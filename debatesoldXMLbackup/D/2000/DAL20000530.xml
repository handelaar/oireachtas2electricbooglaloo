On my own behalf and on behalf of the Members of Dáil Éireann I extend to you, Madame President, and to your delegation, a most sincere welcome to our country.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 17, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I very much welcome Saturday's decision of the Ulster Unionist Council in favour of UUP participation in a restored Northern Ireland Executive, and I offer my warmest congratulations to Mr. David Trimble.</P>
      <P>As I said in my statement on Saturday, I congratulate the leaders of all the pro-Agreement parties, with whom I have been in regular contact, for the courage and commitment they have shown in working with the two Governments, over a long and difficult period, to overcome the problems in the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. There now exists a secure and agreed basis for the full implementation of all aspects of the Agreement.</P>
      <P>There is a job to be done to prove on a sustained basis that the Agreement can work for everyone. It is essential that all aspects of the Agreement be implemented in full, as set out by the two Governments on 5 May. I also look forward to the fulfilment by the IRA of the commitments it made in its statement of 6 May. It remains my hope that the loyalist paramilitaries will also find ways in which to build confidence.</P>
      <P>The Government looks forward to working with Northern Ministers in the North-South Ministerial Council to make progress across the full range of economic and social issues of mutual concern. We also look forward to renewed activity in the British-Irish Council.</P>
      <P>There may well be issues which will, in the future, give rise to stresses and strains. These issues must be worked through and if we are to succeed, we will need at all times to work together in a spirit of mutual respect. I hope also that, over time, we might be able to bring those who now oppose the Agreement to see that it represents a fair and balanced accommodation, which is in the best interest of all the people of this island, North and South.</P>
      <P>I met representatives of the RUC Widows Association, the RUC Disabled Officers Association and the Police Federation on Tuesday, 23 May last, and we had a valuable and informative discussion. The Government recognises the terrible price that has been paid by individual members of the RUC and their wives and families throughout the conflict of the past 30 years, and the suffering of all victims. I made clear at the meeting the Government's full commitment to the Patten report and I referred to the concerns expressed by Nationalist parties on the policing Bill. The objective must be to have a police service which is representative of both communities and is accepted across all of Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further to the commitment given in the Good Friday Agreement to take active steps to demonstrate their respect for the different traditions on the island, the Government has provided support, under the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust, <Col N="5" /> for a number of projects including the Journey of Reconciliation and Trust Peace Park at Messines, the Royal Dublin Fusiliers Association, the Ulster Society, and the Federation for Ulster Local Studies. In addition, the Government announced an eight-fold increase in the funding available to the Reconciliation Fund, administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs, to £2 million per annum.</P>
    <P>Last December I was also glad to announce that the Government has agreed to purchase the site of the Battle of the Boyne. The development of the site will serve to mark in a fitting way the significance of this important historical event for all of the people of Ireland, and in particular for the Unionist tradition. The interdepartmental committee with responsibility for developing the site has initiated a process of extensive consultation for the purpose, including with representatives of the Unionist tradition, with the relevant local authorities and with community groups.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate if there has been any commitment from the various loyalist paramilitaries to allow inspection of weaponry they are holding or to put such weaponry beyond use?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No. There has not been any progress on that matter yet. In the meetings we held in Hillsborough we met the political parties and raised the issues of what we were trying to do. I have since spoken by telephone to the political leaders and I am soon to have a meeting with Gary McMichael and his colleagues, I hope, over the next few days, but as of yet, there is no progress. Both Governments had asked the loyalist paramilitaries and their political associates to consider the full extent of the agreements on 5 May. I know there is a consultation process going on between the various groupings but as yet, other than some of the statements they have made in the public domain, there has not been any other news.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Taoiseach's reply, when is it intended that the next meeting of the British-Irish Council will be convened and does he have any plans in anticipation of what was decided upon last Saturday by the Ulster Unionist Council to proceed with the establishment of a parliamentary tier within the framework of the Council of the Isles? The Taoiseach will no doubt agree that much of this work had been in preparation once the institutions had been established and presumably we are more advanced now than we were when the Taoiseach last answered questions on these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Executive, will meet on Thursday and the Assembly will meet on Monday. A number of the sectoral groups held one meeting and it is hoped they will have a second one in June. The groups which were only in the course of being put together when the Assembly <Col N="6" /> collapsed on 11 February will have their first meeting soon. A plenary session of the North-South bodies was planned for June and it is hoped this will still happen although it may be difficult. As Deputy Quinn knows, the Northern holiday will start on 7 July and the Assembly will probably suspend then for the summer recess. The Government will try to have a full range of meetings during June, if that proves possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What reason has been given to the Taoiseach by the loyalist political leaders for the failure of loyalist paramilitaries to make any move in putting their weaponry beyond use? Will the Taoiseach comment on the involvement of the IRA in punishment beatings and shootings given that on 6 May the IRA stated &ldquo;Our arms are silent&rdquo;. If arms are being used in punishment beatings or shootings, they are not silent. When does the Taoiseach expect the first inspection of arms to take place, in accordance with the proposals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Loyalist political party members have been convening meetings among their organisations and membership, on which they have made some public statements. Those statements suggest they will wait some time to see what happens regarding inspections and other matters before they come to a conclusion, if they do as they have not stated they will. However, we can build confidence over time if there is movement by the IRA and the institutions are up and running. Hopefully we will then see progress from the loyalist parties.</P>
      <P>I have no information on punishment beatings. The percentage of punishment beatings decreased substantially in the first four months of this year, compared with last year, although, as Deputy Bruton knows, the figure is still substantial. It continues to be a worrying trend in some communities. We have continued to raise this matter with Sinn Féin which has raised it with the republican movement. It has given commitments. Last year we exerted pressure for a period and the number of punishment beatings dropped substantially. It concerns me that in some communities there seems to be an acceptance of punishment beatings. Unfortunately, it seems to be a system meted out with a great deal of community support. It will take us some time&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>It is getting more barbaric all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is barbaric. We must continue to seek a resolution which lies in policing. In the view of the RUC, not to mention the views <Col N="7" /> of others, we will not see the elimination of punishment beatings until there is a Northern Ireland police force which is acceptable to all communities. It is a matter of concern when communities take the law into their hands. We will continue to do all we can to get people to desist from this and to try to get Sinn Féin to get its supporters and members to do likewise.</P>
      <P>I do not know when the first inspections will take place but I hope it will be as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, within weeks. If it happens as soon as possible it would help to eliminate tensions and further difficulties for the Ulster Unionist Party. If confidence building measures are undertaken quickly, it will remove the tensions that would otherwise build up and which are unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the Taoiseach's reply on the RUC, I welcome the meeting with the RUC Disabled Officers Association and the RUC Widows Association. Has the Taoiseach or the Government particular knowledge of the substance of Mr. John Taylor's claims that the Secretary of State has given Unionists particular assurances in relation to policing, or is this comment reminiscent of the assurances given by Prime Minister Blair to Mr. Trimble formally on decommissioning? Does the Taoiseach agree we should avoid, if at all possible, fudging on issues which will further undermine future progress and may land us back in a situation of having to try to restore confidence again?</P>
      <P>In relation to our jurisdiction, does the Taoiseach see merit in reconvening, not the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation as a whole but, at least, the sub-committee that needs to finish its work on the removal of obstacles to reconciliation in the South? Given the loss of understanding created by the difficulties over Orange Order ceremonies in Dublin, could that be given more attention so that we can start to, at least, build up some level of trust with the 47% of the Ulster Unionist Council and their colleagues who felt the process was not worthy of support?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will check that last point. As I said, I have an open mind about the forum but it requires everybody to agree on it. However, I will raise it. I have asked for some of the work in our domain to be tidied up so that we will be in a position to complete some of it. Even if some parts of that work are out of date, it is still part of all that has happened over recent years and, therefore, it still makes sense to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>John Taylor has been helpful on numerous occasions in recent months. He was involved in the discussions in Downing Street with the British and Irish Governments. He was also a key part of the talks on 5 and 6 May in Hillsborough. He <Col N="8" /> has continued to keep in close touch with the British Government and the Secretary of State. I have not been talking directly to him but I know he has been expressing his views on aspects of the RUC. I did not hear what he said the other day and I did not see any actual report of his comments at the meeting. However, as I understand his position, he accepts fully that from September 2001 the first recruits will enter the new police service of Northern Ireland. He talks about the interregnum period and what should be in the title. Those are issues between him and the Secretary of State. Our position is clear on these matters.</P>
    <P>I do not want to create unnecessary tension. As I said here a fortnight ago, legislation has been published and is now open for debate. A substantial number of meetings will take place before this weekend between different parties in the North with the security Minister in the North and the Secretary of State and, perhaps, with the Secretary of State in Dublin. Many meetings are taking place on these aspects. The easiest thing on God's earth is to find issues on which people can criticise each other. I know that, at times, people give each other the opportunity to do that in these meetings. However, it makes far more sense to just try to resolve them, talk them through and find resolutions. I honestly believe there is no difficulty in getting resolutions to these issues if everybody can work at it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that policing and symbolic questions such as where and when various flags might be flown are often much more difficult to resolve than issues of substance because they have so much emotional content? Does the Taoiseach agree it might be useful, given that Mr. David Trimble and Mr. Seamus Mallon reflect their communities more directly than anyone else as representatives of the two main traditions, if they could be given a more active role in finding a solution to the various symbolic issues that affect policing and the flying of flags? They could establish protocols regarding these matters which might be acceptable to both communities bearing in mind that the Northern Ireland Executive was extremely successful in choosing a common symbol for itself, namely the flax flower, which was accepted by both communities as representing both of them. Given that the Executive did that itself, there may be good reason to believe that some of these difficult issues could be remitted to the Executive now that it has been reconstituted. They may be able to succeed where those more remote from the issue in London &ndash; or Dublin, for that matter &ndash; might not be so successful as sensitivities are not quite so immediate as they are in the North itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton is certainly right on one matter &ndash; the issues of emblems and the flying of flags are sensitive and generate enormous difficulties. I am very conscious of that but feel we can find resolutions to those issues even <Col N="9" /> if it is difficult. The flag issue was debated in the discussions before the Executive was formed and it was realised that there was no statutory basis for the flying of flags, though some people thought there was. It was hoped to reach a conclusion on that issue, but it will now be back on the table within the Executive &ndash; if not on Thursday, then very soon. To be frank, there is no chance of me being able to resolve or even contribute to the resolution of the issue of flags or of what days flags are to be flown. I am conscious of that and do not think the British Prime Minister will be able to resolve the issue either. An understanding will have to be reached between the parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that any solution of which the politicians in Northern Ireland have ownership &ndash; which they created themselves &ndash; is more likely to travel than even the same solution suggested by London or Dublin?</P>

      <P>Precisely. They will have to reach a consensus on these issues. Deputies will know that the Secretary of State, Mr. Mandelson, has taken the powers to have some of these matters decided on a statutory basis, but I imagine he will have to decide them in tandem with the parties. He will have to decide them in conjunction with the pro-Agreement parties and, in the first place, the parties in the Executive.</P>

      <P>In a reply to a parliamentary question on 14 December the Taoiseach indicated that the Government had agreed in principle to purchase the site of the Battle of the Boyne. Has that purchase decision been completed? Can the Taoiseach give details of whether the preliminary works, which were costed at approximately £150,000, have proceeded? What is the current position regarding that particularly symbolic project which could help towards reconciliation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The negotiations have been done through the Office of Public Works. I do not have the details, but I believe they are completed. I know there have been some site visits &ndash; members of the Orange Order and other groups in the North have visited the site, while memorabilia in the North that might be located at the site has also been examined. The intention is to have a centre at the site rather than a museum. The Office of Public Works is working on this in conjunction with the interdepartmental group to ensure that all communities are involved, particularly members of the Orange Order. Those meetings are doing well although I am not sure if the contracts have been signed yet.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that speedy action is <Col N="10" /> required on the fundamental issues of policing and putting arms beyond use and that a long delay may not occur in those matters? Ordinary people in Northern Ireland must see progress quickly in those areas. Will the Taoiseach further agree that other confidence building measures might be examined? In his meetings with the republican movement he might emphasise these again. Deputy Bruton referred to punishment beatings. These are intolerable and contradict the commitments given.</P>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that the issue of &ldquo;the disappeared&rdquo; remains? That practice, too, was barbaric. It is the responsibility of the republican movement. Information exists which has not been made available to the authorities. It ought to be made available. Will the Taoiseach also agree that a long list of people have been exiled from Northern Ireland for one reason or another? They are outside this country but, given that people who are responsible for the most awful atrocities are now free to walk the streets of Northern Ireland, there is no reason these exiles should not be allowed to return to their homes.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Currie asked a number of questions. I have said my piece on punishment beatings. We must continue in our efforts to encourage people away from that way of life while at the same time try to build up confidence in the police service. It is only when there is a police service which represents every corner of Northern Ireland that this problem will be overcome. We must continue pressing in that direction.</P>
      <P>With regard to confidence building measures, particularly the inspection of arms, the quicker that happens the better. I do not see any reason it should not happen. However, I have no wish to call for it every day because that usually has a negative effect. Nevertheless, a deal is a deal and I expect it to be honoured and to see that happen sooner rather than later.</P>
      <P>With regard to policing, specific concerns about structures for police accountability, the cover of and participation on policing boards, the police ombudsman, the district policing partnership and a range of other areas with regard to policing partnership, the human rights ethos of the new service and the oversight commissioner are enormously important. They are the main issues of the approximately 40 issues to do with policing legislation and the implementation bodies around policing. It will take some time to resolve them. The good news on that front is that today and for several more days meetings are scheduled to take place between the key players. I hope they can come to an understanding. The policing Bill is due to get its next reading this day week in the House of Commons, so much of the work must be finished by then. There is, in effect, a deadline on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="11" /> To the best of my knowledge there is no further news regarding &ldquo;the disappeared&rdquo;. The leads that were available were explored. If any more become available they will be acted on. Unfortunately, the problem has not been solved for many people but the Garda Síochána and the Government are ready to assist. The passage of time has helped in some cases but not in many.</P>
    <P>With regard to the exiles, there will be confidence building measures as time goes on. Many of these issues will just require time to resolve. We will simply have to convince people over time that they can return. Related issues such as acts of intimidation, threats and the displacement of people have been ongoing for many years but we must continue to pursue them.</P>

        <b>: </b>Now that the institutions are restored, will the Taoiseach agree that those institutions should be subjected to rigorous scrutiny given that the structures that have been set up are an institutionalisation of sectarian division and differences, regardless of whether the Taoiseach likes it? Will he agree there could be a grave danger that political parties, which are based on one side or other of the sectarian divide, may in certain circumstances play a sectarian card to boost their position and try to outflank others, or that Ministries could even be used in certain circumstances in this regard? Will he agree that the structures could, therefore, be agents of division rather than reconciliation? Do both Governments have proposals to go beyond the institutions, bearing in mind what I have said, and will the Taoiseach agree there is a real need for the people on the ground, the working class communities in particular, to come together to address the very serious problems that have been overlooked over the past 30 years, such as homelessness, bad living conditions, unemployment, poverty and so on?</P>
      <P>Now that paramilitary violence is, I hope, a nightmare from the past and will not be reimposed &ndash; this is the wish of the vast majority of the Irish people &ndash; what proposals are there for the dismantling of all vestiges of the British military machine in Northern Ireland? Is there a real commitment on the part of the British Government to create a genuine community-based police force which is unarmed and without political agendas in the sense of any kind of sectarian allegiance and which is genuinely accountable to the community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Executive brings together in a unique way Nationalists, Unionists and republicans on the representative basis in which they received votes in the Assembly election in the summer of 1998. Democratic parties always play to their own agendas but the Executive has an obligation to work for all the people of Northern Ireland. During the short time the Executive was in place there was a genuine indication that <Col N="12" /> parties worked well together on issues such as education, health and finance. Even though members of the DUP were not in attendance, they worked constructively to assist the people of Northern Ireland. The possibility exists for parties to work and communicate together and not work on a sectarian basis. However, sectarianism exists in Northern Ireland and this will not change overnight. Issues such as names and emblems signify this fact and we must continue to assist parties in this period of democratic involvement and accountability to deal with issues in a different way than was the case in the past. Following my various meetings with the parties, I believe they are determined to try to be inclusive and work together for the benefit of everyone. However, problems occur regularly in the North which forces divisiveness such as we have seen in the past. I believe the parties mean well and wish to overcome these problems.</P>
      <P>On demilitarisation, in the agreement of 5 May the British Government agreed to remove the military infrastructure in certain locations. This will take place over the coming months on a scaled basis in a number of areas in Derry, south Armagh, east Tyrone and Fermanagh. I understand the engineering unit, which is not based in Northern Ireland, will work in these areas but it will be a number of weeks before this will happen. As the threat of violence diminishes there will be further demilitarisation. The Deputy said that he hopes we have seen the end of paramilitary activity. So do I, but Members are aware there are groups which see a threat to their existence and activities as a result of the success of the Good Friday Agreement. These will not go out of business too easily and I wish well the Garda Síochána, the RUC and everybody else engaged in thwarting their efforts. We have seen their activities and they have capabilities. We must be vigilant and conscious that some of groups are still in business or endeavouring to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked if the British Government is sincere about a new policing arrangement. It signed up to the Patten report, and there have been some strains and stresses since then. We have continuously indicated that the Patten report was a compromise and not written by Nationalists in the North. For years Seamus Mallon has very strongly and repeatedly indicated that the recommendations in the Patten report must be implemented faithfully, something with which we agree, to ensure the new police service is capable of attracting the support of both communities, including young Nationalists and republicans. I know it is hard for many people to understand the sensitivities involved, but we must try to understand the sensitivities on both sides. If the Patten report is not recommended by SDLP and Sinn Féin there is no chance of young Nationalists joining the police force, which would be a disaster for the work of Patten. In understanding some of the sensitivities of Unionists and issues they raise, we must try to find compromises which ensure the Patten report is fully implemented and is <Col N="13" /> recommended and sold in Nationalist and republican communities in Northern Ireland so we can have a proper police service. Because of demographics and the fact that there are not many Catholics at senior level in the force &ndash; the Patten report makes recommendations in this regard &ndash; it will be difficult. It will take some years and we cannot begin from the basis that Catholics will not join as that would lead to massive failure. It is fundamentally important we resolve the issues concerning the Patten report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that many of the problems of the Nationalist community regarding policing do not arise from the acceptance by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland of Unionist views as such, but rather from the bureaucratic interests of the RUC in terms of control, the relative role of the Chief Constable as against the police authority, the initiation of investigations, and other such matters which are essentially not political issues which divide Nationalists and Unionists but rather issues concerning the relative role of the force <i>vis-à-vis</i> the public, and that, therefore, the issues should not be all that difficult to resolve? Does the Taoiseach agree that if one could separate the structural policing issues from the symbolic issues one might find that the former might be comparatively easily resolved between the parties?</P>
      <P>On the last occasion the Taoiseach answered questions he referred to the inquiry by the Garda Commissioner into allegations that two members of the Garda Síochána had colluded with the IRA in the murder of 12 people. Has the commissioner concluded his inquiry into this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the commissioner has not concluded his inquiry.</P>
      <P>Regarding the first question, as I have said a number of times during Question Time, dialogue will lead to solving problems in all the areas where legislation and implementation is different from what was outlined in the Patten report. Some of the issues concern the Secretary of State, some the RUC and some the NIO while other issues need to be debated in terms of working out definitions and understanding. It is also necessary to examine the police board, clarify its general functions and look at retrospective inquiries. Together with the role and terms of reference of the oversight commissioner these are all administrative issues which I hope will be resolved in the substantial range of meetings initiated this morning and which will continue for the next few days. It is the only way to resolve them. They are all extremely important. They are important to some person; they would not be on the agenda otherwise. Whether they are of concern to Unionists, the SDLP or Sinn Féin, they have to be reconciled. If this can be done calmly and quietly through dialogue and meetings rather than blow by blow across the airwaves it can be done faster.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask a separate but related <Col N="14" /> question. On 14 December we also spoke about another confidence building measure, for the Unionist community in particular, the establishment of the parliamentary tier emanating from the Council of the Isles in replacement of the existing British-Irish parliamentary tier. In view of the necessity to embrace the 47% who have expressed reservations, if not opposition, and the Democratic Unionist Party in the Northern Ireland Assembly, not to mention Mr. McCartney and others, the parliamentary tier with its Welsh and Scottish component parts, to which the Taoiseach is very committed, would be an arena in which confidence could be constructed and developed. Does the Government have a view on the best way forward? Are the members of the British-Irish parliamentary body prepared to broaden its terms of reference and have it subsumed into a wider parliamentary tier?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that is what will happen. I have had discussions with the British-Irish parliamentary group. One could go one of two ways. One could retain the British-Irish parliamentary group and establish a second group but I am not in favour of this. It would be far better to bring together Members of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies, Westminster and the Oireachtas. I would like us to work on this during the summer and have it up and running in the autumn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess to being disappointed at the Taoiseach's reply to the questions I asked him about those who have been exiled from Northern Ireland. I am sorry to say I sensed a lack of urgency, which I had not expected. Does the Taoiseach agree that many of the people concerned are in a worse position than those convicted of so-called political offences and ODCs &ndash; ordinary decent criminals &ndash; in the sense that ordinary decent criminals have been sentenced to prison for a particular length of time? The people concerned have not been convicted of any crime and are outside Northern Ireland without any indication as to when they might be able to return. There is a degree of urgency attached to dealing with this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of flags in Northern Ireland, does the Taoiseach agree that part of the problem is that there are too many flags and emblems on display and that some of those calling for respect to be shown to the two national flags are members of organisations which appear to show little respect in the sense that the thousands of flags erected each July have turned into a rag by the following July and the thousands of flags erected each Easter have turned into a rag by the following Easter? Does the Taoiseach agree that in many instances flags are flown to provoke and stake out territory and that everything possible <Col N="15" /> should be done to keep the matter under control? Having said that, I recognise the tremendous symbolic nature and importance of the flying of flags but there is a very negative aspect to this practice which also requires attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy and it will take time to stop elements of certain communities killing, maiming, threatening and intimidating each other and all the related things which went on. One moves down the scale of trying to convince people to have respect for the community in the next area and that is what much of this is about. There are too many flags but that is done for a reason. It is done to mark out territory but that has built up over, not 30 years, but 70 or 80 years.</P>
      <P>As regards people being put out of the North, I do not want to suggest there is no urgency about this issue but many of the groups I met indicated that those driven out by paramilitary groups were threatened for misconduct in their own communities, because people did not like them or because they crossed&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. A substantial number of people were on the run from the RUC and the British army down the years. There was also rivalry between paramilitary groups who fell out with their paramilitary colleagues or people were fighting for one paramilitary group against another paramilitary group. This is an enormously complex area. I have had the pleasure, even though it was difficult, to meet all these groups over the past number of years and listened to a range of views. If we reach a stage where people stop the violence we can then deal with that issue. However, that is not exactly the case as was seen last week when an alleged member of a paramilitary group was shot by an alleged member of another paramilitary group. We are not at that stage yet so we are still on difficult ground as far as those outside the North are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>Last December's social welfare budget package was the biggest ever social welfare budget allocation amounting to more than £428 million on a full year basis. It provided for a £7 a week increase for pensioners over 66, a special increase of £5.90 a week for invalidity pensioners aged under 65 years and a £4 increase for other recipients under 66.</P>
      <P>The £7 increase for pensioners represents an increase ranging between 7.9% and 8.9%, while the £4 general increase represents an increase ranging between 5.2% and 5.6%. The annual average increase in the consumer price index is the benchmark against which increases in social welfare payments have been normally compared. While the latest published monthly CSO report on the CPI highlights that, in the 12 months to April 2000, inflation increased by 4.9%, it is predicted that this figure will moderate during the second half of the year. It is now expected that inflation will average about 4% for the year as a whole and this is well below the rates of payment increases.</P>
      <P>In addition to the increases in the rates of personal payments, special increases in the rate of qualified adult allowances have been provided this year as part of our overall strategy to increase this allowance to 70% of the main rate by 2002. These increases, which range between 7.7% and 17.2%, represent real increases of between 3.6% and 12.7%. Furthermore, as part of our commitment to align the tax and social welfare changes by 2001, all these increases were paid four weeks earlier this year, from the beginning of May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant increases in monthly child benefit payments are also being provided for families with children &ndash; £8 for each of the first two qualified children and £10 for each other qualified child. These increases, which range between <Col N="17" /> 21.7% and 23.2%, represent real increases of 17% and 18.5%.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to achieving a minimum rate of £100 per week for all social welfare old age pensioners by 2002; to bringing this target forward in the case of contributory old age pensioners; and to ensuring that, over its term of office, all old age pensions will increase in line with average industrial earnings. Following the improvements we made over the past three budgets, we are well on target to implementing our priority commitments for old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>Social welfare rates have improved significantly in real terms since the Government took office just over three years ago. Over our three budgets to date we have increased the old age contributory pension by £18 per week, a 14% real increase, compared to £7 per week, a 4% real increase, in the same payment over the three budgets introduced by the rainbow coalition.</P>
    <P>As part of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the Government has entered into a number of social inclusion commitments with the social partners. This programme provides that in the period up to 2003, all rates of social welfare will be increased in real terms and substantial progress will be made towards a target of £100 per week for the lower rates of payment. For families, substantial progress will be made towards a target child benefit rate of £100 per month for the third and subsequent child.</P>
    <P>The significant social welfare improvements we have made amount to almost £1 billion since we came to office. Those, together with the further improvements to which we are committed over the coming years, demonstrate our guarantee that everyone will share in the benefits of social and economic developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the enormous increase in inflation, which is more than one third higher than that predicted by the Government earlier this year and is continuing to increase, will largely wipe out the increases in social welfare provided for part of this year by the Government? Does he accept that inflation is the enemy of the poor? Does he also accept that while a couple in receipt of £125,000 per annum will not be unduly affected by an increase in inflation, the current rate of inflation will seriously affect the standard of living of an elderly person, a disabled person and a couple in receipt of £125 per week, and in many instances will lead to hardship? Taking that into account, will the Government announce a compensatory package for those who will be so affected?</P>

      <P>When the rate of inflation was estimated to be 2% last year and it turned out be 1.6%, I did not hear calls in the House for social welfare increases to be clawed back and, thankfully, they were not. Over the lifetime of this Government social welfare increases have increased in real terms as opposed to when the Deputies opposite were in office, particularly in 1995 when they decided to maintain payment increases at 2.5% when inflation turned out to be 2.5%.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister likes to hark back to 1994, 1995 and 1996, but this is 2000 and a different economic era. The Minister's colleague, the Taoiseach, was in Poland last week. Its rate of inflation is 10% and countries such as Mexico and Hungary have a similar rate of inflation. Does the Minister accept we are heading towards that rate of inflation and that he has lost the battle in this respect? Is it not the case that the Minister's soubriquet will be that he is the most skinflint Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs in modern Irish history? He need not smile.</P>
      <P>The increases he gave this year have been wiped out by the increase in inflation and it appears social welfare recipients will be in a negative position financially. What is the value of the £4 per week increase for recipients of unemployment assistance and the £4 per week increase for carers in light of the massively escalating price of groceries and petrol? Will the Minister admit he has failed social welfare recipients? Will he also admit that the rate of inflation does matter? Some economists claim it does not matter anymore as the rate of economic growth here can be compared to the rate of economic growth in California some years ago. I am sure my Fine Gael colleagues will agree that the rate of inflation matters to the poorest 1.5 million in our society for whom the Minister is responsible. He has not given them any real increase this year and it appears they will fare less well during the term of office of this skinflint Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>

      <P>I question the Deputy's right to castigate me as being skinflint. He often refers to the serious deprivation in his territory and would paint a picture of it being as deprived as when his party was in Government, yet he did not refer recently to the fact that, according to Northside Partnership, unemployment there has fallen by <Col N="19" /> 51% during the three years this Government has been in office. I must repeat what I said, for the first time in a long time my office has been inundated with phone calls, particularly from old age pensioners complimenting the Government on the substantial increases given. I am sure those sentiments will be acknowledged by public representatives throughout the country. In response to the Deputy's claim that I am a skinflint, I wish to quote the rate of increases in pension payments. During the three years I have been in office the rate of pension payment increased by £18 compared to an increase of £7 during the three years the Deputy's party was in Government. On that basis, I rest my case.</P>

      <P>It is often the case that Deputies in Opposition talk up inflation. I accused Deputy De Rossa of doing that when he was in Opposition. Deputies in Opposition should be careful about the way in which they address the issue of inflation. It can be considered only over an extended period of at least 12 months, if not more, given that last year social welfare recipients were given an increase over and above that originally targeted, as inflation which was estimated to be 2% turned out to be 1.6%.</P>
      <P>In the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, which will run over the next three budgets, we have given an undertaken, in conjunction with the social partners, to move towards a minimum payment of £100 per week for social welfare recipients. That will entail significant increases in social welfare payments over the next three budgets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Returning to the issue of whether I am a skinflint, I point out that old age pensioners in the UK got a weekly increase in benefit of 75p compared to a £7 per week increase for their counterparts in the Republic. We are the envy of our <Col N="20" /> colleagues not only in the UK but five miles from where I live across the Border. During our period in office there has been a real increase in social welfare of 14% while in the period of office of the Opposition it was 4%.</P>

      <P>I am pleased the Minister at least does not agree with the views of those economists who say inflation does not matter. Mr. McLoughlin was quoted in the press as saying it did not matter. It certainly does matter to people on social welfare. In the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness there is a review mechanism for general wages. Clearly, when wages fall behind the Irish Congress of Trades Union has some means of coming back to renegotiate. Social welfare recipients have no such mechanism. They have to wait for the December budget and, in effect, until mid-April before getting an increase as inflation spirals ahead. Is this not a fundamental problem that there is not a review mechanism for social welfare? Is that not the Minister's responsibility?</P>

      <P>The possibility of introducing a special island allowance for social welfare claimants whose permanent place of residence is on an offshore island has been raised with me on a <Col N="21" /> number of occasions and in particular by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív.</P>
      <P>The implications of introducing such a measure would need to be examined carefully, and this will be explored by my Department in the coming months. There are a number of potential difficulties with such a scheme, including: the appropriateness of having different rates of welfare payments depending on the claimant's place of permanent residence; having regard to requirement to treat all welfare claimants in an equitable manner, while it can be argued that islanders live in particularly isolated circumstances, with associated costs in terms of travel, access to goods at cheaper prices and so on, the same is true of other parts of rural Ireland; the potential employment disincentive impact of such an allowance; and the costs involved.</P>
      <P>In addition, any examination would need to take account of issues such as whether such an allowance would be payable to all welfare claimants or confined to claimants of social welfare pensions, and the manner in which increases in respect of qualified adults and dependent children would be treated.</P>

It is one to which I am not averse but there are difficulties which I have already explained. There are a number of pros and cons. Ultimately it may be an issue which would be properly addressed by the Minister from that Department rather than from my Department. There are issues of equity, whether such a payment would have disincentives to employment and there are fairly difficult administrative issues involved in bringing it forward.

      <P>The Deputy's report to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs is based on the report &ldquo;Towards a Senior Euro Pass&rdquo; which was commissioned by the Social Affairs Directorate of the European Commission and was undertaken and published by Age Concern, England at the end of 1997. It recommends that EU states should establish a senior Euro pass card which would entitle older people to concessions on various services, including travel, cultural and social activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of my Department in matters relating to the senior Euro pass is to submit observations <Col N="23" /> in conjunction with other Departments, statutory and non-statutory bodies on any action taken to implement the proposals in this report, in so far as they affect the business of this Department. The administration of the Euro pass itself is outside the remit of my Department.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has suggested, in advance of any EU measures, that the cross-Border free travel scheme should be extended to allow free travel for all pensioners throughout the island of Ireland. The current scheme applies only to cross-Border journeys and not travel exclusively within each jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should note that my Department is responsible for the entire funding of this scheme which amounted to almost £2 million in 1998. In this regard, I note that the Euro card equalisation fund mentioned by the Deputy in his report could not be used to assist with the cost of operating this extension to the free travel scheme, as under EU law, any concession arising under this fund would have to be applied across the EU.</P>
    <P>A review of the free schemes, including the free travel scheme, was recently published by the Policy Institute, Trinity College Dublin. The review examined the issue of extending the free travel scheme to non-resident pensioners and concluded that such an extension of the scheme would not be in keeping with the objective of the free travel scheme. The report examines a great number of issues and requires detailed consideration. I will carefully examine all the recommendations made in this report in the context of future budgets and available resources.</P>

Will he give an indication of even nominal acceptance of this recommendation or is it like the island proposal &ndash; one to be talked about and nothing to be done about it? Will the Minister agree this proposal is worthwhile and stands on its own merits irrespective of the other proposals included in the Euro card report? In the context of what is happening this very day on this island he should be the first up to one of the Implementation Bodies with a proposal to establish free travel for the elderly throughout the island of Ireland. If there is a will to do it, it can be done.</P>

This is part of a report compiled in relation to a Euro card. I will not go into that wide area at this stage. It does not go back to the 1977 report, the only one of which the Minister seems to be aware. It goes back to a recommendation of the European Commission in 1989. I suggest the Minister extend his reading a little further. There is a proposal with the Federation of Irish Societies about travel from the UK to Ireland. Does the Minister accept that if we could get the all-Ireland proposal in place, it might then be used in discussions with the Assembly in Wales, the Assembly in Scotland and, ultimately, with the UK Parliament to have some form of travel concession throughout the two islands? Does he agree this is of particular importance to Irish people who live in the UK?</P>

      <P>A family with three dependent children, where gross earnings are £240 per week, and claiming additional tax reliefs as outlined by the Deputy, will have an entitlement of a weekly payment of £24 under the family income supplement scheme. The net weekly household income in such a case will amount to some £257.70.</P>
      <P>A wage rise of £10 per week in gross earnings would result in an increase of £3.55 in net weekly household income; a £20 wage increase would result in an increase of £8.10 in net income; a £30 wage increase would result in an increase of £14.65 in net income; and a £40 wage increase would result in an increase of £23.84 in net income. The detailed figures are set out in a table which I will circulate in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out that there is a time lag in re-assessment for FIS. If a person in receipt of FIS gets a wage increase, the FIS payment is not reduced until the next renewal date. In the short-<Col N="25" /> term, therefore, the increase in net income would be higher than the figures I have given.</P>
    <P>I understand the Deputy is concerned about the potential for a fall in income when entitlement to FIS is fully exhausted and the level of tax payable increases. I recognise the point being made by the Deputy in this regard. Any system which relies on income thresholds may give rise to poverty traps at the point where income marginally exceeds that threshold. In the context of the desirability of ensuring that there is always a positive return from increases in wages, I will continue to explore the potential for further easing any remaining employment traps. In general, however, I believe that the FIS scheme is very effective in ensuring workers with families and on the low incomes have a real incentive to take up and remain in low-paid employment and to improve wages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that report. The Minister will recall that we had a similar discussion in this House three years ago when we spoke about the poverty traps that exist in relation to FIS and the marginal tax rate. At that stage the Minister said almost exactly what he said today. He said there was a poverty trap which needed to be examined. What progress has been made? According to the figures the Minister has given, a person getting an increase of £10 loses 66% of that increase and a person gaining £20 loses 60%. Is that not ridiculous, and does the Minister not consider he should address this as a matter or urgency? It relates to families on £240 a week with three dependent children. That is low income. Something needs to be done to eradicate that poverty trap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I made substantial changes in the recent Social Welfare Act, where I abolished <Col N="26" /> PRSI on wages under £280 a week. I also made major changes to health levies. These changes gave back £105 million to people on low incomes across the spectrum. People earning up to £280 are gaining at least £5 or £6 extra because of changes to those levies, apart from taxation benefits. Given the increases in FIS, their incomes will be much better this year than in previous years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is missing the point which is that for a person in receipt of FIS or on a marginal rate of tax, the benefit will be wiped out by losses resulting from the reduction in FIS and because of the tax rate. Does he not see there is a poverty trap in that sector, and that this needs to be sorted out, irrespective of any other measures that are taken? These are people the Minister could target specifically. They are on low income. They are struggling to survive. There is a disincentive for them to work, perhaps even an incentive to drive them into the black economy. Does the Minister not believe he has a responsibility to eliminate that poverty trap?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Reform of FIS is being considered in the context of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness where there is a commitment to examine the whole issue of tax credits. That may be the way to resolve the problems to which the Deputy refers. There will always be difficulties when a line is drawn and people fall the wrong side of it. That is always the case in social welfare. However, an objective look at the changes to taxation in recent months and to, the levies and overall pay which was agreed in the PPF will reveal that people, particularly those on low incomes, will get a minimum increase of about £20 per week. People earning approximately £170 a week will get a minimum increase of £20 this year alone as a result of the policies adopted by this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has it all wrong. He is talking about the better off, the better paid people who will gain £20 or £30 a week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>People on low pay, people in the bracket to which I refer, families on £220 to £230 a week, will gain a very small amount, perhaps 4% or 5% additional take-home pay. That is as much as it amounts to. The low paid did very badly out of this budget. Many of the commentaries on the budget state that very clearly. The better off did extremely well. It seems the Minister supports that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Deputy. Taking the tax changes that were made in the budget, the levy changes and the commitments made in relation to wage increases in the PPF, which will be implemented this year, people on £170 &ndash; which is lower than the figures to which the Deputy refers &ndash; will be better off by a minimum <Col N="27" /> of £20. People on higher amounts will gain more. That is the reality.</P>

      <P>Pilot projects to enhance information services for families are under way in three local offices of my Department in Waterford, Cork and Finglas in Dublin. The projects build on the one-stop-shop concept with the aim of providing improved access to information for families through local social welfare offices. The overall objective of the family services project is to provide a high quality information service about the range of supports available to families from State agencies and from the community and voluntary sector, with a particular emphasis on the services available locally.</P>
      <P>The expanded range of family services on which information is available includes marriage counselling and marriage preparation programmes, bereavement counselling and support services, information about parenting issues, including local child care services where this information is available, and the State family mediation service. The latest information technology will be used to support the family services project. Within the pilot project an enhanced programme of support is available to a small group of customers with complex needs, for example, very young lone mothers, other parents rearing children without the support of a partner and dependent spouses in households with children depending on social welfare payments. It is hoped the additional support involving individual attention, customised information and enhanced access to services and supports which would assist the family, will enhance the capacity of those in the most difficult family circumstances to improve their personal situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The family services project is the subject of ongoing evaluation during the pilot phase which will continue throughout this year. The evaluation will identify the resource and management issues to be addressed in the provision of this family focused service, as well as assessing its effectiveness in meeting the needs of families and its potential to improve local co-ordination of community support for families. The outcome of the evaluation will inform proposals for the progressive expansion of the successful elements of the pilot programme in line with the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and for which the <Col N="28" /> Government has provided £12 million over the period 2000-2006 in the National Development Plan.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The project draws on the Government's &ldquo;pro-families&rdquo; approach to the development of policies and services for families, the recommendations of the Commission on the Family, and the strategy statement of my Department, which commits the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to promote policies which protect and support families, including the development of service delivery to address the different needs of customers and the creation of stronger links with partner agencies and voluntary organisations at local level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that information, but would he agree that, so far, the pilot schemes have been spread over three relatively small areas? I understand that £12 million is available for this programme over six years, but that is far too little. Would the Minister agree that the range of services needs to be increased and concentrated upon? Does the Minister see any role, for example, for the family services project in the current small holocaust of deaths throughout northside and southside communities from drug-related addiction and crime? In some districts social workers think there should be counselling for all young people because such significant numbers have died in recent months.</P>
      <P>As regards information technology, would the Minister agree it is critical that in future we should gather much more comprehensive information? If the Minister is going to frame his 25 most disadvantaged areas by December this year, surely he needs widespread statistical information on the kind of issues I have raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is mixing up a number of issues. The 25 areas will be designated under a separate process which is set out in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The family services project is completely different, although it is also referred to in the programme. The Department estimates that the £12 million which has been allocated is sufficient to be spread out progressively over that period. It is a very focused campaign. The initial reaction and evaluation is that it is being supported positively by those who have entered the process. It will not solve all the problems the Deputy referred to and other agencies have primary responsibility for those issues. However, it is one of the matters that will be taken into account. The key to the family services project is that it will co-ordinate the community response at local level and provide an agency response to the issues. It will try to educate those people, particularly younger lone parents and families in difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the programme evaluation process, an interdepartmental working group, established by my Department, is currently reviewing the school meals scheme. The scheme provides financial assistance to local authorities, except county councils, for the provision of school meals for national school children who are &ldquo;unable by reason of lack of food to take full advantage of the education provided for them&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The working group is composed of representatives from my Department, the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science, the Environment and Local Government, and Finance, as well as Dublin Corporation and the <Col N="30" /> County and City Managers' Association. This is indicative of the broad range of stakeholders in this area.</P>
    <P>In the course of the review, the working group has been engaged in a comprehensive consultation process. The views of many organisations have been canvassed and a survey has been issued to all local authorities to ascertain their views on the scheme. To obtain the views of school principals and teachers, and to become familiar with any local initiatives in the area of school meals, a survey has also been issued to a representative sample of schools, including all disadvantaged primary schools.</P>
    <P>In addition, the working group has consulted and continues to consult those involved in initiatives, such as that mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>At its last meeting the group was given a presentation on a pilot school meals project run by the PAUL Partnership in Limerick. The working group's previous meeting included a visit to a school meals programme supported by the Drogheda Partnership. The group's next meeting, which is scheduled for tomorrow, 31 May, includes a visit to the Dublin 17 Breakfast Club.</P>
    <P>The consultation process and the group's direct engagement with those involved in developing and managing these worthwhile initiatives, will assist the group greatly in its deliberations on the future policy direction of the scheme. The group hopes to complete its work before the end of the year and I look forward to receiving its report and to considering the issues at that stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's positive reaction to the three schemes he mentioned in Limerick, Drogheda and north Coolock. Children are anxious to get out to school at 8.40 a.m., as I saw in north Coolock this morning. A key element of their success is what they learn about nutrition, including the value of fruit, milk and other food and the need to eat a good basic breakfast in the mornings. Given that the former school meals service collapsed, what would be the cost of extending the pilot school meals project nationwide? In most other countries, including the United Kingdom, a hot meal is provided in schools where pupils have a full day's attendance.</P>

      <P>In 1999, 31 local authorities participated in this scheme. The average annual departmental expenditure is approximately £750,000. The Department funds 50% of the total expenditure of the scheme and the remaining 50% is funded by local authorities. I cannot give the Deputy the figures concerning the schemes that are being undertaken at present, but that will give a flavour of what has been taking place. The scheme started in 1914 and it has been changed over the years. While I strongly support my Department's initiative, the scheme is badly in need of review and that is why I have instituted such a review. Consultants provided the group with a report which made a number of recommendations, such as piloting alternatives to the <Col N="31" /> current scheme, including a breakfast club. As I said in my reply, these types of initiative are already up and running and will provide the group with a pointer as to how to proceed.</P>

      <P>Last December's social welfare budget package was the biggest in the history of the State. Over £428 million on a full year basis provided, <i>inter alia</i>, for a £4 per week increase in social welfare payments in general, including disability allowance. In addition, special increases in the qualified adult allowance rates were provided as an overall strategy to increase the allowance to 70% of the main rate over the next three budgets. This means that the couple rate of disability allowance has been increased by £7.80 per week, an increase of 6.7%.</P>
      <P>As part of the process of aligning tax and social welfare changes by 2001, these increases were paid four weeks earlier this year, from the beginning of May. This means that 51,200 recipients of disability allowance received their increased rates of payment four weeks earlier than in previous years.</P>
      <P>In addition to the increases in the weekly rates, last December's budget also provided for a number of other improvements for people with disabilities, including the payment of full rate disability allowance to those in full-time residential care who are currently receiving a half rate payment, which has resulted in an increase of £40.70 per week in such cases; and a 50% increase, from £50 to £75 per week, in the amount of income from rehabilitative employment which is disregarded for disability allowance purposes. This enhanced disregard has also been extended to those in rehabilitative self-employment.</P>
      <P>The submission made by the National Representative Council, which proposes increasing disability allowance to £100 per week, raises two separate issues, first, the adequacy of social welfare payment rates, and, second, the question of the additional costs associated with disability. With regard to the adequacy of social welfare rates, including the rate of disability allowance, it should be noted that the recently ratified Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides that over the next three years all rates of social welfare will be increased in real terms and substantial progress will be made towards a target of £100 per week for the lower rates of payment.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional information</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>The NRC also proposed that the rate of disability allowance be increased to £100 per week so as to compensate for the additional costs associated with disability. However, the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities recommended that such additional costs should be met through the introduction of a separate cost of disability payment to be administered by the Department of Health and Children, which would be paid regardless of the person's employment status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As provided for under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a working group is being established to examine the feasibility of introducing a cost of disability payment. This working group, which is being chaired by the Department of Health and Children and comprises representatives of the Department of Finance and the <Col N="33" /> Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, will consult with the social partners. The outcome of the work of this group will be important in informing future policy in this area and I look forward to receiving the results in due course.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister ashamed that over the past three years, all that has been given to disabled people is £10 compared to an increase of £18 to people receiving old age pension? These are the facts. At a time when inflation is 5%, does the Minister believe that a £4 increase is justified and sufficient in this Celtic tiger economy? The Minister mentioned some benefits but there are many people with serious disability who want to live in rural Ireland but cannot because they cannot get support for a car unless they have lost a leg or suffered some other injury? They may be seriously disabled and those people should be looked after in a proper manner.</P>

      <P>The real answer for people with disability is in relation to the proposal about the cost of disability payment. There is a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to set up a working group to examine that issue. A cost of disability payment will be paid by the Department of Health and Children rather than this Department.</P>
      <P>In relation to the payments that were given, I suggest that the Deputy look no further than five years ago when he was on this side of the House and the Government of which his party was a member gave a 2.5% increase at a time when inflation was 2.5%. In effect, it gave no real increase to those people about whom he is now crying.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 50, 54 and 62 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="35" /> As Deputies will be aware, A review of the free schemes was recently published by the Policy Institute, Trinity College, Dublin. The review examined the underlying rationale of the free schemes and their performance using efficiency criteria and customer views, and assessed their overall contribution to combating poverty and social exclusion. It noted that the schemes share a number of common objectives as follows: to provide assistance to those living alone by targeting them with specific benefits providing both income and social inclusion gains; to support older people and people with disabilities in their wish to remain in the community as opposed to institutional care; and to support Government policy which seeks to acknowledge the value of older people in our society.</P>
    <P>I requested that the issue of extending the free travel scheme to non-residents be examined in the review. This request was made following a number of representations from groups representing Irish people resident in the UK. When they were informed by my Department that this could be contrary to EU law, which prohibits discrimination on grounds of nationality, they then requested that the scheme be made available to all EU senior citizens.</P>
    <P>The review considered that the main objective of the free travel scheme is to encourage older people and people with disabilities to remain independent and active within the community, thereby reducing the need for institutional care. Accordingly, it concluded that extending the scheme to visitors would not be in keeping with the objective of the free travel scheme. It should also be noted that such an extension would have significant administrative and cost implications, in the order of £8 million to £15 million, depending on the level of concession granted. The free travel scheme is based on spare capacity and CIE has already expressed its concern about capacity constraints on the public transport system. It is unlikely, therefore, that it would grant any further extension of the scheme on the current concession basis.</P>
    <P>The review also considered the difficulties involved in access to public transport services. In this regard it noted that there are two main groups affected, those who have a disability which prevents them using the service and those for whom a service does not exist, which mainly affects those living in remote rural areas. This problem, which is unrelated to the free travel scheme, is part of a wider social and infrastructure problem, affecting all those who are disadvantaged and who can neither afford their own transport or avail of access to public transport.</P>
    <P>The review examined a number of alternatives to the existing system including the use of vouchers. It considered that a voucher type system, which would be open to a wide range of transport providers including taxis and hackneys, would be complicated and less feasible than the current system. Voucher schemes, by their nature, introduce <Col N="36" /> stigma to a scheme. In addition, they are administratively not feasible, particularly if issued annually, as the number of vouchers and potential operators would be enormous. For example, if people were issued with only four vouchers per month, allowing two return journeys, this amounts to 25 million vouchers to be processed annually, based on the current number of free travel passes issued. The experience of my Department operating a voucher based scheme, such as the free bottled gas scheme, which is claimed by only 414 recipients suggests that the difficulties inherent in this type of scheme make it most unsuitable for a central Government Department to operate.</P>
    <P>The use of vouchers is not in keeping with a fundamental aspect of the scheme as originally envisaged; that of using existing spare capacity on public transport as it covers the country. It would do little to facilitate the provision of public transport services where none exist nor would it facilitate the provision of accessible public transport. The current value of the free travel pass would not be sufficient to provide an acceptable amount of travel and would inevitably lead to demands for increases. However, the review of the free schemes recommends that a social transport fund be supported and made available to voluntary and community based organisations for the provision of local transport initiatives that would be unlikely to operate without a subsidy. Such a fund would be mainly social in nature and could facilitate the provision of wheelchair accessible vehicles. The review considered it appropriate that such a fund could be managed locally, perhaps by the local authorities, in view of their knowledge of local services and to maintain community autonomy.</P>
    <P>In relation to the free television licence scheme, the review indicated that recipients of the free schemes place the highest value on the free television licence. The scheme assists in combating social exclusion and alleviating loneliness for many vulnerable people living alone. However, a number of issues are raised concerning the payment arrangements for this scheme and the review noted that there is not a financial benefit to my Department in operating the scheme while there are considerable benefits accruing to other State agencies. My officials are currently examining the proposals put forward in this regard.</P>
    <P>The review examined the many demands to extend the schemes to other groups and to other services using social inclusion objectives as the criteria for decision. It considered that the schemes as currently constituted provide a basic package that ensures a limited standard of comfort or well-being to a particular targeted group, that is based on age or disability. Other groups, particularly those in receipt of long-term payments may experience social exclusion, but they are not groups in need of community care support nor do they experience the same physical risks of isolation as older people and people with dis<Col N="37" /> abilities. It noted that, where payment levels are adequate, any extension of the free schemes must be based solely on increased social benefits that are over and above those which can be purchased by increased income. Accordingly, the review concluded that the schemes should not be extended further to additional groups of people or to include other types of schemes.</P>
    <P>The report examines a great number of issues and requires detailed consideration. I will carefully examine all the recommendations made in this report in the context of future budgets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is as long-winded as ever. The promises given to Irish emigrants in the UK have not arisen in this report and the Minister has decided that progress will not be made on this issue. The promises made by the Minister and his colleagues as recorded in <i>The Irish Post </i>now mean nothing and free travel facilities will not be made available to Irish emigrants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Most Deputies received extensive submissions on this issue from groups such as the Camden Elderly Irish Network in the UK. One of the key points made by the groups was the huge amount of remittances, around £3 billion, which were sent back to this country by these people who are now senior citizens and are asking for this basic facility. It is fair that at this stage of their lives we should extend free travel to them. The administrative difficulties to which the Minister referred should not prevent us from doing this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though many of those living in rural areas have free travel passes, they are not of any use to them because they do not live within an ass's roar of bus routes where they can use them. Does the Minister agree that his reply regarding the use of free passes for taxi travel was negative? He found all the reasons they cannot be used and did not suggest anything positive. Does the Minister agree it is fair to those in rural areas with free travel passes to find some way in which they can use them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the review to look at the issue of those seeking free travel in Ireland and it came down firmly on the side of restricting free travel to those resident in Ireland. If one gives free travel to UK residents it must be done on a Europe wide basis which is why this issue was raised at EU level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We also asked the review to look at those in rural areas which do not have access to the free travel scheme. The group looked at a number of issues, including vouchers, and recommended a social transport fund which I hope, will be managed locally for those in rural <Col N="38" /> areas, perhaps through local authorities or the county development boards. We will aim to make progress on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I expressed my disappointment at the manner in which the Minister has introduced this Bill. While many sections of the Bill are welcome, I felt it important that the issue of alcohol consumption be put in a social context and I regret that the Minister has not done so. If we are to make a serious and genuine attempt to tackle the problems associated with the misuse of alcohol an analysis must be made of where society is coming from in its attitudes <Col N="47" /> to alcohol and how to change some of the more negative attitudes.</P>
      <P>There has been a traditional problem with alcohol, based partly on the prohibitionist attitudes of some which gave alcohol a mystique it should not have had. It would be in all our interests if alcohol was seen as a more normal aspect of life and something we could enjoy in moderation at different times of the day, particularly when people are having a meal. It should be seen simply as a part of our social life. Instead, for many historical reasons, alcohol is now at the very centre of Irish social life. Many people would complain that it is very difficult to have a social life that does not involve alcohol. One of the main reasons for this is the very powerful advertising of alcohol, on which Deputy McGahon spoke very well last week. It is very difficult to avoid being bombarded with the promotion of alcohol, whether it is on television &ndash; every advertising slot has a couple of advertisements for alcohol &ndash; or when one is driving around Dublin, where two in every three billboards advertise alcohol. It is constantly in our lives and exerts pressure on the young and vulnerable.</P>
      <P>Alcohol is portrayed as a solution to problems and in that regard the current Guinness advertisement is particularly reprehensible. There is also a close association of alcohol with having a good time. That centrality of alcohol causes damage because young people feel they cannot function or socialise without consuming significant amounts of alcohol. A strong case has to be made for at least restricting the advertising of alcohol, if not banning it completely. It is certainly out of control and we must curb the powerful promotion of alcohol.</P>
      <P>There is also a serious problem with sponsorship. It is virtually impossible to have a major musical or sporting event which does not involve one of the drinks companies. We must consider whether that is appropriate. Take as an example the sponsorship undertaken by Guinness. The hurling championship is now known as the Guinness hurling championship. This insidious and, in my view, effective form of advertising is pervasive.</P>
      <P>We should question and examine the effects of this advertising in glamourising the use of alcohol and encouraging young people who attend or watch these events, whether musical or sporting, to begin drinking alcohol. It undoubtedly has a subconscious impact on them. There is a close association between alcohol and practically every activity in Irish society. I hope the Minister will comment on that; I regret that he has not done so to date. The Labour Party will pursue this matter further in terms of imposing strict curbs on the advertising and promotion of alcohol, particularly the sponsorship by drinks companies of events that are targeted at young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I question the approach taken in this Bill and whether the extension of opening hours by one hour is the right option. There is a major hang-up <Col N="48" /> in this country, probably for traditional reasons, about the place of alcohol in society and the phenomenon of the last drinking hour before closing time. I admit I am a culprit in this regard. One goes down to the local pub for the last half hour or hour for a couple of drinks. That is the time when the atmosphere is best in the pub, when it is busy and the crowd is at its biggest. Many people come into the pub at that time.</P>
    <P>What effect will the proposed opening hours have on that? The main effect will probably be that most people will go to their local pub an hour later. It will mean coming home and going to bed an hour later and having an hour less sleep. Most customers do not want that. People who go to their local for a social drink during the week or at the weekend do not necessarily want an extra hour's drinking. They are annoyed about its implications for work the next day.</P>
    <P>One can argue that people have free choice. However, if one is in the pub two hours before closing time the atmosphere is not the same as an hour before closing time. I am not sure that extending opening hours by one hour will mean that people will have a more mature approach and decide to drink for a particular hour in the evening. The Minister should deregulate the hours and leave pubs to find the level to suit their local market. In that respect, we must distinguish between pubs in city centre locations or holiday resorts and those in residential areas. By and large, the latter are for people who fancy going to the pub for one or two pints at night before they go to bed. I believe there is no demand in those areas for pubs to be open longer.</P>
    <P>The neighbours of pubs in residential areas do not want them opening later. The noise and trouble that can occur at closing time will simply be postponed for an hour or hour and a half. That is not in anybody's interest. The proposed new hours will pose a huge problem for the management of pubs in terms of recruiting staff. In the last couple of weeks I spoke to a number of publicans and barmen about this. They do not know what they will do. They already find it difficult to staff their premises because it is a tough job involving long hours. It is simply not on to have people working from 10.30 in the morning until after 1 o'clock the following morning, and that does not include cleaning up time. Publicans will be unable to staff pubs through the day and night and will be obliged to introduce two shifts each day. That will prove impossible financially for many of them. I question the advisability of dealing with opening hours in this manner. A distinction should have been made between pubs in commercial areas, city centres and holiday resorts and pubs in residential areas.</P>
    <P>What is the current status of the national alcohol policy? We have heard little about it in the last three years. Much work went into developing the policy and it contained many worthy aspirations. Little has been said about it by the Ministers who have responsibility for it. It is time to revisit the policy and account for the progress or <Col N="49" /> otherwise in implementing its recommendations. Where necessary, it should be updated. There is a need for that as a counterbalance to the extension of opening hours.</P>
    <P>The proposed opening hours are exceptionally confusing and convoluted. A little card will have to be drafted which people will have to carry with them to help them remember the opening hours. There are different hours for Sundays, Wednesdays, Fridays and the nights before bank holidays. It is extremely complicated. Why did the Minister not seek to streamline the opening hours to assist the consumer? What is the reason for making a distinction between different days of the week?</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to look again at the provision of the extra opening hour, particularly in the context of pubs in residential areas. There is no demand for it from customers, publicans, barmen or neighbours of pubs. I believe it will prove problematic in its implementation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of a uniform time of 7.30 a.m. for on-licence mixed trading premises and the fact that they can sell alcohol from 8 a.m. It is a good development. However, what is the position of a mixed trading premises selling alcohol on a Sunday morning? There are many such premises which are anxious to open early on Sunday morning to sell the newspapers as well as wine. It is perfectly sensible to allow people who are buying their newspapers on Sunday to buy a bottle of wine for their lunch. It is crazy that these shops cannot sell wine until 12.30 p.m. on Sundays. How are shopkeepers to organise their shops if on Sundays they are obliged to cover up or hide the alcohol in their premises until a certain time? I sought the advice of some gardaí on this but they do not know what the position will be in relation to the enforcement of that section.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to allow restaurants which sell wine to also sell beer. That is a welcome and sensible development. A problem arises, however, in that there is no equal treatment of shops licensed to sell wine. Why has the provision permitting restaurants to sell beer not been extended to these shops? Why are they not permitted to sell beer? This issue will be contested strongly in the courts. It was brought to Members' attention by a number of people in the industry. Deputy Healy-Rae will have a good deal to say about it given the position of his son, Michael Healy-Rae, who would consider himself disadvantaged in this regard. Has the Attorney General given an opinion on this provision and whether it is anti-competitive? I look forward to hearing the Minister's views in this regard.</P>
    <P>I will devote the rest of my time to the issue of under age drinking. The Minister has failed to grasp the seriousness of this problem. It affects all parts of the country. It was initially a social problem in urban areas but it now seems that every constituency is affected by the phenomenon of young people drinking. This is not just young people having a couple of beers or trying a flagon of cider, it is young people going out to <Col N="50" /> get drunk as their main pastime. Is the Minister examining this problem or is any research being done in the Department to discover why this is the case?</P>
    <P>I am a member of two drugs task forces in my constituency and the general view now is that the problem of under age drinking is surpassing the drugs problem in local communities. There is the phenomenon of children from 11 or 12 years of age going out several nights a week and taking red bull and vodka, which seems to be the drink of choice, and drinking until they are literally out of their heads drunk. This is very often followed with an ecstasy tablet. It is a massive indictment of society that young people are choosing to do this. We must investigate why they want to escape reality and need such a massive buzz. To some extent, this is the down side of the Celtic tiger, but it also indicates a failure on the part of the authorities to adequately protect children. Very often they need to be protected from themselves. A down side of the Celtic tiger is that so many young teenagers are working. What protection is there for them? No one under 18 years of age is supposed to work after 10 p.m., yet many young people under the age of 18 work as lounge girls and lounge boys in pubs at night. The situation is bad now but I am concerned that it will be exacerbated as a result of the new opening hours. I urge the Minister to ensure there is a counterbalancing measure put in place, that is, more inspectors from the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt's, Department to carry out regular inspections, because the authorities have been very remiss in this regard.</P>
    <P>The growth in under age drinking is resulting in shocking statistics in absenteeism from school. I do not know if the Minister is aware of how bad this problem is. I recently spoke to school principals in my constituency and I was amazed to discover that there is an absentee rate of between 30% and 35% every Monday across a number of schools in the area. It is a regular occurrence that one-third of teenagers do not attend school on Monday morning because of, by and large, the effects of week-end drinking. First, this is a result of their working late into the night in pubs and, second, they have all this additional money in their pockets and they can think of nothing better to do in many cases than spend it on drink. The authorities have, by and large, turned a blind eye to date to this problem which needs urgent attention. There is a serious lack of enforcement of the existing laws and I welcome the strengthening of the provisions under the new legislation.</P>
    <P>Why has the Minister not promoted the national age card? That should have been promoted strongly. Ideally most young people should be given these cards before the new legislation is enacted and then the Minister could come down hard on the publicans. Given that the new legislation is imminent, why has the Minister not yet launched and promoted the national age card? I ask him to do so as soon as possible so that <Col N="51" /> people can prepare for the enactment of the new legislation.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister do something about raising awareness among parents regarding their responsibilities and the dangers for their children of widespread alcohol abuse? Many parents have been remiss in this regard but they need the support of the State in taking a firm stand with their young people. It is very difficult for parents to take a firm stand if their children can point to their neighbours who are going to the local pub, being served under age without any great difficulty and working in local pubs until 12.30 a.m. and 1 a.m. Therefore, why should parents try to swim against the tide, so to speak? Many parents do so bravely and successfully but it is very difficult for them. They need the support of the State in helping to protect their children which the State has not given them up to now.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister consider an amendment I will table? This is an effort to clamp down more effectively on publicans who sell drink to under age people for drinking in public. Off-licences should be required to print the name of the shop on their bags. That would be of great assistance to the Garda in tracing from where drink sold to gangs of young people emanated. Drink is sold to gangs of young people who consume it on green spaces and in many cases cause absolute havoc in their local community. Many areas, particularly areas with elderly populations, are simply under siege from gangs of drinking youths. This is a nightly nightmare for many people in my constituency and throughout the country. The proposal was put to me by a number of gardaí that off-licences should be obliged to display the name of their shop on bags and this would assist the authorities in tracing the source of much of the alcohol consumed on the street.</P>
    <P>There is also a need to introduce draft by-laws for local authorities to cover drinking in public places. This has been dealt with in an <i>ad hoc</i> basis in recent years and there have been legal difficulties with local authorities. Some direction should come from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I am aware that many local authorities would welcome draft by-laws.</P>
    <P>On our attitude as a society to alcohol and the effect it is having on young people, the question must be raised about the place of alcohol in third level colleges. We are inclined to think that alcohol abuse is a phenomenon which is common among working class children. This is not the case. The problem crosses all classes and one would need to have just a cursory knowledge of social activities within third level colleges to know that the drinks industry sponsors heavily every activity and society in our universities. This is wrong and should be prohibited. I ask the Minister to acquaint himself with the issue. During freshers' week in the universities every society invites the new students, many of whom are just 16 and 17 years of age, to come along to drinks which are available in abundance and provided <Col N="52" /> free of charge by the drinks industry. This is an appalling message to be sending to young people in their first few days in university. This resembles the way in which the banks target third level students. The drinks industry targets third level students on the basis that if they can get them drinking early, whether Guinness, Budweiser or whatever, they will stick with them for life. Sending out the message that we are incapable of enjoying ourselves without large amounts of alcohol being involved is causing great damage to young people. I ask the Minister to pay attention to this issue.</P>
    <P>I reiterate my support for the new measures being introduced in relation to breaches of the legislation by publicans selling alcohol to under age people. The Minister should not water down this proposal. We need a strong deterrent because attitudes to young people and what is acceptable have become very lax. For too long there has been very little difficulty for anyone over the age of 14 or 15 being served in a pub or off-licence. We need to clamp down and change this entire culture so that publicans and owners of off-licences will be terrified of the consequences of selling alcohol to young people. The Minister has got the measures right and I appeal to him not to give way to pressure.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the measure allowing young people to work in pubs as lounge boys and lounge girls. Will he come back with specific answers on how this tallies with the Protection of Young Persons Act? I also ask the Minister to give consideration to the establishment of a special Garda unit to tackle the problem of under age drinking and to ensure strict enforcement of the new laws. This social problem is of such magnitude that a special unit is necessary to examine it, look at trends and ensure strict enforcement of the legislation across all divisions.</P>
    <P>I recognise the submission made by the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association which includes a number of very worthwhile proposals. I was asked to make reference to the submission by the leader of our parliamentary party, Deputy Penrose, who is a strong supporter of the association. It might be said that the PTAA is of another time, but it has adapted very well to modern circumstances and is now a strong lobbying voice counteracting the pressure and muscle of the drinks industry. It is important to recognise that the board of the PTAA expressed serious concern about the possible negative effects of extending the hours of drinking in pubs, hotels and clubs and suggested changes should be permitted on a trial basis during which an impact study should be carried out measuring the personal, medical, domestic, economic and social effects of such extensions. I earnestly ask the Minister to agree to this proposal as this is a new departure and there is a serious problem. The proposals by the Minister to extend opening hours could quite conceivably exacerbate the problem of alcohol abuse. For that reason I ask <Col N="53" /> the Minister to put in place systems to monitor the impact of the new opening hours. I know the Minister is establishing a commission and intends returning to this.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the sound proposal by the PTAA that health warnings be put on bottles and cans containing alcoholic drinks. Health warnings on cigarette packs made people stop and think and we should do the same in relation to alcohol, which is potentially just as damaging.</P>
    <P>I fully endorse the proposal made by the PTAA that the drinks industry and those licensed to sell alcoholic liquor should take their proportionate responsibility for the serious personal, domestic and social consequences of drinking to excess. Too often we look at this from an economic point of view and see the great success with plenty of jobs, but behind that there is a very sad and harrowing story about the effect drink is having on many lives and families. I am not satisfied the Minister has struck a sufficient balance between both sides of the argument. Most importantly, he did not indicate in his opening remarks that he has an appreciation of the scale and reality of the current problem of under-age drinking. Many counter-balancing measures are required to put the Bill in context and to ensure it does not further exacerbate the problem. I look forward to Committee Stage when we will table a number of amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support fully the measures being introduced by the Minister who has gone a long way to tackling many issues in relation to our licensing laws and I commend him on the manner in which he has done so. He has had the courage to tackle an issue which has been fudged by many previous Ministers. He has proposed that a commission be established to examine the granting of licences and has encouraged it to come forward with relevant proposals.</P>
      <P>The Bill has been eagerly anticipated and generally well received. Certain misgivings have been expressed by organisations representing publicans, but they have given a broad welcome to most aspects of this long awaited legislation. I compliment the Minister on his extensive consultations with the trade before presenting the Bill. He has also taken the view of the general public into account.</P>
      <P>I have certain reservations regarding aspects of the Bill which I will discuss later. It will make sweeping and extensive changes in licensing Acts dating back to the 1830s and to the registration of clubs legislation dating to the early 1900s. It will introduce the biggest changes made in licensing laws since the 1960s. Within the next month or so pub law will have been dramatically altered. There will be a dramatic liberalisation of opening hours, changes in respect of pubs, off-licences, night clubs and restaurants and an easing in the conditions imposed for the granting of bar licences. A very much tougher approach will be taken towards publicans who serve under-age drinkers, a change which is long overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="54" /> The long awaited changes in the law relating to the hours during which it is legal to sell intoxicating products in bars and clubs are now before us. There is a tightening up of the law in relation to under age drinking and stronger penalties will be imposed when the law is broken. A new system is being introduced for licensing premises which have not previously been licensed. The Bill also covers the scope of licences granted to racecourses and greyhound racetracks and incorporates certain other changes.</P>
    <P>The Bill is long overdue. Its contents have been influenced by the report of the sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights of 18 June 1998 of which I was a member. It made 78 recommendations to the Minister and I am delighted he has taken many of them on board. The interim study on the liquor licensing laws, published by the Competition Authority in September 1998, was also considered and seminars were held which were co-sponsored by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Dublin Institute of Technology. These addressed matters relevant to the legislation and the knowledge gained from the sessions has had a major bearing on the new laws, with a wide variety of viewpoints having a crucial impact on the provisions being proposed.</P>
    <P>Detailed observations have been made by a diversity of groups and individuals such as the Vintners' Federation of Ireland, Mandate, Bord Fáilte, the hotels federation, the Wine and Spirit Association, IMRO, the Irish Dance and Entertainment Industry and chambers of commerce. There has been a major input from the Garda Síochána, the Law Society, the Bar Council, the Road Safety Association, Mothers Against Drink Driving and others concerned with the legal aspects of the Bill. In effect we have had detailed submissions from all the interested parties, the general public, the law enforcement bodies and professional bodies. No shade of opinion has been ignored and I compliment the Minister on such a wide-ranging consultation process which has helped produce a Bill which will pass safely through the House.</P>
    <P>All the views expressed have been listened to and many have been incorporated in the Bill. The extension of opening hours was inevitable. European law indicates the need for amended laws here. The licensed trade has demanded longer opening hours for a long time while the consumer has been looking for extended opening hours for many years. There has been a major change in social circumstances over the past decades. For example, people increasingly work flexi-time or shifts and find they have more free time. People have more disposable income and tend to socialise until later. These trends have influenced the legislation before us. The holy hour on Sundays has been the subject of public criticism for many years and the proposal to abolish it is timely. Closing time on Sunday night will remain unchanged, something I support as a very wise <Col N="55" /> move to ensure people can get up for work on Monday morning and that we do not have absenteeism from schools or anywhere else. I understand why there is no demand for a change in this regard.</P>

      <P>The later closing time of 12.30 a.m. on the eve of all public holidays will be welcomed. The new closing times of 11.30 p.m. all year round on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays and 12.30 a.m. on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays reflect the wide diversity of views on this aspect of the licensing laws. They have broad support.</P>
      <P>There is broad support for uniform opening hours for on-licence and off-licence premises and the new relaxed weekday trading hours. The area of special exemptions is being widened and simplified. This is welcome. One aspect of the old laws &ndash; the mandatory availability of a meal to qualify for an exemption &ndash; is being abolished and not before time. How many times has the legislation been ignored and bypassed by the serving of a token meal to customers by those who have availed of an exemption? It is common practice. I am glad owners of premises will not now have to serve meals to qualify for exemptions. All licensed premises will now be able to apply for such exemptions as the restriction of qualification to hotels and restaurants is being lifted.</P>
      <P>The granting of new licences is being simplified. A licence may be granted anywhere in the State in substitution for an old one subject to conditions. This is welcome. Restricted licences may be converted to full licences subject to conditions. Most restricted licences are six day licences or early closing licences. Under section 16 these may be upgraded to ordinary seven day licences on payment of a fee of £2,500 to the Revenue Commissioners. This is also welcome. At last count there were over 130 such licences. It was a shame that the publicans concerned could not open seven days.</P>
      <P>Section 5 deals with changes to the law on special exemptions granted by the courts. They allow for the sale of intoxicating liquor after normal closing times on special occasions and remove the condition that exemptions be granted only to hotels or restaurants. They also remove restrictions on the granting of a special exemption on Sundays.</P>
      <P>Section 6 provides for an extension of permitted hours in relation to the serving of alcohol with meals in hotels or restaurants. The same will apply to clubs registered under the Registration of Clubs Act. Drinking-up time for a period of 30 minutes will be allowed after such special exemptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the increased penalties in relation to under age drinking, a problem that we have had <Col N="56" /> to address in Cork city because of its side effects. In 1996 I embarked on a campaign to ban on-street drinking, the need for which stemmed from the indiscriminate selling of alcohol to under age drinkers by certain &ndash; by which I mean very few &ndash; off-licensed and licensed premises. I was horrified to see youngsters of the tender age of 14 years or less drinking alcohol on public streets. It had become commonplace in the city centre. Something had to be done to tackle what was a very serious social problem.</P>
    <P>I conducted major research, as part of which I examined the laws in place in Northern Ireland and Scotland to tackle on-street drinking by those over the age of 18 years. The public order Act deals with those under the age of 18 years. I was fortunate to gain the full support of my colleagues on Cork Corporation and the complete co-operation of the city manager and his staff. The Garda Síochána gave me and my colleagues the benefit of their invaluable advice and total commitment during the period in which we promoted the new by-laws and have been of great help ever since. The new by-laws were introduced on 1 November 1998. A copy of the report produced in that year is available in the Oireachtas Library. They are currently being revised.</P>
    <P>Everybody in the city shared my concerns in relation to under age drinking in all its social aspects. They were also concerned at the ease with which young people were able to ask older persons to purchase alcohol for them from off-licensed premises which they drank on city streets, in housing estates and at the gable end of houses. The practice in Cork is referred to as gatting, which was often followed by a visit to the disco, leaving many of our youth on the streets at a very late hour in an intoxicated condition.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Garda Síochána in Cork city on its enforcement of the by-laws. Chief superintendent Adrian Culligan, superintendent Martin Shannon who worked with us on the committee and superintendent Kieran McGann have worked very hard to ensure they are enforced. In many instances the £25 on-the-spot fine has been imposed. There are almost 300 prosecutions pending in the local courts against those who did not pay the fine. Since the by-laws were introduced on 1 November 1998, 531 21-day notices have been issued and 203 have paid the £25 fine. The remainder are before the courts which have the power to impose fines of up to £500. The average fine is about £70, although fines of £100 have been imposed. Of the 531 people concerned, 58 are under the age of 18 while 83 are over the age of 25. I will give a copy of the statistics to the Minister for his information. While one would need a garda to detect every person who is offending in the city, we are doing our best to get people to comply and there has certainly been an improvement.</P>
    <P>I fully understand and relate to the Minister's concern. I note that the penalties include the temporary closing of premises and the abolition of the reasonable belief defence in relation to the <Col N="57" /> sale of alcohol to under age persons. Publicans are worried about this aspect of the Bill. They are of the view that it imposes harsh penalties on publicans and does not punish young persons who know that they are below the legal age, some of whom may produce false identity cards or passes. Is there an appropriate penalty for so doing? I am advised that they can be prosecuted under the 1998 Act. Very high fines should be imposed on under age drinkers given that they are aware that they are breaking the law. They should not be allowed to do so with impunity.</P>
    <P>Those who produce false identity cards are guilty of a further serious transgression. In this day and age it is possible with the aid of modern technology to produce identity cards which appear to be genuine. They are literally undetectable from genuine identity cards. How can publicans detect and deal with this fraud? Many publicans favour the introduction of a standard identity card &ndash; a national identity card &ndash; for persons under the age of 25. Can this be done? What about the person who does not drink? Would he or she have to carry an identity card? Would this be legal or constitutional? Publicans are of the view that this section should be incorporated in the Bill, but am I right in thinking that a national identity card may be introduced under regulations introduced in April 1999?</P>
    <P>Only a very small minority of publicans sell alcohol to underage persons. The vast majority have nothing to fear from the Bill. There is confusion, however, about the provisions under which a premises may be closed for up to one week. Will the onus be on the publican? What will happen in a case where a publican is happy that a person is over the legal age only to discover that he or she was wrong in making that assumption? Should publicans take the view that they should not serve those without a card &ndash; no card, no drink? Publicans have expressed the view that the seven day mandatory penalty is too harsh. Will the Minister clarify whether the penalty is seven days or from one hour to seven days? There is confusion over this issue.</P>
    <P>Parents are concerned about the fact that children of 14, 15 and 16 years of age are drinking. A Southern Health Board report was recently cited in a newspaper which indicated that children as young as nine years of age are drinking. This is dangerous. We have all seen the drinking which goes on when junior certificate results are announced. Will the Minister indicate whether judges will have discretion with regard to the mandatory closure of a public house? Some legal opinion has suggested that, by virtue of the manner in which the Bill is drafted, a temporary closure may have the effect of lapsing the licence, requiring an application to be made to the courts to reactivate the licence. These issues are confusing publicans and I would ask the Minister to clarify them. We do not want to penalise publicans who are obeying the law and doing their best to carry on their business. We want new licensing laws which protect publicans and customers and <Col N="58" /> ensure that those under age do not obtain alcohol.</P>
    <P>Publicans have also expressed concern about the issuing of 15 authorised event orders in a 12 month period to racecourses or greyhound tracks. They want this defined as 15 single days because an order given to one of the above groups could be used to cover a three day meeting. If this was the case, orders would give permission for up to 45 exemptions. Publicans are seeking an assurance that this will not happen and I would welcome the Minister's comments on this issue.</P>
    <P>The same circumstances could arise during a trade fair and I would appreciate clarification of this matter so that we can allay those fears. Publicans also wish the Bill to stipulate that they be allowed the 12 area exemption orders and that the days can be taken singularly rather than in blocks of three. Under the Bill as drafted, three of the days must be taken on each area exemption order, even if there is only a need for one or two days.</P>
    <P>Major disquiet has been expressed about the transfer of licences and there is concern that rural areas will be denuded of licences under the Bill. Serious reservations have been expressed about the transferring of licences from family sized pubs to other pubs. There is no definition in the Bill which would ensure that a licence went to a similar sized pub. Under the Bill as drafted, the licence could be transferred to one of the new superpubs, with consequent financial implications for owners of traditional pubs which would be unable to compete with the new breed of licensed premises. Some of the new pubs are up to 10,000 to 15,000 sq. ft. in contrast to many traditional pubs which are 1,000 sq. ft. or less. I understand the fears of those who earn a living in the current environment but who will be unable to compete with the supermarket-type competition of the massive new bars which are becoming a feature of the scene. There is a cap on the size of supermarkets, and publicans believe there should also be a cap on the size of new licensed premises. If not, many family run public houses will go out of business. Publicans are concerned that the Bill is a charter for developers and speculators. I am not sure whether the Minister has discretion in this area or whether it is a matter for planners. However, he should examine the possibility of ensuring that licences are transferred to similar sized premises.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the Bill and look forward to his reply.</P>

      <P>If the trade descriptions Act applied to Ministers selling their wares in this House, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, would have com<Col N="59" /> mitted a serious offence last Thursday. On that occasion he suggested the Bill was a lot of things which it is not. The Minister used words such as &ldquo;wide-ranging&rdquo; and &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; and claimed the Bill &ldquo;does away with decades-old restrictive legislation&rdquo;. He also talked about clarifying licensing laws which are &ldquo;labyrinthine in their complexity&rdquo; and claimed to have &ldquo;interpreted the public mood correctly&rdquo;. He has done none of these things.</P>
      <P>This is not a bad Bill in so far as it goes, but the problem is it does not go far enough. The only good parts of the Bill are those which get rid of some of the nonsense in current legislation but the innovations in the Bill are of more doubtful value. No one has suggested to me that having three different closing times in the week is a good idea. It is ludicrous to have one closing time for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, another for Thursday, Friday and Saturday and a third for Sunday. Earlier closing on Sunday is justified on the grounds that people have to get up for work on Monday, yet they also have to get up for work on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Many people also have to get up for work on Saturday. The only explanation for three different closing times is the Government could not make up its mind on what it wished to do and has made a mess of it. It is a nonsense to have three different closing times in the week.</P>
      <P>I hope that some day a Minister for Justice will do the right thing and reduce the number of different kinds of licences available. I know how difficult it is to achieve this objective. I did a deal with the vintners in 1986 but the Bill was not completed by the time of the election in 1987. The vintners then came back to the next Minister and unpicked the deal I had done with them and off we went again. We still have a ridiculous plethora of licences.</P>
      <P>I would welcome a Bill which repealed all previous Intoxicating Liquor Acts; provided for one type of licence for the sale of alcohol for consumption on premises, whether public houses, restaurants, clubs or whatever; provided for one type of licence for off-sales from any kind of premises; contained a coherent set of rules, in so far as they are needed, for night-clubs, discos and similar premises; and put an end to the nonsensical approach under which, up to now, the only way the total number of public licences in the country could go was down, because to create a new licence one had to extinguish two old ones. The Minister has put the brakes on that and we will now have a situation where the number can only remain the same. This is a little less ideological but it is nonsensical given that the population is increasing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people are concerned about the consequences of any new measure on the value of their businesses, yet they maintain and defend a situation in which the number of businesses can be reduced but cannot be increased. These people need to make up their minds about what <Col N="60" /> they want. Do they want to be able to do business or do they want an asset with a substantial value? They can have one or the other, but not both. Somewhere in the middle, the interests of ordinary people who like to have a drink need to be considered. I wish to offer some personal advice which may or may not be taken. Health warnings on cans or bottles will have the same effect as those on cigarette packets &ndash; nil.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Jim Higgins who pointed out that the Bill merely tinkers around with closing and opening hours, dates, transfers of licences and so on. The Minister is setting up a commission on licensing. I will make a virtue of necessity by saying that I hope the commission will be given the required remit to carry out a fundamental modernisation of the law. I have to say, with regret, that it is making a virtue of necessity because the institution of that commission is another example of the long-fingering of simple basic but contentious issues that has become one of the hallmarks of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Bill admits some parts of the current law are daft. The Minister spoke about the apparent conflict between public dance licences and special exemption orders. He said the difference is that this could give rise to a situation where a licensed premises with an exemption order to 2.30 a.m. may have to end the dancing before the end of the exemption. He said that would not make sense. How very perceptive of him. What did he do about it? He went on to say the solution is provided in section 5, that where a special exemption order is in force, the dance licence will be deemed to be a licence, which will permit dancing for a period beyond the period of a special exemption. It will be deemed to be a licence and the people concerned can deem themselves to be allowed to continue dancing for as long as they are allowed to continue drinking. Could he not have made a simple straightforward provision that people can be permitted to do anything as long as the premises remains open and anything that is legal in the premises can be done up to the time that it has to close, instead of introducing another nonsense to solve a nonsense? What genius thought up the provision that a dance licence will be deemed to be a licence, etc.? The Minister talked about labyrinthine complexity of the law. I do not know what labyrinthine mind thought up that solution of deeming a dance licence to be a licence. It can be compared to the jokes told about economists, who assume they have the answer.</P>
    <P>Another admission of the stupidity of the existing law was recognised by the Minister when he said we will no longer require a premises with a special restaurant licence to have a waiting area not exceeding 20% of the floor area of the dining area. I am delighted that requirement has been removed. The Minister's predecessor, who put it into law and fought in the ditches for it, should not have put it there.</P>
    <P>Another provision of existing law being repealed, which also should not have been inserted, <Col N="61" /> is that which forbade a supermarket with an off-licence to have a self-service configuration for its drinks section because it was thought that people would go berserk buying drink in supermarkets if they could get it self-service. It is a tribute to the Minister and his predecessors that they had the good sense not to enforce that requirement. It was so patently absurd it could not have been given effect and I am delighted it has been removed.</P>
    <P>The law has not got to grips with serving intoxicating liquor in clubs. The Minister reminded us that under existing law visitors to a club may be supplied with liquor only on the invitation and in the company of a club member and the visitor's name and address must be kept in a book showing the date of each visit. I am sure the Minister, like me, has been offered a drink and accepted it in a club of which he was not a member. I bet my bottom dollar his name, address and the date of the visit do not appear in a book in a club. I would say those names and addresses are as rare as hens' teeth. The Minister is not doing anything about that. That is a nonsense section. It is honoured only in the breach, not in the observance.</P>
    <P>The Minister will sort out the problem associated with serving intoxicating liquor in clubs by making a new provision about visiting teams. I do not know why he talked about teams as the Bill refers to visiting groups. What is a group? Is it a team? Does it include the team's panel, its trainers, boot-cleaners, groundsmen and linesmen? Who is included? Are the spouses, partners, friends, sons and daughters of members of a team included? Who is included in the term &ldquo;visiting groups&rdquo;? Under the Bill, visiting groups can be supplied with liquor at the request and in the presence of an official of the club. That will not sort out the problem of drinking in clubs. The Minister has compounded the confusion even more by talking about teams.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to discover that I will stop being a criminal in another way. I congratulate the Minister on having dug out this one. He reminded us that the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1924, requires all sales of alcohol in an unlicensed premises to be for ready cash. Members who have written a cheque to pay for a round of drinks or for drinks for an evening have committed an offence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Jim Higgins, argued for a single, streamlined and, by implication, dedicated body to look after licensing. The Minister told us that the courts will take account of the fitness of an applicant, the unfitness or inconvenience of a new premises, their unsuitability for <Col N="62" /> the needs of persons residing in the neighbourhood, whether a locality is sufficiently served by a particular form of licensed outlet and so on. Why should we assume the courts have any special wisdom or knowledge in these matters? Judges know the law. We do not appoint judges to the Bench to make judgments on the suitability of persons or premises or on how well or badly an area is served by pubs. Judges do not have any special insight into the kind of qualitative questions of social and economic practices involved in making licences. If the commission on licensing does anything worthwhile, it will put in place a new system for granting licences for as long as we have licences, as we have avoided the question of the basic justification for a licensing system for a long time.</P>
    <P>It has been brought to my attention that some local authorities take the law into their own hands. Under certain provisions they can limit the number of licences in a town or forbid the granting of licences to new applicants. Can they do that under existing law? Representations have been made to me in respect of a number of cases that they do that. Also, abolishing the defence of reasonable grounds in relation to serving drink to under age persons in the absence of a mandatory national provision for identity cards is unreasonable.</P>

      <P>This Bill, introduced by the Minister, is one of the greatest jokes of all time. He must be completely out of touch with the rank and file of the general community on the changes needed to update the rules appertaining to drinking hours operated by licensed premises. What Minister in his sane senses would dream of introducing a three-tiered closing time system for the licensed trade? It is proposed to introduce a closing time of 11 p.m. on Sundays, 11.30 p.m. on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays and 12 midnight closing time on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Publicans will need a stopwatch to remind themselves of the day of the week and the time.</P>

      <P>The Minister should have enough experience to realise that one specified closing time of 12 midnight with 30 minutes drinking up time should apply seven days a week.</P>
      <P>It is evident this legislation is doomed to failure and will be severely criticised by those engaged in the licensing trade. Is it fit and proper to request visitors to this country to adhere to a rule that last orders on a Sunday will be taken at 11 p.m. and customers will be asked to finish up their drinks and leave a premises by 11.30 p.m.? I need not remind the Minister, because he should be conversant with the situation, that it will be criticised in all tourist seaside resorts such as Schull. The Minister should be aware of the position in Schull where he frequently visits his in-laws. He should have known about this three-tier system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="63" /> Is the Minister aware that £1,000 million is paid by the drinks industry in duties and VAT each year to the Exchequer? Is he aware that 52,300 people are employed full time and a further 23,000 are employed part time in the industry? Is he aware that an additional 3,000 jobs in agriculture are solely dependent on the drinks industry for purchasing crops such as malting barley etc? Is he aware that the drinks industry utilises 80% of Ireland's malted barley, 12% of our sugar production and 2% of our milk production? Some 88% of pubs throughout the country have carried out renovations to the tune of £200 million over the past five years. Is the Minister aware that 90% of public houses are family run businesses? Labour accounts for 60% of the average publican's running costs and 69% of pubs have an annual turnover of less than £150,000 &ndash; only 1% of pubs have an annual turnover in excess of £1 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some 60% of pubs are located in small towns and villages with a population of fewer than 10,000 people. Some 90% provide some form of entertainment, including live shows, TV, music, darts, snooker etc. and 15% provide specific tourist entertainment. Some 85.8% of customers visit the pubs after 9 p.m. each night of the week.</P>
      <P>The Irish consumer wants later licensing hours. The lifestyle has changed and people go out later in the evening. Customers want to stay in their local pub and enjoy a few hours socialising. They do not want to leave the pub and go to a night club where they will pay significantly more for drinks. There are no night clubs in Schull, where the Minister's wife comes from, or in Golleen, Ballydehob or other areas. These people must be catered for also.</P>
      <P>Of the five million visitors to Ireland last year, nearly all spent some time in an Irish pub. Compared to the extended hours tourists spend in the pubs of their own countries, they are baffled at our hours of trading. Irish people travel abroad regularly for work and holidays. They believe the trading hours here are outdated and restrictive. The current laws are based on those enacted in 1927 and do not reflect the vast changes in society and social habits. They do not allow people to take responsibility for their own lives and make mature decisions. Irish licensing laws will have to be revised to bring them on a par with European licensing laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, under the Bill, restaurants which have Bord Fáilte certificates can sell beer as well as wine, why is the same privilege not extended to the family supermarket which has a similar wine licence? Why did the Minister not include spirits as well as beer and wine to be made available in restaurants? If the Minister went for a meal and was thirsty he might need a hot whiskey, but <Col N="64" /> under the Bill it would be illegal for those restaurants to serve him a hot whiskey. That is discriminatory and bad planning.</P>
    <P>On under age drinking, Deputy O'Flynn lectured on drinking outside licensed premises. The Minister is aware that at every licensed premises in Schull during the summer people drink on the streets due to a lack of accommodation in the premises. The same applies in Crookhaven, Bantry, Killarney and all over the country. I hope when Deputy Healy-Rea comes in to speak on behalf of the people and publicans of South Kerry he will be realistic and will support the Fine Gael motion when the time comes.</P>

      <P>I am happy to have an opportunity to contribute to the Second Stage debate on the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 2000. I was pleased to hear Deputy Dukes, a former Minister for Justice, speak about the inaction, the lack of real action and the lack of real change in the Bill. Given that he has left the House he cannot inform me now whether he introduced any changes when he had the opportunity to do so.</P>
      <P>I declare an interest in that I enjoy a drink, usually in moderation. That will cover my declaration of interest in relation to this Bill. Publication of the Bill is long awaited. Recently I have been in the company of people who said it would never appear, that it would be too controversial for any Minister to take on. It was said that the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, would not have the guts to do what others had put on the long finger. What Deputy Sheehan said about a lack of consultation is pub talk. So far as I understand, every person involved in the drinks industry was consulted and a consensus was reached. They were all given the opportunity to express their views and have been listened to. It is with great admiration that these same people look on the Minister.</P>
      <P>This is an area in which it is difficult to please everyone. The Minister has taken on board a number of wide-ranging opinions and points of view and has delivered this new, comprehensive package. It will be, and is already, seen as a milestone for the licensing laws and their modernisation. In his address to the Seanad, the Minister said that, given that almost everyone has an interest in the topic, there will no doubt be publicans, restaurateurs, licence holders, drinkers and non-drinkers who will either find the Bill too relaxed or too strict. I believe he has taken a balanced approach in the legislation and, with the other measures such as the commission on licensing, it will ensure that the process of review and change continues to evolve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill significantly increases the permitted trading hours. The distinction between summer and winter time will be abolished and premises will be permitted to remain open from 10.30 a.m. to 11.30 p.m. on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, from 10.30 a.m. to 12.30 a.m. on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays and from 12.30 p.m. to 11 p.m. on Sundays. The Sunday closing <Col N="65" /> time between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. is long out of date and will be abolished under the Bill. There is no change to the closing time on Christmas Day and Good Friday when there will be no permitted opening hours. I welcome that. Publicans and their families deserve to have those two days for themselves.</P>
    <P>In many areas the Bill will bring a legal reality to what occurs, for right or wrong, in practice. In some urban areas it will probably cause concern as people exit onto the streets from premises at a later hour. For others the hour change will not be enough as they strive for all night opening for some adults who may wish to arrive home after their children instead of before their children go out. It abolishes key barriers to entry into the licensed trade with the implementation of the single licensing clause. The abolition of the population clause will assist areas which are deemed to have too few pubs. In my area it will add significant value to rural licences and in that respect it is very welcome.</P>
    <P>The Bill abolishes prohibitions on special exemptions and increases the time to 2.30 a.m. up to which premises may open on foot of special exemptions. It abolishes the obligation to provide a meal for a special exemption. This will release many existing premises from legally having to do something which they have not been doing. Restricted licences are to be converted to full publican licences, subject to disposal conditions. This will allow the small number of six day licences to fade out, making the new full licence status all the more valuable. I know a small number of people who will be very happy with that aspect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Restaurants will now be able to serve beer with meals. This makes sense and should be expanded into a full service option. Many good meals are finished with an Irish coffee by locals and tourists alike.</P>
    <P>On-licence and off-licence outlets engaged in mixed trading will be permitted to sell alcohol from 8.00 a.m. on weekdays. This will make alcohol readily accessible to all. This is both a good and a bad thing, depending on how available it proves to be to young people, a point on which I will expand later.</P>
    <P>Racecourses and greyhound tracks are to be licensed for authorised events that occur on non-racing days. This will greatly enhance the viability of many of these facilities which are reliant on a very poor ratio of racing to non-racing days. Perhaps this is the time for me to promote, both to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and to the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, the concept of a race track for Donegal which could avail of these new licensing laws, because Donegal is badly under-served particularly by horse-racing courses. Perhaps the Ministers would look at that issue.</P>
    <P>There is to be a relaxation of the restrictions on the use of registered club premises. There will be an extension in the trading hour regime which will apply to registered clubs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="66" /> The final two important items are the aforementioned establishment of the commission on licensing. It will comprise Departments, representatives of the trade, representatives of consumers and other interests. Its remit will include continuing the process of fundamental change of the law in this area and, what I consider to be the most important element, focusing on the issue of underage drinking. With the removal of the &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo; defence comes a penalty of the closure of a premises, whether an on-licence or an off-licence, for specific periods for offenders. I am glad all premises that sell alcohol are being brought under this provision. The drinks industry finds this aspect particularly controversial. However, I urge the Minister to hold firm on it.</P>
    <P>The licensing trade is an industry which employs thousands of people and is a major economic and commercial activity for the nation. Ireland abroad is synonymous with Guinness, Bushmills, Baileys and so on. The Irish have a world-wide reputation for their social skills and, dare I say it, their capacity for drinking. While this can be endearing to some, it can and does hide a very serious problem of alcohol abuse. Abuse is seen in terms not only of the decreasing age of average adult alcoholism but also in terms of a significant difficulty with under age drinking in most towns and villages. It is vital that the changes in these laws do not become a licence to increase these problems in continuing abuse of the law but that the provisions of this Bill, once it has gone through the rigours of Committee and Report Stages, are rigorously enforced. In this respect, I am glad the Minister has already stated that he will raise this matter with the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The majority of young people in Ireland are good, fun loving and carefree individuals. A minority tend to attract negative publicity in the press, and as a result all young people are tarred with the one brush, which they do not deserve. Similarly, the majority of publicans and licensees are responsible people who bear the common good in mind. Here again it is a minority, who exploit young people and people who have a problem with alcohol merely to increase their profits, that makes the headlines. Nevertheless, social and health-related alcohol problems are too often brushed under the carpet. This is particularly worrying when one considers the incidence of alcoholism and the ever-decreasing age at which people with alcoholism are now reporting.</P>
    <P>A recent report in a Derry journal stated that the majority of attendances at Altnagelvin accident and emergency department after hours are young people who have sustained injuries while under the influence of alcohol or who have been involved in alcohol-related assaults. Alcohol also features in many of the hospital's overdose cases involving young people. It is felt by consultants who work in accident and emergency departments in Derry that the youth culture revolves around drinking to the extent that they drink until they cannot stand up. The consultant gastro<Col N="67" /> enterologist has said that time after time many young people present with alcohol poisoning. Often they are aggressive to both medical staff and other patients. Dr. Frank O'Connor pointed to the fact that besides the acute effects of alcohol on their behaviour and level of consciousness, there is often damage to the stomach from dangerous haemorrhaging. There is always a degree of youthful high spirits, but this seems to be more than that. Dr. O'Connor added that this type of habitual abuse leads, inevitably, to severe damage to the liver and pancreas and that his hospital has even seen several deaths as a result of alcohol abuse in young men in recent years due to liver failure from alcohol damage. These comments arose from a national report which revealed that hospitals had seen a 17% increase in teenage admissions due to alcohol abuse. I would be interested to know whether such a survey has been undertaken in this jurisdiction and, if so, what the results were.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, I would add my support to Dr. O'Connor's call for a concerted programme of public education to try to change what he describes as the senseless and dangerous culture of heavy drinking among young people. In Inishowen, approximately three years ago, a study was undertaken into the use of drugs in the peninsula. This was carried out in co-operation with secondary schools, the Garda Síochána and the health board. The results were startling in relation to drugs and in relation to the most common drug which is usually described separately, alcohol. I am rather disappointed at the level of follow-up that has occurred since. Opportunities are being lost to bring pop or sports personalities or others for whom young people have an affinity into classrooms at a national level to outline the importance of a healthy lifestyle and to give the positive message that an idol can give to teenagers at a time when they are so prone to having idols.</P>
    <P>Recently, Mikey Graham of Boyzone was on the Marian Finucane show to express his concern at the way the media had portrayed a recent interview with him. He had advocated the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes. He felt he had been made out to be a junkie because of his comments, although he stated that he felt that alcohol was the biggest and most underestimated scourge in Irish life. Such people, locally and nationally, could act as role models for the youth. Given the number of children who listen closely to, and emulate the stars, we are under-utilising those who consciously wish to be a positive role model for their supporters.</P>
    <P>I trust that each health board area will consider this suggestion and organise, even on a pilot basis, a scheme which would bring the message of success without drink into the classroom. As it is, one would think one cannot have fun or be successful without drink. Even the local authorities should have a role. The vocational education committees, the health boards, vintners, medical <Col N="68" /> practitioners and voluntary groups are all represented in any council grouping. Perhaps an SPC for social development with an element of role modelling might be a good idea. Perhaps the Minister would take up this with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. I would like to hear his reaction to these ideas.</P>
    <P>One reason I continue to speak on the issue of under age drinking, here in the House and at local level, is that it needs to be highlighted. It needs to be brought out into the open and addressed. I spoke in the House in March on specific major incidents that occurred in my area. Numerous minor incidents occur on a weekly basis all over the country. I have stressed the need for community fora on the topic. At present there is still a reluctance to tackle the problem head on. I am glad that as a result of raising the major incidents in my area we now have an assurance that the bus companies and the Garda Síochána will interact and co-operate more in the future. This a very positive step. By raising the issue we have secured a police van for the peninsula, a long overdue requirement which is very welcome. I trust the Minister will respond to my other concerns on supplying basic equipment, which I recently raised with him personally and in the House.</P>
    <P>In raising the issue we awaken an awareness in our Border regions of the need for cross-Border co-operation in the context of the need for gardaí and for co-ordination of the legislative framework. This is necessary in the context of the social reality of the proximity of Derry as a shopping location for many Donegal people and the reality of Donegal as a social location for many of the people of Derry. Curbs on the availability of alcohol for underage people must be co-ordinated between Donegal and Derry. In the context of the Executive in the North being reformed, I ask the Minister to take up with the appropriate Minister in the North the issue of co-ordinating an approach to the accessibility of alcohol, because it impinges on Donegal if it is freely available in Derry and <i>vice versa</i>.</P>
    <P>This issue will not and cannot be resolved by one individual or one sector of society. Until people accept that there is a problem, there will not be a real effort to work through the difficulties. Under age drinking must be tackled by parents, teachers and the general community, working with the Garda Síochána and other State agencies, including the health boards.The tendency is to blame the other party rather than accept we all have a role in dealing with the effects of affluence on our young people. We examined the issue of cigarette advertising in the Committee on Health and Children. There is a move to ban such advertising. In almost every TV soap the pub is the centre of activity. We see the glorification of drink in advertisements and it is also tied into many sporting events. What is the position with regard to advertising?</P>
    <P>A culture takes time to develop but once estab<Col N="69" /> lished is difficult to break. It is important that where small problems exist action is taken before a major problem develops. In some towns the number of young people who openly flout the law may be as low as three or four but if they are not challenged that number increases as peer pressure kicks in and the message of tolerance is put out. Alongside this tolerance there may be a number of minor incidents of vandalism, for example, litter, broken glass and empty bottles and cans, which has implications for the local public and tourists alike, and other forms of anti-social behaviour. Over a short period this can escalate to major incidents of disorder.</P>
    <P>Up to now the legal anomaly of &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo; made it almost impossible for the Garda to obtain successful convictions against those selling drink to minors. I am glad the Minister has stated that defence is to be removed in response to requests from the Garda, parents' groups, youth organisations and others and that this tough provision will, when the law is enacted, be followed &ldquo;by the most extensive and determined crackdown ever on the sale of alcohol to minors in all areas of the State&rdquo;. Those who take their responsibilities seriously have nothing to fear by the removal of this defence.</P>
    <P>I have listened to those who would like to see the mandatory introduction of an ID card. This should be considered seriously. I recently tabled a question to the Minister on this issue. While there was an uptake of 423 cards in Donegal, which is a higher ratio than many other counties, there is no doubt that with the co-operation of parents, students, gardaí and licence holders, students could be encouraged to use the ID and accept with good grace that they will be asked for it in licensed premises. It should be issued free of charge on the presentation of proof of age at a Garda station. It would be much better to develop one acceptable ID card rather than open up the possibility of having counterfeit IDs. When one examines the detail of the uptake and looks at the Minister's county where only seven cards have been sought, the issue of payment for ID cards should be reconsidered. An ID should be given to every individual at birth which could be used for the purposes of PRSI, social welfare benefits, and so on. It would be a smart card and would contain the person's details including proof of age. The number of people who have taken up cards in Mayo is 637, the number in Dublin is 648, in Galway it is 582 and in Cork it is 563. In Tipperary, the number is 851. If there was not a £5 charge the uptake would be greater. A young person between the ages of 16 and 18 can get a free card to prove his or her age for the purposes of travelling on Bus Éireann. If it can be done for that purpose, surely it should be done in this case.</P>
    <P>A big factor is that a significant number of adults are prepared to buy alcohol for minors. This occurs not only in pubs but in off-licences. I am glad the threat of closure extends to off-licences. There is need for the onus of responsibility to be placed on such adults. Is there a pen<Col N="70" /> alty under this or the Children's Bill for such offending adults? Should supermarkets be allowed to sell beer bearing in mind that it is a popular commodity with both nationals and visitors, that wine is already sold there and that those caught serving any alcohol to minors will be treated in the same way as fully licensed premises? I would appreciate the Minister's views on that.</P>
    <P>The Minister should persist with enforcement. Garda visibility is very important. I have been told not to try to have bye-laws introduced as they are impossible to enforce. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, could help by giving us plenty of sporting facilities so that, instead of going to pubs, we could offer an alternative to young people. There are many other issues I would like to raise but time does not permit me. I appreciate the great effort the Minister has made and I wish him and the Bill well in its passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Deenihan.</P>
      <P>I have mixed feelings about the legislation. From a commercial aspect, in the area of licensing we are making at best very minor changes and as regards the three different versions of closing time we are going in reverse. Much more must be done through this legislation and by the Minister for Health and Children to deal with excessive and under age drinking.</P>
      <P>I was interested in the comments of Deputy Keaveney who served with me on the Committee on Health and Children. She proposed, and I supported her, that that committee should examine in detail the issue of under age drinking. It is an acute problem and is experienced not only in large urban areas but in every small town and village. Alcohol abuse stems from a mystique that has been built up around alcohol and the drinks industry through the years. I wonder if our relatively restrictive regime of pub licensing and closing hours add to rather than help solve the problem. In other countries in Europe there is a more liberal regime of pub licensing and there is not the same bravado and mystique surrounding the drinks industry and alcohol consumption. The problem of excessive drinking, alcoholism and under age drinking in is not as acute in those countries. All our efforts through the years to regulate and bring discipline into alcohol consumption have added to rather than solved the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak as almost a non-drinker if there is such a thing, in politics we tend to stretch our terminology. Any politician who holds weekly clinics and attends constituency meetings will be in a pub almost every night and can see the problems at first hand. What the Minister is doing as regards under age drinking is a step in the right direction. While I welcome his proposals, much more needs to be done to tackle the culture of under age and excessive drinking. Many people hold the idea that without excessive drinking life <Col N="71" /> cannot be enjoyed. That simplistic and very wrong argument must be knocked on the head with the same degree of advertising power, revenue and resources as is used to promote the sale of alcohol.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, indicated he proposed to deal with the problem of tobacco by prohibiting advertising, sponsorship and so on. Something similar must be done in respect of alcohol. The statistics speak for themselves. Sadly, the number of people suffering as a direct consequence of alcohol abuse is growing. Notwithstanding that, the Minister has got the question of closing hours entirely wrong. The fact that we will now have three different closing times in a week is bizarre and would be amusing except that it will cause problems. I am sure the Minister has presented a rational explanation but I can see no sense in having three closing times. Some people have said that it will make us the laughing stock of Europe and, while we can live with that, it will cause genuine problems for tourists as well as publicans. The Minister should re-examine the matter. I have not read in detail the report of the all-party committee, but I am quite sure it would not have made such a recommendation. I cannot see where the recommendation could have arisen. We have difficulty in operating the current two-tiered closing hours structure, but the new proposal, involving three closing times, is a step too far. I hope the Minister will be able to step back from it.</P>
    <P>The Minister's ideas in the Bill concerning the extension of licensing represent but a minor step in the right direction. During the debate in committee, something more dramatic was suggested than has been introduced. The previous system, whereby it was impossible to obtain a new licence in large urban centres, needed to be addressed. I concede the Minister has made an improvement in that regard, but the monopoly brought about in our licensing system needs to be addressed also because it is not dealt with in the Bill. In large urban centres a pub licence is literally a licence to print money. Revenue from licensed premises in smaller towns and villages is not comparable.</P>
    <P>In the coming months and years we will have to examine seriously the possibility of further extending the licensing system. I am amazed that no court has yet been asked to adjudicate on the legality of the licensing system. I find it difficult to explain to people who argue that the biggest drapery, grocery or supermarket can be opened with planning permission and no licence is required, yet we are sticking to a 1920s or 1930s approach to pub licensing. The Minister has made a small change which will be of benefit to people who want to transfer licences from smaller centres to larger towns. I welcome that but the debate on extending the licensing system has yet to be addressed fully by the Minister and his officials. A volume of assistance is available to the Minister arising from the report of the all-<Col N="72" /> party committee and he should consider it seriously.</P>
    <P>One or two issues have been brought to my attention by various interest groups in my constituency. I congratulate the Minister on removing the Sunday ban on occasional licences, which has been welcomed generally. I have received quite a number of representations on that matter over the past 12 months. I welcome the mature decision to end the holy hour on Sunday, which was not being observed in the vast majority of licensed premises. There is little point in having a law in force if it is not being observed.</P>
    <P>I have received a presentation from the Cork GAA clubs' lobby group, as I am sure all my colleagues have. The Cork GAA clubs are concerned about the legislation which they feel is a retrograde step. They are requesting that clubs should be allowed to hold local events in various licensed premises, as well as being allowed to advertise such events in the local media and serve intoxicating liquor at them. They also want the regulations governing admission to club premises to be relaxed. I read in a national newspaper today that this matter has been brought to the attention of the Taoiseach who, apparently, has responded sympathetically. I trust, therefore, that the Taoiseach will be discussing that matter with the Minister in the coming days. Perhaps the Minister can re-examine that situation. Fortunately, many sporting clubs and organisations are now in a position to have their own premises. We should be encouraging the use of such premises to ensure they become a greater focal point within local communities.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on what he has done, but we must be more realistic about pub licensing laws. The Bill is but a small step and in a sense it is something of a fudge. I take it the jury is out and that the Minister will be willing to reconsider that argument. To reiterate, I find the three different closing times quite bizarre and I suspect they will be totally unworkable. I heard Deputy O'Flynn commenting on the matter today. Earlier the Taoiseach commented on Monday morning absenteeism as one of the reasons for restrictions on Sunday night licensing hours, but the current restrictions have not worked in that regard. The more rules and regulations we have in place, the less they seem to work. Therefore, I hope the Minister will opt for one closing time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with previous speakers, I welcome the Bill. This debate affords us an opportunity to discuss the licensing laws and, in particular, alcohol abuse which is now rampant. As a fellow county man, I compliment the Minister on introducing more legislation. It should be recognised that the Minister spends more time in the House dealing with legislation than any other Minister, and he deserves to be complimented on that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there was something of a contradiction in the Minister's opening statement in which <Col N="73" /> he said of the Bill: &ldquo;It is, I believe, the most comprehensive single package of reform measures ever introduced to the Oireachtas on this particular issue&rdquo;. Yet, on page two of his speech the Minister said: &ldquo;I recognise that more remains to be done and for this reason I will shortly establish a commission on licensing&rdquo;. However, if the legislation was comprehensive there would be no need for a commission on licensing. It is unfortunate the Minister did not go all the way when the Bill was being drafted.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Vintners' Federation of Ireland on its lobbying prowess. With all other representatives in the House, I listened to the views of the federation. Over the years we have lobbied on the federation's behalf by sending on its proposals. On this issue, however, the vintners have certainly won out and their influence is obvious from the various sections of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I notice that the commission will examine the nature of the off-licence and other forms of licence, and will seek to establish what premises might benefit from licences and how such premises might be licensed. The work of the proposed commission is an important aspect of this debate.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister of a small group of golf clubs called the &ldquo;Nines of Kerry&rdquo;. There are some of them in the Minister's constituency. They believe they will not be able to survive unless they can sell alcohol and are allowed to operate restaurants and so on like any other club. They have made a submission to the Minister and I ask to him before Report Stage is completed, to consider their appeal for a more liberal approach to their application for a change in the licensing laws.</P>
    <P>I read with interest Deputy Higgins's contribution last week in which he made a strong statement on the issue of changing the licensing laws in isolation without addressing the wider agenda of the social consequences of alcohol abuse. He said it was absurd not to do both in conjunction with each other. As Deputy Higgins said, the consequences of alcohol abuse are obvious right across our society. They are represented by broken homes and marriages, failed careers and so on. Alcohol abuse destroys the health of young people and can lead to unwanted under age pregnancies which totally change the focus of young people in regard to their future careers and restricts them in many instances. That issue should have been addressed to some extent in the Bill, for instance by introducing an identity card system, but the Bill narrowly focuses on changing the closing times.</P>
    <P>The opening times proposed will give rise to confusion. I know there is a good reason for having people out of the pubs earlier on Sunday night, but the Minister should try to standardise the times. There will be total confusion as regards St. Patrick's Day, Christmas Eve and other days. No doubt other speakers mentioned that problem. Will the Minister do something about it because I envisage publicans using confusion as an excuse when they are visited by a member of <Col N="74" /> the Garda Síochána? Perhaps the Minister might explain when replying the reason he decided on these time schedules?</P>
    <P>Other speakers will probably refer to the need for a broader policy as regards the health education aspect of alcohol abuse. Some years ago I was involved in a public meeting on drug and alcohol abuse and the document I used was the national alcohol policy. One of the principal aims of that document was to influence people's attitudes and habits so that for those who choose to drink, moderate drinking becomes personally and socially acceptable and favoured in the Irish culture. The policy document recommended a range of initiatives aimed at increasing knowledge of the health effects of alcohol and increasing awareness of sensible drinking and so on. That is not reflected in the Bill before us and I ask the Minister to refer to that when replying.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not refer to health education, which I have mentioned many times in this House. Young people need to be educated in this area because they are being bombarded with various messages from the television and in cinemas regarding the positive aspects of alcohol. It is claimed it will boost their social life, even their athleticism. People will have to be told the truth about the damage alcohol can cause to the body, health and mind and the diseases it can cause. Those effects will have to be spelled out clearly as were the effects of smoking in the anti-smoking campaign. A recent survey by the National Youth Council indicated that approximately 81% of people between the ages of 15 and 24 drink alcohol.</P>
    <P>I received a submission from a local supermarket owner, which I will forward to the Minister, who is very concerned about the effects of the Bill. He points out &ndash; perhaps the Minister might refer to this when replying &ndash; that as far as the EU is concerned, wine and beer are similar products and that it seems ridiculous that he can sell wine but not beer even though wine has a much higher alcohol content than beer. He went on to say that he understood this was in breach of EU competition laws and that it would be grossly unjust to ignore his sector. I am grateful for the opportunity to raise these points with the Minister this afternoon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>At a time when transparency seems to be the order of the day, I acknowledge that I am the holder of a licence so I have a vested interest in the matter we are discussing today. There are very few people who do not have an interest in the Bill. This is an issue that has been widely discussed. The Minister paid tribute to the sub-committee of the Oireachtas joint committee which dealt with this issue and undertook a major study on the licensing laws. He acknowledged the contribution that committee made, and the foundation it laid in terms of this Bill, and accepted many of its recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no denying that pubs play an important part in Irish life. Some would argue <Col N="75" /> they play too big a part. Many of the contributions made in this House are spoken about in pubs and people give their own views on the way politicians perform. No doubt we have given them plenty of ammunition in recent weeks in particular. Post-mortems take place on a regular basis in pubs on football matches and on sport in general and the later the hour, the more definite people are about the way matches were won and lost. That will always be the case.</P>
    <P>Despite all the debate on changing the licensing laws, there was never any possibility of reaching a real consensus on the matter. The Minister consulted a number of groups, accepted their proposals and tried to facilitate the different views on this issue, but he had a difficult job in trying to provide a new Bill. Listening to many of the speakers, I believe the Minister has reached a reasonable compromise. Even his worst critics would accept that.</P>
    <P>Alcohol is portrayed on television and in the papers as a wonderful product which gives people a little boost and makes them feel good. The drinks industry spends millions of pounds promoting its product, and that is understandable. Anyone who is producing a product will do the same. The majority of people who enjoy drink do so in moderation but, unfortunately, many people do not have the same control. They drink to excess and major difficulties follow as a result.</P>
    <P>The majority of people, particularly couples, only drink at weekends. They are not in a position to go out drinking because they have mortgages to pay, education costs, etc. They are quite happy to go for a few social drinks with friends and then go home. Unfortunately, throughout Ireland there are people who become addicted to drink. As Deputy Deenihan said, this has serious consequences. Unfortunately, the persons involved not only damage themselves but family members also suffer. They may neglect parental duties and their work may suffer with careers going down the drain. Young people with sporting potential often fail to reach it because of over-indulgence in alcohol. I do not want to give the impression that by introducing this Bill we are promoting the consumption of alcohol. Unfortunately, a number of people cannot handle it and this causes serious difficulties.</P>
    <P>One person who has done tremendous work in this area is Sr. Consilio, who set up a number of units throughout the country to deal with alcoholics. She probably meets people when they feel at rock bottom, with low self-esteem and in some cases when their families have had enough and disowned them. She has been successful in dealing with alcoholics who must first accept their problem and be willing to change their ways. Sr. Consilio has been successful in helping alcoholics restore their dignity and begin leading normal lives again. The necessity for the Government to fund sport was mentioned earlier. It is important that work such as that carried out by Sr. Consilio and others is also funded properly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="76" /> Despite the abuse of alcohol, our licensing laws needed to be reformed. I am glad the Minister has introduced new measures. The introduction of this Bill was important because of major changes in work practices, the amount of spare time people have and the times at which they socialise. The main features of this Bill are the extension in hours of trading, the new licensing arrangements and removal of barriers to entry to the trade, the new measures for the restaurant sector, the major changes to deal with under-age drinking and the measures dealing with registered clubs, greyhound tracks and racecourses, which are to be welcomed. There are many greyhound tracks and racecourses around the country which have spent thousands of pounds providing new facilities and upgrading existing ones and for the majority of the year they are unused. They are wonderful assets and it is important they are used as much as possible. The measures taken by the Minister will achieve that.</P>
    <P>Section 15 deals with the issuing, upgrading and transfer of licences. I am concerned about some of these provisions and perhaps the Minister will clarify them. Sometimes Bills can be difficult to read but as I understand it, section 15 provides that no suitable commercial premises which previously held a wine on-licence can apply for a new licence. I do not think the Minister intended this to be the case and perhaps he will explain how he will deal with this, or perhaps he will clarify the matter for me.</P>
    <P>Regarding grounds of objection, section 15(1)(<i>c</i>) refers to unsuitability for the needs of persons residing in the neighbourhood. One of my constituents wishes to establish a new public house in a suitable premises which was recently granted public house planning permission. These premises are situated in an extensive office and light industrial development park with no residents to be catered for as there is no residential population within a half a mile of the site. The demand and service relates to a working population of approximately 8,000 people. Is it intended that a new public house or off-licence should not be granted in such circumstances or that it should relate solely to the residential population to the exclusion of the working population? An amendment needs to be introduced to facilitate the working population. I would like the Minister to explain the thinking behind this provision.</P>
    <P>Many Members have spoken about under age drinking and have supported what the Minister has done in this regard. They mean well and it is popular to congratulate the Minister. Any sensible person knows about the major under age drinking problem throughout the country. However, it can be a difficult matter for a publican to deal with. As we grow older it becomes more difficult to judge people's ages and the absence of a national identity card makes it more difficult. I know of cases where people have false identification but one would put one's shirt on a bet that they were over 18. It is becoming very <Col N="77" /> difficult to judge whether a person is under or over 18. Listening to some of the contributions, one would think publicans are encouraging under age drinking. The last thing the vast majority of publicans want on their premises is under age drinking because it turns adult drinkers off to see under age drinkers in a pub.</P>
    <P>I realise it is a problem to which there are not any easy solutions. The Minister's proposals are too severe. Temporary closures should be left to the discretion of the court, certainly for the first offence. A publican could innocently serve a 17 year old a drink and he would then have to close his premises for one week. The measure is too severe as, apart from the cost, there is also the embarrassment of having to put a notice on the door that the pub is closed because the publican served an under age person, even though it might not have been intended. I appeal to the Minister to look at this again. If a publican has committed more than one or two offences, he should be punished severely. We cannot condone under age drinking. However, it is difficult to judge the age of a person even if there are security personnel on the door. Given the availability of false identification, it is difficult to monitor people and ensure everyone on the premises is aged 18 years or over.</P>
    <P>The proposal to allow holders of a wine retailer's on-licence to sell beer with a meal will lead to spirits being sold which in turn will lead to an increase in the number of outlets selling alcohol. This is a fair assessment of the situation. A number of publicans have expressed genuine concern about this. Reading the newspapers this morning, one would think publicans are rolling in money with a huge mark-up on what they are selling. The majority of pubs, like many shops, are just surviving. Many of the big pubs are doing exceptionally well. However, it is just a job for most publicans, which gives them nothing more than an income. They are just surviving. Most publicans have made a major investment in their property, which it is important to protect. I know this is not the Minister's intention but if we allow the Bill to pass as it stands, it could facilitate the opening of a large number of drinking outlets throughout the country. The Minister does not want that and we should not allow it to happen.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in the House last week at the beginning of Second Stage that &ldquo;section 29 repeals section 8 of the Intoxicating Liquor (General) Act, 1924, which requires that all sales of alcohol in an on-licence must be for &lsquo;ready cash'&rdquo;. Deputy Dukes commented on that earlier, which reminded me of an embarrassing moment I had in the Curragh recently when I met with a number of Army spouses to deal with a matter relating to the hospital in the Curragh. When the meeting was over I kindly invited a number of them back to the local mess for a few drinks. I decided to order them a drink, but just as I took the last drink off the counter I realised I had no money in my pocket. Fortunately, the general secretary of PDFORRA was there and <Col N="78" /> asked me what I would have. He thought I was joking when I asked him for £20 but he gave it to me. The money was not in a brown envelope and was repaid. I was reminded of that incident when I heard Deputy Dukes speaking earlier.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers criticised what the Minister has done in relation to trading hours. However, when one looks at it objectively, the Minister's proposals make a lot of sense. There are three different closing times during the week. However, people are not ignorant or stupid and I do not think the hours will be the cause of confusion as some speakers have said they will be. It is important not to forget the unsociable hours worked by pub staff, who have to put up with a lot. Sometimes they meet people who are not in the best of form but they must always put a brave face on it and try to be nice to them, no matter what state they are in. I am quite happy with the Minister's proposals in that regard. Most socialising and drinking is done at weekends &ndash; the figures for absenteeism on Monday mornings show that. The Minister has made the necessary changes in regard to bank holiday weekends, which is desirable. I am quite happy with the opening hour changes he has proposed and he should leave well enough alone.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on engaging in widespread consultation on this matter, which was threatened for a long time. People talk about the necessity to bring in this law for tourists, although I do not see tourists drinking that much. These changes were badly needed by Irish people and the tourists can enjoy the extra opening hours like the rest of us. Reform of the licensing laws was badly needed and the Minister has reached a reasonable compromise on it. I outlined my concerns on some provisions in the Bill and I hope the Minister will take them on board. I look forward to his reply on those.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation will, I hope, announce the successful applications for lottery funding over the next couple of weeks. It is very important for us to show the people we are very concerned about sport and that we realise there must be a certain balance in people's lives. Many very good sports people also indulge in a little drop every now and then. We are trying to facilitate people as best we can. We are not encouraging people to drink, but we are making certain changes in the times they can go for a drink.</P>
    <P>We are also very conscious of the need to promote sport. Resources are much more available now than they have been for years. The Government has been very supportive of sport in general, for which we have got some flak. We must defend and continue that support, despite the criticism we have received from some elements in the media. It is important to have a certain balance. Sport must be promoted and encouraged at all costs. Any money spent on sport is money well spent.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for introducing this Bill, which was extensively debated in the Seanad and <Col N="79" /> outside the Oireachtas. I would like him to introduce the few amendments I mentioned, to put the final polish on a good Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. While, as the Minister said, it has been a long time in gestation, it is rather timid in what it delivers. We heard a lot about new and relaxed continental style licensing laws, but they do not seem to have materialised. The Bill does not go nearly far enough towards contributing to the reduction of underage drinking. The issue and transfer of licences has been fudged completely and will probably be a disaster.</P>
      <P>I welcome, however, the changes in opening hours, as far as they go, although I do not think they go nearly far enough. I realise I probably have a fairly liberal attitude to adult drinking habits and I know others have very strongly and legitimately held views that longer opening hours would lead to an increased number of alcoholics and give them further opportunities to drink. However, I do not hold that view and I doubt its validity. If it were valid, the corollary would also be true and our restricted licensing laws would have resulted in lower levels of alcoholism here than in countries with less restrictive laws. However, I do not think anyone is claiming that for Ireland. I would go even further and suggest there may be a causal relationship between the high levels of alcoholism in Ireland and our restrictive licensing laws. In any event, the changes are fairly minimal and I do not think they will bring about any behavioural changes, for good or evil.</P>
      <P>I want to speak about Parts 3 and 4 of the Bill because I have very strong views on under age drinking and its effect on the mental, physical, social and psychological development of our children. As a citizen, never mind as a public representative, one would need to have one's head firmly buried in the sand not to see that underage drinking is rampant in society. It is not just the occasional transgression but is now the norm. It is not confined to cities or so-called disadvantaged areas but is happening right across society and the country. Any public representative will say that the single most reported cause of nuisance in urban areas is groups of youths gathering to drink in every open space, alley and laneway they can find.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main objection is not the nuisance, petty vandalism and so on that causes, although that is very annoying, but what it is doing to young children, particularly when they mix alcohol with so-called recreational drugs. These are lethal cocktails for young children, particularly for young, developing brains. I am not saying this can all be <Col N="80" /> solved by this Bill or by this Minister. As other Members said, this is a cultural and social problem and requires a complex response, but a chance to do something really meaningful has been lost. I welcome the penalties to be imposed on those who sell drink to under age children. The penalty cannot be high enough for someone who knowingly sells drink to a person who is under age, but &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; is the key. We have to give sellers of alcohol a way of knowing people's age and it is unfair to put the onus of proof on the sellers while not introducing a national identity card scheme. I have heard all the civil liberties arguments against identity cards, but those are not applicable any more. As society becomes more sophisticated, identity cards of one type or another are becoming indispensable. One literally cannot go out one's front door without a variety of cards &ndash; credit cards, cash cards, student cards, RSI cards and drug refund cards. One can go into any bank in the world and be identified by one's credit card. Why can the Government not introduce a single national identity card for everyone, if only to protect our children? If it achieved nothing else it would be worth that. The Minister should reconsider this. I know he has thought about it, but we should grasp the nettle now.</P>
    <P>Part 4 deals with the transfer of licences and it is here the Minister has balked completely. Given the 12% growth in the economy and more money and tourists in the country, there is an increased demand that merits the issue of additional licences. Surely consumer need should dictate the number of licences and not historical accidents. We should share those licences out among a hugely increased population. The Minister's decision to meet this demand by insisting on the permanent extinguishing of a full licence in order to open an off-licence is wrong. That reduces the overall supply of public licensed premises. Similarly, new entrants in the pub business can still only acquire a licence by buying one from an existing licence holder without reference to the consumer needs of the area. On the face of it, it may seem that removing the ban on the transfer of licences between urban and rural areas is something of a liberalisation, but such is the pent-up demand in urban areas that intense competition from hoteliers, publicans, supermarkets and off-licences has already pushed up prices and will effectively ensure that small newcomers cannot compete and will never be able to enter the market. It is worth remembering that the market in drink at the moment is one where lack of competition has resulted in inflation of 5.2% already this year, which is way above the average.</P>
    <P>There is no rationale I can think of for not issuing new licences in expanding areas. The reason this issue sends out a warning light to me is that I have considerable experience of the Dublin taxi industry. When the State artificially curtails supply while demand is expanding, the only possible result is an explosive market for licences. That is precisely the mistake that was made in the taxi <Col N="81" /> industry and the result will be the same here, where the value of the licence increases to the point where the capital value becomes much more important than the purpose for which the licence was issued in the first place. I am not suggesting this industry should not be regulated; it should be rigorously regulated, with clear criteria for the issue of licences.</P>
    <P>However, under this Bill the main criterion is the ability to pay an exorbitant licence cost. There can be no rationale for anti-competitive arrangements whereby people have to travel further for a drink and then pay more when they have one. It is clear that that has happened in Dublin in the past. There is no justification for the State erecting barriers to entry into this industry and not into others, particularly barriers that are purely financial, such as in this case. I read in the newspapers that this section was drawn up in response to the powerful publicans' lobby. I do not know if that is true, but this measure is not in their long-term interests. I doubt any Dublin taxi drivers still think it was a good idea to curtail supply and force up the price of taxi licences. In an expanding market such an anti-competitive practice cannot really survive the pressure that will result, as happened in the taxi market. If the Minister persists with this he will end up where the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, has ended up &ndash; in court, with no improvement in the situation and digging a bigger hole than the one he started with. When a Minister goes the route of protecting one group to the detriment of other, competing groups &ndash; particularly to the detriment of the consumer, as in this case &ndash; he or she will rue the day. I know a commission is being set up and that the Minister has said this is not the end of the matter, but if we are to tackle this issue we should do so now, before a false market for licences emerges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. The Minister has listened to the main lobby groups and consulted many others, including, I presume, Deputy Healy-Rae, who was very vocal on these issues before becoming a Member. The Bill has been a long time in gestation and I welcome the changes regarding the mistakes made by the Minister relating to the millennium when he first introduced the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The holy hour was no longer a reality anyway and the change there is a step in the right direction, as there is no sense in one group being able to serve drink through that period when others cannot. The late opening hours do not cause me a major problem as, in many rural areas those hours operated in reality. It reminds me of the story of the person asking when pubs closed in a certain town. The answer was: &ldquo;Sometime in September.&rdquo;  It is a matter of the local gardaí implementing the new rules and I hope they do so in an even-handed way all around the country. The extra opening hours will cause some prob<Col N="82" /> lems, with staff in small, family-owned units coming under pressure.</P>
    <P>However, the opening hours cannot be dealt with in isolation. There has been much talk recently about the damage and deaths caused by hard drugs, but drink also has wrecked many homes and marriages in addition to causing death through road accidents. One need only visit the casualty unit of any hospital at the weekend to see the results of road traffic accidents as well those of street or domestic violence, to see that drink is a huge problem. In Monaghan General Hospital those casualties must be put into the wards and they cause major problems for the elderly and others who must put up with these intrusions in the middle of the night.</P>
    <P>The need for identity cards has already been mentioned and it is unbelievable that a provision dealing with this has not been included in the Bill. The Minister should introduce such a provision now, if possible. The vintners lobbied for many changes and they hoped an identity card scheme would be introduced. As Deputy Mitchell said, most young people have cards of various types, such as credit cards and RSI cards, and it is hard to understand that we cannot provide proper identity cards in this day and age. In America, people have identity cards and a barman can establish if someone is 18 and whether he can be allowed to drink on the premises. That will not stop people from getting drink outside the premises, but we must make every effort.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the failure of the Government and the Minister for Public Enterprise to fully and adequately convey to potential Eircom share purchasers the likelihood that KPN and Telia &ndash; Comsource &ndash; would sell their shareholding at the earliest possible date, in view of the reluctance of the Government to allow them to increase their shareholding beyond 35%, and the lack of transparency of the views of Eircom management as to the real value of the shares at the time of the IPO, which may result in significant losses for many individual shareholders who were not aware of these factors at the time of their purchase.</P>

      <P>As there are 488,000 shareholders in Eircom, it is only to be expected that Members <Col N="83" /> of the House involved in this debate and intending to vote on it tomorrow night would also be shareholders. Today, therefore, the assistant whip of the Fine Gael Party wrote to the chairperson of the Committee on Members' Interests, Deputy Killeen, on the advice of the Clerk of the Dáil. The ruling is that under section 7 of the Ethics in Public Office Act, there is no obligation on any Member to declare other than what they have already declared if they have a shareholding in excess of £10,000 in Eircom but that Members are free to do so. The committee also did not believe that this debate would have any effect on the Eircom share price, which is significant. However, in the interests of proper order, neither I nor my wife or children have shares in Eircom.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this debate is to seek answers to crucial questions about the completeness of the information given at the time of flotation to potential Eircom shareholders. I believe there was a lack of complete information in two areas. The first is the decision of KPN and Telia that they would, as opposed to could, sell their shares in Eircom at the earliest possible date, resulting in an overhang on the market of 776 million shares for sale. This is the principal reason the price of the shares has been depressed in recent months.</P>
      <P>The second issue is the statement last week by Mr. Alfie Kane that it was known within Eircom that the Government's share price was 30% above prevailing telecom values. The exact words of Mr. Kane last Wednesday morning during the &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme to Geraldine Harney were:</P>
      <P>I believe it is now widely accepted that it was priced too high at the time, a 30% premium to our peer group in the telecom sector. That was a decision made by the Government based on the advisers' input and not a decision made by the company.</P>
      <P>I will deal first with the Comsource situation. Of immediate interest is the mini prospectus. Pages 26 and 27 deal with Comsource and outline the history of how KPN and Telia, a Dutch company and a Swedish company, came together in 1996 through Comsource to acquire 35% of Eircom. KPN had 21% and Telia held 14%. There is an explanation of how the merger of Telia and Telenor AS took place and, because Telenor AS had a stake in Esat, there was a regulatory reason that company would have to exit. I have no quibble with the fact that Telia was always likely to get out for regulatory reasons. As it happens, Esat has been acquired by another company and Telenor AS has sold its stake in the company.</P>
      <P>The relevant paragraph on page 27 of the prospectus states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comsource, KPN Telecom and Telia have agreed not to sell any of their shares for a period of 6 months from the completion of the offers, but will be free to sell their shares there<Col N="84" /> after by way of a stock market offering or otherwise. In addition, each of Comsource, KPN Telecom and Telia have agreed not to acquire any additional shares for a period of 18 months from the completion of the offers, provided that KPN Telecom is not restricted from increasing its shareholding in the company to a level not exceeding 29.9%.</P>
    <P>Here was a clear suggestion that Telia was on the way out but that some of the Telia shares would be bought by KPN Telecom. The bombshell hit late last year when the public was told that KPN Telecom was going to leave Eircom. I went through my files and noted an article which I wrote for <i>The Irish Times</i> on 29 September 1999. I will quote briefly from it because the article reflects the prevailing attitude last September.</P>
    <P>It cannot be denied that this will come as a major shock to most observers, not least because the hype and spin at the time of the share sale clearly indicated that KPN was a long-term strategic stakeholder.</P>
    <P>In fact, the expectation was that the 14% stake owned by Telia would, at least in part, be bought up by KPN . . . it was intimated that KPN would buy up to 5.9% of Telia's stakeholding.</P>
    <P>From the point the legal right which KPN had to exit &ndash; I do not dispute that legal right &ndash; was exercised, a glut of shares was overhanging the market.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that in the negotiations that took place in the first half of last year, prior to the IPO, KPN and Telia put their cards on the table and sought a larger stake. They wanted to have the option of controlling the company. It is further suggested that the Department, for whatever reason, said no and from that moment KPN and Telia made it clear that they were short-term stockholders. Did the Minister and the Department know this? Was the reason for inserting the six month clause in the prospectus that these people were on the way out? If that is the case why was the public not told?</P>
    <P>I wrote to the freedom of information officer in the Department of Public Enterprise on 1 December last seeking various items of information, and I only received a reply today. It said that there is an inspection process. The letter, from Mr. Kevin Doyle, said: &ldquo;In view of the large number of freedom of information and other requests, it has been decided to open all files relating to the IPO process other than files or documents exempt from release under the FOI&rdquo;. When I sought a specific document, to which I will refer later, I was told it was ineligible because it was deemed financially sensitive.</P>
    <P>What were the circumstances whereby Comsource was refused a larger stake and whereby it decided to get out? If this was known in the Department and stitched into the six month rule, why was it not made known at the time?</P>
    <P>The second issue is Mr. Kane's remarks. In an <Col N="85" /> Adjournment debate last week the Minister said that the board agreed with the price range. She implied that she was not aware that Eircom was objecting to the share price. Last weekend, however, I read an interesting article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i>. It said that not only did Eircom have a view on the overpricing of the share, it hired consultants called ABN Amro to compile a report on it. The document I am asking the Minister to publish is the ABN Amro report on the valid price of the share which was commissioned by Eircom and submitted to the Department.</P>
    <P>When I asked for the document today under the Freedom of Information Act, I was denied it. The document states:</P>
    <P>the potential dangers of an overpriced offering are arguably to be found in the Tele Danmark case, where the share price struggled in the after-market and the perception of the company in the market suffered as a result. Applied to Telecom Éireann (now Eircom) there are, of course, similar dangers.</P>
    <P>Is that, as reported by <i>The Sunday Tribune</i>, in the ABN Amro document? Was this document brought to the attention of the Minister? Was it considered?</P>
    <P>This document appears to vindicate Mr. Kane's view, expressed last Wednesday, that not only did Eircom have concerns but it hired consultants who submitted a report which clearly specified them. The report in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> also states:</P>
    <P>Contrary to suggestions made last week [by the Minister] that Eircom had been involved in the setting of the price, the company was merely informed on the day of the announcement of the share price, that it had been set at 307p.</P>
    <P>There is a direct conflict between what Eircom and the Minister are saying and this needs to be clarified. I want the ABN Amro report published and the Comsource issue clarified fully.</P>
    <P>Let us consider what has happened. This is the first State IPO in this country. This is the first time all the State's shares were sold and that none was retained by the State. It was a retail process. The launch price was IR£3.07 or 3.90. The price at close of business last Friday was IR£2.40, down from IR£3.07, and 3.05, down from 3.90. There are 488,000 shareholders. This means that if one had £17,000 worth of shares and were to get out now, he or she would suffer a loss, including expenses, of approximately £4,000. Shareholders are also faced with the prospect that KPN will make a secondary offering of their shares at a 10% discount to the market price, with a further 5% discount to the institutions. Therefore, a 21% block of shares is overhanging the market and Telia is not selling yet, but may sell later. I put it to the Minister that novices, never having bought a share previously, will be very wary for any future IPO, whereas the bed and breakfast operators, as they are known in the trade, those who <Col N="86" /> bought large tranches of shares and got out quickly, the speculative investor, has actually gained. Those who were encouraged to put their nest egg aside for their long-term pension and future welfare, and their children's welfare, have lost most. Credit unions, banks and so on did a major media blitz and offered special loans to investors.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made great play of the fact that her advisers advised the Government on the price and that when you pay that kind of money, you take the advice. During the Minister's tenure of almost three years in the Department, she got very expensive advisers in relation to Aer Rianta, both Arthur Anderson and her own advisers. Atkins provided very expensive advise in relation to Luas and she readily put their report in the bin. Therefore, she has no difficulty asserting herself to the extent that she is not obligated to advisers. I would like the Minister to clarify how much Merrill Lynch International and AIB Capital Markets received. The original estimate was £40 million, of which £28 million was to be spent. We subsequently heard that £58 was expended. My information is that they had a vested interest in a higher price because the higher the Government windfall, the higher would be their fee. Their role is to underwrite the share because if they set the price too high, they could be left with the stock. However, in this case the share was over-subscribed, so there was no underwriting risk. Therefore, they had no reason but to set the highest possible price.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will comment on information which has come to hand that Merrill Lynch was involved with a Scandinavian telecom company and set a very low IPO price. This was a backlash against the flak they got in Finland. The Minister should clarify whether the advisers had a vested interest in extracting the highest price for their own financial gain. In addition, in order to maximise the return, Government greed took precedence over all else. These issues require absolute clarity.</P>
    <P>This issue was raised on the Adjournment debate last week and I term the Minister's response to date as flimflam answers. I do not mind personal abuse against me as I am able for that. However, there were two spins at the weekend which perturbed me. I have gone through the process of seeing Ron Bolger, Brian Thompson, Brian Joyce and Garry McCann come and go and I saw two hallmarks during the weekend. First, it was not the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, it was actually the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. I believe in the principle of collective responsibility. The Minister cannot say one year to pupils that it is great news, they all have a free day, and come along the next year and say, &ldquo;no, it is not me, sir&rdquo;. One cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>Second, I see all the hallmarks of a potential hatchet job being done on Mr. Kane in that his future is now in jeopardy. I ask the Minister to publish the ABN Amro report. That will clarify <Col N="87" /> whether Mr. Kane's remarks at the time of the IPO were the same as they were last Wednesday. I would like the Minister to inform us when KPN decided to get out, which caused this glut of shares, whether she and the Department had that information when the IPO was occurring and, if so, why they did not inform the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to support Deputy Yates's motion. Its timely introduction gives everyone an opportunity to outline their disgust at what has arisen as a result of the flotation of Eircom.</P>
      <P>The motion highlights the callous disregard of the Government for fewer than one million people, the majority of whom were small investors who were misled by the poor advice given at an early stage. The sad fact is that many of these small investors borrowed the finances to invest in these shares. Their situation today is very unhealthy in that they are caught between a rock and a hard place, although the advice in some of the media is to hold on, things will get better. The motion calls on the Minister for Public Enterprise to fully and adequately convey to potential Eircom share purchasers the likelihood that KPN and Telia &ndash; Comsource &ndash; would sell their shareholding at the earliest possible date. I believe the warning lights were in existence from the beginning but, unfortunately, many people did not heed them.</P>
      <P>When the flotation price of Eircom was set last July, it was decided that the company deserved a premium rating because Eircom was the largest operator in the fastest growing economy in Europe. I believe that was propaganda because it did not merit such a premium being put on the shares, particularly in the European context where all the big players were at the same time offloading shares on the European markets within their own countries. By August the tide had turned and the fact that the advisers, Merrill Lynch International and AIB Capital Markets, had got it all wrong became obvious to investors. In ordinary circumstances, the flotation of shares would be of little, if any, interest to ordinary members of the public. However, in the case of the Eircom flotation, the public were cajoled or enticed by every means possible to buy the shares and become investors for the first time and they would have almost guaranteed profit at the end.</P>
      <P>Who could have refused such offers? The Minister led the promotion. The timing of the flotation was wrong and it is extraordinary the Minister ignored the advice of the Chief Executive of Eircom, Mr. Alfie Kane, that the company knew the flotation share price was over-valued by as much as 30%. The Government was fully aware of this advice when it agreed with the Minister's recommendation of the flotation price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terrible fall-out of this mess is that many small investors were lured into purchasing these shares by the advice given. These people, many of them elderly, invested their savings in the hope <Col N="88" /> of improving their meagre lifestyle and small savings. They have now lost very heavily in proportion to their investment. Is it true the advice on which the final flotation figure was based cost £28 million? Is the Minister continuing to keep these advisers on her payroll? It must be the most costly advice ever received by a Minister, which has led to major losses for many investors, both retail and institutional.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the greatest debacle of all time. The Minister was flying high 12 months ago telling people that the gold rush was on and that they should aim for the moon. An investment of £5,000 in Eircom last year was worth £4,200 last Wednesday and £4,050 by last Thursday. What about the poor pensioners and other people who borrowed money from the banks and credit unions to purchase shares? It was like picking the wrong horse in the 3.30 p.m. race in Leopardstown. Many a wrong tip is given by tipsters, and the Minister is the greatest tipster of all time in terms of giving the wrong advice at the wrong time.</P>
      <P>The Minister agreed to give the chief executive officer, Alfie Kane, £300,000 per year plus a bonus. She has led investors astray. She gave them the wrong advice and did not do her homework. She was carried away on a cloud nine atmosphere. Pious words butter no bread for the unfortunate people who today have no money in their pockets.</P>
      <P>Despite the so-called financial wizards who were giving the Minister and the Government advice the Minister made a mess of the flotation. She has lost the confidence of ordinary people, jeopardised the chances of future flotations and has led the people up the garden path. Nobody will listen to her advice in future.</P>
      <P>The share price was over-valued by more than 30%. I do not know who gave the Minister the incorrect information. Perhaps the higher the valuation the higher the percentage charge. The Minister bears responsibility for the current share price. Nobody will listen to the Minister if she tries to convince people to buy shares in future flotations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no shares in Eircom, so I have a smile on my face. However, I feel very sorry for the unfortunate people who were taken in by the Minister and Ray MacSharry, who led the promotion of the Eircom shares. Both owe a profuse apology to those who bought shares, for the manner in which they were mislead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debacle is very serious for a number of reasons. People who normally do not invest in shares were encouraged to take out their savings and families were encouraged to make investments for other family members. People borrowed money to buy shares. The flotation was hyped. The big day came and the Minister was there in all her grandeur. I understand Ray MacSharry was flown in at enormous expense. With blackboard in place and chalk in hand, the price <Col N="89" /> was fixed at 3.90 euros and a big line was drawn under it. Ray MacSharry is gone and we do not hear a word from him. The Minister is trying to shift blame.</P>
    <P>I pay a glowing tribute to the chief executive officer of Eircom, Mr. Alfie Kane, an Ulsterman. I am proud he is an Ulsterman as we tell it as it is &ndash; perhaps the rest of the country should take a leaf from our book. Ulster people have no hidden agendas &ndash; we tell it out straight. Alfie Kane had the courage, honesty and dignity to state things exactly and he has been beleaguered since. The Minister attacked him and told him to mind his own business. However, that is his business. The Minister is not minding her business. I do not wish to be hard on the Minister, but a major blunder was made and she should have the honesty and dignity to say <i>mea culpa</i>.</P>
    <P>Perhaps for the benefit of small investors who are not into the big world of stocks and shares the Minister will explain what she means when she says she paid £58 million &ndash; a fat lot of money &ndash; for the advice. This is equivalent to £118 for each shareholder. The Minister said she had to take that advice, but that is not true. She should have examined it and asked questions. The Minister is a common sense woman and she did not have to take the advice because she paid an enormous amount for it. She would not buy a wedding dress which did not fit and which was at an enormous price, just because she was advised to buy it. However, she accepted the wrong advice and paid an enormous amount of money for it. Now, unfortunate small investors are picking up the tab. I have heard many sad stories but will not relate them tonight as it would take too much time.</P>
    <P>It could have come right if the shares had been offered at the correct price, in line with the advice the Minister received from people in her Department and which she ignored &ndash; perhaps the Minister might clarify this. People were not seeking to make a vast fortune. Investments by and large were between £1,000 and £2,000 &ndash; not big money in the Minister's stakes, but a great deal of money for ordinary people. If things had worked out these people would have been encouraged to invest in Irish stocks and companies in future flotations. Now they tell me they will not get involved in future flotations; they say it is only for big people, the people of the nod and wink who are in the know. Deputy Sheehan spoke about people going to the races. There are people in the know and then small punters who pay for it all. As a former Deputy, Tom Fitzpatrick, used to say, it is the bookmakers who drive the big cars. He was perfectly right, and we know who is driving the big cars in terms of the Eircom flotation.</P>
    <P>Who benefited and where is the money? People want answers to these questions. The Minister did not explain what people were getting into and what the consequences would be. It was presented as being very straightforward. People bought a pig in a poke because when they offered <Col N="90" /> to take, for example, shares worth £1,000 they did not know the share price. That was wrong &ndash; prices must be advertised. There is a big hubbub about drink prices in today's newspapers. Drink prices have to be marked up, but the share prices were not marked up and people were not told how much each share would cost. People simply made a lump sum investment and were given an amount of shares. It is a sad situation and I advise the Minister, in the interests of decency and honesty, to come clean about the entire debacle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>When the flotation of Eircom was announced last year we were told that it was a team effort. The team was: in goal, the Minister for Public Enterprise; full back, Ray MacSharry, and in midfield, Alfie Kane, chief executive of Eircom. The trouble was that he thought he was Roy Keane. He was sent off last year when his mouth was closed. Where was he when the flotation was announced? Why did the Roy Keane of the team not tell the people that the share was overpriced by 30%? The forwards on the team were the advisers to the Government who were well paid. They remind me of Manchester United which is buying a French goalkeeper for £10 million. They received £28 million.</P>
      <P>The taxpayer has been ripped off on many occasions. As a man said to me the other day, is this another political donation to the Government? The people &ndash; the supporters &ndash; were told that they could not go wrong, that the share was a certainty. They saw the advertisements on television and in the newspapers and were assured that this was a winning team. Like the supporters of soccer, rugby and the GAA who always pay high prices for match tickets, they were ripped off by having to pay a high price for the share.</P>
      <P>Those who had a few pounds to invest last year in the hope that they would make enough money to educate their family down the road said to themselves that they had to believe the Government, Alfie Kane and the advisers to the Government who were being paid £28 million. While the Government, Eircom and the advisers gained, the losers were the people &ndash; the supporters. When the election is called &ndash; it is not too far away &ndash; and the representatives of the political parties knock on doors the people who invested £500 to £700 in Eircom will quickly spell it out, particularly to Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. They are very upset and annoyed at having been sold down the drain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was the worst team we ever put on the field. It has performed like no other. It is unbelievable that the ordinary people of this country have been hoodwinked again. It is bad enough that those on social welfare, pensioners and those who depend on the Government for health services are deprived, but the small investor in Eircom believed that the Government and those who were involved in the flotation were honest and honourable. As Deputy Sheehan said, shares purchased for £5,000 last year are now worth around £4,200. This is outrageous and a disgrace. <Col N="91" /> It is not good enough. I do not know which company advised the Government but it should give back some of the £28 million it received from the State to the Government and the investors to give them some return on their savings which they invested open and honestly.</P>
    <P>There will not be many more flotations. If there are they will not be undertaken under the Government because the people will not believe it. Aer Lingus and other State companies which will depend on flotation will be badly affected. One cods the supporters only once. This team has failed and we all know what happens to a team when it does not win trophies &ndash; one gets rid of the manager and players and brings in a new team. There is a need for fresh faces on the opposite side of the House. It is time the people had an opportunity to decide which team they want.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>We have probably just heard the new Minister for Economic Planning and Development. I agree fully with my colleagues and in particular our party spokesperson, Deputy Yates. The Minister has been very fortunate in the last week or two when the newspapers headlines focused on the trials and tribulations of her colleagues that the debacle surrounding the Eircom share issue has been covered more on the business pages than the front page of the national media. In coming weeks, however, as more and more people come to realise that they have suffered grave financial losses as a result of the share going into freefall there will be real anger which will be focused in the main on the Minister as the person who made the final political choice.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of Members were very supportive of the concept behind the flotation of Eircom, the development of a share owning society. Such a concept has worked very effectively throughout Europe and it was our hope that the Eircom flotation would be the first of many in which the ordinary person would invest modest sums in public companies floated from time to time. Sadly the golden goose promised by the Government and Eircom has turned out to be nothing more than a chicken coming home to roost. There are political and economic questions to answer. Not only has it become a financial disaster for hundreds of thousands of people but it has been a public relations disaster for the Government and Eircom. The possibility of generating interest of the same scale in the future sale of State assets has been reduced to an alarming extent. The people will not be fooled a second time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister who may have answers to the questions raised will be more constructive and realistic than in her glib statement last week about backing horses. It may have been a good quip but it was of scant consolation to the hundreds of thousands of people who took her advice last year and invested their hard earned money in a State asset or took out loans made available by <Col N="92" /> the banks and other financial institutions and are now counting their losses. If the Minister was brave enough to own up to rather than dismiss the problem as being akin to a horse winning a race she would at least allow a rational and reasoned debate.</P>
    <P>This flotation was expected to be the first of many. We support the Minister in her efforts to encourage genuine public ownership of public companies but if this is step one we are starting from a very weak footing. As my colleagues said, those who advised the Minister have questions to answer but more than any other the Minister has always been brave enough to accept political responsibility for decisions made. She therefore has to answer the question of why she took their advice and ignored the alternative advice available and explain where we go from here. Those who have been burnt will not go to the well again.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be constructive and listen to the pleas from this side of the House. We are talking about the losses endured by thousands of people and need a better response than it is akin to backing a horse.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&ndash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;commends the Government and the Minister for Public Enterprise in respect of the successful flotation of Telecom Éireann (now re-named Eircom) in July, 1999;</P>
      <P>notes, the full disclosure of all matters relating to the shareholding in the Company held by the strategic partners (KPN and Telia) in the offer documentation sent to each potential shareholder;</P>
      <P>notes, in particular, the mini-prospectus statement that &ldquo;Comsource, KPN Telecom and Telia have agreed not to sell any of their shares for a period of 6 months from the completion of the offers, but will be free to sell their shares thereafter by way of a stock market offering or otherwise. In addition, each of Comsource, KPN Telecom and Telia have agreed not to acquire any additional shares for a period of 18 months from the completion of the offers, provided that KPN Telecom is not restricted from increasing its shareholding in the Company to a level not exceeding per cent&rdquo;;</P>
      <P>notes the Board of the Company's agreement in a transparent manner to the issue of a prospectus including a full price range in advance of the offer;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>notes the fact that the Eircom share price <Col N="93" /> equalled or exceeded the flotation price on all but 38 out of the 233 trading days since flotation.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I thank the Opposition for the measured way in which the matter was introduced. In particular, I thank Deputy John Bruton for the courtesy he and his personal assistant, Mark Kennelly, showed to the Secretary General of my Department. I was not in Ireland yesterday when queries were being made but the dealings were entirely cordial, courteous and constructive.</P>
    <P>I shoulder a considerable reluctance to trade words across this House about a private company listed on the Stock Exchange. However, it is obvious that the Opposition shows no such reluctance, and the net effect of attempting to stir controversy regarding the Eircom flotation may be to apply downward pressure on the share price. I wish to make clear to Deputies John Bruton and Yates that I have nothing to fear from this debate. However, it is another matter whether the marketplace will remain immune after the Opposition ventilates half-truths, innuendoes and mad-cap conspiracy theories.</P>
    <P>Eircom is a private company with hundreds of thousands of shareholders drawn from every walk of life. I doubt whether these shareholders will welcome their company name being dragged through the Dáil Chamber with its attendant dangers. It may provide a quick, opportunistic headline for Fine Gael but at what cost to the company and its shareholders?</P>
    <P>Being in Opposition has its responsibilities, part of which is to look at the broader picture. Deputies John Bruton and Yates have opted for the cheap headline &ndash; and it may be a cheap headline in more ways than one. When the dust finally settles on this issue, I hope both Deputies will believe it worthwhile but I doubt the company's shareholders will adopt a similar view.</P>
    <P>The debate so far has been measured but I appeal to colleagues in the House to exercise great prudence in refraining from saying anything under privilege which might give rise to erroneous investor perceptions of Eircom. No person in any country can make a commitment that the shares of a floated company will never drop in price. I did not make any such commitment. How could I, as it would be patently nonsensical. Even if I wished to do so, I would have been prevented by the strict laws concerning the listing of companies on the Irish and international Stock Exchanges.</P>
    <P>The Opposition's motion seeks to censure me and the Government on three basic grounds relating to the Eircom flotation, first, that the offer documentation failed to make full disclosure of the position of the strategic partners, second, that the partners may wish to sell their shareholding in the company because of their inability to purchase a stake of more than 35% of the company for a period of 18 months following the flotation and, third, that the Government failed to give transparency to the views of Eircom <Col N="94" /> management as to the value of the shares at the time of the IPO.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with these matters of detail, I wish to deal with some important issues of principle. Deputies will be aware that I am always happy to come to the House to debate issues and to share information on matters for which I have direct political responsibility. I have never shirked that responsibility. Eircom has been in private ownership for almost a year and I have no responsibility for its commercial operations or its capital structure. Deputies will also know that in the 11 months since its flotation, the share price has traded at or above its flotation price on all but 38 of 233 trading days.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that this debate is not taking place on one of the 195 out of 233 trading days that the Eircom share has traded at or above flotation price. That is because the motion has little to do with the flotation process but is an opportunistic exercise driven by current weakness in the share price 11 months after the offering. The motion is driven by the absurd logic that the Government and I are somehow responsible for current share price weakness, or that we could have reasonably foreseen it taking place and failed to warn potential shareholders of its likelihood. It is a motion nurtured in cloud-cuckoo land.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to find a single independent observer outside this House who can support this ludicrous proposition. The motion alleges that the offer documentation failed to make full disclosure of the position of the strategic partners. Sadly, the facts utterly fail to support this allegation. This position was made clear in the main prospectus and the mini-prospectus.</P>
    <P>The mini-prospectus was distributed to all of the 1.2 million people who registered an interest in purchasing shares. It stated:</P>
    <P>Comsource, KPN Telecom and Telia have agreed not to sell any of their shares for a period of 6 months from the completion of the Offers, but will be free to sell their Shares thereafter by way of a stock market offering or otherwise. In addition, each of Comsource, KPN Telecom and Telia have agreed not to acquire any additional Shares for a period of 18 months from the completion of the Offers, provided that KPN Telecom is not restricted from increasing its shareholding in the Company to a level not exceeding 29.9%.</P>
    <P>The offer documentation went beyond fully disclosing the position of the strategic partners. It also indicated the influence that decisions made by the strategic partners could have on share price developments. The offer documentation did so in the context of setting out fairly the risks associated with investment in the Eircom stock. The prospectus contained a chapter on risks which was flagged in the contents on page 2.</P>
    <P>The mini-prospectus also contains the following statement addressed to all potential investors <Col N="95" /> in the company under the heading &ldquo;Risks&rdquo; which states:</P>
    <P>You should carefully consider the risks described below and the information in the Prospectus before purchasing Shares. The value of your Shares may be adversely affected by general market conditions and/or the possibility of further stock market offerings of the Shares by, among others, KPN Telecom and Telia. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the Shares will trade in the stock market subsequent to the Offers at or above the price at which those Shares are sold in the Offers by the Ministers. In addition, if any of the risks summarised below actually occur, the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected and the trading price of its Shares could decline.</P>
    <P>The mini-prospectus goes on the set out the risks: increasing competition, which is happening; the entrance of a third mobile phone operator, which will happen; the company's changing regulatory environment, which will also happen; the consequences of the company failing to successfully implement its transformation programme; rapidly changing technologies; the possibility of a decline in the company's revenues, profitability and growth rate; a slowing of growth in the Irish telecommunications market; the fact that the company's investments in new business areas and markets could require substantial capital; the company's computer systems; the need to hire and retain skilled personnel; the fact that the company may be influenced by significant shareholders whose interests may not be aligned with those of shareholders; the possibility that an adverse decision in legal proceedings could require the company to pay damages or fines; the fact that the company is dependent on its continuing good relationship with its employees and their trade unions; and health risks, including those involving mobile telephones.</P>
    <P>This is a comprehensive and sober list of risk factors associated with investing in Eircom which demolishes the motion's argument regarding lack of disclosure by the selling shareholder. It must also be recognised that all publicity material issued in connection with the sale stated that share values could go down as well as up.</P>
    <P>The prospectus dealing with the sale of shares in Eircom was cleared by the New York, London and Dublin Stock Exchanges in advance of the issue of the document in mid June 1999. This involved an arduous process of clearance of texts lasting over a period of months. All of the exchanges involved have testing standards in terms of the representation of all material relevant to a company being floated.</P>
    <P>In relation to the second allegation contained in the motion, the decision of KPN to sell its stake is that company's decision alone. With that stake potentially about to come to the market, it would <Col N="96" /> be wrong to say anything that might be damaging to the interests of Eircom shareholders or to KPN at this time. KPN has stated publicly that its decision to sell has come about as a result of its strategy to focus more on mobile telecommunications and its need to fund this strategic shift. The only point I want to make at this stage is that there was little point in floating Eircom only to have an immediate takeover of that company in the aftermath of flotation.</P>
    <P>In relation to the third allegation contained in the motion, the prospectus and the price range, which was set prior to the flotation, were agreed by the Government and the company. The final price of £3.07 was within this price range. The prospectus, in its totality, is the responsibility of the board. The prospectus contained a price range and that price range was approved by the board.</P>
    <P>The balance sheet of the company at the time of the flotation was very strong. The price set by the Government for Eircom at the flotation date was set on the basis of what the market was prepared to pay and based on the advice of expert advisers.</P>
    <P>The pricing of the shares in July 1999 involved balancing the need for a fair price for taxpayers and the need for a fair return for retail and institutional investors. Criticism was expressed in the immediate aftermath of the flotation from certain quarters that the price of Eircom shares was set too low by the Government. In particular, it is worth remembering that the institutional offer was no fewer than 16 times over-subscribed, even at the top of the price range.</P>
    <P>The views of those commentators, many of whom are the most respected and reputable journalists in the State, is best expressed by a quotation from the press immediately after flotation, &ldquo;the obligation of the State as owner &ndash; since the State is the guardian of the public finances &ndash; was to sell Telecom at the highest price the market would bear.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Government could have chosen to float the company at a higher price than it did, but it chose not to do so. It received advice from one of the joint global co-ordinators to the offering, Merrill Lynch, to float the shares at £3.27. Merrill Lynch has since been appointed advisers by Eircom and is now advising it.</P>
    <P>As the House knows, the launch price was £3.07. In the immediate aftermath of the flotation the shares rose by 20%. The share has traded well above flotation price most of the time since the flotation. The share price has been below the issue price on only 38 days out of 233 days since the launch.</P>
    <P>One commentator, Colm Rapple, wrote after the flotation that the company was sold at 20% below its market value, which represents a loss of almost £700 million. Many commentators believed that the Government struck the right balance. An editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> declared &ldquo;The Government appears to have pitched the flotation price (£3.07) at precisely the right level: <Col N="97" /> anything less and it would have been vulnerable to the charge that the Company was being sold off too cheaply.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the first three months of this year, the share price was never below the issue price and it reached a high of £3.78 on a number of occasions in January, February and March 2000, a premium of 23% on the flotation price. I cannot tell people when to buy or sell shares, they are the masters and mistresses of that. I was not called to Dáil Éireann to speak about why the share price was 23% higher than the flotation price during the first three months of this year.</P>
    <P>The potential returns to Eircom investors have been available against the background of a market which, at best, has been sluggish or in decline since the flotation. It is worth remembering that sentiment in the stock markets has turned against European telecommunications stocks in recent months as high technology companies in general have suffered sharp share price declines. A leading European telecommunications index has fallen by 35% since 6 March. British Telecom, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom are currently 45%, 41% and 35%, respectively, of their share price highs in 2000.</P>
    <P>This motion is not about the fundamentals underlying the Eircom flotation. This debate could not have taken place on 195 of the 233 days since the shares were floated. The motion has been put forward without regard to the interest of the shareholders in the company. It seeks to use current market conditions for cynical ends.</P>
    <P>I wish to return to the question posed by Deputy Yates's mad-cap theory. He appears to believe the report compiled by merchant bankers, ABN Amro, for the company was suppressed in some way. This report suggested a lower flotation price. We did not commission this report, it was commissioned by Eircom.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It was commissioned by Alfie Kane. The Minister refused today to give me a copy of that report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy, even at his daftest. At the time, while not formally released, the report received widespread media coverage. Instead of pursuing breathlessly in Enid Blyton-type mode a Famous Five mystery, Deputy Yates would have been better employed extracting press cuttings from that period. If he did, he would discover the full scale of that coverage.</P>
      <P>Following a cursory look through the cuttings, I have been able to establish that <i>Business &amp; Finance, The Sunday Business Post, </i>the<i> Irish Independent </i>and <i>The Sunday Tribune </i>covered ABN Amro's concerns in the weeks leading up to the flotation. That is hardly the stuff of conspiracy and secret files.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Yates questioned me on ABN Amro's report, which he is entitled to do. As it was commissioned by Eircom, it is its property and it refused us the right to release it under the Free<Col N="98" /> dom of Information Act. I asked someone in the Department to telephone Eircom this afternoon to ask if we could release the report now, but Eircom said no, it is its property and it does not wish to release it. We cannot release the report as it is not ours.</P>
    <P>There are many forces at work behind a flotation. A company would like a low flotation price as it would not have to work as hard or justify fat share options later. I am playing this game with my two hands tied behind my back as I have received advice that temperance and prudence should inform what one would say on this.</P>
    <P>ABN Amro issued a report to Eircom in May, which was widely commented on in the newspapers to which I referred, and on 3 September it said Eircom shares, at £4.20, were undervalued. It said it retained a positive long-term stance in the company, but Eircom shares were undervalued at the price it quoted in September 1999. It advised people to purchase and to purchase again. One pays one's money and takes one's chance on the advice offered by economic commentators at a time.</P>
    <P>I have faith in Eircom, its workers and its future. That is not to say what any person should do in this regard. It would be good if Members re-enforced their faith in that company and I am proud to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh" hpid="Mr. Ardagh Mr. Ardagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people invested in Eircom shares. Some invested in them for a gamble and others invested for the long-term. Those who invested for a gamble had the opportunity to sell their shares and many of them did. Up to the end of October they had to sell at what was the best price if they took a particular route, but early this year they could dictate the price at which they wanted to sell their shares. For a considerable number of days at that time the price of the shares rose to 4.70 or 4.80. There was ample opportunity then for those who invested in the shares for a gamble to sell their shares and make more than 20% profit on their investment.</P>
      <P>One should look at the situation today. Today I did an analysis of the breakup value of Eircom, its essential ingredients and what the value would be. There is the mobile network, Eircell, the infrastructure, the fixed lines, ISDNs and the Internet with the ISPs and multi-media. Yesterday or the day before, France Telecom took over Orange and paid 6,741 per customer. In the last report Eircell had 1,049,000 customers. That places a value on Eircell alone at today's pricing of £5.57 billion. The New York Stock Exchange today had a market capitalisation on Eircom of $6.658 billion, which is, within £100,000, equivalent to the value of Eircell on its own. Eircom has 243,000 Internet customers. The sale value ranges from $2,120 to $6,167, the higher range being paid if they are customers of KOL or some other major company. The sale value of the minor ones is over $2,000 per customer, amounting to £430 million, which is well over the market capitalisation value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="99" /> That is not taking into account the 1.58 million customers on fixed line or the 152,000 ISDN customers. In fixed line I include all the exchanges throughout the country. If that was available at £2 billion &ndash; 40% of the total value of Eircell &ndash; I would go out of my way to get a consortium together to buy it. That would put Eircom valuation at £8 billion, with a breakup value of 4.80. That is not taking into account the astonishing growth in the telecommunications market here. The present price should not be considered as the maximum, a price at which people sell off shares they have kept in the longer term. From the values in the marketplace, the breakup value is a minimum of 4.80. Instead of valuing the infrastructure at £2 billion, some people would value it at £6 billion plus, which would add another 2.42 to the actual breakup value of Eircom. Even today the market has accepted the price. At the close of business in London this afternoon it was valued at 3.39, a significant increase from this morning at 3.07. This shows the fluctuations that can occur even in a stock of this nature.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why Eircom has been undersold by people in that company. The institutional investors own only 0.1% of the stock. What is going on? A share option will be put in place in September. The lower the value of the share the greater value it will be to the executives who get their share options. It would be cynical of me to think there would be a relationship between maintaining lower share prices and the share option scheme. One wonders about the underselling that is taking place. There is also the question of the institutional investors. Why do institutions not invest in Eircom? Normally they look at the overall company, the direction in which it is going and its management. If those fundamentals are sound they will invest in it. Obviously there is some fundamental which needs to be addressed and questioned.</P>
    <P>Certainly in this day and age, the confidence and ability of Eircom to develop and increase in value is huge and it must be allowed to realise that potential. This defensiveness of Eircom is unfortunate at a time when we need to develop our telecommunications system. We have lived through social exclusion and pockets of poverty, but the opportunity is here now for everyone to have access to the Internet, to delete the digital divide and not allow it come into place.</P>
    <P>In the past few days a glossy brochure from NTL was delivered to my house. It apologised for the work that would be carried out on the road because it was going to deliver fibre to my door so that I could get from it digital television, rapid Internet access and telephone lines. Why have I not got that type of letter from Eircom? Why is it taking Eircom so long to go onto the fibre route given that the company has resources? Eircom borrowings were £188 million at the last report. On a company that has a value of £6.6 billion market capitalisation, why has it not borrowed if it considers the share price is too low to do a <Col N="100" /> rights issue? Why has it not invested in putting fibre into place in every home in the country so that it gets to the market before companies such as NTL, owned by France Telecom which recently bought Orange? Why is Eircom lagging behind? That is an issue that needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>There is the question of unbundling the local loop. It is important if copper wires are going into every house they should be accessible at a price to any Telecom operator who is prepared to pay an economic price for them. There is no reason there should be a shut-out because that does not do this country any good. It prevents and stops progress. That is being done in such a way at times that people feel they are protecting Eircom. Eircom is not being protected. The greater the number of people using Telecom's facilities the better for Eircom. Eircom is the number one company here. The greater the market, the greater the potential for Eircom to capitalise on that market. I do not know whether it is stunting it or whether Eircom has any part in seeking not to unbundle the local loop but I would like to see that happening in the near future.</P>
    <P>The value of Eircom is about two and a half times the revenue. Young people going out to buy houses have to borrow up to four times their salary, although it is not desirable from a credit point of view. A company that is valued at two and a half times the revenue seems to be an undervalued company.</P>
    <P>Eircom is a great buy and has great value and great potential. I want to see Eircom, its management and its board of directors take some initiative and drive that company to its full potential.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the general principles of the initial public offering of shares in Telecom Éireann, published by the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, on 7 May 1999, section 1 is headed: &ldquo;Objectives of the Offer&rdquo;. Section 1 stated that the objectives of the flotation were to maximise the financial return to the Exchequer and to promote wider share ownership in the State. I understand that the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, came in with a price for the shares to the Irish retail investor which was between the Merrill Lynch higher price and the lower price of the Telecom Éireann advisers. Mr. Alfie Kane, chief executive of Éircom, suggested on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; on Wednesday of last week that the Telecom Éireann share price was <Col N="101" /> overvalued. Subhead E1 of the 1999 Estimates of the Department of Public Enterprise deals with the fees and expenses related to the sale of shares in Telecom Éireann. This shows an original Estimate of £40 million. However, by the end of the year, a Supplementary Estimate of £40 million was required. This brought the total requirement to £80 million.</P>
    <P>The factors giving rise to the requirement for an additional £40 million were stated as being that the value of the company increased significantly and so did the percentage fees to the global co-ordinators. A sum of £57.4 million was the estimated cost, including VAT, of Merrill Lynch International and AIB Capital Markets, and these were the joint global co-ordinators. The fact that those offering an interest increased significantly had a similar impact on the fees and this was a further reason put forward regarding the need for the Supplementary Estimate of £40 million. The final reason the Supplementary Estimate was required was that the level of interest in the initial public offering far surpassed expectations, and this had the impact of demand-led costs.</P>
    <P>There are differing views as to whether the Minister maximised the financial return to the Exchequer. I wish to leave this to one side for the moment and deal with the second objective of the flotation &ndash; to promote wider share ownership in the State. The basic question is whether the Minister has succeeded in relation to the second objective of the initial public offering of shares of Telecom Éireann. My recollection is that 1.2 million people registered an interest in buying shares and that finally there were half a million investors in the shares.</P>
    <P>There are very valuable lessons to be learned from what happened in the interim approximately 233 trading days. Borrowing to buy shares is not to be advised, particularly, when the loan is large in relation to the income of the borrower. There were those who borrowed against the background of selling early when they assessed that the share price had peaked. In general, these people have done well. Those who borrowed with no strategic plans to sell or hold their shares are presently suffering a loss. I do not intend to speculate as to the future value of Éircom shares in the short, medium or long-term. That is a matter for the experts on the Stock Exchange. What is sure is that stock market forecasting is just that. Unexpected events, national and international, can upset the apple cart. What is certainly clear to everyone at this stage is that there is no guaranteed return from buying or selling shares. Every investment is a gamble.</P>
    <P>The motion before us tonight condemns the failure of the Government and the Minister for Public Enterprise to fully and adequately convey to potential purchasers of Telecom Éireann shares the likelihood of KPN and Telia, or Comsource, would sell their share holdings at the earliest possible date in view of the reluctance of the Government to increase their shareholding to beyond 33%. This is an extremely serious alle<Col N="102" /> gation which implies that information critical to the future price of the shares was concealed from potential investors.</P>

      <P>The mini-prospectus which was forwarded on behalf of the Government to the 1.2 million who registered an interest in the Telecom Éireann flotation stated that Comsource, KPN and Telia, had agreed not to sell any of their shares for a period of six months from the completion of the offers but would be free to sell their shares thereafter by way of a stock market offering or otherwise. In addition, Comsource, KPN and Telia, had agreed not to acquire any additional shares for a period of 18 months from the completion of the offers, provided that KPN Telecom was not restricted from increasing shareholding in the company to a level not exceeding 29.9%.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates's allegation is a serious one. Evidence is required to show that the Minister was in possession of further relevant information in regard to the likelihood of KPN and Telia selling their shareholding in the short-term following the six-month period after the completion of the offers. The Minister has an obligation to disclose all relevant information of which she had definite knowledge.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael motion further condemns the lack of transparency of the view of Telecom Éireann management as to the real value of the shares at the time of the IPO. The motion goes on to state that both these issues may result in significant losses for many individual shareholders who were not aware of these factors at the time of their purchase. The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, is quoted as saying that the board of Telecom Éireann agreed on the flotation price of the company's shares before they were launched on the market last year. The Fine Gael motion makes the point that transparency was lacking in regard to the view of Telecom Éireann management.</P>
      <P>It is incumbent on the Minister for Public Enterprise to put in context and to provide full information regarding the view of Telecom Éireann's advisers regarding the share price for the IPO as well as the views of the board and management of Telecom Éireann. Let us clarify these issues once and for all and let Telecom Éireann, now Eircom, get on with its business as a privately-owned telecommunications company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are issues which we must reflect upon in the whole area of privatisation. The interests of our citizens collectively must be our first and foremost concern. As a modern and highly effective economy, we need to have the best possible communications system so that we can maximise economic growth and the creation of well-paid employment while providing the best quality system at the lowest possible price for domestic use. <Col N="103" /> The future direction of communications technology remains a matter for conjecture. We can only plan for the future on the basis of present knowledge. It is probably too early to have a definitive analysis on whether privatisation was in the national interest. In the year up to end March pre-tax profits rose by almost 18 per cent to £265 million but the 3,500 voluntary job losses have eroded the profits. The social consequences of the job losses are another negative that must be taken into account when considering the overall analysis. Whether the Minister for Public Enterprise maximised the return to the Exchequer is, to some extent, a matter of conjecture. Advice and consultancy costs amounted to £80 million. That is the figure we were given last year in the 1999 Estimates for her Department. This is a very large sum of money and there is need to analyse this expenditure to establish whether it represents value for money and what mistakes were made that could be avoided in the future.</P>
    <P>Another issue often lost sight of is the right of citizens to know what was done with the £4.7 million which the Exchequer received, less expenses, from the sale of Telecom. Privatisation can become a fashion rather than something that is in the overall national interest. The electorate, particularly those who bought shares in Telecom, are entitled to know what the money they invested, together with other money invested by private investors, has achieved.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear that Deputy Ardagh will receive digital television in the future. While there is a certain amount of knowledge regarding communications and information technology, what does the future hold? Where are we heading in terms of communications, broadcasting, the Internet and so on? There is a school of thought that says we will see a convergence of these means of communication and there will be one receiver for all these services. Deputy Ardagh said he was surprised Telecom Éireann did not do something similar but, at the end of the day, we are talking about two separate things. His colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, has effectively stalled Committee Stage of the broadcasting Bill. We are awaiting her position and the publication of new amendments.</P>
    <P>The reason digital television in the context of digital terrestrial television is not moving forward can be laid fairly and squarely at the feet of the Minister who is in conflict with RTE regarding ownership of the broadcasting infrastructure. NTL provides its signal by way of cable and MMDS in the main. Interestingly, I heard recently it has 600,000 customers which is approximately half of the potential market for digital television. It can be provided through cable and MMDS. Digital terrestrial is the signal that goes through the air and will be provided in the first instance to the four existing television stations though there will be extra stations provided to them. Those who will operate digital ter<Col N="104" /> restrial television will be able to sell other multiplexes or other channels to the private sector. However, the potential that exists is being eaten up against a background of further subscribers to cable and MMDS television.</P>
    <P>The other means of broadcasting, satellite television, is not as yet a very large factor here. Deputy Ardagh could ask the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to move the digital terrestrial television agenda ahead. It is more important to rural rather than urban areas where there is cable and so on as, if it succeeds &ndash; we hope it does &ndash; it will bring greater choice to those areas. In the view of many of those who know, the convergence of broadcasting, telephony and the Internet will be a reality. Obviously views differ on when exactly that will happen.</P>
    <P>Part of the difficulty that arose in regard to Digico, the company that was to have been set up under the broadcasting Bill to operate what is at present Teilifís Éireann's broadcasting infrastructure, was that initially up to 40% of the shareholding was for RTE, that was to be carried out on the basis of an evaluation of its infrastructure and 60% was to go elsewhere. An asset should, as this should, remain in public ownership. In Britain the network was sold off but there may be potential in relation to that infrastructure that we may not be aware of because the technologies to exploit it are not readily visible now.</P>
    <P>The flotation of the telecom shares was something new. If information was withheld which would be relevant in a significant way to the future price of the shares, it should be provided. If we could see the ABN report which the Minister said is the property of Eircom we might have more information on what happened and why the share price was set.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>It is vital that the Minister introduces identity cards. We must be ruthless in dealing with publicans and licensees who knowingly and deliberately sell drink to underage persons. How can we withdraw the mandatory law that allows for some doubt if we do not introduce ID cards? All sorts of plastic cards are available. Banks can produce them in a matter of days so why can we not do so? If young people aged 18 or over do not want to drink they will not have to obtain ID cards, but if they want to become involved in clubs or public houses they should carry such cards. I would fully support any measures, however draconian, to curb the scourge of underage drinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to come to grips with a situation which is totally out of control. Each new survey <Col N="105" /> confirms a further reduction in the age threshold at which youngsters begin drinking. According to the surveys, young people of 12, 13 and 14 are openly admitting that they drink alcohol. Young people are now starting to drink at a very early age and the Minister must deal with this major problem. It cannot be denied that at least some teenage pregnancies, which are increasing, are connected with alcohol abuse. The real problem is not being addressed in a coherent way.</P>
    <P>Elderly people in towns and villages have brought to my notice the problem of young people leaving hotels and dicsos at night. There is genuine fear among the elderly and business people when such crowds congregate outside chip shops at night. The Minister must ensure that this problem is dealt with. We must encourage those who want to drink to do so in moderation. We have run anti-smoking campaigns, and rightly so, because smoking can cause cancer. Drink can also be a cancer, however, so we need a similar campaign to point out the result of alcoholism and to encourage and promote sensible drinking habits.</P>
    <P>We also need to provide care for those with an alcohol problem. On many occasions in my area people have sought help from the health board, but have had to travel to Newry, Galway or elsewhere to obtain treatment. If the Government is serious about having a coherent policy on licensing the sale of alcohol and controlling consumption, it must ensure that those who are unfortunate enough to find themselves with a serious habitual problem are cared for. I have had to deal with individual cases that have caused extremely serious problems in families. We want to support families and encourage them not to expose their young members to situations where alcohol is available late at night. Young people must not see this as the only way of socialising and they must not be left uncared for. They should be encouraged to follow their parents' example. That is part of the reason for introducing proper regulations.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Deenihan, I have also been lobbied by supermarkets and I understand that some of those letters have already reached the Minister's office. Small supermarket proprietors are worried that the bigger consortia, such as Tesco and Dunnes Stores &ndash; although perhaps I should not use these names in the House &ndash; have privileges that they do not enjoy. It does not seem logical that wine should be freely available in such supermarkets while beer is not. I hope that matter will be re-examined on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I have also been lobbied by the GAA and by golf clubs which want some of the Bill's provisions looked at again to make them more workable and more sensible. In isolated rural areas, public meetings are often held in the local clubhouse, and it would be a pity if such meetings could not be publicly advertised. As a politician, one would be afraid to have one's photograph taken in such a place if the Bill were to remain without amendment.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a change in the law on the transfer of liquor licences. Current measures gov<Col N="106" /> erning the issuance of new licences in larger towns and cities are unbelievable. When one sees the millions of pounds being paid for licensed premises, it shows how ludicrous that law is. There is a surplus of liquor licences in many rural areas so ways must be found to open up that market. Most public houses and discos run their premises in a reasonable and orderly way, but difficulties have arisen. The present licensing laws do not provide enough options to those who wish to object to a premises having its licence renewed. As the law stands, the District Court can only renew or refuse when a licence comes up for reallocation at the September court. Most of the licences are given without going to court and that situation should be examined. As an enforcement measure, a licensee should be liable to lose his or her licence for a few days or weeks.</P>
    <P>Other difficulties can arise concerning licensed premises. I came across a case recently where a licensee failed to obtain a licence because of a taxation problem that was not the fault of the licensee. When the licensee went to get the licence renewed, the authorities were heavy-handed and insisted that the premises should be reconstructed. The Minister must ensure that the law is evenly applied so that people who have reasonable premises will be entitled to a licence.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and recognise that the Minister has fulfilled a commitment by introducing the legislation. It is important to note that the Minister has remained in the House throughout Second Stage. As a member of the Vintners Federation of Ireland and a licence holder, I obviously have an interest in seeing the Bill enacted. All the issues referred to by the VFI over the years have been successfully addressed in the legislation. Few people would disagree that the law governing the sale of intoxicating liquor has been in need of reform for many years. This legislation is not being rushed through the House. In my three years in this House, I have seen wide consultation by the Minister with all the interested groups. This time last year I was somewhat critical of the Minister for not addressing the issue as hastily as I had hoped but I fully recognise now that the consultation period had to be extensive to ensure that all the various interest groups had an input into the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is welcome from a number of viewpoints. It deals with all the issues raised over the years such as the need for longer opening hours, so often sought by the consumer and, to a lesser extent, the tourism industry. It also provides clarity for sports and recreation clubs. One of the most important aspects of the Bill is the tightening of the law in relation to underage drinking. Anybody who has been involved in local politics, particularly at health board level, will recognise <Col N="107" /> the major concern about the difficulties caused by underage drinking and the increase in the number of people in psychiatric care, which has been brought about by the scourge of underage drinking. That is an important part of the legislation. I will refer later to that change and ask for an amendment to that part of section 3.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill removes the holy hour closing period on Sundays. That will make it easier to sell beer in restaurants, something that has been campaigned for over many years. The Bill also allows for more exemptions in relations to festivals and other occasions of celebration. It abolishes the need for night clubs to serve a meal. Overall, the Bill brings the State's licensing laws into the 21st century and introduces a sense of realism to the idea of selling alcohol. That shows the commitment of the Minister who listened to the various representations over recent years.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes strengthening the law in relation to underage drinking. The main measure in this regard is the provision allowing for the closure of premises found to be in breach of this section. That measure will be welcomed by those concerned with the increasing problems of teenage alcohol addiction and general substance abuse among young people. Publicans whom I have met are somewhat concerned about it but I understand the Minister's commitment to resolving the problem. I will not come into this House to praise the Minister on the one hand and then immediately criticism him on the other. I am fully aware of his commitment to resolving this issue.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to closely examine this issue by way of recognising, which I am sure he does, that the Licensed Vintners' Association and the Vintners Federation of Ireland have consistently outlined their concern regarding underage drinking. I would go so far as to say they have encouraged measures to deal with this problem. We have seen the voluntary ID card operating in some counties. Part 3 deals with that issue and puts an onus on the courts to impose, on conviction for a first offence, a mandatory temporary closure order. I would be concerned that the courts, in the absence of a mandatory national ID card, could have the discretion to decide upon a genuine error made by a publican or a member of staff rather than the case of a regular law breaker. It is in no publican's interest to have the name of allowing young people to drink in his or her premises, but I have to think about the country publican who is left to run the pub on his or her own. I do not want to take away from the serious attempt by the Minister to resolve this problem but I have to take into consideration the publican working alone who may have a back snug or lounge in which somebody who may be underage is given a drink.</P>
    <P>I voice concerns about that and that is as far as I will go on it because I fully appreciate the Minister's concern. I am sure he will recognise the concern of publicans as well who want to <Col N="108" /> ensure that they run a good house. It has been well established that publicans take their trade seriously and the level of investment they make in their pubs is an indication of that. More importantly, it is a well known fact that publicans regularly send their staff either on brewery or CERT courses and all that adds up to a genuine attempt on their part to ensure that their premises are run in a professional manner and that there is no underage drinking.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the extended opening hours have been recognised by the Minister. For many years consumers and indeed tourists demanded extended opening hours. That is also something that the publicans, by way of a vested interest, have demanded. They make the point that they find it difficult to explain, particularly to tourists, the reason they have to leave their premises just as the party is starting, as it were. The vintners have also made the point that extending the hours will not increase the level of alcohol consumption because there is a finite amount of money available for that purpose. This is a practical response to the demand from the tourism industry to ensure that a good time can still be had by all. The socialising habits of Irish people have changed considerably in recent years. People travel abroad more often and see the way those in other countries socialise, and we are making similar demands.</P>
    <P>Sports and recreation clubs throughout the country provide a valuable social, recreational and amenity service in their communities. They are often at the forefront in community development and it is fair to say that many communities depend on the local club to help raise funds for charities etc. This section provides much needed clarity for clubs and the Minister has tidied up the law in relation to visiting teams whereby those teams can now be signed in as a group. The Minister has introduced many provisions throughout the Bill that make the working of this legislation easier on all those who have responsibility for managing licensed premises.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's reference to the establishment of a commission which will ensure that the process of reform will be ongoing and responsive to the needs of consumers, the industry and all the other interested parties. There has been some comment recently that publicans have forced through many of these measures for their own gain. Few people would argue that something could be forced on the Minister. He has consulted widely with all the interested groups and presented a finely balanced Bill. I have met people from the VFI throughout the country over the past few weeks and they and many publicans welcome the many changes. While others might argue they will make the day even longer, there is general agreement within the trade that there will not be a significant increase in the quantity of alcohol sold. Customers will be able to get a drink at a time that most suits their lifestyle.</P>
    <P>The main beneficiaries of the Bill will be the consumers, those who enjoy a drink in their local <Col N="109" /> pub at a time when it is most convenient to them and their friends. It is also welcomed by the tourism industry and it brings us into line with European law. The Bill goes a long way towards addressing the wide-ranging interests of the consumer, the tourism industry, festivals and race courses, to name but a few. It is a modernising and progressive Bill which has found favour with both consumer groups and the VFI.</P>
    <P>Over the past three to four years many groups made representations on this issue. They all recognised the value of consultation. The vast majority of pubs are doing their best to ensure a level of accommodation, service and professionalism that matches their European counterparts.</P>
    <P>The new provisions for special exemptions will make it easier for towns and villages to obtain exemptions for festivals and sporting occasions. That is welcome because it is an issue that has been on the agenda for some years. These measures will be welcomed also by those involved in the tourism industry who see reform in this area as vitally important if we are to continue attracting visitors. It is well recognised that tourism is our largest industry and this is a low cost way of supporting that industry. The Exchequer is the net beneficiary.</P>
    <P>On the issue of the sale of alcohol in restaurants, the law on the sale of beer in restaurants was too restrictive, as witnessed by the small number of restaurants which avail of this provision. It is a strange law that allowed a person to sell produce from another country but forbade the same business from selling an Irish product. The provision in this regard will benefit Irish brewers in that it will remove the anomaly whereby foreign produced wine is freely available while local goods are not.</P>
    <P>The holy hour is something we always wanted to see abandoned and I welcome that provision. I thank the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, for meeting the various representative groups in the recent past. I suggest that, as we move to make life easier for the consumer, we should recognise the difficulty of life for the publican. As we update legislation governing the sale of alcohol, we should take into account the considerable difficulties often visited upon publicans. I ask the Minister to ensure, over the coming years, that publicans have the right to command and run their own premises. Provision should be made whereby publicans retain the right to ensure that, whoever they serve on their property, good practice is continued on their premises.</P>
    <P>If there is a doubt on the part of the publican or some difficulty arises, I suggest that the publican should have the right to refuse service, to ensure the safety of the other customers. I speak as someone who is involved in this business and I am aware that this issue is a cause of concern. It is difficult for a publican to ensure the safety of customers if he does not know the customers he is serving. Provision should be made in future to ensure that some protection exists.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="110" /> I welcome the Bill. The Minister has given it considerable thought and it will receive full support across the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers, I join with this side of the House in welcoming the Bill. It acknowledges that society has changed considerably over recent years. This was not reflected generally in the licensing laws. The pattern of drinking, how we approach it and how we celebrate and socialise has changed. This Bill acknowledges that change in our social make-up and in the manner in which we use pubs, hotels, clubs and so on. We need to reflect that change in our laws. We need laws that are realistic and deal with the real world. For far too long, particularly in regard to this issue, we had laws that did not relate to daily life. The laws were flouted and were not policed. They could not be policed because social change had taken place and a different structure was needed.</P>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, before bringing this Bill before the House, went through a process of consultation, not only with those who have a vested interest, such as pubs, hotels and clubs, but also with us as politicians who represent the public. The Minister asked all of us our opinions on the legislation required.</P>
      <P>The Bill represents quite a radical change in terms of updating the law and introducing new measures which will deal with the changing times in which we live. It will also help those who frequent public houses. One of the central issues in relation to a Bill like this is that every organisation has a view on it, and the challenge was to have that view accepted widely. The Minister rose to that challenge and gained general acceptance, and what we have before us is a Bill which is accepted widely both inside and outside this House. A number of issues were raised by groups and organisations, but for the most part they have been dealt with in the Bill. I compliment the Minister on that and on the many other Bills he has put through this House.</P>
      <P>The Bill refers to the setting up of a commission. Given the changes that are proposed in opening hours and in the licensing system, the work of this commission will be extremely important, as will its make-up. The commission, in implementing the provisions of the Bill, should take into account continuous changes that will be required. I note from the Minister's speech that this commission will examine the off-licence and other forms of licence. In the context of changing opening hours, the commission should ensure that people can conduct their business without too many restrictions while at the same time protecting the interests of those who speak out against drinking generally or who wish to restrict drinking hours. The commission will have to examine the nature and activity of clubs and how they operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see the realities of public life reflected in this Bill or in future Bills. Clubs are <Col N="111" /> used widely by many groups and organisations to raise money and host cabarets and a whole range of activities. That should be recognised and legislation which currently restricts various activities within clubs needs to be examined, perhaps not in the context of this Bill but by the commission.</P>
    <P>In relation to off-licences and other forms of licences, we need to look at the off-licence trade and how it operates. In my city and in towns throughout the country it is very easy for underage people to gain access to drink from off-licences. Many local authorities are of the view that it is necessary to introduce by-laws to prevent drinking in public places. Drink is being accessed by underage people through off-licences and as a result they are drinking in public places, causing problems for many people who frequent various amenities in cities and towns. This practice is uncontrolled. I would like to see measures in place such as a mandatory ID system &ndash; there is reference to that in the Bill. Under such a system the public would be required to have identification cards, thus making it possible for the people in the trade, whether in on-licences or off-licences, to easily identify those who are under age.</P>
    <P>Underage drinking acts almost as a gateway to the use of heavier drugs. A problem exists and we cannot ignore it. It is reflected in almost every health board region where pressure is put on the boards to react to the problems caused by alcohol abuse in families. We are talking in most cases about young, underage people drinking. That matter should be addressed. There is another issue which I hope will be reflected in terms of the make-up of the Commission. The transfer and purchase of the 600 unused licences may be taken up by operators of &ldquo;super pubs&rdquo; in major urban centres. The commission will need to define the role of local authorities in granting planning permission for the transfer of these licences. I welcome the Bill overall and I commend the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Naughten. I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 2000. Vintners and those involved in the licensed trade have sought such a Bill for many years and the Minister has brought it before the House at last. Many will ask why the Bill is necessary. Some people have told me we do not need licensing laws &ndash; that the pubs should open 24 hours a day and regulate themselves. This cannot happen because alcohol is a drug which must be regulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Members of the House are involved in the licensed trade. The vintners will fight for those they represent, which is their democratic right. However, drink is the greatest scourge in this country because it affects, upsets and destroys many families. Everyone has spoken about under-age drinking but nobody mentioned over-age drinking &ndash; the scourge of men going <Col N="112" /> home drunk on Saturday and Sunday nights. Many of them did not obey the holy hour and drank through Sunday, Monday and Tuesday in some cases, while their wives and families suffered. Drink is a wonderful thing if it is treated properly and not abused.</P>
    <P>There are three kinds of public house in this country &ndash; rural pubs, city pubs and night clubs. Most politicians hold their constituency clinics in the pub because people find it easier and more confidential to come into a pub than a rural hall. In many cases the rural pub is also a shop and post office. In bigger towns, such as Castlebar, Ballina and Westport, there is plenty of competition among pubs which are run as good businesses. One night in the past few weeks I went into a pub in this city on three different occasions and the pint of beer was charged at three different prices. Charges are outrageous in the city because there is no competition. While there were restrictions in the transfer of licences in the past, I welcome the fact that the Minister is now providing for the transfer of a licence from one part of the country to another.</P>
    <P>The Minister has introduced a fairly good Bill. He has satisfied many people, although he will never satisfy everyone. He should apply the same extension of opening hours to Sunday nights, which will be especially beneficial for rural areas during the tourism season. There is no difference between weeknights and Sunday nights. Those on holidays who do not have to go to work on Monday should not be penalised. There is a short tourism season in my county, Mayo, and the Minister's county, Kerry, which we are trying to extend. Tourists like to spend the day on the beach, shopping or sightseeing, then have a meal and a few pints. It is ridiculous that the pubs will close at a different time on Sunday. Given that the Minister has brought the Bill this far, he should extend the opening hours on Sunday. The Minister is a reasonable man and I think he will do that.</P>
    <P>I will ask my party to put down an amendment to this Bill regarding six day licences and I hope it will. I am told there are approximately 105 six day licences in this country, some of which are leased. The Minister, as a solicitor, knows that legally they cannot be leased for five years but must be leased for 11 months, three years or four years. The last time a liquor Bill came through this House, there were approximately 1,500 six day licences and no major restriction in changing a six day licence to a seven day licence. I hope the Minister will remove all restrictions and include all six day licences, whether leased or not, with seven day licences, so that we may be certain of our position.</P>
    <P>There have been legal disputes over six day and seven day licences, often because those granting licences have made mistakes issuing. I understand that approximately 200 of these licences have not been cleared. So that the Minister does not misunderstand me when he is responding and says he cannot do this, I am talking about genuine <Col N="113" /> publicans with tax clearance certificates who are paying their rates. The Minister should declare an amnesty &ndash; I know that is not a very popular word in this country &ndash; for the problem licences so that they can be regulated and transferred to seven day licences.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the Minister the vintners cannot complain because, like the taxi licences, he could have introduced 10,000 or 12,000 more licences. He did not do that but he should regulate all licences which will stop people lobbying for the next ten or 15 years. The Minister should deal with the problems which exist in a reasonable way at whatever cost may be involved. After the Bill is passed, all licences should be properly regulated and made seven day licences. I hope the Minister will resolve the problem of six day licences, of which there are only 105 &ndash; that is not a large number.</P>
    <P>Publicans come in for a great deal of criticism but to be fair, 99.9% of them are decent family people who want to run an honest business and make a living. An uncle of mine is in the pub trade and being a publican is not an easy life. They are up early in the morning, late at night and they have to listen to everybody's problems. This legislation will help to regulate the licensing industry, which is not easy to do. There are interest groups which are against alcohol and its abuse. There is nothing wrong with that because that is their right. I am glad there are people like that who are acting on behalf of the community, young and old. People have to pick up the pieces when alcohol is abused.</P>
    <P>I make a plea to the Minister and perhaps he will say the matter is outside his remit. I am not having a go at publicans. There was an article in a newspaper today about overcharging for alcohol. Whatever about that, the greatest scandal is overcharging for minerals &ndash; orange, cola and mineral water. An intoxicating liquor licence should restrict the prices charged for minerals. Those who do not drink should not have to subsidise the customers who do. The prices charged for mineral water, cola and orange are outrageous. The Minister and the Government should limit what pubs can charge for minerals. That would be a good thing for the country and would send out the right signals. I support completely the vintners, who do a difficult job, and I welcome the Bill. However, while the federation will say that vintners are in business to make a profit, it is wrong to make profits by penalising people who do not drink by making them pay outrageous prices for coke, mineral water and so on. I would love the Government to take this on board.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at the six day licences. I saw his officials speaking to him. I hope we can have an amnesty to regulate everyone with a six day licence, so that the days of the six day licence will be gone. We should try to regulate every licence with which there is difficulties. I could say more about the Bill but I want to give some time to my colleague.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill, which is not before time. I told the Minister last December I would wholeheartedly welcome this legislation when it came into the House. The Bill will get rid of the tradition of kamikaze drinking we see when our Dublin cousins come to rural Ireland. When Dublin people come to the country they think the pubs will close at the same time as the Dublin pubs and they down drinks as quickly as possible in case the bar stops serving. That will be resolved by the Bill. The Bill will also bring competition into the Dublin market, which is crying out for it at present. The opening up of the general transfer of licences is a welcome measure.</P>
      <P>I want to raise a number of changes I feel should be made in this legislation. We were led to believe when the Minister spoke in the House last December that he would introduce a comprehensive consolidation Bill, but that is not the case. That is a pity because an opportunity was missed to change many archaic procedures in the current licensing legislation.</P>
      <P>More importantly, the plans to change the licensing laws have been introduced in complete isolation, without addressing the wider social agenda which is fundamental to the whole debate. We need only look at the broken homes and the hospital casualty units at weekends following road traffic accidents and street and domestic violence to realise the huge problem in Irish society which is sadly ignored by the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister has failed to look at the issue of the enforcement of this legislation, which could lead to chaos if it is not properly implemented. The proposal to move from the two tier licensing system to a three tier one will lead to further confusion about opening hours. Sunday should be treated as either a weekday or a weekend night, rather than adding a third tier to the system. My preference is to treat Sunday as a weekday night with a closing time of 11.30 p.m., like Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday nights.</P>
      <P>More importantly, the Minister failed to grasp the issues of under-age drinking, public disorder and the bad management of pubs and nightclubs. This will lead to chaos on our streets, further demands on Garda resources and the abuse of the rights of young people. This is all due to the failure to tackle the small percentage of cowboy operators in the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Elderly and other people living beside pubs and discos must reside alongside modern day hellholes. They are kept awake all night by the disorder outside these premises or at other locations where people congregate. They genuinely fear their homes will be invaded or that they will be attacked by people under the influence of alcohol. Many of them have experienced damage to their property by these louts and, sadly, it is not unusual to see smashed windows on a Sunday morning. A big problem experienced by elderly people is the persistent ringing of doorbells. Many elderly people who live where people congregate at night are being driven crazy by this situation. We must examine this. There are now <Col N="115" /> no-go areas in some towns at weekends. It is a pity to see this happen in our country and we must look at it seriously.</P>
    <P>We must also look at the issue of drinking on streets and derelict sites, which is becoming a huge problem. That will require the introduction of by-laws to ban drinking outside licensed premises. These lager louts are in total control of some parts of our towns and villages, which is unacceptable. This raises an issue, not so much of pub licences and the pub trade, but of off licences. It is not unusual in some areas to see nine and ten year old children who are drunk. They are not getting the drink in pubs. We should look at introducing a new law which would make it an offence to purchase alcohol and pass it on to someone under the legal drinking age. I ask the Minister to look at the possibility of tabling an amendment to that effect. It would be difficult to enforce but, at least, we could lay down a marker and try to crack down on it.</P>
    <P>In January 1999 the Minister announced the introduction of the national ID card scheme. While it was an optional scheme, it was welcome. However, he failed to provide the necessary resources or administration procedures. Young people had to go to a Garda station, fill out the application form, pay the £5 fee and wait three months to receive an identity card, which was a ridiculous arrangement. Eventually, the Minister realised his mistake and put the necessary procedures in place. However, it still takes up to three weeks for a young person to get an identity card. When the scheme was announced by the Minister he stated that identity cards would be available within five working days. However, the new identity card scheme has failed to make any impact for two main reasons.</P>
    <P>The first is the possibility of forgeries. If perfect forgeries can be made of driving licences, the same will happen with a national identity card scheme. We must look at some way to ensure they cannot be replicated. One possible control might be to include the RSI number on the ID card, so that a nightclub owner or publican could check it out at a later date and ensure a repeat offence did not happen.</P>
    <P>The second reason is that, due to these problems, some nightclubs are not accepting these ID cards. If the nightclubs are not accepting the cards, and I am sure it is the same in some public houses, young people will not get them. Some nightclubs will not accept any ID whatsoever because of the large range of forged IDs available at present and turn people away if they look under 18 years. That means that some people who are over the legal age but look younger are being discriminated against.</P>
    <P>Other speakers referred to the problem that the good publican, who made a genuine error or sold drink on his premises to someone who was buying it for younger people he did not see, is treated in the exact same way as the small percentage of cowboys who are abusing the system <Col N="116" /> for their own benefit. We need to examine that, although I know it is a very difficult area. However, a mandatory approach may not be the best way to address this. I ask the Minister to consider whether the introduction of a mandatory seven days penalty for a first offence is the right way to go about it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes in section 14, where the onus is now put on the publican to ensure the person is over 18 years of age. It is a positive development that the loophole in the existing legislation has been addressed.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas subcommittee that examined this issue recommended that special licensing courts should be established within the Circuit Court. They would have judges permanently assigned who were experts in licensing and related matters, which would ensure consistency in the judgments made. The Minister failed to introduce this in the Bill and that is disappointing. These cowboys who have contempt for residents living in their vicinity and who encourage under age drinking would be wiped out by such courts. It would also combat the drug dungeon night-clubs around the country where people are encouraged to peddle drugs. If we had such courts they could clamp down on these people once and for all rather than sitting once a year to renew licences. Will the Minister look at these matters and bring forward amendments on Committee Stage?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers I commend the Minister and his officials on this Bill, which we have been awaiting for some time. We were told it would be comprehensive, and that it is. I am glad speakers from the Opposition benches have complimented the Minister on this Bill and on the number of other Bills he has introduced. Only a few weeks ago we heard other Opposition Members, though not the same people, condemning him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to some of the contributions one might think that only pubs are affected by the Bill, but far from it. That is probably one of the reasons the Minister and his officials deliberated on the Bill for so long. It is very difficult to please all Deputies, as we all have different views, but be that as it may, the Minister must have done a very good job if Deputies from all sides are commending him. This is the most fundamental Bill to review and update the existing licensing Acts. Legislation in this area dates back to 1833 and in essence, this Bill updates and consolidates legislation over a period extending back 167 years. That is not a simple task. Extensive and widespread consultation was needed between the Minister, the Government and interested parties, of which there are many. The Bill touches on many aspects of society and those of us representing rural areas, more so than urban Deputies, will know that drink has a big say in the social life of rural Ireland. People in rural Ireland do not have the theatre or other luxuries that city people have; instead they have the pub. <Col N="117" /> The pub is a place for chat and company, particularly for those who are not married, and whether they are farmers or have other jobs, going to the pub one or two nights a week may be their only enjoyment.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out the rights and duties of pub, hotel and club owners in selling intoxicating liquor as well as the rights of service for off-licences. It also updates legislation relating to drinking licences for clubs and consolidates legislation in this field which dates back to the Registration of Clubs Act, 1904, as well as dealing with drinking at racecourse meetings and greyhound racetracks. When one considers the Bill touches on pubs, off-licences clubs, hotels, racecourses and greyhound tracks, it is clear that it is important social legislation. I commend the Minister on his determination and courage in facing up to the need to update legislation in this area, as this would not be an easy task for him or the Government. Many other Governments shied away from the key issue of updating the licensing legislation, which was archaic and outdated in many respects. As a result of widespread consultation with all interested groups, this Bill, which has been passed by the Seanad, should be supported by Deputies, as it is a full and composite Bill, spanning 24 pages and incorporating five different Parts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ring made a valid point about six-day licences. He mentioned a figure of more than 100 six-day licences, but I understand there are approximately 600 such licences. From my reading of the Bill, any person with a six-day, or restricted, licence for a period of five years immediately preceding the commencement of the Bill can, on payment of £2,500 to the Revenue Commissioners, have the licence upgraded to a seven-day licence. I commend the Minister on that. I do not know of any six-day licences in my constituency, though I remember them from years ago, and I realise that some people probably had the foresight to buy up many of these licences. I understand the Minister's intentions when including this provision.</P>
    <P>Part 1 is preliminary in nature and refers to the wide variety of Bills it is intended to update, including the Licensing Act, 1902, which is still one of the core Acts governing the sale of intoxicating liquor, though it and other Acts dating back over 167 years are to be updated. The Bill also gives definitions for the operation of different licences.</P>
    <P>Part 2 updates the hours when publicans will be entitled to serve drink. Those who lobbied, be they hoteliers, vintners or restaurateurs, are entitled to do so, though it is difficult to please everyone. The last time I spoke on this Bill, in December, I declared an interest, but tonight I do not have that interest. I am trying to be fair as possible and do not want to be seen as selfish. I have been involved in the vintner's trade in my time and it was difficult for vintners to look for additional hours as the hours were very long as they were. However, customers being what they <Col N="118" /> are, they demanded additional time at night as there are so many clubs in operation and publicans did not want to see their customers go elsewhere later in the night. To update the hours when publicans will be entitled to serve drink, required the amendment of section 2 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927, as well as the other Intoxicating Liquor Acts of 1960, 1962, 1988 and 1995. Businesses selling alcohol are prohibited from serving alcohol on Christmas Day and Good Friday and that is only right and proper. There can be certain restrictions where people are resident in hotels and it can be awkward at times, but in fairness I have not found people to be overly demanding on Good Friday. Christmas Day was different, though Good Friday can be a little awkward in that respect.</P>
    <P>Drink can be sold between 12.30 p.m. and 12.30 a.m. on St. Patrick's Day, between 10.30 a.m. and 11.30 p.m. on Christmas Eve and the eve of Good Friday and between 12.30 p.m. and 11 p.m. on Sundays. Everybody will be glad that the holy hour between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. on Sunday has been abolished. It was a nuisance, especially during the summer when there are matches and games. It was not too bad in the winter. On other Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, drink can be sold between 10 a.m. and 11.30 p.m. and between 10.30 a.m. and 12.30 p.m. on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays.</P>
    <P>Sunday nights used to be extremely busy for a number of months during the year in rural areas. Now, however, it is not as good. Friday and Saturday nights are the important nights now. There are no seaside resorts in my constituency but my constituents holiday in places such as Ballybunion, Lahinch or Kilkea. They find that 11 p.m. closing on Sunday nights during July and August is useful, especially if they have to get children to bed. I do not have a strong opinion on the matter but perhaps the Minister would consider an extension of another hour on Sunday nights for the summer months of July and August.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for sensible extensions to the time limits in which alcohol is permitted to be served in pubs. It abolishes the holy hour on Sunday afternoons and lengthens pub opening hours for Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, the key nights for social occasions and outings for many people. These changes are not as dramatic as were sought by some people but I doubt that a man has been born who could occupy the office of Minister and satisfy everybody. It is impossible to do so in the case of the liquor trade. Wholesale extensions to opening hours would not have served or functioned adequately</P>
    <P>Part 2, Section 5 relates to the amendment of special exemption orders and updates section 4 of the Public Dance Halls Act, 1935. In future a special exemption order shall expire in cases where it extends to any Monday at 1 a.m. or in any other case at 2.30 a.m., unless the appropriate court for stated reasons considers it expedient to grant the order for a shorter period. A court should not grant a special exemption order in <Col N="119" /> respect of any premises unless it is satisfied that the special occasion mentioned in section 5 will be conducted in a manner which will not cause undue inconvenience to persons residing in the vicinity of those premises.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Public Dance Halls Act, 1935, is amended as follows:</P>
    <P>. a public dancing licence granted by virtue of this Act shall be deemed to be a licence that permits public dancing in the place to which the licence applies for a period not exceeding thirty minutes after any period in respect of which a special exception order (within the meaning of the<i> Licensing Acts, 1833 to 2000</i>) is in force in respect of that place.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with the rights of clubs to serve intoxicating liquor to their members. On &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, this morning a prominent gentleman put forward his case in this regard, as he is entitled to do like the hotel owners, restaurateurs and nightclub owners. However, such clubs must be registered in accordance with the Registration of Clubs Acts, 1904 to 1999. I have no axe to grind with regard to clubs. In certain areas one can make a good case for them, especially for GAA or rugby clubs in small rural towns which run discos one night a week. Without the money they make from the discos they would probably be unable to survive. However, one can also make a case that a small hotel in the town which operates a small function hall will suffer. It is a difficult decision to make but I believe the Minister has taken the correct approach.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with area exemption orders. It states that not more than &ldquo;six orders under the section having effect in any particular year shall be made in respect of any particular locality&rdquo;. Part 3 of the Bill relates to provisions concerning drinking by under-age persons. I believe that 99% of people will commend the Minister for this. I have been requested by the licensed vintners to point out that 99% of them are not in favour of selling drink to under-age persons. However, it is a nightmare for an owner of a licensed premises to find out the age of a person without proper identity cards.</P>
    <P>I am lucky in not having experienced that type of young trade but the people I know who have a young trade find it extremely difficult to deal with this problem. If somebody under-age is found on the premises, they believe the law is too harsh. I understand the Minister's objective in this matter. If the law were not so harsh, the 1% or 2% of people who sell liquor to under-age persons would not get the message. The penalty is a temporary closure of seven days in respect of a first offence and of not less than seven and not more than 30 days in respect of a second offence.</P>
    <P>The penalty of temporary closure will have the effect, we hope, of ensuring that pub owners will not under any circumstances knowingly provide drink to under-age persons. If somebody I did not know visited the licensed premises and I did not <Col N="120" /> think they were well over 18 years, I refused to serve them drink and told them we could only serve people over 22 or 25 years of age. It is a difficult call to make and I am aware the Minister had a problem dealing with the matter.</P>
    <P>Under section 14, &ldquo;it shall be a defence for the defendant to prove that the person in respect of whom the charge is brought produced to him or her an age card relating to that person&rdquo;. It will also be a defence for the defendant &ldquo;to prove that he or she used all due diligence to prevent the person under the age of 18 years in respect of whom the charge is brought from being admitted to the part of the licensed premises which is used on foot of an exemption order&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to off-licences in the context of under-age drinking. I tried to ascertain from a garda recently the law with regard to off-licences selling alcohol to under age persons. It is terrible to see young people of 15 and 16 years walking through the streets at night with bags filled with cans of cider and other alcohol. Usually they will congregate in inappropriate places where problems arise and residents call the gardaí. When the gardaí arrive, however, they tell the residents there is nothing they can do.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would explain the law in this regard. I can relay it to the gardaí who told me there were no licensing laws under which they could stop this type of behaviour or prevent off-licences selling drink to under-age people. If these off-licences can be proved guilty of selling alcohol to under-age people, there is no reason they should not suffer the same consequences as the publicans and hoteliers who commit the same offence.</P>
    <P>I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, and his officials for bringing forward this sensible and innovative legislation. The Bill is balanced and fair and has been brought forward following extensive consultations which lasted three years. Having consulted with the Minister and interested groups, I thank him sincerely for his briefings at all times. Members of this House should support this sensible and pragmatic legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Joe Higgins.</P>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill which has been anticipated for some time. The sale and consumption of alcohol is a major issue in which publicans play a major role. Publicans in general run their businesses correctly within the law and contribute to the society in which they live. They organise fund raising events and so on. It is a social occasion to meet in a pub and the fabric of society generates around the pub, particularly in rural areas. Where there are people, there must be laws. However, I believe order is more important than law. If there is good order, a lot of law is not needed but, if there is bad order, a lot of law is needed. Obviously the law which exists at present is not working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="121" /> I welcome the fact that the Minister deals in the Bill with the consumption of alcohol in restaurants. Given the influx of more tourists and the consumer society in which we live, more and more people are eating meals and having drinks in restaurants. This fact was forgotten, as were many other aspects of the law relating to alcohol. I recall when I was a child that drinkers from Newtowncashel travelled to Keenagh, which was five miles away, and the drinkers from Keenagh travelled to Newtowncashel. Therefore, everyone got a slice of the market. People travelled by bicycle to get alcohol under the old three mile limit. This is where the approach towards the sale and consumption of alcohol comes from.</P>
    <P>Nowadays it is not a problem to obtain alcohol. I agree there is an emphasis on under age drinking in pubs but most publicans do not want under age people consuming alcohol on their premises. Supermarkets and off-licences now sell alcohol, therefore, there are no restrictions on young people obtaining it. It is freely available in off-licences and so on. There is no point saying legislation will control this phenomenon; it will not. The Government and the State cannot baby sit when it comes to alcohol. This is the responsibility of individuals, families and communities. Alcohol is now available in supermarkets and off-licences, which was not the case 30 or 40 years ago. The reality is that if one could not obtain alcohol in a pub, one could not obtain it at all because it was not otherwise available. There is no point saying any different.</P>
    <P>Some publicans have expressed concern about the very strict penalties proposed in the Bill if they are found serving alcohol on their premises to under age people. These are not people who indulge in this practice; they are people who just wonder if these penalties are necessary. Perhaps this is a deterrent to a certain extent but 99% of publicans do not want young people under the age of 18 on their premises.</P>
    <P>These licences were introduced in 1902. Almost every premises in towns where fairs were held obtained a licence because obviously they sold bottles of drink on the fair day. When the legislation was enacted, any premises that sold a few bottles of drink on a fair day obtained a licence. This is why towns such as Ballymahon had more than 25 licences at one stage and almost every house in Ballaghaderreen, where fairs were regularly held, had a licence. This was the era in which the licensed trade began. Up to now, the issuing of licences has not respected the sprawling new developments and movement of populations which is taking place at present. There is no point having 15 licences in a town where there are 1,000 souls and one licence in an area where there are 15 souls. This aspect must be updated.</P>
    <P>Another major problem at present is opening hours. One can drink in a pub until 12.30 p.m. on Thursday, yet one must leave the pub at 11 p.m. on Sunday. Members of the Vintners Association expressed their complete and utter shock at this proposal. We are all aware that Sunday night is a <Col N="122" /> social occasion in rural areas when most people visit pubs. I cannot understand the reason for this proposal. One theory put forward by members of the Vintners Association is that the Taoiseach did not want people in pubs on Sunday nights because they had to go to work on Monday. However, the same people can be in a pub on Thursday night until 12.30 a.m. while having to get up for work on Friday, or leave a pub on Sunday night at 11.30 p.m., go to the nearest disco and drink for another two hours. There is a drinking song with the following lines:</P>
    <P>There are lots of pubs in Wales</P>
    <P>And they sell all kinds of ales.</P>
    <P>If you want to drink on Sunday</P>
    <P>You'll have to wait 'til Monday.</P>
    <P>. But did you ever see such a funny sight before?</P>
    <P>That goes back to a time when one could not get a drink in Wales on Sunday. Did one ever see such a funny sight? As it is closing time, I will finish my drink.</P>

        <b>:</b> One of the main purposes of the Bill is to provide for the extension of opening hours of public houses. The Bill should not provide for this without crucial information being provided either by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the Department of Health and Children. I cannot support the Bill given my current knowledge. The important information we need is the impact longer opening hours will have on a number of crucial factors. What impact will they have on the amount of alcohol consumed? What impact will they have on people suffering from the disease of alcoholism and who continue to drink? What impact will they have on social behaviour related to or influenced by alcohol consumption?</P>
      <P>Alcohol is a drug which seriously affects people and society when taken to excess. It is amazing that comprehensive studies have not been carried out on the impact of alcohol on Irish society. For a drug about which so much blather is spoken, including by those under its influence, we are distinctly lacking in facts regarding its impact on crucial aspects of life. Alcohol related deaths are an important component of the causes of death in general while alcohol related illnesses are an important proportion of general illness and disease. Cirrhosis of the liver, diseases of the pancreas and various cancers can be attributed to excessive consumption of alcohol, as, unfortunately, can homicides, domestic violence, a nightmare for so many women and in some cases for men, and various accidents. Alcoholism results in a litany of misery for the individual, their families, friends, neighbours and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the diseases from the abuse of alcohol and unsociable drinking result in a very heavy cost in terms of the resources of society. In terms of psychiatric care, thousands of admissions to institutions each year are related to alcohol. <Col N="123" /> Also, many admissions to acute general hospitals are a result of physical trauma caused by alcohol.</P>
    <P>I am not by any means a prohibitionist &ndash; I consume alcohol at times &ndash; but we must step back and see this for the very serious social phenomenon it is and any change in the law should only come when we have information on the critical issues I have outlined. The Minister or the Minister for Health and Children should have conducted studies or research into these issues. I want to know if the extension of the opening hours of pubs will have a positive or detrimental effect on society and individuals. Only when we have that information will we be in a position to cast an enlightened vote on the matter.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Government has not availed of this opportunity to bring forward legislation on the advertising of alcohol. It is quite outrageous that a substance which is sold to make massive profits for producers and sellers is glamorised to the extent it is through the mass media. I welcome the statement by the Minister for Health and Children's to the effect that he will introduce legislation to ban the advertising of nicotine, and it is logical that there should be legislation banning the advertising of alcohol. I call for an outright ban on the advertising and glamorising in any form of alcohol. The only advertising should be the menu or chart in public houses outlining what is available.</P>
    <P>It defies belief that sporting organisations, such as the GAA and some rugby and soccer organisations, have wide-scale sponsorship from drinks companies and prominently advertise a substance which, when used to excess, produces an effect which is opposite to the ethos such organisations try to inculcate. Such groups should have nothing to do with the advertising of alcohol.</P>
    <P>From an early stage our education system should include enlightened and intelligent information on alcohol and its consumption. In the same way as there are health warnings on packets of cigarettes, all alcohol containers should include health warnings outlining the negative effects. I am not sure what effect the health warning on cigarettes has on people, but such warnings should exist in any case.</P>
    <P>There is an enormous hypocrisy regarding underage drinking. Studies suggest a wide range of young people drink and rather than ritual denunciations we should have an enlightened debate. Regarding my own area, I ask myself and others whether it would be better for the youth who consume alcohol in the hedges, dark corners and lanes to do so in a different type of environment. I would like a debate on these issues to see what is to the benefit of society.</P>
    <P>The profiteering in some sections of the drinks industry is outrageous and the Minister should address it. Over-pricing is a huge issue. It is not the major problem, but the Minister should have addressed the fact that stout or beer is much more expensive when bought by the half pint &ndash; if the Minister <Col N="124" /> does not bring forward an amendment to address this then I will do so. This is unfair to those who are light drinkers and can be seen as an encouragement for people to drink like sucky calves, as we said in Kerry long ago, rather than in a civilised fashion. As there are probably many publicans in the Houses of the Oireachtas I do not know if it is the best place to secure fair play for drinkers in this regard.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very complex Bill into which the Minister and his officials have put much time and on which they have consulted widely. Like every other Bill we have been very quick to find the pitfalls. There a number of issues with which I would like to deal.</P>
      <P>Alcohol consumption and socialising go hand in glove. The public house is one of the great social outlets. Be it a wedding, wake or christening, it is said that it is the publican who benefits. While there are good reasons for this, excessive alcohol consumption gives rise to many social problems. While public representatives are well aware of the problems that can arise when one or more family members drink to excess, this has to be tackled at a different level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment of the liquor licensing laws as proposed by the Minister is both welcome and long overdue. I wish to address the provisions aimed at tackling under age drinking, a problem in both urban and rural areas. It does not take young people long to discover the outlets from which they can obtain alcohol, be it an off-licence or public house. The main concern of 15 and 16 year olds and younger at weekends is from where they can obtain alcohol and where they can consume it. While it is appreciated that publicans do not wish to patrol the law, if we are serious about facing up to the problems being caused by under age drinking the Minister has no option but to introduce tough legislation. We must knuckle <Col N="125" /> down and accept that this has to be done. As we are all aware young people congregate on every street and park of every small town and village and vandalism and violence, such as the breaking of windows, results from excessive alcohol consumption, which was probably a contributory factor in the violence which erupted on train services following GAA matches over the weekend.</P>
    <P>It is seen as manly or part of growing up to take a drink. One has to be able to say when one returns to school on Monday morning or after the Christmas holidays, for example, that one drank alcohol. Ways by which this can be tackled have to be looked at. While one can make young people aware of the pitfalls, to be successful there is a need for serious deterrents in legislation. The serious consequences for the owners of licensed premises of serving persons under the age of 18 years are highlighted in many soap operas across the water. While the onus will be on publicans, if they work hand in glove with the Garda Síochána in relation to identity cards it ought to be possible for them to police the law. While I have reservations about this, the Minister has no option but to face up to the matter in this way.</P>
    <P>Twenty-five to 30 years ago many would have said that Sunday was the big night of the week. For me it has become the slow night of the week. While there are occasions which merit an exemption, it is my experience that those who attend football matches or functions on Sunday afternoon in my constituency tend to go home early after a few drinks. Friday and Saturday have become the two big nights of the week.</P>
    <P>I welcome many of the provisions of the Bill into which the Minister and his officials have put much time and effort and on which they have consulted widely for the past three years. They could be here for 33 years and still not satisfy everybody. Be that as it may, the Bill is welcome and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>By the time the Bill has been passed all the great stories that we have heard during the years, particularly in rural Ireland, about the extremes to which people went to get a drink, particularly when a distance clause was included in legislation, will have been told. I am certain there will be big changes in the future. I compliment the Minister on what was a very brave decision to bring this Bill forward. His Department is the busiest I have seen in my time in this House and this is another comprehensive Bill he has introduced. However, no matter what he does it will be hard to satisfy all interest groups. Some will claim he has not gone far enough while others will claim he has gone too far. However, he has struck a good balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This review of the legislation has been necessary for many years and some of our legislation in this regard dates from the 1800s. Changes in society require other changes, and the licensing laws are no different in that regard. I applaud the process of consultation in which the Minister engaged. He received numerous written sub<Col N="126" /> missions and had formal and informal meetings with publicans, restaurant owners, hoteliers, night-club owners and many interested groups, including politicians.</P>
    <P>The licensed trade is one of the largest industries in the country. It is an important employer and contributes significantly to the economic and commercial activity of the State, both for Government and those who earn their livelihood from the trade. It is proper, therefore, that we devote adequate time to this legislation and I am glad it is before the House at long last.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt about the public demand for longer opening hours. There has been a change in the social outlook of consumers in recent years and this is the first step towards self-regulation of the industry. People would have been shocked by such a statement a few years ago but there well be self-regulation in the near future, as is the case in other countries, and that is the best alternative.</P>
    <P>Significant changes have taken place in the licensed trade. Most of the pubs in villages in my area do not open until 5.30 p.m. or 6 p.m., unless they serve food, whereas years ago they all opened at 10.30 a.m. This is because people are not frequenting pubs during the day, except when attending funerals or similar occasions. There is a need to recognise this and the legislation is changing accordingly. The Minister is introducing legislation which reflects the public demand.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill. The whole country is now a single licence area and I particularly welcome the abolition of the two for one rule and the need to prove an increase in population. There are publicans in most towns and villages. Years ago, if a licence became available, it was bought by a local publican and closed down. Under the old legislation the pub had to open for one day in the year but those licences were held so that others could not get access to them. There was also an element of speculation in that it was hoped the price would increase dramatically, as has occurred over the years.</P>
    <P>This has led to a situation where there are very few pubs in larger urban areas. There is a new word in the language which refers to areas which are &ldquo;under-pubbed&rdquo;. I welcome the fact that it will now be possible to transfer a licence from a town or village to a major centre of population. There are a number of six day licences in counties Carlow and Clare and I welcome the provision to allow these licences to change to seven day licences. Quite a number of speculators bought six day licences and I applaud the Minister for preventing such people from making excess profits. This shows the depth of thought he has given the legislation and the fact that he has tried to cover all angles. No matter what he does he will not cover everything but he will have an opportunity on Committee and Report Stages to further improve the Bill.</P>
    <P>This legislation will result in a fairer spread of licensed premises and will rectify the imbalance between rural and urban areas. The Minister has said that one of the pillars of the Bill was his <Col N="127" /> approach to under-age drinking and he has taken a serious attitude to the issue. One of the biggest problems we have concerns drinking by those, not only under 18 years of age, but by people much younger than that. When this is added to the drugs problem it is imperative that we have a mandatory ID card system. Whatever action needs to be taken must be taken to crack down on under-age drinking.</P>
    <P>I accept the need to place greater responsibility on publicans but young people can access to alcohol in a number of ways. We must talk about off licences and supermarkets and the fact that adults are buying drink and giving it to young people. These people must not get off the hook but there is no provision to deal with this problem. People must know they will be equally guilty and will be brought before the law if they buy drink for a minor and there must be provision for such a course of action.</P>
    <P>My 16 year old daughter told me she is too old to go to a local disco in a rural area. This disco is a great success and is run for charitable purposes but it is hard to believe the amount of alcohol confiscated on any one night by those running the club. Most of those who attend the disco are 14 years of age. The young people have ways of getting alcohol past the search on the door, such as hiding it in the toilets. This highlights the seriousness of the matter and the Minister will have the support of the House in any action he takes to control under-age drinking.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of publicans are honest and hard working people, particularly those in rural Ireland. Publicans help everyone in many different ways, including the entire community. They do a tremendous job. Some argue that being a publican is a licence to print money and there is a good return on being a publican. However, they provide a necessary service.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the abolition of the difference between summer and winter trading. This is a sensible measure. Tourism is an important industry and tourists find it difficult to understand why they have to leave a pub so early. I am happy with the provision for opening hours of 10.30 a.m. to 11.30 p.m., plus drinking up time, on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, as I am with the opening hours on Thursday, Friday and Saturday of 10.30 a.m. to 12.30 a.m., plus drinking up time.</P>
    <P>The issue which required to be addressed most was the 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. closing on Sunday. People play matches on Sunday mornings and like to go to a pub to watch a GAA or soccer match on television, so the 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. closing was ridiculous and I welcome its abolition.</P>
    <P>Only one publican to whom I spoke did not wish to retain the rules for Christmas Day and Good Friday. Everyone else felt these were two days they could call their own and they were happy with the current arrangements. However, I ask the Minister to reconsider the 11 p.m. closing time on Sunday. It should be similar to the closing times that will apply to other days. The Minister <Col N="128" /> might reconsider that matter. I welcome the closing time of 12.30 a.m. that will apply to the Sunday of a bank holiday weekend.</P>
    <P>I mentioned off licences in supermarkets and other outlets that supply alcoholic drink. We must seriously examine this area. Previous speakers referred to the incident on the train, in which drink was a factor, following the Munster championship match last Sunday.</P>
    <P>There is much more I would like to say on this Bill. I welcome the establishment of the commission on licensing with a remit to continue the process of fundamental reform of the law in this area. The Minister has struck the right balance in the legislation. He was brave to introduce it and I commend him on it. Many of his predecessors have walked away from introducing such a Bill, but that is not the Minister's style. The general public are satisfied with it. While the Minister cannot address everyone's demands in this legislation, he has gone a long way towards doing that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill. Reform of our licensing and drinking laws to bring us up to date with modern society and the way it is developing, is long overdue. Before critically assessing aspects of the Bill, I will make some general comments on the negative effect alcohol has on our society. The misuse of alcohol and alcoholism continues to cause massive social, health and family problems. If we are to relax licensing laws and make drink more freely available, we need to ensure measures are put in place, through information and publicity campaigns that highlight the danger of alcohol abuse and the disease of alcoholism, to counteract threats alcohol poses to the weaker sections of our society.</P>
      <P>I will concentrate on three parts of the Bills. Has the Minister seriously considered removing a limit on trading hours altogether thereby allowing publicans to decide whether and when their premises should be opened or closed depending on the demand in their community? As long as closing time exists, there will be a mass exodus from public houses at the same time, a habit which is associated with many problems in urban areas. The Garda cannot monitor the number of people on the streets in our towns and cities on weekends immediately after closing time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The transport problems connected to pub closing time due to an insufficient number of taxis and a lack of public transport available immediately after closing time leads to increased drink driving and large queues of young people under the influence of alcoholic drink waiting impatiently for a lift home. Large groups of young people on the streets under the influence of alcohol is a recipe for drug dealing, harass<Col N="129" /> ment, abusive behaviour and all the other negative social behaviours that are evident on our streets immediately after pub closing time. I am unsure whether the positives of enforcing a closing time outweigh the negatives. This matter is one that warrants serious debate and both sides need to be considered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>If new trading hours are to be introduced, the proposed times are an improvement on the current position, with the exception of the proposed Sunday night closing time. As mentioned by several speakers, and I am sure the Minister is sick of hearing it at this point, implementing three closing times in a week does not seem sensible. If a tourist visited Ireland over a long weekend and went out for a week each evening he was here, he would experience three different closing times on a Saturday, Sunday and Monday. It seems sensible to bring Sunday closing time in line with the closing time that will apply to the first three nights of the week. I would prefer if the same closing time applied each night of the week. What is the difference between a Wednesday night and a Thursday night, particularly in tourist areas and during the summer months. Is there such a major difference between weekend nights and weekday nights, especially as many people now work on a Saturday?</P>
    <P>I question the measure to deal with under age drinking. I agree with the Minister that this is an area that needs to be dealt with decisively. We must, however, be fair to publicans and must not be unreasonable by asking them to do the impossible. It is impossible to tell the difference between a girl aged 16 or a girl aged 18 or 19. This is particularly the case when fake identification is commonly available to young people at a cheap price.</P>
    <P>Part 3 provides that the courts must impose a mandatory temporary closure order where a publican is convicted of serving alcohol to an under age person. I am very much in favour of this tough measure, as long as publicans have some way of accurately assessing the age of their customers, otherwise the measure is unfair.</P>
    <P>In line with many of my Fine Gael colleagues, I favour the introduction of a national ID card scheme. Young people could be required to produce this card should they be called upon to do so by a publican or off-licence owner. This would make life easier for everybody, including the Garda and the publicans, and it would take guesswork out of the equation. However, I stress that publicans should not be left off the hook altogether. If they are deemed to have acted recklessly by serving under age drinkers, they should be penalised severely by the law. Young people should also be held accountable for their behaviour. A person who holds a fake ID should be under no illusions that it is a serious offence to do so.</P>
    <P>With regard to the matter of transferring licences, I cannot support a Bill that proposes to allow a licence acquired for a small family run public house to be used for a large superpub. Cer<Col N="130" /> tain vintners have approached me and expressed concern that small Irish traditional pubs may become a thing of the past due to the provision on this area in the legislation. Large superpub chains can buy up small pubs for their licences and use them to gain licences for premises in urban areas. I accept there are large urban areas, particularly in the capital, that are grossly under provided with public houses. I am in favour, in principle, of transferring licences, but only from one pub to another of similar size. Such a provision could be introduced by putting a cap on the size of a new pub relying on the licence of another small former pub in order to trade. If new superpubs need to be introduced to Dublin's city suburbs, special provision should be made for this, but we should not legislate nationally to address problems that are solely problems related to the capital. The small family pub with tradition and character is one of the features that makes Ireland Irish. We should preserve this aspect of Irish social life.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of the Bill. With some amendment, the Bill, when enacted, will have a positive impact on the lives of people who like to enjoy a drink and on the publicans who serve them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has shown great patience having listened to this debate all day. I hope some of the contributions were not too repetitive. The Bill has had a long gestation period. Work on it began in 1996 under Deputy Flanagan when he chaired the committee concerned. Extensive investigations into this area were carried out at the time and I participated in some of the related discussions. There was a general election in 1997 and the committee resumed its work on the Bill under Deputy Flanagan. Having read the Minister's contribution, I note he recognises that much of the input into this legislation is the result of the deliberations of that committee. It provided a good deal of foresight and advice on this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Vintners organisations are effective at lobbying. As they have not lobbied us recently, they must be reasonably happy with the content and balance achieved in the Bill. I was surprised to receive a contribution this week outlining two major concerns of the Licensed Vintners' Association relating to under-age persons. Its contribution on the restaurants was rich. We believe that the proposal to allow holders of a wine retailer's on-licence to sell beer with a meal means it will only be a matter of time before such licensees are allowed to sell spirits. In this context Irish spirit producers will feel aggrieved and will press for a broadening of the Bill to allow their brands to be sold in restaurants. To sell an Irish coffee in such outlets would be illegal while to sell an imported beer would not. If that is the best they can do in regard to the two amendments, the Bill has a long way to go. I thought that act was a little petty because one of the better aspects of the Bill deals with restaurants and the fact that <Col N="131" /> they could have a licence. I would like to think those restaurants would be able to make an Irish coffee.</P>
    <P>I come from Foynes where each year Powers Irish Coffee Festival is held. It is hugely successful. Irish coffee originated in Foynes in the 1940s when the seaplanes were going into Foynes. Irish coffee is part of our tradition.</P>
    <P>In regard to under age drinking, it is widely recognised we are going to have certain difficulties. Everybody appreciates that under age drinking is a cause of much concern. Some have spoken about identity cards. One of the contributors said it would take a long time before we would have a national identity card system. I am not sure, unless we go down that route, whether we can administer the scheme in such a way to ensure that only those over the age of 18 drink.</P>
    <P>The pub is part of our culture and from the tourism point of view it is widely recognised. Nowadays people can go to the pub to socialise, to have food or sit and be entertained. For those of us who enjoy a pint and take it in moderation it is a chance to relax and unwind at the end of a day. They are the positive aspects.</P>
    <P>We also know there is a negative side which involves the problem of alcoholism. I am reminded of a publican in a rural area who approached me and was concerned that the squad car was calling on a regular basis. He felt the Garda was being unduly harsh. Subsequent inquiries suggested he check out his clientele. These inquiries revealed that a dear woman at home was ringing the superintendent asking why her husband was not coming home. He was in the pub after hours. It is not always a case of the Garda being over-zealous. There may be concerns on the domestic front in regard to drinking and often in the process not enough food is put on the table. That is a sad spinoff. The members of Alcoholics Anonymous will not be mentioned much in this debate. I know people involved who have done tremendous work for those with alcohol problems. They make tremendous sacrifices at their own expense to help out colleagues who have fallen on hard times. Their role should be recognised.</P>
    <P>Given the closing time of 1 a.m. there is no justification for after hours drinking in public houses. I hope people will be happy with that. However, there could be certain difficulties on Sunday nights during the summer. Some suggested a later opening in July and August, particularly in areas dependent on tourism. That is a valid point but I do not know whether it can be accommodated.</P>
    <P>The requirement to provide food for late night functions is being abolished. For those of us who had a drink it was hard, as adults, being put out of a public house and to see the younger members of the family heading off to the disco where they had access to alcohol for an hour or two after we had left. This may be the right balance now where people can stay on a little longer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="132" /> I am pleased the Bill is so advanced and I look forward to its implementation during the summer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I broadly welcome the thrust of the Bill. I shall try to avoid repeating what my colleagues have said. I support the general thrust of the amendments in respect of the opening hours and the transfer of licences. There is concern among publicans about the super bars and their impact in certain areas if they develop. There should be some control in that area.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the difficulties that arise because of the abuse of alcohol and the need to ensure this most potent influence on behaviour is fully understood, examined and controlled. I draw attention to a policy document published by a former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Noonan. The national alcohol policy which I have studied is an excellent document on how to proceed. It deals with educating the public, education through schools, research and introduces a policy of appropriate behaviour in the use and abuse of alcohol and treating those afflicted by alcoholism. It is incumbent on the Government to introduce in full the recommendations outlined in that document which was accepted by the previous Government.</P>
      <P>The abuse of alcohol has a detrimental effect. It results in broken homes, broken marriages, children in difficulty, abuse of children, loss of business, ill-health and death. Alcohol plays a strong role in the lives of people who commit suicide. Reseach in the UK shows that an alcoholic is 20 times more likely to commit suicide than an ordinary member of the public. It is accepted in Ireland that 80% of those who commit suicide have taken alcohol at the time of their death. I am not saying they are alcoholics, though some are, but that 80% would have taken alcohol at the time of their death.</P>
      <P>There is an urgent need for a study on alcoholism, depression, attempted suicide and suicide. There is a dearth of research in this area. Over a number of years I have tried to look up international research on alcoholism and its relationship to depression, psychiatric illness and suicide. It is difficult to get empirical research on that area but it is accepted by psychiatrists in general and those involved in that area that alcohol plays a key role in the final decision of those who are suicidal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the treatment services for alcoholism. I acknowledge the excellent work done at Cuan Mhuire, Bruree, County Limerick, where I have seen at first hand the impact of positive, compassionate efficient treatment. When this approach was introduced it was frowned on by many in the psychiatric profession but it has proven its worth. Treatment centres for alcohol related disorders will never provide an effective response on their own to alcohol dependency. Treatment services provided by the health boards <Col N="133" /> down to community care level are essential but are only one aspect of a multi-faceted approach to alcohol related problems in our society. A treatment programme will be more effective if it is supported by national policies which help people to avoid damaging behaviour.  </P>
    <P>Treatment services within the psychiatric service have tended to deal with those who have alcohol dependence of long standing or who are particularly harmful to themselves or others. The appropriateness of the psychiatric hospital model of treatment for alcohol dependence came under scrutiny in Ireland in the 1970s. There is urgent need for comprehensive organisation of the treatment of alcohol dependence. We must recognise that the condition needs treatment. It needs the attention of the State. It is not just the treatment of deviants who are not able to control themselves. It is treatment of an addiction and a disease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Wright.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing this legislation to the House. It was difficult legislation and his success is evidenced by the lack of outcry in the papers since the legislation was brought to public attention.</P>
      <P>The Minister has listened to the debate among the public over the past few years and has had many meetings with representatives of the vintners. A balance has been struck between the demands on one side and what the Minister considered was right for our society. It is important to have a proper balance because drink is a curse when it is misused. We hear much about the effects of tobacco on smokers and of smoking on passive smokers. However, drink has more detrimental effects on society than tobacco ever had.</P>
      <P>The extension of opening hours, as agreed, will not have a detrimental effect on society. Allowing more decision making to individuals will change people's attitude towards drinking and towards staying all night in public houses.</P>
      <P>The provision of identity cards for young persons should be considered. One of the measures to combat under age drinking is the removal of the &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo; defence in any proceeding against a licensee. Under current law it is a defence for a licensee to claim that he or she had reasonable grounds for believing that a person to whom he or she has sold intoxicating liquor was of age. These days young people who go into pubs in groups may look over the legal age but are under it. It is very difficult for publicans or their employees to be absolutely sure that everyone to whom they sell drink is over the legal age. There should be a national identity card system where, if the publican is in doubt about a person's age, he or she can require an individual to produce proof of his or her age. I feel very strongly about this because a publican could lose his licence or a person working in a pub could lose his or her job through no fault of their own. The Minister should look again at this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="134" /> The wisdom of Solomon was needed to get agreement on closing hours. Over the past few years the Minister, through deft handling of the negotiations, got the agreement of all the parties involved. I congratulate him on that very fine work.</P>
    <P>Clubs have been shouting in the past few days about not being treated the same as pubs. They were never treated the same as public houses. As far as I am aware, an individual who is not a member of a club must be signed in by a member. That applies to GAA clubs, golf clubs and so on. Unless a person who is not a member of such a club is brought in and signed in by a member, he or she is not entitled to be served drink. The Minister has changed that. A team, for example, can be signed in as a group. Other functions can also be carried on in the club. I congratulate the Minister for making it easier for clubs to provide their premises for social and other occasions. Clubs should realise that the Minister has treated them favourably. If clubs want to be public houses, they must apply for full public house licences, and they have not done that.</P>
    <P>I come from a constituency where point-to-point races are held, mainly on Sundays. Publicans who have, over the years, provided services for those events felt that they would lose out if they could not transfer their licence to the racecourse. I am glad the Minister is providing for occasional licences for such events. I assure him that my constituents are very happy with that news.</P>
    <P>On the question of hotel licences, in towns and seaside resorts people who had hotel licences had to have ten bedrooms and operate as a hotel. However, over the years the practice of operating these premises as public houses grew up and, although they did not meet the conditions, they were licensed year after year. I do not know what can be done to ensure that these people are not now driven out of business or forced to pay excessive prices for licences to continue in business. I would like the Minister to consider their predicament and come up with as fair a solution as possible.</P>
    <P>There is also a fear among publicans that licences obtained in the country will be transferred to cities or towns and massive public houses erected on the basis of licences which applied only to small village pubs, allowing thousands of people to be catered for. Publicans feel that there should be a cap on the size of pubs which operate under licences that are transferred. I would like to hear the Minister's view on that matter.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on a job very well done. The proof that he has done a good job is that there has been no public outcry. Any queries are just housekeeping ones. This is proof that the Minister has hit the right note.</P>

      <P>As a member of the sub-committee of the Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights dealing with this issue I com<Col N="135" /> mend the Minister, as did my colleague, on the balance he has achieved. It is significant that the wide-ranging reforms he has introduced have satisfied the many diverse opinions on this Bill.</P>
      <P>I welcome the debate as this is a matter on which reform is long overdue. To say the legislation that governs our liquor licensing laws is anachronistic is a considerable understatement. I commend the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, on having the vision to bring this matter into the 21st century and the determination to ensure that it is fair and equitable to all interests involved. It is also an understatement to say that the public house has traditionally served a very important role in Irish life. It is a centre for socialising for our citizens. Many Members of this House have, through the years, used public houses to meet constituents on a regular and convenient basis. Many committees and sports associations that do not have their own premises use the local pub to organise themselves and create a standard of life for people for which we are beginning to develop a deep appreciation.</P>
      <P>In more recent times the proprietors of these establishments have sought to expand their roles and provide dining facilities and venues in which families can find entertainment and social intercourse. Public houses have become centres of attraction not only for our own people but for all those who wish to sample Irish hospitality. The Irish public house has become known abroad from Tokyo to Brussels and New York to San Francisco as synonymous with welcome, friendship, good company and superb Irish food and drink. As with all good things, however, it can be abused. The individual who seeks inebriation is not concerned with the social aspect of the public house. Those who seek to disturb the public peace and use the public house to acquire Dutch courage are not concerned with hospitality. Young people who seek alcohol to prove their maturity are not concerned with building a community or with family values.</P>
      <P>In the past we concerned ourselves to a great extent with how licensed premises may be abused. In articulating this concern we all but ignored the demand for greater facilitation within licensed premises by those who are responsible in our society, families, community groups, tourists and others who seek to enhance the social fabric of Irish life. This legislation seeks to redress that imbalance and to grant that greater facilitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ironically, although we have focused on the abuse of licensed premises by a minority in society, we have not used common sense in tackling the problem at its root. If we have had the common sense to know where these problems are we have not had the moral courage to grasp the nettle and tackle them. Instead we tackle the peripheral issues that surround the problem. This legislation seeks to correct that imbalance and leads us to inevitable action against the greatest <Col N="136" /> abuse of our licensing laws, that of under-age drinking.</P>
    <P>As I have said, our society and our visitors now seek greater facilitation in Irish public houses. In order to provide this the Minister has seen fit to address the issue on two fronts. First, he seeks to eliminate many of the medieval regulations that seek to unreasonably limit the number of licensed premises and, second, he proposes to broaden the activities in which licensed premises may engage.</P>
    <P>In an effort to eliminate the effects of the abuse of alcohol, good thinking people in the past sought to limit the number of public houses. They argued that by removing the occasion of sin you would eliminate it. With the great value of hindsight we are now only too well aware that human nature is such that its determination to follow a course of action cannot be diverted if it is strong enough. Limiting the number of public houses thus becomes a ham-fisted and unworkable way of trying to curtail alcohol abuse.</P>
    <P>In more recent times this out of date and ineffective thinking has had other ramifications. We have seen a greater movement of our people to the cities from the countryside and, in particular, to new suburban communities. Due to our archaic licensing laws many of these new communities are at a loss for the type of social interaction that characterised their former rural lives. Licences could not be had unless two country based licences were surrendered. The likelihood of the abandonment of these licences in rural communities is rare in diminishing communities where there is a growing need for socialisation. Simply put, the licensing laws, some of which extend back well over a century, do not fulfil the needs of urban or rural life in the 21st century.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's proposals to amend the licensing arrangements and to remove the barriers of entry to the trade. These include the abolition of the requirement to eliminate two licences in rural areas and the prohibition on granting a licence within a mile of an existing licensed premises. The Minister also proposes to eliminate the need to extinguish a licence within urban areas and prove an increase in population in these areas; a licence may be issued in substitution for an existing licence based on the fitness of the applicant, the fitness and convenience of the premises and the adequacy of the existing number of licensed premises in the vicinity; the development of a scheme for holders of restricted licences to convert them to full licences and the enhancement of the procedure where an interim transfer of a licence is sought based largely on the requirement that the person seeking it is a fit person.</P>
    <P>In order to allow a greater use of public house facilities the Minister has ensured that his legislation will abolish the distinction between summer and winter trading and increase opening hours for licensed premises on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 10.30 a.m. to 11.30 p.m. and on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 10.30 a.m. to 12.30 a.m., all with 30 minutes <Col N="137" /> drinking up time. As regards Sunday nights the Minister might comment on whether Sunday opening hours should be the same as Mondays to Wednesdays. This matter was raised in the Seanad. The abolition of the closing time on Sundays between 2.00 p.m. and 4.00 p.m. is welcomed as is the provision for both on and off licences to open for non-licensed business at 7.30 a.m. There is also provision for on or off-licenses engaged in non-licensed business to open for off-license sales at 8.00 a.m.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also looked at the area of special exemptions and has been consistent in ensuring that arbitrary regulations from another time do not interfere with modern responsible social intercourse. To this end, he has provided that the Bill removes the restriction on the granting of a special exemption for any time on a Sunday, be it after midnight on a Saturday or after normal closing time on a Sunday evening; removes the obligation to provide a meal as part of the conditions for the grant of a special exemption; authorises the extension of special exemptions to 2.30 a.m., unless the court orders a shorter period; removes the requirement that a premises be a hotel or restaurant for the grant of a special exemption; allows drinking up time in the case of special exemptions and club authorisations and will require that a special exemption will not cause undue inconvenience to persons residing in the vicinity of the premises involved. I have received many representations on that issue. A licence may have been granted years ago but an area is now built up and residents have to deal with unruly individuals leaving the public house at night. I know the Minister has been asked by residents' associations and community groups to ensure this is part of his thinking and that if a public house is causing a nuisance in an area the courts will consider that aspect.</P>
    <P>With the growth of the hospitality industry it is appropriate that the Minister reviews the laws which no longer apply to the way we reasonably wish to live our lives or which run contrary to the expectations of those who seek to holiday here. To this end, I welcome the provision to change the regulations applying to the restaurant and club trade. These include permission for restaurants with a wine licence to serve beer with a meal. I know from the many deputations I received and from meetings I was involved in with the Minister in relation to the restaurant industry that this will be well received. Some of those involved in Dublin have written to the Minister positively on the changes he has introduced in the restaurant industry. He is abolishing the requirement for a waiting area of a premises with a special restaurant licence to be no greater than 20% of the dining areas and the requirement for Bord Fáilte certification in respect of a special restaurant licence. He is providing that the extension of hours will apply to clubs under the Registration of Clubs Acts.</P>
    <P>One of the issues raised with the Minister was that of spirits being served in restaurants. I ask <Col N="138" /> him to review his thinking on this. One of our most famous drinks is Irish coffee. The Minister has gone a long way and I ask him to take another small step and allow this type of drink to be served. How much time is remaining?</P>

      <P>I want the Minister to resolve this issue without bias by providing Seamount College, Kinvara, with the same facilities as Gort community school, namely a single catchment area for both schools. This was on offer as far back as 1998 but with the proviso that both schools' boards of management must approve it. Seamount College's board of management approved the offer immediately. We all know that school transport schemes operated by the Department of Education and Science provide transport to students according to a precise set of rules which are applied nation-wide. These rules are applied strictly throughout the country and like any hard and fast rules they sometimes result in very difficult cases. Within the Seamount College catchment area there have always been students who fell foul of this rule. In addition, there are several students who, despite qualifying for school transport, were not accommodated because there was no bus in the area. A campaign on their behalf had been waged for many years by Seamount College, but to no avail. In recent years in the Seamount College catchment area, a significant number of students were provided with full transport to Gort, in clear violation of the transport rules. It is noteworthy that all the human errors that these were accredited to were to the disadvantage of Seamount College, while the full rigour of the rules continued to be applied to Seamount students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In support of these students, the college authorities simply requested an even application of the rules but this has not happened. After much pressure, the transport authorities eventually withdrew the Gort ticket they had issued, supposedly, in error, unfortunately creating inconvenience for the parents and students concerned. Nevertheless, Seamount was painted as the villain in the whole process with the view that the college was withholding permission for these students to travel. The board of management could not sign the document, especially since the basic entitlements &ndash; let alone the equivalent concessions &ndash; were not being made available to their own students. Eventually, the Minister intervened and issued temporary tickets to the Gort students. This action completely overruled all existing rules. <Col N="139" /> That is the current situation and the Minister must take responsibility for it.</P>
    <P>Seamount has no wish to inconvenience any parents or students travelling to Gort. It has a duty to protect its own students and its own school. The Minister cannot allow a veto to exist in favour of one school which has caused serious consequences in the other one, namely Seamount College. A group of parents want to have their daughters educated in Seamount College, which they are entitled to do, and they must be provided with inward transport to Kinvara, just as boys and girls from the Gort catchment area are allowed outward transport to Gort. The Minister should act decisively to prevent chaos in another new school year. He should not continue to be partisan in this delicate situation. The Minister has caused much of it in the past by his biased bungling of the situation to date. There is no reason both schools cannot co-exist, providing an excellent education as they have done over the years. The 19 girl students wishing to be educated in Seamount College must be provided with school transport inwards to Kinvara, as is currently available outwards for Gort students.</P>
    <P>This problem has been on the Minister's desk for far too long. Why is he delaying? Can he not implement or direct a decision to be made whereby all involved must work to it without being selective, to the advantage of one side. The Minister for Education and Science replied recently to Deputy Richard Bruton saying that the Department was currently examining the matter. An article in the <i>Irish Independent </i>of 18 February stated that:</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Dea has also set up a departmental committee to look at one of the more substantial reforms proposed by an Oireachtas committee, that is a review of the catchment areas where the post primary scheme is based. The committee said a review of the area boundaries was overdue because of changes in population distribution and educational practice.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will have good news for the parents of Kinvara.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to correct one deliberate mis-statement on the part of Deputy Ulick Burke. I did not act in gross violation of any rules. I changed the rules as I am entitled to do, and I stand over my decision to do so in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seamount college is located in the Kinvara catchment area. The college caters for girls only. Gort is an adjoining catchment area with one school, Gort community school, which is co-educational. The original position was that for transport purposes, boys living in the Kinvara catchment area were eligible for transport to Gort community school as there was no post primary school provision for boys in the Kinvara centre. Girls were considered ineligible for full transport <Col N="140" /> provision to Gort as they could be catered for in Seamount college. Transport was not provided for girls from the Gort catchment area who wished to attend school in Kinvara.</P>
    <P>In 1998 a number of families residing in the Kinvara catchment area asked that the terms of the school transport scheme applicable to girls in that catchment area who attend post-primary school in Gort, be re-examined. At the time such pupils were given catchment boundary facilities only to Gort, provided they were basically eligible for transport in the first instance, i.e. where they reside at least three miles from Seamount college. They were expected to make their own travel arrangements to meet the bus at the nearest pick-up point in the Gort catchment area.</P>
    <P>The Parents' complaint was that while the bus collected boys at or near their homes, their sisters had to travel to the catchment boundary to get on the same bus &ndash; an absolutely ludicrous situation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>In re-examining the relevant terms of the scheme, a number of issues had to be addressed. The Department is responsible for ensuring that requests for school transport do not unreasonably threaten the viability of existing schools, to which parents, teachers and the State &ndash; through taxpayers &ndash; have already committed resources. However, the Department was also required to consider the practical difficulties experienced by the families in question, arising from the rigid application of the scheme in their area.</P>
      <P>It was considered that in the unusual circumstances where members of the same household could be appropriate to separate catchment areas on the basis of their gender, pupils who would not ordinarily qualify for transport to another catchment area may be allowed to board the bus at the same point as those with a full transport entitlement, provided no extra State cost is involved.</P>
      <P>This revision, whereby girls from Kinvara were allowed to board the school bus for Gort, was put in place in September 1998. The board of management of Seamount secondary school were unhappy with the arrangement whereby there was no reciprocal arrangement to transport girls from the Gort catchment area to Seamount. The Department's position was that in the case of the girls from Seamount to Gort, no additional costs arose as a bus route already existed for boys. The reverse situation did not apply, and to carry girls from Gort to Seamount would require a new bus service for pupils who could be accommodated in Gort and would be a deliberate infringement of the catchment boundaries in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an effort to resolve the problem in so far as was possible, the management authorities of the Seamount and Gort schools were subsequently asked to reconsider the implications of having one catchment area to include post-primary schools in Kinvara and Gort. This would allow <Col N="141" /> girls to enrol in either school and once they were three miles from the school which they attended, they would be eligible for school transport. It was hoped that this would resolve the transport problem for girls who wish to attend either centre under the school transport scheme. Both school managements would have to agree this strategy. That is the normal procedure in a case where a re-drawing or removal of catchment boundaries is proposed.</P>
    <P>The response to the proposal was that while the Seamount school management expressed support, the management of Gort community school was opposed. In the circumstances, the proposal was not proceeded with and it is my understanding that the matter remains unchanged, and that the opposition which Gort has expressed remains.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Adjournment debate this evening. Over the past few days I have spoken to a number of teachers in my constituency and in particular in the Dublin 8 area whose schools are in areas classified as disadvantaged and who are participating in the Breaking the Cycle programme. It is a matter of great concern that many of these schools are at risk of losing one or more teachers in the coming school year because the number of pupils on the roll does not meet the bureaucratic requirements. If this should happen and they should lose teachers, much of the excellent work that has been done in the past few years will be negated and the students, schools and parents will be the losers.</P>
      <P>When the Breaking the Cycle programme was introduced there were clear ground rules concerning the allocation of teachers. It was agreed that the allocation under the programme would not be touched throughout the five year pilot stage. If the Breaking the Cycle programme is to be anything other than a public relations exercise, it is imperative that the complement of teachers is retained.</P>
      <P>A system whereby the teacher allocation is decided in September for the following school year is totally unrealistic and unworkable for schools that have disadvantaged status. It is also unfair in that the effort, dedication and commitment of a small number of people, often working under great pressure, is significantly damaged by the negative impact of such a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ironic that in one school, for example, when the numbers were assessed last September, they had dropped by seven on the required number to retain their quota of teachers. Eight months later, it is clear that the numbers will exceed that of last September and will be above the required level, yet this school is to be penalised by the loss of one teacher that it cannot afford to lose. In another school it has been noted that having a special class will require the deployment of the current remedial maths teacher to the special class duties. These are retrograde steps <Col N="142" /> which will inflict serious damage on the morale of the entire school.</P>
    <P>It reflects the commitment and indeed the appreciation of the principal teachers of all the schools that I have spoken to that they acknowledge, without reservation, the enormous dedication and commitment of their staff. They recognise that it can be difficult at times for all of them. There are many behavioural, psychological and social problems that are manifested in the classroom, yet the school principals acknowledge the change in morale, the happy atmosphere and the many innovative projects undertaken in their schools as a result of the additional, if still somewhat inadequate, resource. Activities such as computer projects, after school clubs, producing language videos and field trips are now an integral part of their school programmes. The teachers, support staff, parents and pupils are justly proud of their achievements.</P>
    <P>One of the schools that I refer to is Scoil Treasa in Donore Avenue, which was described by a visitor to the school recently as the university of young children in Dublin. However, in order for schools like Scoil Treasa to sustain and develop the progress that has been made, it is essential that present staffing levels are maintained. In the current climate of teacher shortages, teachers have a choice of locations and a choice of school. If morale is seen to be low because of the burden of additional work, the perception of being forgotten and the very demanding workloads that are part of teaching in these schools, it will be impossible to retain teachers.</P>
    <P>Principals in many of these schools are burdened with enormous administrative duties in addition to teaching responsibilities. This should also be reviewed and provision made to allow a full-time administrative post for many of these schools. Other schools are in need of additional resource teachers, secretarial assistance or a counselling service.</P>
    <P>The integrated services process is a Government initiative to develop new procedures to meet the needs of communities with the greatest level of disadvantage as a basis for a model of best practice. Most of the schools I have referred to fall within the ambit of the integrated services process in Dublin 8. It is a terrible waste and very short-sighted to withdraw support at this stage for a project that shows enormous promise and one that is dependent on the empowerment of the individual, which is provided by education. In effect, a constructive, positive and committed investment in education is an investment in the future of the children and their communities.</P>
    <P>The teachers in these schools are generous and committed but they are also afraid and angry. They are afraid that they will lose the ground they have worked so hard to achieve and they are angry because they believe they are ignored, dismissed and forgotten once again.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to review the real needs of these schools and to take account of their disadvantaged status when deciding on the resources <Col N="143" /> that are to be allocated. It is vital that the progress that has been made is now retained. Their needs are far too great to be evaluated merely as part of a numbers gain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Education and Science has set the tackling of educational disadvantage as a priority and he will be bringing forward proposals for a major initiative to address the needs of pupils who are encountering educational disadvantage at both primary and second level.</P>
      <P>I will begin by drawing the Deputy's attention to the Government's major initiative of December last to provide 1,000 additional teachers to schools. This will further reduce the pupil-teacher ratio at both primary and post primary levels.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a range of other initiatives was introduced in the past two years to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools. They include improvements in the staffing schedule for the appointment and retention of teachers and particularly reductions in the retention and appointment figures for one-teacher schools. Other initiatives include the allocation of additional posts towards specifically helping the educationally disadvantaged and the introduction of a maximum class size guideline of 30. These initiatives have helped to improve substantially the pupil-teacher ratio.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science has allocated more than 300 extra resource teachers and more than 700 special needs assistants to cater for children with special needs within the primary system. The Department is continuing to extend these services in response to assessed needs.</P>
      <P>In September 1999, the remedial teacher service was extended to every first and second level school in the country with a pupil teacher ratio of 10: 1 or more. Schools with lower ratios have also been advised that they may apply to the Department of Education and Science for a remedial service where they can demonstrate a need for such a service.</P>
      <P>The Educational Research Centre recently issued a comprehensive questionnaire to all primary schools, including schools in the Dublin area. The responses from schools, which are now being assessed by the Educational Research Centre, will allow for an accurate identification of levels of disadvantage in every school.</P>
      <P>Based on the levels of need identified, the Minister's objective is to introduce a range of significant and specifically targeted interventions, which will ensure that disadvantaged children will receive the support they require to enable them to succeed in the education system. The interventions in question will take the form of extra teacher support or extra funding, or both, depending on the nature and level of need identified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other improvements have also taken place at second level in the same period. In the current school year, 225 additional posts were created and a further 280 posts were retained. As a result, <Col N="144" /> the pupil-teacher ratio has reduced from 15.4:1 in 1998-99 to an estimated 15.1: 1 in the current year. This will reduce further with the allocation of the extra posts announced last December.</P>
    <P>There are at present 211 second level schools designated as disadvantaged. Each of the disadvantaged schools is allocated an additional teaching post. The schools also qualify for increased funding. In addition, each of the schools has been invited to participate in the home-school-community liaison scheme in the current year. They were allocated a half post each for this purpose. All schools in the free education system have an entitlement to an ex-quota allocation in respect of remedial education. The allocation for a particular school year is determined by the enrolment at the end of the proceeding September. Schools with enrolments of 600 or more get a full post. Schools with less than 600 pupils get a half post.</P>
    <P>Additional teaching resources are being allocated to facilitate an expansion of the leaving certificate applied programme. It is also intended that the junior certificate school programme will be made available in an additional 100 second level schools over the next few years. This will be encouraged by an improved teacher allocation for this programme.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy of the commitment of the Minister for Education and Science to build on the developments I have already outlined and to ensure that all schools designated disadvantaged are given the support they require.</P>

      <P>It is sad that I have to raise this case in the Dáil. With no disrespect to the Minister who is present, there are three Ministers in Agriculture House and I am disappointed not one of them is here to deal with this problem.</P>
      <P>The family concerned applied for 10.35 hectares on their 1999 area aid application. The Department stated there were only 9.16 hectares when it processed the application, a difference of 1.19 hectares. That means a penalty of 2.38 hectares resulting in payment on 6.78 hectares only.</P>
      <P>This matter has been going on for 12 months. The family has submitted copy maps and title deeds to prove their entitlement to the land. They even called personally to the area aid unit last year to resolve the matter. The wife telephoned the local number on several occasions and has dealt with five different people in the area aid unit. These people are very frustrated. The wife came into my office on two occasions last month and was very upset because she cannot put up with the problem for much longer. This problem was resolved last year but it has arisen again this year. The other problem is that these people are not told why their payments have not arrived. They must then find out why they have not been paid, which cannot be resolved over the telephone. It does not matter that the local number is low cost because if anyone rings the area aid unit, they are put on hold for up to an hour. This is not fair to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When documents are submitted to correct <Col N="145" /> errors, it can take several weeks for them to be dealt with. In 1998, area aid officials travelled around the country to resolve commonage problems yet the same problems resurfaced in 1999. Applicants are paying back interest and losing money because of high telephone bills due to the Department's inefficiency. What does a farmer have to do to clear a problem on his application? They cannot telephone because they are put on hold. This family went to the unit in person and the problem was still not resolved.</P>
    <P>It was no wonder that on page 28 of the Ombudsman's report last week, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development was severely criticised because of the way it deals with complaints and the public. There was a major complaint about the area aid unit. It is not good enough. The Department should immediately establish complaints boards in each county so people do not have to keep telephoning and writing.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Walsh, yesterday said he supported anti-poverty initiatives. This family has been caused great hardship by the Department which has made them wait for their payment. They have been doing their best. They went to Dublin to try to resolve their problem, spoke to five different officials and a year later their problem still has not been resolved. I do not want to hear the Minister of State telling me the payments made last year. We have to deal with the problems, not the payments made. I did not want to take up the time of this House tonight but it is wrong that a family must suffer and wait without a structure in place to deal with their problem.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister is not here but I am not surprised &ndash; the Three Wise Men came from the east and we have three disasters from the south dealing with agriculture. If any Minister was doing his job, he would not allow what has been going on in the area aid unit for the past few years to continue. I hope the Minister of State will have a satisfactory response in relation to this case. This family is suffering &ndash;  they have debts and loans to repay and they have to feed their children. They are not asking for anything from the State &ndash; all they are asking for are the agriculture payments due to them.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy I understand the area aid system very well. The person named submitted an area aid application in respect of 10.35 hectares of land in 1999. However, part of the parcel which she claimed overlapped with land claimed by another applicant. The other applicant successfully claimed entitlement to the overlapped area. Consequently, the area for her land was reduced on the Department's electronic database to 9.16 hectares. In the meantime, the herd owner has continued to maintain that the boundaries to her plot which were entered on the <Col N="146" /> Department's electronic database were not entered correctly and she submitted the most current schedules, maps and folios available to her with her 2000 area aid application last month. At the same time she increased the area on which she was claiming area aid for 2000 to 11.42 hectares.</P>
      <P>While the schedules and folios submitted with the area aid application for 2000 would support a claim for 11.42 hectares, the most recent map which she has submitted only supports an area of 9.9 hectares when entered on the Department's database. It may be that the map that she has submitted does not outline all the land available to her. The area aid unit will make contact with the person named within the next few days and will send her the most up-to-date orthophotographic map outlining her parcel. If she feels that the map does not adequately reflect all of her holding, she should amend the map if appropriate and return it to the area aid unit as soon as possible so it can be entered on the Department's electronic database. The Department is anxious to clarify the position and to resolve any remaining difficulties in this case without further delay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue. I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, for attending the House at this late hour. I hope he will urgently convey this matter to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the fact that it requires his immediate attention before someone is killed or seriously injured.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is already aware of the proliferation in the number of end of life cars since the introduction of the NCT. More or less simultaneously in the Dublin area, the facility at Hammond Lane which was used by the local authorities for the recycling of cars suffered a fire which resulted in further health and safety requirements. The outcome is that local authorities, as well as having to pay for the collection costs of cars also have to pay for their decontamination prior to recycling. This involves draining the cars of petrol and the removal of batteries.</P>
      <P>At a time when the number of calls for this service is growing at a phenomenal rate, the local authorities cannot absorb the additional costs involved. The end result is that in the Dublin and greater Dublin area all the local authorities, bar one, which is now considering it, have introduced charges to the public for the disposal of cars. This is bad enough but there is a further anomaly whereby the responsible citizen who arranges for his car's disposal has to pay a charge of £40 or £50 and is at a relative disadvantage to the many persons who arrange to have their cars burnt out. It is wrong that the system encourages these people in this free service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I contacted several of the local authorities in Dublin who reported that the number of burnt out and abandoned cars has trebled in the first three months of this year. Clearly the system of charging for car disposal is not an incentive to <Col N="147" /> responsible behaviour. I ask the Minister to refund to local authorities the cost of car disposal so at least there is no disincentive to proper disposal and no excuse given to those who are selfish, thoughtless and far from civic minded.</P>
    <P>Abandoned cars are now a litter problem but they are much more than that. I am raising this matter not primarily as a litter problem but because it is a major public safety issue in many parts of urban Dublin and other cities around the country, particularly in disadvantaged areas where nightly citizens are subjected to terrifying scenes of joyriding and acrobatics before the cars are finally thrashed and burnt out. In most cases, drivers are little more than children in charge of lethal weapons. If this is allowed to go on, nothing is surer than that there will be fatalities.</P>
    <P>I have heard reports of owners handing cars to children because they have failed the NCT. Others are more suspect in dealing with their disposal problems. They park their open cars with the keys in the ignition, usually outside somebody else's house. Either way, a person who behaves like this can be confident that their disposal problems are over and at no cost to them. This is mindless and incredibly selfish behaviour for which no penalty can be too great. It certainly requires more than a litter fine.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to refund to the local authorities the costs involved in disposal, at least to obviate the need for a charge which only gives these people an excuse to dump their cars. The Minister will be aware a new end-of-life tax on cars will be introduced shortly under an EU directive so the cost to the Exchequer will only be temporary. This is an urgent issue and I ask the Minister to respond positively to my request.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government apologises for being unable to be here tonight and has asked me to respond on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Available data indicate that the number of end-of-life vehicles, or ELVs, arising annually in Ireland has increased significantly in recent years. This is due to the growth in new car sales, the effects of Government and industry car scrappage schemes and, no doubt, to the introduction of the national car test. As I will outline shortly, it is the intention that the motor industry would develop a producer responsibility initiative in relation to ELVs which, among other things, will ensure that they are recovered in an acceptable manner.</P>
      <P>Of course, most ELVs are not abandoned. Legally and otherwise, it is clearly incumbent on the owner of an ELV to dispose of it in a responsible manner. This can be done by transferring it to a facility that has been permitted by the relevant local authority to undertake the dismantling and recovery of vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="148" /> Furthermore, I understand that some local authorities provide a service for the acceptance and safe disposal of ELVS, either free of charge or on foot of a modest fee. For instance, Dublin Corporation and Fingal and Dublin South County Councils operate a free vehicle acceptance scheme, while the Deputy's own authority, Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, charges £40 per vehicle for this service.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, abandoned vehicles are, regrettably, a perennial problem and local authorities around the country have various arrangements in place to collect and deal properly with these vehicles. The Minister agrees there recently appears to be a visible increase in the scale of the problem. However, there is no information to suggest that cost is a significant obstacle to the proper management by local authorities of these ELVs. I understand that, generally, the cost to an authority of engaging contractors to collect abandoned vehicles is quite modest, as it is offset by the scrap value of the vehicle. Accordingly, the Minister has no proposals to augment the substantial funding currently being provided to local authorities. In any event, the Minister is not satisfied it would be a proper response to the grossly irresponsible dumping of vehicles to simply accept such behaviour as a fact and resignedly meet the costs involved in cleaning up afterwards.</P>
    <P>The law is clear. A general duty of care applies, <i>inter alia</i>, to the owner of an ELV and the Waste Management Act, 1996, specifically prohibits the abandonment of vehicles. The enforcement and implementation of this legislation is a matter for local authorities, and the Minister is seeking a greater effort to identify and legally pursue those responsible for the illegal dumping of vehicles. As the Minister has already indicated to the House, he will emphasise the need to take such action when meeting local authority managers over the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>Looking further ahead, the Department of the Environment and Local Government has initiated discussions with the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, with a view to the development by the industry of a producer responsibility initiative in relation to ELVs.</P>
    <P>Initial proposals for an ELV management system for Ireland were submitted by SIMI in December 1999 and were circulated for consultation to various Departments and State agencies and a number of representative associations and other bodies. On foot of the various submissions received, the Department will shortly have further discussions with SIMI and other concerned parties in order to progress the development of a cohesive and practicable industry led scheme. It is the objective to secure agreement on an acceptable vehicle recovery scheme not later than the autumn of this year.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 31 May 2000.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is to provide a basic weekly allowance to people who have little or no income. Any person living in the State who satisfies a means test and who has applied for any other benefit or assistance to which they may be entitled, may be eligible to receive assistance under the SWA scheme. Assistance may be given in the form of a basic payment, a supplement or an exceptional needs payment.</P>
      <P>The legislation governing the SWA scheme makes provision for a health board to make a single payment to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. These payments are known as ENPs. There is no automatic entitlement to an ENP.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on ENPs was between £21 million and £22 million in each of the last three years. Expenditure on the SWA scheme totalled £209 million in 1999, of which ENPs accounted for £21.9 million or 10.5%. In 1998 expenditure was £180.6 million of which ENPs accounted for £21.4 million or 11.8%. In 1997, total expenditure on the SWA scheme was £158.2 million, of which ENPs accounted for £21.6 million or 13.7%. While the absolute value of ENP expenditure has been more or less constant over the last three years, it has declined as a proportion of overall SWA expenditure.</P>
      <P>Details of expenditure on ENPs for the years 1987, 1988 and 1989 are not available as expenditure on the SWA scheme was not then broken down into different payments. Total expenditure on the SWA scheme was £31.9 million in 1987, £34.3 million in 1988 and £36.5 million in 1989.</P>
      <P>The estimate for expenditure on the overall SWA scheme for the next three years is £239.2 million in 2000, £268.0 million in 2001 and £299.3 million in 2002. The estimate for expenditure on ENPs over these years is £24 million in 2000, £26 million in 2001 and £28 million in 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government has committed itself to the realisation of true equality for women and to ensuring that women can realise their full potential in Irish society. In a recent address to the national conference on the national anti-poverty strategy the Taoiseach singled out women's poverty as being one of the key issues to be addressed under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. In addition, one of the main principles underlying the NAPS is &ldquo;the reduction of inequalities and in particular, addressing the gender dimensions of poverty&rdquo; and a number of developments have taken place which aim, <i>inter alia,</i> to ease the burden on predominantly female-headed households.</P>
      <P>A working group to examine the tax and social welfare treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent families was established in May 1997. Underlying the necessity of such a review was a need to ensure fairness in the way that the State supports families of all types, while at the same time providing assistance for families who are at particular risk of poverty. This group's report, issued in August 1999, provided a valuable input into consideration of this area. Furthermore, a major review of the impact of supports for one-parent families is near completion and it is intended to make whatever changes are required to help lone-parents and their children avoid poverty traps and long-term dependency.</P>
      <P>The introduction of poverty proofing across all Government Departments, which aims to assess significant policy proposals at design stage for their impact on the poor, is also a major step in this regard. Lone parents, older people, and single adult households are among the groups given particular attention in this process.</P>
      <P>My Department also recognises that women, in both urban and rural areas, can experience particular problems arising from poverty and marginalisation and that women's groups and community groups have an important role in tackling these problems. Particular emphasis is placed in the various grant schemes operated by my Department on support for community-based initiatives targeted at disadvantaged women. Schemes of particular relevance in this regard are the community development programme, the family and community services resource centre programme, and the scheme of grants for locally-based community and family support groups. The pilot family services project initiative will provide information on parenting, including child care family mediation and other services available locally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="151" /> With regard to this Government's commitment in relation to old age pensions, substantial progress has been made in the last three budgets towards meeting our commitment to increase the old age contributory pension to £100 by 2002. This will be of very significant benefit to households headed by elderly women.</P>
    <P>Women's poverty is one of the central issues for consideration in the review of the national anti-poverty strategy under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Possible new targets will be considered, in consultation with the social partners, under the themes of women's poverty, child poverty, health, older people and housing-accommodation. Working groups are currently being established to advance the review process which will be completed by the third quarter of 2001. I expect that the NAPS review will further assist in the development of policies which address the concerns of women living in poverty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 43, 45, 60 and 74 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the Government's commitment to carers, as set out in An Action Programme for <Col N="152" /> the Millennium, and arising from the review of the carer's allowance which was published by my Department in October 1998, I introduced major improvements to the carer's allowance scheme in the 1999 and 2000 budgets.</P>
    <P>One of the many measures I introduced in 1999 was a new annual respite care grant and in budget 2000 I made provision to increase this grant from £200 to £300. This grant is payable to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and to carers who are caring for recipients of a constant attendance or prescribed relatives allowance to use in whatever way they choose. The feedback on this payment, in enabling carers to have some break, has been good and I will keep its operation under review bearing in mind the point raised by Deputy McManus.</P>
    <P>In budget 2000 I announced the introduction of a new carer's benefit which will come into operation in October to support people who must leave the workforce to care for someone who is in need of full-time care and attention. I also extended the free electricity allowance and free television licence schemes to all qualified carers from October thereby ensuring that carers will qualify for all free schemes from October.</P>
    <P>The extensive measures that I have introduced in recent budgets to benefit carers clearly indicate my personal commitment and that of the Government to carers. This is reflected in the number of carers in receipt of carer's allowance and the increased expenditure. There are currently 15,238 carer's allowances in payment, an increase of over 60% in the number of carers claiming the allowance since this Government took office. Expenditure on carer's allowance was £36.5 million in 1997 and is projected to be £78.3 million this year, representing an increase of 115%.</P>
    <P>In the review of An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government pledged to put in place a co-ordinated approach addressing the needs of carers. One of the key priorities is to develop a partnership model to facilitate the development, by the State in conjunction with the private sector, of an improved system for meeting long-term care costs.</P>
    <P>To this end, one of the remaining proposals arising from the review of the carer's allowance will be examined this year. A consultancy study will be undertaken to examine issues relating to long-term care, both in terms of cost and possible partnership approaches and the possible role of the PRSI system in this regard.</P>
    <P>Another of the key priorities identified in the Government's review of its action programme is to establish a pilot system of needs assessment for carers and people needing care to be operated by the health boards. This area is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Health and Children. However, I understand that the Western Health Board has agreed to undertake this pilot project in their area and that needs assessments will be commencing in the near future.</P>
    <P>The review of the carer's allowance noted that the carer's allowance is an income support pay<Col N="153" /> ment and not a payment for caring. As with all other social assistance schemes, a means test is applied to ensure that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need. The means test has been eased significantly in the past few years, most notably with the introduction of disregards of income from employment and other sources, and the review noted that the means test is one of the more generous tests in terms of the assessment of household income. The review concluded that the means test should be maintained as a way of targeting public resources towards those who are most in need.</P>
    <P>However, the review did recommend the payment of a continual care payment to recognise all carers who were providing the highest levels of care. This would be a non-means tested payment available to all carers, including social welfare recipients, regardless of their income. In order to provide this payment, an assessment of the care levels being provided would be required. This proposal will be examined further when the pilot project on needs assessment has been completed.</P>
    <P>The review also examined the issue of a cost of care allowance and considered it to be within the remit of the Department of Health and Children. It is similar to the requests for a cost of disability payment which the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities recommended should be introduced by the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>The creation of a database containing details of the level of caring provided and types of services required, as proposed by the Deputy, could only be developed following a needs assessment and therefore, is also a matter for the Department of Health and Children who have responsibility for the health and services provision in this area.</P>
    <P>The question of further improvements to the carer's allowance and for carers generally will be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of our key priorities in the care area, as set out in the review of our action programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 58 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="154" /> From 1953 until 1996, benefit and pension payments from the social insurance fund have exceeded contribution income. The balance has been met by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The detailed figures for the deficit and surplus from 1990 to 2000 are in a table which I am arranging to have circulated in the Official Report. In summary, the figures from 1990 to 1996 show a deficit; the size of this has fluctuated over the time period, ranging in size from just over £41 million in 1994 to over £214 million in 1995. Since 1997, the fund has shown a surplus in each year, which has been gradually increasing from £6.6 million in 1997 to an estimated £275 million in 2000.</P>
    <P>Regarding future projections, indicators are that the surplus will continue to increase in the short-term. It is estimated that the surplus will, in each year, range from £275 million in 2000 to about £1,250 million by 2005. These figures assume that benefits will increase only in line with inflation, and also take account of the increased contribution income from projected wage growth &ndash; no account is taken of future possible improvements in the social insurance system. Again, the detailed figures are in the tables which I am circulating.</P>
    <P>As I have previously indicated, PRSI income is currently buoyant due to the increased numbers of persons in the workforce and the economic climate generally. The availability of social insurance fund resources has enabled me to widen the contingencies covered by the social insurance system. This year's Social Welfare Act provides for the introduction of a carer's benefit which will be paid, without a means test, to all workers who are required to take time out of the workforce in order to provide full time care and attention for incapacitated persons. This is an innovative enhancement of the social insurance system and will be of significant value to all workers who have to balance work responsibilities with their responsibilities to care for persons who are sick or incapacitated.</P>
    <P>While the financial position of the fund is secure in the short-term, significant funding challenges lie ahead in the medium and long-term. These arise mainly from the increase in the numbers of older persons in society, the vast majority of whom will have an entitlement to a pension paid from the fund. The Government decision to set up a reserve fund to part pre-fund social welfare pensions in the long-term represents a significant commitment by the Exchequer towards ensuring that pensions will be paid in the future. The current social insurance fund surplus will play an important role in the financing of projected growth in social insurance expenditure in the medium term as well as improvements in the rate and range of benefits provided. I am fully committed to safeguarding the fund and to the enhancement of the social insurance system so that it continues to be a key component in the delivery of social protection in this country in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>The pre-retirement allowance is a means-tested payment which allows a person aged 55 or over to opt to retire from the labour force and receive a weekly allowance. To qualify for the payment, the person concerned must be in receipt of a long-term unemployment payment, or be no longer entitled to one-parent family payment or carer's allowance.</P>
      <P>It is important to recognise at the outset that the scheme is entirely optional and there is no obligation therefore on anyone to avail of PRETA. Unemployed people over the age of 55 who wish to continue to seek work are allowed to remain on unemployment assistance. Furthermore, there is no restriction on a person in receipt of PRETA, coming out of retirement and returning to employment if they so wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current strong performance of the Irish economy is reflected in a steady reduction in the <Col N="156" /> numbers seeking to avail of the scheme in recent years. More than 60% of PRETA recipients are aged 60 or more. Given this age profile, I expect the decline in numbers to continue in the future.</P>
    <P>I have asked my Department to examine ways of supporting older unemployed workers back into the workforce and to look at the future role of PRETA given the changed environment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>This Government is committed, as set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium, to providing the mechanism to allow women, who take time out for family reasons, to continue contributions for pension purposes, in recognition of the fact that women who leave the workforce to undertake family responsibilities in the home face difficulties in maintaining their social insurance record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="157" /> Certain measures have already been introduced to address this issue. Special arrangements are in place to help people who work in the home to qualify for an old age contributory pension. From 6 April 1994, years spent out of the workforce caring either for children up to the age of six, increased to age 12 from 6 April 1995, or incapacitated people may be disregarded in calculating the person's yearly average number of contributions for old age contributory pension purposes. A maximum of 20 years may be disregarded in this way. Provision is also made for the award of credited contributions in the year in which a person commences or ceases to be a homemaker. In addition, earnings of up to £30 per week where a person is engaged in part-time employment outside the home are also permitted.</P>
    <P>The <i>pro rata</i> pensions which I introduced in November 1997 and the new arrangements to take account of pre-1953 contributions, which came into effect earlier this month, will be of benefit to many women who have gaps in their PRSI records due to working in the home.</P>
    <P>However, I recognise that issues remain to be addressed in this area and, as I have stated, I have ordered a review of this issue. Accordingly, the review of the existing arrangements for homemakers will be undertaken as part of the ongoing review of eligibility conditions for contributory old age pensions. I have asked that proposals be brought forward which I will consider in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>My Department has been directly involved in activities to tackle the problems of moneylending and overindebtedness since 1988 and has been funding the Money Advice and Budgeting Service programme since 1992. By the end of 1999 the Department was supporting 50 MABS projects, thereby providing a service countrywide.</P>
      <P>The local projects, funded by the Department and managed by a committee drawn from local voluntary and statutory services and community groups, operate in partnership with other relevant agencies. The projects are independent information and advice providers, rooted in the local community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The MABS budget has grown from £260,000, six projects, in 1992 to £4,542,000, 50 projects in 2000. The successes of the service are clear to see. I am satisfied that the time has now come to go one step further and establish the MABS on a statutory basis. This is about giving formal recognition in legislation to the MABS as it is working <Col N="158" /> and as it has worked so well over the past years and not about changing the key features and advantages of the service as currently structured. I want to enhance and support the autonomous nature, the voluntary management and the sense of community ownership of the independent local MABS projects, while establishing a formal legislative basis for their continued funding, support and development into the future.</P>
    <P>I should stress that my Department will consult with the MABS National Advisory Committee, comprising representatives of all MABS stakeholders, in determining the precise form of proposals for legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>I expect to be in a position to submit proposals for Government approval by the end of the summer with a view to publication of a Bill in early 2001.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>The Government decided to disperse asylum seekers throughout the country due to a shortage of accommodation in the Dublin area and to introduce a system of direct provision to cater for their needs. This decision is being implemented by the directorate for asylum support services which was established under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to manage services for asylum seekers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main objective of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is to make up the difference between a person's means whether in cash or in kind and their needs. Where a person has access to some resources either in cash or in kind this is taken into account in determining entitlement to SWA. This occurs in the case of asylum seekers in direct provision who are being provided with full board accommodation, all meals and other essential services. In such cases the recommended weekly allowance is £15 per adult <Col N="159" /> and £7.50 per child to provide for personal requisites. Furthermore, where there are other reasonable expenses exceptional needs payments, ENPs, will be made by the health boards.</P>
    <P>My Department received a representation dated 11 February 2000 from SIPTU who represent some of the community welfare officers of the health boards highlighting their concerns regarding the plan to set up the directorate to deal with asylum seekers under the programme of direct provision. Officials from my Department also met SIPTU and Impact representatives on 16 February 2000 to discuss the issues raised in SIPTU's letter. The points outlined above were included in my Department's response to SIPTU's representation and discussed with the unions representatives.</P>
    <P>In addition, I am setting up a working group comprising representatives from relevant Departments to examine certain issues related to the assessment of need for SWA purposes. The terms of reference of the working group are to review the existing arrangements for the payment of basic weekly supplementary welfare allowance to people who have means other than cash to partly meet their basic needs; to review the circumstances in which people claiming SWA rent supplement are refused on the grounds that they are not in need of accommodation; and to consult with interested parties and to make appropriate recommendations.</P>
    <P>Membership of the working group will consist of nominees of the health boards, the Department of Finance, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and the Department of the Environment and Local Government, in addition to representatives of my Department, which will chair the group.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the first meeting of the working group will be in early June and I have asked the group to report to me in September.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>As stated in my reply to a similar question recently, this Government is particularly concerned about children living in poverty. Consideration is being given to the introduction of policy responses on a number of fronts to help ensure that our children are given the opportunity to break out of the poverty cycle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains a number of commitments on child wel<Col N="160" /> fare. In the context of the forthcoming review of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy, new targets will be considered under various themes, including child poverty. These targets are to be considered in consultation with the social partners.</P>
    <P>On a more general note, all policy proposals across Government Departments are poverty proofed to ensure that the needs of children, among other target groups, are kept to the fore in the design of policy.</P>
    <P>With regard to the specific issue of the Combat Poverty Agency's suggested minimum income for children, this issue will be considered further in the light of the report of the working group on the benchmarking and indexation of social welfare rates, which will be set up in the context of the PPF.</P>
    <P>The Government shares the view that child benefit represents a key instrument for tackling child poverty. As a universal payment, which is not taxable and is not assessed as means for other secondary benefits, it does not act as a disincentive to taking up employment or to improving wages.</P>
    <P>The recent 2000 budget provides for substantial improvements in the monthly rates of child benefit, resulting in a full year increase of some £106 million, bringing the total provision in 2000 to a record £504.6 million. In addition, the PPF contains a commitment to substantially increase child benefit over the lifetime of the programme, with a priority focus towards £100 per month for the third and subsequent children. From September, the basic child benefit monthly rates will have risen to £42.50 in respect of each of the first two children and £56 in respect of the third and subsequent children.</P>
    <P>The best way out of poverty, for both adults and children, is employment. It is Government policy to ensure that everybody has the opportunity to participate fully in society and work is the key to achieving this objective for those who can work. The unemployment rate is now well below the EU average and the live register has fallen by over 93,000 since we took up office in June 1997.</P>
    <P>Long-term unemployment has fallen more rapidly than the live register as a whole and employment opportunities have increased. Measures such as the family income supplement have helped encourage parents back into the workforce. By increasing income from work, not just the individuals themselves benefit, but the families and communities in which they live.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>Last December's social welfare budget package, which is the biggest ever social welfare budget allocation amounting to more than £428 million on a full year basis, provided for a £7 a week increase for pensioners over 66, a special increase of £5.90 a week for invalidity pensioners aged under 65 years, and a £4 increase for other recipients under 66.</P>
      <P>The £7 increase for pensioners represents an increase ranging between 7.9% and 8.9%, while the £4 general increase represents an increase ranging between 5.2% and 5.6%. With a predicted annual average rate of inflation of 4% this year, it will be seen that this year's increases are well ahead of expected inflation, representing real increases ranging between 1.2% and 4.7%.</P>
      <P>In addition, special increases in the rate of qualified adult allowances have been provided this year, as part of an overall strategy to increase this allowance to 70% of the main rate by 2002. These increases, which range between 7.7% and 17.2%, represent real increases of between 3.6% and 12.7%.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, as part of the process of aligning tax and social welfare changes by 2001, all of these increases have been paid four weeks earlier this year, from the beginning of May.</P>
      <P>The National Anti-Poverty Strategy Statement: Sharing in Progress provides that all social welfare payments would be increased to the minimum of the lower range recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare by the end of 1999. This was fully achieved last year and now in 2000 all social welfare rates exceed to an even greater extent the commission's target rate.</P>
      <P>With regard to the broader question of the adequacy of social welfare rates, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains a commitment to set up a working group to examine the issues of developing a benchmark for adequacy of adult and child social welfare payments, including the implications of adopting a specific approach to the ongoing up-rating or indexation of payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is also committed to achieving a minimum rate of £100 a week for all social welfare old age pensioners by 2002; to bringing this target forward to 2001 in the case of contributory old age pensioners; and to ensuring that over its term of office all old age pensions will increase in line with average industrial earnings. Following the improvements which we have made over the last three budgets we are now well on target to <Col N="162" /> implementing our priority commitments for old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>The new Programme for Prosperity and Fairness also provides that over the period up to 2003, all social welfare rates will be increased in real terms and substantial progress will be made towards a target of £100 a week for the lower rates of payment. For families, substantial progress will be made towards a target child benefit rate of £100 per month for the third and subsequent child.</P>

      <P>To qualify for a social insurance payment, a person must fulfil all the relevant conditions including the social insurance contribution conditions relating to the particular benefit being claimed. These contribution rules aim to preserve a fair balance between average contributions and average benefits.</P>
      <P>Two underlying principles are reflected in the setting of equitable contribution conditions for entitlement.</P>
      <P>The first is that the claimants' record of contributions should be sufficient in terms both of initial establishment in the scheme and of consistency over a period of time. The second is that there should be a difference according to whether a person is claiming a short-term or a long-term benefit. In the case of the latter, where a person will be drawing heavily on the resources of the social insurance funds, it is considered appropriate that the tests should be more stringent.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, short-term benefits such as disability benefit and unemployment benefit, require the claimant to have paid a minimum number of contributions, 39 weeks, and to demonstrate a recent attachment to the workforce by having a minimum number of contributions in a recent tax year. For long-term benefits, such as the old age contributory and retirement pensions, the person must have paid a more substantial minimum number of contributions, 156 weeks, and must also have a prescribed yearly average over their working lives.</P>
      <P>Under social insurance provisions, temporary periods of absence from the workforce in the case of illness, unemployment, maternity leave, parental leave, etc. are catered for through the provision of credited contributions for the duration of these periods. Credited contributions have the effect of preserving a person's existing entitlements during such periods of absence from the workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="163" /> In the circumstances, therefore, it is considered that the existing contribution conditions for entitlement to disability benefit are fair.</P>
    <P>Where a person does not have sufficient contributions in order to qualify for disability benefit, they may qualify for supplementary welfare allowance, which is subject to a means test.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since it was formed in 1997, this Government has demonstrated a commitment to the process of social inclusion and has introduced policies to help ensure that every individual has the opportunity to participate fully in society.</P>
      <P>While the National Anti-Poverty Strategy provided the framework for the implementation of cross-departmental policies to reduce poverty, economic and social developments since then have convinced this Government that the strategy needed to be reviewed to reflect the changed economic, social and cultural circumstances now prevailing in Ireland. In this regard, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides for an updating of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy, including a review of the underlying methodology, a review of existing targets and consideration of new targets.</P>
      <P>Plans to get that review up and running, with the involvement of the social partners, are well under way. The publication of the Combat Poverty Agency study will play an important role in the debate on poverty issues and in the further development of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy.</P>
      <P>The review of the NAPS will incorporate a number of elements and will address many of the recommendations identified in the Combat Poverty Agency report. Existing targets will be reviewed and new targets considered under the themes of child poverty, women's poverty, health, older people and housing-accommodation. This process will be completed during the first 18 months of the programme.</P>
      <P>Emerging causes of poverty will be analysed and mechanisms for strengthening the involvement of the social partners will be examined. The issue of data collection for the monitoring and evaluation of poverty will be examined, in line with commitments contained in the PPF. In addition, the programme provides for the roll-out of the NAPS to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="164" /> The poverty proofing of policies will be independently reviewed by the National Economic and Social Council with a view to strengthening that process. Following this review, poverty proofing will be extended on a phased basis to local authorities and health boards.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in the speech I delivered at the Combat Poverty Agency conference on 11 May, we now have the opportunity to effectively eliminate poverty in this country. This Government has worked throughout its term to tackle the root causes of poverty across various themes of income adequacy, unemployment, disadvantaged urban areas, rural poverty and educational disadvantage. While we are already seeing reductions in consistent poverty, its eventual elimination is something for which we, as a society need to strive.</P>
    <P>One of the most important steps we can take towards eliminating poverty is to maintain and enhance an active debate on the means towards achieving this end. As the Combat Poverty Agency has indicated in its study, to eliminate poverty will require the right policies and the resources and the will to implement them effectively. The investment of £1.5 billion in social inclusion measures during the period of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is testament to the Government's commitment in this area. The comprehensive section on social inclusion in the programme ensures that the policy focus will remain fixed on this issue in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>I visited New York and Chicago during the period 2-5 May where I met representatives of the various Irish immigrant resource centres and other organisations to discuss how my Department could assist and support the centres in the provision of information, advice and assistance to Irish immigrants at ground level.</P>
      <P>Given the dispersed nature of the Irish throughout America, the path to success obviously lies in working with organisations in the various areas and in that regard we have always appreciated the fact that organisations in the United States work so well together to co-ordinate the services to the highest standards. Clearly, information and advice for Irish immigrants in the States continue to be the key need, particularly at ground level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a means of addressing this need, I took the opportunity, during my visit, to launch the <i>Returning to Ireland</i> booklet and an information leaflet on the operation of the Ireland-USA Bilateral Agreement on Social Security which my Department put together for the purpose of pro<Col N="165" /> viding essential information for people who have emigrated.</P>
    <P>As the economy continues to thrive, there will be increasing demands for skilled workers. This presents good opportunities for Irish people working abroad to return to Ireland. From talking to people who have emigrated, I get the impression that almost every Irish emigrant leaves home with the clear intention of returning again in the future but it is probably true that their wish to return is also tempered by the availability of suitable employment back home &ndash; the opportunities for employment or self-employment are now there.</P>
    <P>During my visit, I also took the opportunity to address the two-day annual general meeting of the Coalition of Irish Immigrant Centres in Chicago where I sought to develop contacts between my Department and a network of immigrant organisations to enable them to work together in the future to improve the flow of quality information.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains a commitment to set up a working group, with an independent chairperson, to examine the issues of developing a benchmark for adequacy of adult and child social welfare payments, including the implications of adopting a specific approach to the ongoing up-rating or indexation of payments.</P>
      <P>Following the recent ratification of the programme, the Department of the Taoiseach is in the process of finalising the composition, including the identification of an independent chairperson, and is in discussion with the social partners in this regard. Once an independent chairperson has been identified and agreed on, this working group will be convened. Once the working group is established, my Department will play a leading role in the deliberations of the group, in conjunction with other relevant Departments.</P>

      <Col N="166" /> The issues to be covered by the group are set out in the programme. These include relative income poverty, as well as the long-term economic, budgetary, PRSI, distributive and incentive issues. These are highly complex issues which will need careful study. The outcome of the work of the group will have a significant impact on future policy in this regard, and I look forward to receiving the results in due course.</P>

    <P>The total of 15,465 appeals received during 1999 represented an increase of more than 10% on the number, 14,014, received in 1998. So far this year the rate of increase has accelerated, with receipts for the first four months showing an increase of 22% over the same period last year.</P>
    <P>The average time taken to process appeals determined during 1999 was 21 weeks. This average has been maintained during the first three months of 1999 despite the increase in appeals received. The average period given includes all phases of appeals including the additional time involved in the determination of appeals where, for example, further investigations have to be made or where adjournments have been sought by the appellant or by the legal representative acting on his behalf.</P>
    <P>The social welfare appeals system is a quasi-judicial one and the procedures involved are designed to ensure that every appellant's case gets full and satisfactory consideration. There is an inevitable time-lag inherent in such a process which is governed by statutory and fair procedure requirements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="167" /> In some cases appeals can be dealt with on the basis of information supplied by the appellant and the Department's deciding officer without recourse to an oral hearing and these would take less than the average time. Where an oral hearing is required, however, an additional delay is inevitable.</P>
    <P>While processing times in the social welfare appeals office compare favourably with international experience in this area, the achievement of further improvement in these times is a major objective of the office. However, at all times it is necessary to ensure that progress in this regard is achieved in a manner that is not in conflict with or at a cost to the demands of justice and the requirement that every appeal be fully investigated and examined on all its merits.</P>

      <P>The final report of the Commission on the Family Strengthening Families for Life was published by the Government in July 1998 and contains a comprehensive analysis of the issues affecting families in Ireland and wide-ranging recommendations across several policy areas. The Government is committed to adopting a families first approach by putting the family at the centre of all its policies. The family affairs unit established in my Department has a function to pursue the findings in the commission's report following their consideration by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government priorities for the development of family policy and services have brought about significant progress in areas highlighted by the Commission on the Family. Considerable extra resources, this year amounting to some £10 million, have been provided for the development of family services in my Department. Major improvements include a record £3.75 million this year for voluntary organisations providing marriage and child counselling services and bereavement counselling and support services &ndash; this is more than four times the amount provided in 1997; a nationwide family mediation service, now available in ten centres around the country, is in place as promised in An Action Programme for the Millennium. I now plan to establish the service on a statutory basis; some 64 centres are in receipt of funding or have approval in principle to join the family and community services resource centre programme for which some £3 million has been allocated this year &ndash; the target is 100 centres over the coming years; and I have introduced a families research programme to help shape the development of family policy and ser<Col N="168" /> vices in the future and a feasibility study into a national longitudinal study of children in Ireland is to be undertaken by my Department jointly with the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>Family services projects providing high quality information about the range of supports available to families from State agencies and the community and voluntary sector with a particular emphasis on services available locally are being piloted in three local offices of my Department &ndash; Cork, Waterford and Finglas. The Government has allocated £12 million in the national development plan for the progressive expansion of the successful elements of the pilot over the period 2000-06.</P>
    <P>More than 1,000 people from local voluntary groups that work with families have attended family service information fora which I have held throughout the country. The fora provide an opportunity to discuss the findings of the Commission on the Family and the needs of local communities in supporting families.</P>
    <P>Government priorities to radically improve provision for pensioners, carers and dependent spouses and children in households on low incomes address areas highlighted by the commission in its report. The £428 million budget package for social welfare increases this year is an innovative package to improve the position of those who are most vulnerable in society.</P>
    <P>My colleagues in Government are progressing a number of significant pro-families policy issues in their own areas of responsibility. The Minister for Education and Science has initiatives under-way in relation to early education, investment in primary level schools and to tackle educational disadvantage. The Minister for Health and Children is advancing a national children's strategy. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was responsible for introducing the Parental Leave Act in December 1998 and £250 million has been provided in the national development plan for child care initiatives. In the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness the Government and social partners are committed to support family life, offer choices for families and equal opportunities for both men and women to play an active caring role in families. This Government is committed to continued progress in this important area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 288 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the background to this case in view of the detailed letter which I sent to her on 13 April in keeping with the undertaking I gave in my response to an earlier parliamentary question from the Deputy on 11 April.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 4.3 of the Civil Service disciplinary code provides that an officer may seek a review of disciplinary proceedings on one or more of the following grounds: that the provisions of the disciplinary code were not adhered to; that reasonable steps were not taken to ascertain the relevant facts; that all the relevant evidence was not considered or was not considered in a careful and unbiased fashion; that the officer concerned was not afforded reasonable facilities to answer the allegations(s); that the officer concerned could not reasonably be expected to have understood that the behaviour alleged would attract disciplinary action; and that the sanction recommended is grossly disproportionate to the offence.</P>
      <P>In the case referred to by the Deputy, the person concerned, who is an employee in my Department, sought a review, by the Civil Service disciplinary code appeals board, of the decision to impose disciplinary action. The grounds specified in the appeal were that: all the relevant evidence was not considered or was not considered in a careful and unbiased fashion; the officer concerned could not reasonably be expected to have understood that the behaviour alleged would attract disciplinary action; and the sanction recommended was grossly disproportionate to the offence.</P>
      <P>Following detailed and lengthy consideration of the appeal, the board formed the opinion that a case had not been established on any grounds set out in paragraph 4.3 of the disciplinary code for the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>During the course of the proceedings, unsubstantiated allegations of bias were made, by and on behalf of the person concerned, against the Department. The board was satisfied, however, that the issues taken into account in reaching the decision to impose disciplinary action related to the sending of a letter by the employee in question and his subsequent failure to substantiate the allegations contained therein.</P>
      <P>In approving the decision to impose disciplinary action, I was satisfied that the procedures of the disciplinary code were followed.</P>

      <P>Child benefit is a universal payment which is payable in respect of all children up to the age of 16 years. Child benefit continues to be paid up to age 19 in the case of children who are still in full-time education and in the case of children with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The structure of the child benefit scheme ensures that additional resources are targeted at the larger families, who are at greater risk of poverty, through the existence of a higher rate of payment in respect of the third and subsequent qualified children. The rate of payment is currently £34.50 per month for each of the first two qualified children and £46.00 per month in respect of the third and subsequent qualified children.</P>
      <P>The rate of child benefit payable is determined solely on the basis of the number of eligible children in the family. It is not determined on the basis of the place of each individual child within the family. Accordingly, where one of a family is no longer a qualified child for child benefit purposes, the overall rate of benefit payable is adjusted in accordance with the number of remaining qualified children. I consider that this approach is reasonable.</P>
      <P>The value of child benefit as a means of channelling child income support is reflected in the very substantial investment which the Government makes in the scheme. Most notably, the 2000 budget provides for a full-year investment of almost £106 million, bringing the total investment in the scheme up to some £575 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that the value of the child benefit scheme will continue to be exploited to the greatest possible extent.

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme a weekly supplement may be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to certain people in receipt of social welfare or health board payments. The SWA scheme is administered by the health boards on behalf of my Department. The investigation of the type of case outlined by the Deputy is a matter for the relevant health board and my Department would not normally be involved or notified of such instances.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to a rent supplement is determined by the health boards and supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6.</P>
      <P>This £6 represents the minimum contribution which clients are required to pay from their own resources towards their accommodation costs. Any increase in income over and above the SWA rate will result in a decrease of that amount in the rent supplement rate payable.</P>
      <P>The purpose of rent supplements is to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible persons living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.</P>
      <P>The conditions for entitlement include that the applicant is in need of accommodation, the residence is reasonably suited to the residential and other needs of the claimant and that the rent payable by the claimant is just and proper having regard to the nature, character and location of the residence.</P>
      <P>When an application is made the community welfare officer will ensure that the applicant satisfies the conditions of the scheme before granting the rent supplement. The CWO will access my Department's registration and payments database to check on the circumstances of the claimant. The CWO will also visit the accommodation before the supplement is awarded or shortly afterwards to satisfy themselves that all the conditions are satisfied.</P>
      <P>This will be followed up by regular reviews of the case, including periodic visits to the residence, to ensure continued entitlement to the rent supplement.</P>
      <P>All claimants are advised that failure to disclose details which would affect their entitlement to rent supplement, such as income derived from a partner's employment or otherwise, is an offence and could lead to legal action being taken.</P>

      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains a commitment that the establishment of a social insurance fund board with representation from the social partners will be examined. This examination will begin in the near future.</P>
      <P>The examination will need to take into account the possible roles of a social insurance fund board, the composition of such a board including the role of the social partners, the existing legal responsibilities of myself, as Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, the Minister for Finance and the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to the fund, and the legal responsibility, if any, that a new board would have. In addition, the role of a new board <i>vis-à-vis </i>the Pensions Board, given the latter's existing role in providing advice regarding pensions, including those pensions paid from the fund, would also need to be given detailed consideration.</P>
      <P>A further relevant issue is the announcement by the Minister for Finance last year that the Government had agreed to set up a fund to part pre-fund social welfare pensions. The role and supervisory structures of a social insurance board will, therefore, need to be considered in the context of the legislative arrangements, including supervisory structures, which will be put in place in respect of the new reserve fund. My colleague, the Minister for Finance, will be introducing legislative proposals for the setting up of the reserve fund in the coming months.</P>
      <P>I intend to bring forward legislation to provide for the establishment of the board in the Social Welfare Bill, 2001, following appropriate consultation.</P>

      <P>The family income supplement scheme was introduced in 1984 with the specific purpose of providing an incentive to low-paid employees with families to take up or remain in full-time employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of extending the scheme to cover the self-employed has been considered on a number of occasions. Such consideration would have regard to a range of factors including the practical difficulties associated with extending the scheme to the self-employed; the arrangements already in <Col N="173" /> place to provide income support to self-employed people on low incomes; and the cost of introducing such a measure in the context of the need to prioritise the use of the limited resources available for the development of the wider social welfare system.</P>
    <P>Self-employed people whose income falls below the rate of unemployment assistance appropriate to their family circumstances are entitled to claim UA. The rate of UA payable depends on the person's means. In assessing means, account is taken of the net income which the applicant may reasonably expect to receive in the next year.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the family credit scheme, which operates in Northern Ireland and throughout the United Kingdom, includes provision for the self-employed. I should say that the scheme differs significantly from the family income supplement scheme in the manner in which the income supplement is calculated.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the UK has recently converted family credit from a social welfare payment to a tax credit. In this regard, the Deputy may be aware that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness includes a commitment to examine the question of paying FIS through the tax system.</P>

      <P>I have been very conscious of the need to have extensive and genuine consultation so that the forthcoming White Paper properly and adequately reflects the issues that are of real importance to the community and voluntary sector. The consultation process was in three phases. The first phase provided for information seminars and invited submissions from interested parties. The second phase involved a series of joint regional workshops for the voluntary and community groups and the statutory agencies. The final phase provided for a national seminar to which people were invited to discuss the issues addressed by the steering group in their discussion papers.</P>
      <P>Following the seminar, my Department revised the discussion papers to take account of observations made by delegates at the seminar and written submissions received from individuals and groups following the seminar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness gave a commitment that the White Paper would be published in April 2000. At a steering group meeting held on 11 April, members of the group expressed concern that the end of April might be too tight a timeframe to allow for the inclusion <Col N="174" /> of feedback from submissions made following the national seminar. The group also asked that the timeframe be extended to enable the group to make comments on revisions made to the discussion papers before circulation to Government. As my primary concern is to ensure that there is genuine consultation in the preparation of the White Paper, I agreed to this request.</P>
    <P>A further steering group meeting was held on 18 May to provide an opportunity for the steering group to address the issues raised during the national seminar and subsequently received written submissions. My Department is currently making further revisions to the discussion papers to reflect this process.</P>
    <P>When complete, I will finalise my proposals for discussion at Government in the coming weeks. At this stage I intend that the White Paper will be finalised in June.</P>

Work on the preparation of the Bill is well under way and one of its key features will be the provision of a legislative framework for the introduction of personal retirement savings accounts. It is hoped that this will facilitate increased savings for pensions and provide a vehicle to extend supplementary pensions coverage overall, especially to people who have no such cover at present, as set out in the Pensions Board report Securing Retirement Income.</P>

      <P>The report of the interdepartmental committee on childcare recommended that funding be provided totalling £5 million per annum for community groups towards developing out of school hours services. The committee anticipated that the provision of this funding to less well off communities would address a number of issues, for example, the provision of low cost out-of-school child care for parents who <Col N="175" /> are in the paid labour market, practical support for children who need additional support to maintain their interest in school, the promotion of parental and community involvement in engaging young people in school and community life and the provision of additional community based services for families.</P>
      <P>As announced in Budget 2000, an annual allocation of £5 million has been provided to my Department to support provision of out-of-school hours childcare services in disadvantaged communities.</P>
      <P>It is proposed that the £5 million funding will be mainly made available to the projects funded under the community development support programmes such as a community development programme; a family and community services resource centre programme, core-funded community and family support groups programme.</P>
      <P>In keeping with the spirit of partnership which informs the way in which these community development programmes are managed in my Department, a working group representative of the local community development groups themselves and other interests and expertise in the childcare area has been set up to advise on the detailed design of this scheme and in particular issues such as criteria for applications, technical support needs, service standards, staff issues, etc.</P>
      <P>A circular has issued to all projects funded under the community development support programmes. Given the need to allow sufficient time for groups to draw up and submit applications, there will be three separate rounds of funding with closing dates for receipt of completed applications as follows: 26 May 2000; 30 June 2000; and 22 September 2000.</P>
      <P>A number of applications have been received for the first round of funding and the working group will meet to assess these applications.</P>
      <P>A separate circular on the scheme will be prepared shortly for other local initiatives not currently funded under the community development support programmes who wish to apply for funding under the Department's out-of-school hours child care scheme.</P>

      <P>There is a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to produce a publication in the context of a review of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. <Col N="176" /> The review is part of my Department's series of programme evaluations and commenced in February 2000. The report outlining the findings is expected to be completed by the end of next year.</P>
      <P>One of the key objectives of the review is to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the current policy and administrative arrangements and to make recommendations for improvements where required. The review will include a widespread process of consultation with users of the SWA service, information providers and other interested parties including the social partners and the health boards who administer the scheme.</P>
      <P>The operation of discretion by community welfare officers is an important feature of the SWA scheme. It enables health boards to respond in a flexible and timely manner in a wide range of circumstances where hardship would otherwise occur. This flexibility and responsiveness is one of the main strengths of the scheme and it is made possible by the fact that the health boards can exercise discretion. However, it is not possible or desirable to set out hard and fast rules governing the circumstances in which all of these payments are made. In some categories of cases, there may be no need for the use of discretion because it is clear that the circumstances of the persons concerned warrant a payment.</P>
      <P>These matters will be examined in detail by the working group undertaking the review. In particular, the working group will examine whether the correct balance is struck between rules-based entitlements and discretionary payments within the SWA system. It may be possible to identify some needs which can be better met in some other fashion, for example, through improvements in other schemes or through new schemes.</P>
      <P>Discretion will remain a fundamental feature of the SWA scheme to meet needs which cannot be met or are not being met through other means. A booklet of comprehensive guidance on discretionary payments such as exceptional needs payments and urgent needs payments was published in 1996. In addition, circulars are issued to health boards from time to time to give guidance on various aspects of the scheme, as the need arises. A user-friendly publication outlining community welfare officer guidelines on the operation of discretion in the supplementary welfare allowance system will be drawn up in the light of the points made in the course of the consultation process and the findings of the review itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of insurance is primarily related to insurance claims experience. The relatively high cost of insurance for young drivers is directly related to their adverse claims experience, as a risk category. The 1996 Deloitte &amp; Touche report on an economic evaluation of insurance costs found that the average cost of an insurance claim for 17 to 24 year old drivers is twice that for the 36 to 40 age group and that motorists in the 17 to 24 age group are responsible for over three and a half times the total average claims costs incurred for motorists in the 36 to 40 age group.</P>
      <P>Motor insurance premiums are normally based on underwriting experience including trends in the level, frequency and cost of claims, for particular risks and classes of risk and are a matter of judgment by individual private insurance companies. Any changes in circumstances affecting the risk insured would have to be assessed by the insurer, from an underwriting standpoint. The premium charged and the availability of a quote, will reflect any material increase in the risk.</P>
      <P>For those motorists who are having difficulty getting a quote for motor insurance and in recognition of the compulsory nature of third party motor insurance the declined cases agreement between the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Irish Insurance Federation offers the motorist the opportunity of a motor quotation subject to certain criteria.</P>
      <P>It is abundantly clear that the primary focus of initiatives, aimed at reducing the cost of motor insurance, must be on reducing the frequency of accidents and the associated cost of claims. The key, therefore, to reducing insurance costs for young drivers is to create appropriate conditions for improving their standards of driving and their appreciation of road safety.</P>
      <P>A number of initiatives are in place and are being taken to improve driving standards and safety awareness, amongst all drivers, including young drivers. The Irish Insurance Federation, in conjunction with the Driving Instructors Register, has introduced a scheme of insurance premium discounts, for the young driver on completion of a required number of driving lessons. The National Safety Council, in co-operation with the gardaí, continue to promote anti-speeding and anti-drink driving media campaigns, including road safety educational programmes for secondary school students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My re-establishment of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board was a major initiative aimed at providing us with information and advice on trends in motor insurance costs and with policy recommendations for addressing those costs. The expanded membership of the board, which includes a member representing young drivers' interests, is broadly representative of all of the <Col N="180" /> interests concerned including road safety and enforcement experts.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79, 85 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>The national development plan (NDP) sets out the strategies for Ireland's continuing economic and social development over the period 2000-2006. The plan provides for three national (inter-regional) operational programmes, two of these are the employment and human resources development operational programme and the productive sector operational programme. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is the overall managing authority for both programmes. The third operational programme is the economic and social infrastructure operational programme which is under the aegis of the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>The operational programmes will contribute to the overall national objective of the NDP by, continuing sustainable national economic and employment growth; consolidate and improve Ireland's international competitiveness; foster balanced regional development and promote sustainable development through increased social inclusion, more environmentally friendly development and improved economic growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both operational programmes have been submitted to the European Commission and are awaiting approval. The programmes will be supported by programme complements, which will outline in detail the measures under each oper<Col N="181" /> ational programme. The programme complements will be submitted to the monitoring committees, set up under each programme, for approval. The monitoring committees supervise and monitor the implementation of all measures under the operational programmes.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the various measures in the operational programmes will be the responsibility of a number of implementation bodies. These bodies, under the aegis of my Department, include IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and FÁS.</P>
    <P>County enterprise boards promote micro enterprise development within the national development plan. While the boards are under the aegis of my Department the measures to give effect to their development are contained within the regional operational programmes.</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of community employment (CE) as an active labour market measure is to reintegrate long-term unemployed persons into open labour market jobs. Individuals get the opportunity to update their skills and gain a recent track record of work experience which will assist them in gaining employment in the open labour market. Depending on their age and employment status participants can remain on the programme for a period of up to three years.</P>
      <P>Persons remain eligible for CE schemes until the upper age limit of 65 years, in accordance with the official retirement age. Community employment is an active labour market measure with a strong emphasis on progression to open labour market employment and is not intended to be a substitute for a job. It is intended that the operation of the programme will be kept under review in the light of changing market developments, including the age profile of labour supply.</P>

      <P>The effect of the dangerous substances (retail and private petroleum stores) (amendment) regulations, 1999 (S.I. No. 424 of 1999) is to extend the relevant provisions of the dangerous substances (retail and private Petroleum Stores) Regulations, 1979 (S.I. No. 311 of 1979) as amended by the dangerous substances (retail and private petroleum stores) (amendment) regulations, 1988 (S.I. No. 303 of 1988) until 31st December, 2001. In essence, the 1999 regulations will enable so-called kerbside petrol stations to continue to be licensed under existing arrangements until that date.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns that both family businesses and local communities may have in relation to S.I. No. 303 of 1988. It was for these and other reasons that my officials asked the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health (HSA), which is responsible for the enforcement of the regulations, to review the eligibility requirements under the current licensing system. As a result of this review it is my intention to introduce further statutory provisions governing the licensing and operation of all petrol stations. The new provisions are being designed to be goal-setting in nature, imposing general duties on petrol station operators to store and dispense petrol in a safe manner. It is anticipated that the new measures will allow for the continued use of certain existing petrol stations which, under the current regulations, would not continue to qualify for the grant of a licence beyond 2001. Work on the preparation of the new statutory provisions is proceeding with a view to putting the measures in place as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Last August, I made the Retail Price (Beverages in Licensed Premises) Display Order, 1999, which obliges publicans to display a price list immediately outside or immediately inside each entrance to their premises.</P>
      <P>Following the making of the order, the Director of Consumer Affairs, who has responsibility for its enforcement, agreed to my request to undertake an intense inspection drive to make sure that the order was enforced. I understand from the Director that, following the making of the order, her inspectorate carried out an intensive survey of licensed premises to establish levels of compliance. These visits indicated that more than 75% of the publicans visited were not in compliance with the requirements of the order. I also understand that a programme of second visits was undertaken in January and February of this year and that, while these visits showed a lower figure of non-compliance, of 30%, it was clear that many premises were still not in compliance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the exercise to increase compliance, I understand that the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs (ODCA) wrote to the two <Col N="186" /> bodies representing the licensed trade in Ireland, giving details to them of their respective non-compliant members.</P>
    <P>Follow-up visits to licensed premises are currently being undertaken which I understand will be completed shortly. The Director intends to take legal action should these visits show continuing non-compliance and I fully support her in this action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the issue of safety on leisure craft, as the Deputy is aware, the action group on small powered recreational craft, including personal watercraft, recently presented me with its final report. On the basis of this, I propose the introduction of a legislative framework for the regulation of recreational craft. This is being achieved through amendments to the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992 which are included in the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Bill, 1999. The Bill passed the Dáil Report and Final Stage on 24 May 2000.</P>
      <P>The Bill foresees the implementation of regulations to take account, not only the safety of the passengers and occupants of the vessels in question, but also the safety of other persons resulting from the use of the vessels and any disturbance or nuisance caused by their usage.</P>
      <P>Following on the enactment of this Bill, I hope to quickly introduce implementing regulations based on the recommendations of the action group's final report.</P>
      <P>These regulations, allied to the recently launched &ldquo;Year 2000 Safety on the Water&rdquo; campaign, will contribute to an increase in safety in the water-based leisure sector and a resultant decrease in the emergency calls received by the emergency services in future.</P>

      <P>I propose answering Questions Nos. 99 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>A sum of £24 million has been allocated by the Government for tourism and recreational angling under the National Development Plan, 2000-06. Of this amount, £7 million has been allocated for the southern and eastern regional operational programme. The detailed arrangements for the expenditure of this funding will be finalised following EU approval.</P>
      <P>On the forestry side, it is estimated that £0.36 million will be paid to landowners in County Kildare in 2000 under the afforestation grant scheme, which forms part of the national development plan. It is not possible to estimate expenditure on other forestry measures as such is dependent on the level of uptake of these schemes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 to 104, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>On 29 May 2000 the ESB launched a report prepared by the National University of Ireland, Galway entitled &ldquo;Eel Fishing in the River Shannon: Eel Population Changes, Fishery Management Options and Fishery Conservation Issues&rdquo;. The stated aims of the report are to outline and review the research and development work undertaken during the ESB Shannon eel management programme from 1992 to February 2000; to indicate alternative fishery management measures that could be adopted in future years; to specify eel population parameters and environmental factors that should be monitored in future years and to provide general guidelines for the future development of the eel fishery and to highlight eel stock conservation issues.</P>
      <P>The Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1999, confers on the relevant regional fisheries board the power to grant an authorisation to use a fishing engine or a long line for the capture of eels. The Management of Eel Fishing Bye Law No. 752, 1998 sets at ten the maximum number of eel fishing licences for a long line which the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board may issue. I expect that the long standing practice whereby I authorise the catching by the ESB of eels for scientific purposes will continue in 2000.</P>
      <P>In the coming months I will establish an eel strategy review group to examine all issues relating to the development and regulation of the sector and to report to me. I will be inviting the key players in the sector to participate in the review, including the ESB.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The withdrawal of the Israeli armed forces from southern Lebanon on 22-24 May took place several weeks ahead of expectations. Nevertheless, <Col N="192" /> the situation on the ground has been relatively peaceful and the Irish forces serving with UNIFIL are all reported safe and well. It is not currently considered that Irish battalion personnel are at risk as a result of the recent turn of events. My Department and the Department of Defence will continue to monitor the situation closely in consultation with United Nations headquarters in New York and with our personnel on the ground.</P>
      <P>I wrote to the UN Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on 17 April and emphasised that the safety of the Irish troops is of paramount concern to the Government and that it was crucial that the security of the force be assured in the period after the Israeli withdrawal. During my subsequent visit to New York on 24-26 April, I met the UN Deputy Secretary-General, Ms Louise Fréchette, and senior officials of the UN departments of peacekeeping operations and political affairs to discuss developments. I again emphasised the absolute priority the Government attaches to the safety and security of our troops. The Deputy Secretary-General assured me that the UN shares our concerns for the safety and security of all UN personnel in southern Lebanon and that the UN is fully committed to sharing all information with troop contributing countries. Briefings have been given to these countries, including Ireland, since the Israeli withdrawal. The UN Secretary-General's special envoy, Mr. Terje Roed-Larsen, has now returned to the region and is meeting all the governments involved. He is seeking guarantees that they will fully co-operate with UNIFIL to enable it to fulfil its mandate in conditions of safety.</P>
      <P>My Department has also taken the opportunities presented by our ongoing bilateral contacts with Israel, both in Dublin and through our ambassador in Tel Aviv, to stress the importance that the Government attaches to ensuring the safety of our personnel. We have been assured of Israel's commitment to the safety of the UNIFIL force. In addition, I have discussed the situation in southern Lebanon with my opposite numbers from a number of countries, including the United States and France.</P>

      <P>As I explained to the Deputy in my reply of 10 May, because of an administrative error this application was misplaced after it was received in the embassy and was not registered in the embassy's books. The application was located following a search earlier this month.</P>
      <P>Because of a rapid increase in the numbers of applications from Chinese citizens for visas to travel to Ireland, the procedures in place for receiving and processing visa applications in the embassy have recently been reviewed. In addition, the embassy has deployed a recently engaged member of the local staff to work as a full-time assistant to the visa officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that these measures, along with <Col N="194" /> the anticipated construction of a purpose built visa office in the embassy compound, which, with the co-operation of the Chinese authorities, I hope, will be completed before the end of this year, will help to avoid a recurrence of this unfortunate incident in the future.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the long delay and the apparent loss of the passport caused much distress to the lady concerned and to her family. I am very sorry for what happened.</P>

      <P>Decisions on pipeline routing and connection to specific towns etc. are a matter for Bord Gáis Éireann and such decisions will be made by BGE on the basis of commercial criteria.</P>
      <P>BGE has applied for consent to construct a natural gas pipeline between Dublin, Galway and Limerick. I am aware of the need to process this application without undue delay but I must take account of the liberalisation of the gas market.</P>
      <P>The application will be considered from a shareholder perspective to decide whether the investment is prudent. It will be evaluated separately from a regulatory perspective. In this regard, a new regulatory regime for natural gas infrastructure is currently under consideration.</P>
      <P>I have engaged economic consultants, the Brattle Group, to advise on the development of a new regulatory regime for the authorisation of new pipelines and tariffs for third party access to the natural gas network. The aim will be to promote development of competition in the supply of gas and provide appropriate economic signals in relation to the establishment of new pipeline infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Brattle Group has consulted widely with <Col N="198" /> all interested parties and I expect to receive its report very soon. Following a short period to consider the recommendations, I will make the necessary policy decisions to effect and underpin the necessary changes.</P>
    <P>All proposals to construct pipelines, including the BGE proposal, will be examined in the context of the policy decisions made regarding the new regulatory regime. Therefore, I cannot say at this point when BGE's proposed pipeline will be laid or when a supply of gas will be available from the pipeline.</P>

      <QRef>[14852/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>(Mr. Walsh): This year's milk quota restructuring scheme will cater, as a matter of priority, for those producers who had been dependent on temporary leasing over recent years and for those producers who were unable, for reasons outside their control, to renew existing land leases. I decided to structure this year's scheme in this way following consultation with organisations involved in the industry and taking account in particular of the views of the milk quota review group.</P>
    <P>It was necessary, when deciding on the priorities for this year, to make particular provision for those producers who would be most directly affected by the change to the new regime and whose position, in the absence of priority access to quota, could be worse than last year.</P>
    <P>Of the total pool available for sale under the restructuring scheme, 85% will be allocated to producers who were dependent on temporary leasing over the past three years and to producers who were unable, for reasons outside their control, to renew existing land leases. The remaining 15%, plus any quota remaining unallocated after the entitlements of the special priority producers have been satisfied, will be allocated to all producers who applied for quota under the 2000 milk quota restructuring scheme. These allocations will be weighted in favour of producers in the small and medium size categories.</P>
    <P>The temporary leasing scheme will of course, continue to operate and I will announce details of that scheme at a later stage. The operation of the temporary leasing scheme, and in particular the setting of priority categories, will have regard to the outcome of the restructuring scheme.</P>

      <P>The late husband of the person named was a participant in the scheme of early retirement from farming and died on 13 August 1996. She then applied to have the pension paid to her, as his dependant, but my Department was obliged to refuse her application. A pension may continue to be paid to the dependant of a deceased participant if the dependent's resulting total income, including income from all other sources, is not greater than the maximum pension payable under the scheme together with the average industrial wage as determined by the Central Statistics Office. The application by the person named failed at the time because her total income, if her late husband's pension had been paid to her, would have exceeded that threshold. The pension then lapsed.</P>
      <P>My Department is most sympathetic to the circumstances outlined by the Deputy but unfortunately there is no provision for her previous application to be revived. As the scheme of early retirement from farming is approved and co-financed by the European Commission under EU Council Regulation 2079/92, my Department has no discretion in the matter.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on five cows and one other animal under the 1996 cattle headage scheme but listed 15 animals on the application form. Five of the animal tag numbers were duplicated and, therefore, were not eligible for payment. While he applied on six animals he was paid on the remaining ten animals, resulting in an overpayment of £93.20.</P>
      <P>Regulations provide that overpayments under the headage and premia schemes may be recouped from the next payment entitlements due under these schemes. In this case, an amount of £35.00 was recouped on 14 October 1997 and £28.65 was recouped on 18 May 1998 from his grants under the agrimonetary compensation for suckler cows which left an amount of £29.55 outstanding.</P>

      <P>For many decades past quarantine requirements have been in place for dogs and cats entering Ireland and the UK except in relation to dogs and cats travelling between both countries. The UK Government intends to dispense, with effect from 2001, with its requirement for quarantine for dogs and cats entering or re-entering the UK from member states of the European Union, the European economic area or rabies free islands, in favour of a regime involving microchip identification, vaccination, blood testing and health certification. In the meantime, and from the end of February 2000, it has introduced a pilot of this scheme, the PETS pilot project, using certain approved carriers along a limited number of approved routes from EU member states and EFTA countries to the UK.</P>
      <P>Ireland will not be operating a pilot scheme and, for the present, the existing quarantine requirements will continue to apply for animals entering Ireland directly from outside the UK, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man.</P>
      <P>However, in order to maintain the common control area operating between Ireland, UK, Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, I have made a limited adjustment to Ireland's rabies legislation. This allows pet dogs and cats entering the UK from qualifying countries to travel on to Ireland without the need for quarantine, provided they have come along routes approved under the terms of the UK PETS pilot project and have complied with all of the other conditions of that project. Such animals may originally have travelled from Ireland to any of the countries approved under the UK pilot project or may have originated in one of those countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="209" /> Irish travellers intending to avail of the scheme will be required to have their veterinary practitioners microchip, vaccinate, blood test and certify their dogs or cats before their departure, in the manner provided for under the terms of the UK pilot scheme.</P>
    <P>I will maintain close contact with my counterpart in the UK during the year in relation to the operation of the PETS pilot project and any further adjustment to our quarantine regime will be considered only in the light of the experience of this project and when further necessary consultations have been completed.</P>

      <P>Participants in the rural environment protection scheme must farm all their lands to the REPS specification for a contracted period of five years. As a general rule, any participant who reduces the area of the holding farmed under REPS during the contracted period must reimburse all aid paid on a <i>pro rata</i> basis. However, specific provision is made excluding afforested lands from the reimbursement requirement.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the fact that there is scope for closer integration between REPS and the forestry planting programme operated by the Department of Marine and Natural Resources proposals in this regard have been included in the draft rural development plan for the period 2000-2006 which has been submitted to the European Commission. In the process of preparing a REPS plan planners will be required to identify areas of the farm which would be most appropriate for afforestation on environmental, agricultural forestry and socio-economic grounds. Planners will receive training/guidance from both Departments on the criteria to be applied on prioritisation of land use between agriculture and forestry. Such criteria would include landscape, pollution control, carbon sequestration, wildlife and productivity-suitability of land for forestry and agriculture.</P>
      <P>Any afforestation of land which is the subject of a REPS plan will aim not to affect or disturb wildlife habitats as the intention will be to protect existing habitats and offer greater habitat area overall.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 153 and 154 together.</P>
      <P>Under the national development plan, NDP, the agriculture, food and related rural development area has been allocated substantial Exchequer and EU funding over the seven year period 2000-2006. The funding relates essentially to investment for farmers and the food processing sector. The following table gives full details.</P>
      <P>As regards progress under the NDP, the position is that negotiations with the European Commission on the Community support framework for Ireland, necessary to draw down the EU element of the funds, have recently been completed and the various operational programmes required have been finalised and submitted to Brussels. It is not possible to indicate at this stage when any of the schemes involved will commence but they will all apply in Kildare, with the exception of the western investment fund.</P>

    <P>As regards 2000, I have secured Government approval for payment of an increased level of Exchequer funding for local authorities in the context of the service contract arrangements which have been entered into between the local authorities and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. The total amount of funding available for 2000 is £3.8 million based on the assumption that the requisite staff and services are provided by each local authority and that their obligations under the service contracts are fully discharged. Payments to individual local authorities will be made in the course of this year on foot of properly documented claims.</P>

      <P>The report Gender Equality in the Civil Service is the outcome of research commissioned as part of the ongoing development of human resources management policies under the strategic management initiative, SMI, in the Civil Service. Delivering Better Government, DBG, noted that while the Civil Service had been to the forefront in developing and implementing policies to achieve greater equality of opportunity, nevertheless women employees remained concentrated at lower levels. In view of the need to redress the imbalance, DBG recommended that appropriate strategies be put in place. It was in this context that research was commissioned on the under representation of women in the grades at and above HEO level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main research findings, together with a package of measures based on the recommend<Col N="216" /> ations in the report, were endorsed by the Government and were presented by the Taoiseach and myself at the launch of the current phase of the strategic management initiative for the Civil Service in July, 1999.</P>
    <P>The key elements of these measures are: the development and adoption of a new equality policy; a programme of affirmative action in the main human resource policy areas of recruitment, placement and mobility, training and development, promotion, work and family responsibilities, language and sexual harassment and policy delivery; the adoption of strategic objective setting at individual Department/office level, including the setting of increasingly specific equality goals, to be achieved over a stated period of time; new equality structures to be put in place, both locally and centrally, to support implementation of the policy; and the adoption of a communications strategy for implementation.</P>
    <P>Work on the development and implementation of these measures is currently under way. A high level gender equality management group, chaired by Ms Josephine Feehily, Revenue Commissioner, is in the process of developing a new gender equality policy and framework programme of affirmative action for equality, in accordance with best standards of equal opportunities practices. A key element of the approach which the group is developing is the concept of strategic objective setting, whereby Departments and offices will be required to set for themselves increasingly specific goals for greater representation of women, particularly at middle and senior management grades. These goals will be realistic but challenging, will be based on increased female participation, will operate within the law and will not involve any deviation from the merit principle for selection.</P>
    <P>An essential part of the process will be discussions with the staff and unions on the implementation of the new policy and framework programme, in accordance with the approach adopted to SMI proposals generally. Work on drafting the new gender equality policy and framework programme of affirmative action is at an advanced stage and should be completed shortly. Discussions with the unions will commence as soon as the group has completed its deliberations.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the European Commission report entitled Public Finances in EMU &ndash; 2000 published on 23 May 2000. As the report itself states, it is essentially an issues paper &ldquo;whose aim is to contribute to the policy debate on the fiscal challenges in EMU&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>While a summary of the report was presented to ECOFIN Ministers in advance of its publication, there was no formal agreement by Ministers to abide by any of the recommendations contained in the report relating to taxation or any other policy issues. While I have noted with interest the key elements of the report, those elements do not constitute rules and do not have any binding impact on fiscal planning. As such, the issue of whether or not budget 2000 contravened the report does not arise.</P>
      <P>Finally, it should be remembered that the tax reductions contained in budget 2000 are part of a strategy to improve work incentives, increase labour supply and deliver moderate pay increases in the context of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. I am confident that this strategy will ensure continued sustainable economic growth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I firmly believe that the programme will run its full course. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, PPF, is the fifth partnership agreement and reflects a further endorsement of the model which has served us so well since 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are concerns that higher than expected inflation will undermine the pay terms of the <Col N="218" /> agreement. It should be noted that the increase in inflation in recent months has been due to a number of factors, many of which will decline in importance in the near future. The impact of the increase in tobacco prices will fall out of the index in December and the impact of the oil price increases and the fall in the value of the euro will decline over the course the year. As a result, headline inflation will be substantially lower by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Adherence to the terms of the PPF will ensure that the recent rise in inflation is temporary. It is the Government's view, therefore, that the pay terms of the agreement must be adhered to. These increases, when combined with further reform of income tax, will provide substantial increases in take home pay over the duration of the agreement.</P>

      <P>The additional standard rate band is available to married couples where both spouses have income. If the disabled spouse is in receipt of a payment or pension in her own right, then this would be considered a second income and the couple would, therefore, be eligible for married two earner treatment and could avail of the additional standard rate band.</P>
      <P>However, there are a number of other tax-free allowances available for people with disabilities. These are: the dependant relative allowance and the allowance for employment of a carer for an incapacitated person.</P>
      <P>In addition there are a number of further tax measures from which disabled persons can benefit. The first is medical expenses relief. Section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 provides for tax relief in respect of various defined health expenses. The disabled drivers scheme, details of which are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994, S.I. No. 353 of 1994, provide valuable benefits to those severely and permanently disabled persons who qualify under its terms. Under the scheme, a new car may be purchased every two years free of VAT and vehicle registration tax, subject to certain monetary limits. In addition the annual road tax is not charged and the qualifying person is eligible for the provision per annum of 2,728 litres of road fuel free of excise duty.</P>

      <P>An &lsquo;ambulance' is defined, in primary legislation, for vehicle registration tax, VRT, purposes, as a vehicle which has been specifically designed, constructed or adapted for the conveyance of injured or seriously ill persons to a hospital on a stretcher and which is permanently fitted to accommodate and hold in position one or more standard stretchers. Vehicles coming within this definition are classified as category D and while they are exempt from VRT, they are liable to VAT at the standard rate of 21%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purposes of the Disabled Drivers' and Disabled Passengers' (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994, a qualifying organisation is one which is recognised by the Revenue Commissioners as being chiefly engaged, in a volun<Col N="221" /> tary capacity and on a non-commercial basis, in the care and transport of severely and permanently disabled persons. Such organisations are eligible for relief from tax, including VAT and VRT, in respect of vehicles which have been specially constructed or adapted for the transport of disabled persons.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that certain branches of the Order of Malta have been recognised as qualifying organisations for the purposes of the regulations and that tax relief has been granted in respect of six qualifying vehicles to date. Relief was refused in respect of two vehicles, in one case because the vehicle was fully funded by the Eastern Health Board, and in the other case, because the vehicle was an ambulance, as defined, and therefore excluded from relief under the Disabled Drivers' and Disabled Passengers', (Tax Concessions) Scheme. I am also advised that no applications for relief have been received from the Red Cross Society. However, it would appear that the society could not be regarded as being chiefly engaged in the care and transport of severely and permanently disabled persons.</P>
    <P>As I have informed the House on a number of occasions, the Disabled Drivers' and Disabled Passengers', (Tax Concessions) Scheme is currently being reviewed by an interdepartmental group under the chair of an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

      <P>The income tax code recognises marital status and provides that a married couple can opt for joint, separate or single assessment. However, in the case of cohabiting couples, each partner is taxed as a single person and each is entitled to the tax-free allowances and rate bands appropriate to single persons. Consequently, as each partner is a separate entity for tax purposes, allowances cannot be transferred from one partner to the other.</P>
      <P>The widening of the standard rate band in Budget 2000, takes the first step in putting in place individual tax bands so that taxpayers will, in general, be taxed on what they earn as individuals rather than on their marital status as we have now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Ireland is not a member of the G8, nor a bilateral creditor of any of the world's poorest countries, it is as a member of the multilateral lending organisations, in particular the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, that we can best exercise our influence to seek to contribute to easing the debt burden of the heavily indebted poor countries, HIPCs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The HIPC initiative, driven by the World Bank and the IMF, is the official response to the need <Col N="224" /> for debt relief, particularly at the multilateral level, but also involving substantial, if not complete relief, in respect of official bilateral debt. As originally conceived, the initiative aimed at both (i) freeing the most heavily indebted poorest countries from the burden of the unpayable element of their debt, and (ii) offering them a definitive exit from the debt treadmill which is seriously undermining their development.</P>
    <P>Following the recent review of the initiative, it has been substantially enhanced &ndash; the amount of debt relief on offer has been doubled, a wider range of countries is to get faster and deeper relief &ndash; and my concern now is that these improvements are fully financed.</P>
    <P>Ireland was to the fore in calling for such improvements, in particular via the submissions made by the Department of Finance and the Department of Foreign Affairs to the review of HIPC which led to the improvements.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the wide public concern for a serious attack on the problem of unpayable debt which is reflected in the extent of popular support for Jubilee 2000.</P>
    <P>As far as unilateral debt is concerned, this is best tackled through the HIPC initiative, and while I do feel there is scope for more generosity here, I am not convinced that a blanket call for debt cancellation is attainable.</P>
    <P>As far as bilateral debt is concerned, the HIPC initiative also envisages substantial reductions in bilateral debt and I am heartened by the indications that an increasing number of countries are prepared to do so. We have been advocating and supporting this development in our international dealings.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the enhanced HIPC initiative is the only realistic mechanism through which multilateral debt relief for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries can be achieved. Successful and timely implementation of the enhanced framework would create an opportunity for further enhancement, which I would fully support and consider vital for future growth and development in HIPC countries. In this regard, I am particularly concerned that the number of countries processed to date falls short of projections under the enhanced HIPC framework and I am also somewhat disappointed at the amount of pledges to the HIPC Trust Fund that have been converted to paid-in contributions. Given these concerns, the Deputy can be assured that I will use my best endeavours to press for the full and speedy implementation of the HIPC initiative, both in terms of the number of countries processed and also its financing.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that Ireland is contributing fully to the enhanced initiative. We are also participating in the alleviation of bilateral debt relief in relation to some of our priority aid countries even though our own bilateral assistance has been in the form of grants. Ireland contributed £12.1 million in 1999 to the debt relief package and is committed to payment of a further £2.9 million by 2008.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 181 and 222 together.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that the current situation whereby a small number of children with severe behavioural problems are placed in psychiatric hospitals is undesirable. I am committed to ensuring the availability of suitable places for the care of such children and measures are being taken by the health boards, with funding and other supports provided by my Department, to address this issue as a matter of priority.</P>
      <P>There are 60 places available at present in secure units which cater for children with severe behavioural problems. By the end of 2000, a further 39 such places will be available with another 56 due to open in 2001-2002, bringing the total number of places to 157 by early 2002.</P>
      <P>Specialist inpatient units for children and adolescents who have mental illness are also required and this issue has been referred to by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals in previous annual reports. Funding is being provided under the national development plan for the development of five such units, to be located in Limerick, Cork, Galway and in the eastern region. Project teams have already been established in relation to the units for Limerick, Cork and Galway. It must be emphasised, however, that these psychiatric units will not be secure units and would not be suitable for children such as those who have been before the courts in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>A working group is currently being established by my Department to review child and adolescent psychiatry and to finalise a plan for the further development of this service. The group is expected to commence its work shortly.</P>
      <P>I understand that the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals for 1999 will be published within the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 182 and 190 together.</P>
      <P>Health boards may refer patients for treatment abroad where certain criteria have been met. These criteria are as follows:</P>
      <P>1.The treatment concerned is not available in this country;</P>
      <P>2.There is an urgent medical necessity for the treatment;</P>
      <P>3.There is a reasonable medical prognosis;</P>

      <P>5.The treatment is to be carried out in a recognised hospital or other institution and is under the control of a registered medical practitioner.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the health board concerned to examine the circumstances of each individual case and to decide on whether the above criteria have been met. I have therefore, asked the regional chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority to investigate the circumstances of this case and reply directly to the Deputies.</P>

      <P>The referral of patients abroad scheme is administered by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and by each health board for all cases.</P>
      <P>The criteria for the referral of patients abroad are the same for all cases where treatment is sought. The criteria are as follows:</P>
      <P>1.The treatment concerned is not available in this country;</P>
      <P>2.There is an urgent medical necessity for the treatment;</P>

    <P>It is a matter for the health authority or health board concerned to examine the circumstances of each individual case and to decide on whether the above criteria have been met. The assessment of whether or not the treatment sought is appropriate for the individual concerned is the clinical responsibility of the consultant involved based on his or her professional judgment. I am not aware of any conflicting decisions taken by health boards regarding entitlement to treatment abroad for persons suffering from gender identity disorder.</P>

      <P>The original estimated project cost for the new headquarters of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service at the completion of the design brief stage in June 1997 was £28.7 million. This projected cost did not take account of additional local authority planning conditions concerning water supply and the disposal of sewage and soil, additional requirements of the Irish Medicines Board involving laboratories and air handling facilities as well as costs associated with inflation in the construction industry. Changes in operational policies and additional equipment requirements also affected costs. As a result of the combination of these factors the projected costs increased to £36.3 million at the construction commencement date of June 1998.</P>
      <P>Commercial sensitivity does not allow divulgence of the current estimated project cost because the final account for the construction element of the project is under negotiation with the contractors. However, indications are that the cost is in line with the £36.3 million budget. A breakdown of the estimate is as follows:</P>

    <P>The gross floor area of the existing Pelican House building including ancillary related accommodation located off site because of building and site restrictions is 6,616 square metres including plant rooms. The net usable area excluding plant rooms is 6,350 square metres. The gross floor area of the new IBTS headquarters is 10,751 square metres. The net usable area excluding plant rooms is 8,891 square metres.</P>
    <P>In comparing the net usable areas of the buildings cognisance must be taken of the inadequacies of the existing building to meet current GMP standards (Good Manufacturing Practice for Medicinal Products &ndash; the standards governing medicinal products in the European Community). Pelican House is an altered 1960s office building inherently unsuitable for blood component production due to its unsuitable plan format for current GMP work flow requirements, inadequate floor area, structure, services and finishes. The new IBTS headquarters building is designed and constructed to meet current GMP standards and <Col N="234" /> the requirements of the Irish Medicines Board. As a result, a significant increase in the space currently available for laboratory and GMP facilities is necessary including accommodation for the future provision of PCR testing. Staff accommodation to meet current space standards will also be made available.</P>
    <P>The construction of the building was completed in December 1999. Furniture and equipment has since been purchased and installed. The validation of utilities and equipment commenced in January 2000 and is due to be completed in the latter part of June 2000. The transfer from Pelican House will commence some weeks after that. The new centre is expected to be fully operational by 1 September 2000.</P>

      <P>Officials of my Department have had discussions with officers of the Irish Medicines Board concerning the issue of natural health products, including St. John's Wort. The Irish Medicines Board is currently examining, at my request, the nature of the controls which would be applied in the context of an interim national licensing scheme for traditional and alternative medicinal products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The article to which the Deputy refers was included in the information pack sent by the Irish Medicines Board to all members of the Oireachtas and all Irish MEPs as a consequence of the appearance of the officers of the board at the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committees <Col N="235" /> on Health and Children and Enterprise and Small Business which discussed St. John's Wort and related matters. The pack consisted of 15 different items and included the board's presentation to the above meeting, documents relating to St. John's Wort and the general issues surrounding the safety of herbal medicines, the board's recently published Guide to the Definition of a Medicinal Product, and the article by Mr. Jaroff.</P>
    <P>I have been advised by the Irish Medicines Board that it considered the article in question as simply another view in relation to the general issues surrounding the safety of herbal medicines, published in a reputable non technical journal. The board wishes to point out that the inclusion in the information pack of this article, which incidently did not mention St. John's Wort, did not constitute an endorsement by the Irish Medicines Board of the view expressed.</P>

      <P>The provision of an air ambulance service for emergency cases which cannot be safely conveyed <Col N="236" /> by road ambulance continues to be provided by the Air Corps and the marine search and rescue helicopter service of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
      <P>Contacts regarding the provision of a dedicated air ambulance service are ongoing with all interested parties involved with a view to developing a consensus on the most appropriate role for air ambulance in the overall context of pre hospital care. I am continuing to provide additional funding for pre-hospital care with funding of more than £10 million in 2000. This is the largest annual amount ever provided for the development of the ambulance service.</P>
      <P>It is important to acknowledge that an air ambulance service is only one element of an effective emergency medical care system. Since the publication of the report of the review group on the ambulance service in 1993 approximately £33 million has been provided for the implementation of the report's recommendations with well over half this funding being provided by this Government. This has resulted in major improvements in the service including the training of ambulance personnel; the specification and age profile of the ambulance fleet; the development of command and control centres; the opening of additional ambulance stations; and the provision of training and equipment to general practitioners in remote rural areas, on a pilot basis, to enable them to deal with emergencies in advance of the arrival of an ambulance.</P>
      <P>I remain committed to the continued development of the pre hospital care system identified both in the review group's findings and in the recent report of the cardiovascular health strategy group, Building Healthier Hearts. Proposals for the development of an air ambulance service falls to be considered in the wider context of developments in emergency medical services generally. Any initiative in this area needs to complement appropriately other pre-hospital resources such as the ambulance service, first responder schemes and other emergency response resources.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Southern Health Board is taking steps to ensure that an appropriate level of radiologist cover is available. I will consider an application for the post of a second consultant radiologist in the context of available resources and the priority accorded to it by the board.</P>
      <P>In regard to the ENT service at Mallow General Hospital I understand that the Southern Health Board has sought the in put of Comhairle na nOspidéal with regard to the development of this service. Comhairle na nOspidéal is the statutory body responsible for regulating the number and type of appointments of consultant medical staffs and such other officers or staffs as may be prescribed in hospitals engaged in the provision of services. I will consider any proposals that the Southern Health Board may put forward in the light of these discussions with a view to ensuring that the service to patients at Mallow General Hospital is developed in line with the principles of best practice in this area.</P>
      <P>I am fully committed to building on recent investment in Mallow General Hospital to allow the hospital to continue to provide a high quality level of care to its patients, in line with the priorities identified by the Southern Health Board. The recent provision of funding to open 13 additional medical beds at the hospital represents a major investment in the future of Mallow General Hospital and clearly emphasises the Government's commitment to the hospital.</P>

      <P>The terms of reference for the inquiry stipulate that it may examine the application of these policies, practices and procedures in hospitals generally and in particular their application in the major academic teaching hospitals in the State.

The committee, on considering the report, will come to its own conclusions having regard to the terms of reference of the inquiry, holding a public hearing and calling witnesses as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The identification of hospitals which were involved in the practices referred to by the Deputy is a matter for the inquiry.

      <P>The former Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children, Mr. Jerry O'Dwyer, has been retained to work on the preparation of a new medical practitioners Act. The total cost of the assignment will not exceed £8,000. Mr. O'Dwyer is well-qualified for the task and his agreement to undertake it allows officers of the Department to concentrate on other important projects.</P>

      <P>Additional funding has been allocated to women's health and to services for women victims of violence in 1999 and 2000.  My Department has now received women's health plans from each of the health boards, including the Southern Health Board. These plans range across a number of service programmes which seek to address women's health needs and any additional funding required will have to be considered in this context. Following the examination of the plans, any additional funding implications will fall to be considered in the context of discussions on the funding required for the health services generally for 2001.</P>

      <P>All health agencies are informed on an ongoing basis of their legal obligations to comply with the relevant EU directives in relation to the purchase of goods and services.</P>
      <P>More recently, in December 1999, agencies were informed of the revised financial thresholds taking effect from 1 January 2000 and the need to comply with advertising rules for tenders above these thresholds. The current threshold for advertising services and supplies contracts in the Official Journal of the European Community is, in general, set at r214,326 (£168,795). There are a few exceptions in relation to contracts when this threshold is reduced to t200,000 (£157,517).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Structures have been put in place to assist in the implementation of and compliance with EU directives.  These include the establishment of the <Col N="241" /> healthcare materials management board (HMMB), the appointment of a general manager for the HMMB and the appointment in each health board/authority area of a regional materials manager. In addition, each agency has been advised by my Department as recently as February 2000 to make full use of the investment in these structures so as to exploit every opportunity to maximise economies of scale in procurement. Agencies were also informed that they must be in a position to demonstrate that all contracts are awarded in full compliance with statutory requirements and best procurement practice.</P>
    <P>In relation to capital projects, my Department has also brought all relevant EU directives on tendering to the attention of the health boards and the ERHA. Boards have been asked to comply with these directives where applicable, in the context of delivering my Department's capital programme.</P>
    <P>I note that the article referred to concern expressed in regard to whether the agreement between my Department and the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association on the supply, terms and pricing of medicines to the health services was in line with EU law. In accordance with the terms of EU Council Directive 89/105/EEC of 21 December 1988 relating to the transparency of measures regulating the pricing of medicinal products for human use and their inclusion in the scope of national health insurance systems, the Commission was notified of the terms of the current agreement. I should point out that the agreement recognises the obligation to comply with EU procurement directives. Furthermore, health boards and hospitals have been reminded by way of circular letter of their obligations in this regard.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy is aware of specific instances where EU directives for tendering procedures in respect of contracts were not complied with, he should raise the matter directly with the chief executive officer of the relevant health board/authority.</P>

      <P>The inquiry, which I announced on 9 February 2000, is essentially to review all post-mortem examination policy, practice and procedure in the State since 1970, and in particular as it relates to organ removal, retention, storage and disposal by reference to prevailing standards both in and outside of the State. It will also examine the application of these policies, practices and procedures in hospitals generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of consultations prior to drafting <Col N="242" /> the terms of reference there were a number of cases where concern has arisen in relation to some post-mortem examinations which allegedly should have been conducted on the instruction of a coroner and others which were allegedly portrayed as being necessary on the instruction of a coroner.</P>
    <P>It was for this reason that the terms of reference of the inquiry specifically state that post-mortem examination refers to any post-mortem examination including, where appropriate, any post-mortem examinations directed by the coroner.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference were agreed by the Government and I would expect that all coroners will co-operate on all relevant matters with the inquiry. I am confident that such co-operation will be forthcoming and I have no reason to believe otherwise.</P>

      <P>The provision of hospital services in this instance is the statutory responsibility of the relevant health boards.</P>
      <P>The national centre for haemophilia and related laboratory and clinical facilities is situated at St. James's Hospital and this centre provides a range of specialist services at national level. As such, this centre has particular responsibility for the treatment of persons with haemophilia. Haemophilia is a rare disorder and best international practice suggests that treatment should be provided in designated centres that meet certain criteria particularly in relation to the number of patients registered in individual centres. This reflects the need for a high level of collective experience in treating patients with this rare condition.</P>
      <P>While the national centre is located at St. James's Hospital, services for persons with haemophilia are also provided in Cork and Galway under the supervision of a consultant haematologist. Both these centres work closely with the national centre in St. James's Hospital with a view to ensuring that the appropriate level of service is provided to persons with haemophilia. Both the Southern and Western Health Boards reject the claim that patients with haemophilia attending their board's hospitals are at risk and detailed arrangements are in place in both Cork and Galway to ensure that appropriate priority is accorded to the needs of persons with haemophilia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will continue to work with all the agencies <Col N="243" /> providing hospital services to persons with haemophilia to ensure that these services are delivered in a manner consistent with best practice in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about a number of issues which arise from the increasing cost of settlements in cases where infants have suffered serious brain injury at or around the time of birth. In the first instance I am concerned at the rate of increase in the quantum of damages awarded in cases where negligence is established or where settlements are made before cases go to court. I am also aware of cases where it has not been possible to establish that any negligence occurred but nonetheless parents are faced with the challenge of caring for severely injured babies. The needs of the children are similar in all these cases and it seems unfair that the provision of the financial resources to care for them should be dependent on proving negligence on the part of a hospital or its medical and nursing staff. I am also aware that in these very lengthy and complex cases the legal costs <Col N="244" /> associated with the claims sometimes exceed the damages awarded.</P>
      <P>A further concern is that this small group of cases distorts the overall cost of providing medical indemnity cover for doctors. Despite the fact that it can cost up to £70,000 a year to provide medical indemnity cover for one obstetrician, it is a fact that doctors in other specialties are paying higher subscriptions in order to keep the obstetric rate at its current level. This situation is hardly sustainable in the long-term. I also have a concern that the high cost of obstetric medical negligence claims may make it unattractive to young doctors who may otherwise have been considering a career in that discipline.</P>
      <P>For these and other reasons my Department has been exploring the possibility of introducing a  &ldquo;needs based&rdquo; or &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; compensation scheme for such cases. Similar schemes elsewhere have been examined and initial discussions have been held with interested parties here. However, the introduction of such a scheme raises a number of constitutional legal and financial issues which need further study. The Government has asked that specific consideration be given to the implications of introducing such a scheme in Ireland.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>if he will make a statement on recent reports (details supplied) that thousands of patients are receiving blood components that did not undergo the most rigorous test available for hepatitis C.</Quest>
      <QRef>[15156/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since November 1999 all blood donations collected by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, IBTS, are screened by PCR for hepatitis C. PCR testing is a further safeguard aimed at improving the detection of hepatitis C during the window period. The typical length of the window period without PCR testing is ten to 14 weeks. Following the introduction of PCR testing, this window period is reduced to, on average, 25 days. To introduce this test as rapidly as possible, the IBTS contracted with the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service, SNBTS, in Edinburgh to conduct the test on its behalf. The SNBTS was selected as it has an aggressive programme for the introduction of PCR testing for all donations. The transfusion service in Northern Ireland has also contracted with the SNBTS for PCR.</P>
      <P>The use of PCR results as a release criterion for blood components by the IBTS is being introduced in parallel with the SNBTS. The majority of PCR test results are returned to the IBTS on the fourth day after the donation has been taken. The test format being used in Scotland requires two to three working days in the laboratory after donation. A small number of samples require further analysis because of difficulties associated with this test. The test results are currently faxed to the IBTS. Electronic exchange of data when the IBTS's new computer system is implemented in the summer will improve turnaround time in the transmission of results. In the case of platelets, which have a shelf life of five days, improvement in assay and turnaround times will be required before PCR test results can be used to determine release of these products.</P>
      <P>Approximately 160,000 donations are tested annually by the IBTS. Donations found positive in serological tests are discarded and not issued. No such reactive result by PCR has been observed to date. In the unlikely event that a PCR positive result is observed, for example, a window period donation, appropriate follow up, including product recall, will be initiated. The risk of transmission of hepatitis C in the window period is estimated as one in 500,000 as current mandatory tests are extremely robust and sensitive. The Irish Medicines Board, which is the regulatory authority, is satisfied with the current position regarding the implementation of PCR testing by the IBTS. It is not a mandatory test for blood components in Europe or the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Blood components transfused in Irish hospitals meet all European standards. Over and above these standards, the IBTS plans to enable all components, including platelets, to be tested for <Col N="248" /> PCR as a release criterion before the end of this year. This will coincide with similar arrangements in Scotland and Northern Ireland and will be an advance on the majority of other European transfusion centres. The IBTS plans to perform PCR testing at its new headquarters within the next 12 months when a testing system is validated and fully operational.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government identified in its programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, the need to review medical card eligibility for the elderly and large families and decided that the income guidelines for entitlement to medical cards for persons aged 70 years or over should be doubled. This improvement, which is being introduced over a three year period, began on 1 March 1999. The income guidelines for those aged 70 to 79 and 80 years and over, which are already higher than the normal guidelines, increased by one third in 1999. The second stage of this process was implemented on 1 March 2000 and the third stage will be implemented in March 2001.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Health Board chief executive officers set medical card income guidelines annually. These guidelines are not statutorily binding, and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these circumstances I have no immediate <Col N="249" /> plans to reduce the age threshold for persons to avail of the doubling of the medical card income guideline.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that the proposed Programme for Prosperity and Fairness refers to the fact that health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme and will consult with the social partners by the end of 2000. Particular emphasis will be placed on the needs of families with children, and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits.</P>

      <P>Chemotherapy services are widely available to patients requiring the service in each health board area in the country, subject to the guidelines issued by my Department. There has been considerable development in the care and treatment of patients with cancer in recent years. Since the launch of the national cancer strategy in November 1996, and the announcement of the action plan for the implementation of the strategy in March 1997 considerable improvements have taken place in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two underlying principles of the national cancer strategy are: to take all measures possible <Col N="250" /> to reduce rates of illness and death from cancer, in line with the targets established in the health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, and to ensure that those who develop cancer receive the most effective care and treatment and that their quality of life is enhanced to the greatest extent possible. Underlying these objectives is the need for a high quality, patient-focused service. One of the specific objectives of the strategy is to ensure all patients have access to an equitable, effective service with a uniformly high quality of care, wherever they live.</P>
    <P>Since the strategy was launched, regional directors of cancer services were appointed in each health board area, with two co-regional directors of cancer services appointed in the North Eastern Health Board area. The regional directors were asked to prepare plans for the development of cancer services in their area and these plans were then submitted to my Department. The national cancer forum and Professor James Fennelly, special adviser on cancer services to the Department, advised on appropriate developments in each area. On a national basis, some 41 million of dedicated funding has been allocated since 1997 for the development of cancer services.</P>
    <P>My Department is continuing to work with the national cancer forum and the regional directors of cancer services in identifying priorities for the further development of cancer services in all regions, building on the major progress made to date.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 232 and 234 together.</P>
      <P>The capital requirements of the Eastern Regional Health Authority under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, including those relating to the south Kildare area, are being considered at present by the authority. I understand that the capital development proposals being drawn up by the ERHA under the national development plan will shortly be submitted to the authority for approval. It will then be a matter for my Department to consider the authority's plan with a view to confirming the overall national development plan funding levels already notified to the ERHA.</P>
      <P>Following agreement between my Department and the ERHA on the overall national development plan funding figures, individual capital projects will remain subject over the life of the plan to the normal criteria governing projects such as specific approvals, costings, construction dates and the influence of the overall capital priorities pertaining at any particular time. The question of new or extended service provision will also be examined in detail in the context of national development plan priorities.</P>
      <P>In regard to 2000, the question of what capital projects are funded this year depends on the draw down by the authority for individual projects as liabilities mature for payment. This includes the provision recently of £16 million additional capital funding to the authority for equipment and refurbishment works in 2000 across all health service areas. Other possible initiatives for the ERHA area for this year will also be considered by the authority and my Department.</P>

      <P>Health service employers and the Health Service Employers Agency are continuing to monitor the take up of employment offers made to non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, for 1 July 2000. The situation is likely to remain fluid for a number of weeks to come as an NCHD may have an offer of employment from more than one hospital. Hospitals are exploring all options in an effort to ensure essential posts are filled.</P>
      <P>I am aware of difficulties in recruiting junior doctors to the specialty of anaesthesia but it is important to note that anaesthesia is mainly a consultant driven specialty and is less likely to be affected by a reduction in the number of junior doctors.</P>
      <P>With regard to the decision of the Medical Council to introduce an examination for non EU nationals entering the health services here the medical council is an autonomous statutory body established by the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978. Its functions include registering all medical practitioners, fitness to practice and ensuring junior doctors working in our health service have received a very high standard of training and education. Its membership is made up largely of medical professionals. It is also important to note the medical council here works independently from the general medical council in Britain .</P>
      <P>The Medical Council decided some years ago to introduce an examination for doctors outside the European Union seeking temporary registration in Ireland. Overseas doctors, EU and non EU, account for about one third of non-consultant hospital doctor posts. These doctors have played and, I am sure, will continue to play a very important role in providing a quality service in our hospitals. This assessment procedure was introduced by the Medical Council to ensure all medical trainees, both EU and non EU nationals, are of the highest standard.</P>
      <P>The Medical Manpower Forum is addressing the issue of medical staffing in hospitals. The forum will issue its first report shortly and its recommendations will address this issue.</P>
      <P>In the event that some junior doctor posts remain unfilled, hospitals will be asked to ensure essential and critical services are not affected. I am confident that with full co-operation from all concerned, and a degree of imagination in making the best use of available resources, the effect on services can be minimised.</P>

Significant additional funding has been provided in recent years to implement measures aimed at reducing pressure on accident and emergency departments. These measures have included minor capital works to improve accident and emergency facilities, new equipment and enhanced staffing levels &ndash; nursing, clerical and NCHDs. A publicity campaign aimed at persuading people with flu or flu-like symptoms to attend their GP rather than the accident and emergency department of an acute hospital has also been a feature of accident and emergency winter initiatives in recent years.</P>
      <P>I have recently established a committee to oversee the preparation of a national influenza pandemic plan as well as a plan to address the more regular outbreaks of influenza and influenza-like illnesses. The committee is being asked to address issues such as prevention strategies, surveillance, scientific and medical issues and an overall central strategy.</P>
      <P>In the context of utilising capacity to its fullest extent and following a series of discussions with the chief executive officers of the health boards, I announced on Tuesday last a £10 million initiative aimed at maximising available capacity in the system to enable an additional 7,600 waiting list procedures to be performed before the end of the year. This funding will be allocated on the basis of the performance of each agency in reaching the activity targets they have agreed. The proposals to be funded are based on a series of innovative measures, including use of facilities during the traditional summer closures period, cross-contracting arrangements between agencies and from the private sector, extended theatre and ward opening times, extended weekend work and the contracting of activity from hospitals in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="255" /> These short-term measures are being taken in tandem with longer term measures associated with the £2 billion investment under the national development plan, the ongoing implementation of the recommendations of the expert review group on the waiting list initiative and the national bed capacity review now under way.</P>

    <P>*The Western Health Board received £395,000 for the development of palliative care services in Galway, Roscommon and Mayo. A detailed breakdown of the amount allocated to the provision of home care and day care services is being prepared by the board and will be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Significant additional funding of £1.6 million has also been provided in 2000 to enable other areas of the palliative care service to be developed, for example, new consultant posts, paramedical and support staff and respite services.</P>
    <P>Details regarding the arrangements made by voluntary groups to provide funding for home care or day care services at local level are not available within my Department. It is therefore not possible to provide a percentage breakdown of the total cost as requested by the Deputy. However, since 1997, additional development funding of approximately £10 million has been provided by the Department of Health and Children for palliative care services nationally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="256" /> As the Deputy may be aware, a national advisory committee on palliative care services is preparing a comprehensive national policy for the strategic planning and development of palliative care services. The provision of further development funding for these services will be considered within the context of the recommendations made in the report of the advisory committee. I expect to be presented with this report before the end of 2000.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for the health boards, in consultation with their regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disabilities, to decide on priority services for development in their functional area having regard to the recommendations of the report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, Towards an Independent Future. This report recommended the establishment of regional child assessment teams in each health board and my Department is fully committed to the implementation of this recommendation in respect of each health board area.</P>
      <P>The North Eastern Health Board has identified the establishment of a regional child development and assessment service as a priority. Proposals have been drawn up jointly by the North Eastern Health Board and Cerebral Palsy Ireland and their comprehensive model for services and costed business plan has the support of their regional co-ordinating committee for physical and sensory disability services. The three year plan provides for two centre based locations, one in Cavan and one in Drogheda, providing interdisciplinary specialist assessment and consultant services for all children with physical disability, sensory impairment and developmental delay throughout the area. Children from the local areas will also attend for ongoing centre-based therapy while satellite centres will be established in Monaghan and Meath to provide ongoing therapy programmes for children from these counties. The first phase of the plan relates to the development of the regional assessment and treatment centre in Cavan and the satellite centre in Dunshaughlin, County Meath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="257" /> Ongoing revenue funding was allocated by the health board last year for a number of additional paediatric therapy posts to support the outreach services for children with physical and sensory disabilities and this year additional ongoing revenue has been allocated for the first phase of the implementation of the joint regional assessment and treatment service in Cavan and Meath. Recruitment has commenced for the core teams and the service will commence this year.</P>
    <P>Indicative allocations for capital funding under the national development plan over the next seven years 2000-07 have been advised to the health boards and fully comprehend the capital funding requirements for assessment and treatment centres in each of the health board areas, including the North Eastern Health Board. Building of the regional assessment and treatment centre in Cavan is at the planning stage at health board level and it is proposed that in the interim, services will be delivered from temporary accommodation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As advised to the House previously the report, Towards a Standardised Framework for Intercountry Adoption Assessment Procedures, which was approved by the Government for publication in June 1999, contains recommendations which will have the effect of streamlining and standardising the assessment process for couples. At 31 March 2000 the South Eastern Health Board had 93 first time applicants awaiting assessment as well as seven second time applicants. The board has advised that the waiting time for assessment is approximately two and a half years for first assessments and six months for second assessments. The number of applications received by the board more than doubled between 1998 and 1999, 24 new applications were received in 1998 while 54 new applications were received in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the publication of the report towards a standardised framework for intercountry adoption assessment procedures the board's staffing structure was as follows: one senior social worker based in Waterford; one full-time social worker <Col N="260" /> based in Dungarvan and two half-time social workers based in Carlow and Wexford; part-time clerical support at grade III level.</P>
    <P>As I outlined to the House on 8 February, in June 1999 following the completion of the report on intercountry adoption assessment procedures the Government approved the provision of additional funding for intercountry adoption services. Additional funding for the years 1999 and 2000 was allocated on the basis of waiting lists in December 1998 and September 1999 respectively. The South Eastern Health Board was allocated an additional £26,000 in 1999 and an additional £48,000 in 2000 in respect of developing intercountry adoption services in the board's region.</P>
    <P>In 1999, the funding was earmarked for an additional social worker and grade IV administrative post for adoption services. It was not possible to have these staff in place before the end of 1999. Therefore funding was used for once-off purposes. Both the additional social worker and a grade IV post are now <i>in situ</i>. The 2000 allocation is to be used for an additional 1.5 social worker posts. The interviews have been held to fill the remaining posts and it is anticipated that appointments will be made in the coming weeks. The staffing structure will be as follows when all posts have been filled: one senior social worker based in Waterford; 1.5 social workers for the Carlow-Kilkenny area, an increase of one full-time social worker; one social worker based in Wexford, an increase of 0.5 social worker; one social worker based in Dungarvan &ndash; no longer <Col N="261" /> any responsibility for south Tipperary &ndash; that is, an increase of 0.5 social worker; one social worker based in south Tipperary, an increase of 0.5 social worker with the worker based in the region; one full-time grade IV based in Waterford; one part-time grade III based in Waterford.</P>
    <P>In terms of social work staffing this means that the number has more than doubled since 1999 &ndash; an increase from two posts to 4.5 posts. The board has also informed me that a child care manager has been given special responsibility for the co-ordination of the implementation of the standardised framework on intercountry adoption assessment.</P>
    <P>Adoption services in the South Eastern Health Board area are provided by SEEK regional adoption services which forms part of the board's community care programme. In addition to the priorities identified in the report on the standardised framework, the South Eastern Health Board have carried out a review of the regional adoption service. The recommendations contained in this review regarding the organisation and staffing of <Col N="262" /> the service are in the process of being implemented by the board.</P>
    <P>Clearly, increasing the complement of social workers is essential to bringing about a reduction in the waiting time for couples throughout the board's region. I am satisfied that the board is doing its utmost to recruit these additional staff as well as streamlining the assessment process to increase throughput of applications. I am confident that both the additional staffing and the increase in the number of assessments per social worker arising from the new assessment model will have a significant impact on the waiting list in the South Eastern Health Board.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the recent study carried out by doctors at the Medical Bureau of Road Safety at UCD which states that there is a major increase in the number of people driving under the influence of drugs and where an analysis sample between July and December 1999 has shown that 37% tested positive for drugs and among the drugs uncovered was cannabis.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government strategy on road safety 1998-2002, recognises that the influence of drugs on driving behaviour is an issue of increasing concern. Identification of drugs is more complex than for alcohol. A number of research programmes are being carried out internationally in this area and the strategy commits the Government to monitoring and assessing these developments.</P>
      <P>In order to advance research in relation to drugs and driving in Ireland, I provided additional funding of some £100,000 to the Medical Bureau of Road Safety to commence a two year programme of drug analysis of blood and urine specimens.</P>
      <P>The preliminary findings of this programme were recently made available by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety. These preliminary findings are based on blood and urine samples submitted to the Medical Bureau of Road Safety between 1 July and 31 December 1999 which were under the legal limit for alcohol. Thirty seven per cent of these samples tested were screened positive for drugs, the most common being cannabis.</P>
      <P>These early findings underline the Government's view expressed in the road safety strategy that drugs and driving is an issue of growing concern. While it is too early to draw definitive conclusions, this programme when completed will, along with other international analysis and research in this area, inform of the need for possible changes in testing methods for the presence of drugs, changes in enforcement practice and procedures and possibly changes to existing legislation.</P>
      <P>I must stress that under existing legislation it is already illegal to drive while under the influence of drugs to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>River catchment management is a generic term used to describe the undertaking of any aspect of river management on the basis of the whole river catchment. The objectives and operations vary according to the subject in question, for example flooding, fisheries management, water quality, navigable waterways, protection of habitats.</P>
      <P>In so far as my Department is concerned, catchment based river management refers primarily to the protection and improvement of water quality. Eutrophication due to excess inputs of phosphorus has been identified as the main threat to water quality in Ireland. Since 1997, my Department has been pursuing a comprehensive, integrated catchment based strategy to tackle all sources of phosphorus. Details of the strategy, including objectives and operation, are set out in the strategy document Managing Ireland's Rivers and Lakes &ndash; A Catchment-Based Strategy against Eutrophication a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library. Major catchment-based projects are under way in relation to Loughs Derg and Lough Ree, Lough Leane and the three Rivers &ndash; Boyne, Liffey and Suir. The projects are led by local authorities and involve the participation of a wide range of stakeholders. The strategy is statutorily underpinned by the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977 (Water Quality Standards for Phosphorus) Regulations, 1998, which set targets for reducing phosphorus levels in rivers and lakes by 2007. The strategy is also supported by my Department's major programme of investment, under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, £3,000 million, three times the amount in 1994-99 national development plan, for water and waste water infrastructure and rural water, the bulk of which is for sewage infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is actively promoting the establishment by local authorities, in the short to medium term, of catchment based projects to address all sources of pollution in all inland and coastal waters, including groundwaters. In <Col N="285" /> December 1999 local authorities were advised that financial assistance would be available in the context of the national development plan to support expenditure on projects to develop such catchment based water monitoring and management systems on an inter-authority basis.</P>
    <P>Ireland's catchment-based strategy is in line with the approach envisaged under the proposed EU framework directive on water policy which provides for comprehensive water management on the basis of river basins and river basin districts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 245 and 277 together.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are responsible under section 11 of the Housing Act, 1988, for making schemes of letting priorities to determine the order of priority to be afforded to applicants in the letting of dwellings provided by the authority. The making or amendment of a scheme is a reserved function of the elected members of an authority and the letting of houses in accordance with the scheme is an executive function performable by the manager. The making or amendment of a scheme is subject to ministerial approval to ensure that an adopted scheme is in accordance with statutory requirements and that all categories of need specified in section 9(2) of the Act are covered by the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The order of priority of different categories of persons in a scheme of letting priorities and other details of a scheme are a matter for each local authority. The guidelines issued by my Department to local authorities subsequent to the passing of the 1988 Act advised that it should be the <Col N="286" /> aim of a scheme of letting priorities to promote equality of opportunity in getting access to local authority housing based on relative housing needs to ensure a dwelling, if suitable, is let to the person in greatest need and to ensure that no category of needy persons is at a permanent disadvantage<i> vis-à-vis </i>other categories.</P>
    <P>While the Department's circular to local authorities in September 1993 requested authorities to review their schemes to allow all of their approved housing applicants to be listed in order of priority, a number of local authorities responded by indicating that they did not operate a rigid points system which would allow strict relative priorities to be afforded in respect of each applicant and in respect of each area of the authority in which the applicant might be seeking housing. In addition, the circumstances of applicants on the housing lists were subject to change which, in some circumstances, could be significant. In particular, the local authorities were concerned where an applicants housing priority was reduced because of new applicants accepted on to the waiting list as being in greater housing need and existing schemes of letting priorities continued to remain in force.</P>
    <P>A number of local authorities have recently submitted revised letting schemes incorporating points systems for my approval and these are being examined in the Department. Having regard to the primarily responsibility of local authorities for assessing and responding to housing need it remains a matter for each authority to determine whether their letting priorities scheme should incorporate a points scheme. I do not propose to direct local authorities to introduce a points system in their schemes.</P>

      <P>Part V of the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, will require that a specified percentage, of up to 20%, of land zoned for residential use must be made available for social and affordable housing. The land affected will be valued at existing use value and not market value. The Bill provides that the specified percentage of land must be transferred to the local authority or, alternatively, that developers may enter into an agreement with the local authority to provide social and affordable houses themselves. Where land is transferred to the local authority the Bill expressly provides that that land can then be made available for approved voluntary housing associations or co-operatives. Part V will, therefore, facilitate the provision of land to voluntary housing associations and co-operatives.</P>
      <P>Where a housing co-operative or voluntary housing association purchases land to which a social and affordable housing condition applies, the requirement to transfer land at existing use value to the local authority or to transfer houses will apply. In such a situation, given the similar objectives of the voluntary housing association or housing co-operative and the local authority, it is likely the option of transferring houses rather than land will apply. Where houses are transferred, the Bill provides that the local authority pays a price for the houses based on the site costs calculated on existing use value and agreed building and attributable development costs including profit on costs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 251 and 276 together.</P>
      <P>In April 1999, I published draft retail planning guidelines for public consultation. The draft guidelines recommended that, pending the preparation and adoption of development plan policies by local authorities, the floorspace cap of 3,000 square metres, which was introduced on supermarket development, should be retained in the rest of the State outside Dublin. Within the greater Dublin area, it recommended that the floorspace cap be increased to 3,500 square metres. The draft guidelines recommended that a floorspace cap of 6,000 square metres should apply to retail warehouses, large stores specialising in the sale of household goods such as carpets, furniture and bulky DIY items. I am aware of the concerns expressed by the hardware-DIY sector that this 6,000 square metre floorspace cap should be retained in the final guidelines.</P>
      <P>When publishing the draft guidelines, the carrying out of a further study of the economic effect of the implementation of the guidelines was announced. I expect very shortly to receive the completed report from the consultants on the likely impact of the implementation of the draft retail planning guidelines on competition within the Irish retail sector, the supply of products to consumers at lower prices, consumer choice and the supplier base. This report has been jointly commissioned by my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The study will be published and the results of this study will be considered along with the submissions received on the draft guidelines before I publish the guidelines in final form by end summer.</P>

      <P>As outlined in the policy statement, Changing our Ways, overall Government policy on waste management is committed to a dramatic reduction in reliance on landfill, in favour of an integrated waste management approach which will deliver ambitious waste recycling and recovery targets. These include a diversion of 50% of overall household waste away from landfill; a minimum 65% reduction in biodegradable municipal waste consigned to landfill; the development of composting and other feasible biological treatment facilities capable of treating up to 300,000 tonnes of organic waste annually; recycling of 35% of municipal waste, and recycling at least 50% of construction and demolition waste within a five year period, with a progressive increase to at least 85% over 15 years.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have adopted or are currently engaged in finalising a range of regional and local waste management plans generally aimed at meeting these recovery targets. Typically, these plans incorporate proposals for household segregation and kerbside collection of organic waste and dry recyclables in urban areas; an extended network of &ldquo;bring&rdquo; facilities in rural areas, typically with a target density of one facility per 500 population; an increased network of civic amenity sites and waste transfer stations and a range of waste treatment and disposal facilities.</P>
      <P>To support the delivery of improved waste management services and infrastructure under these plans, some £650 million is earmarked for capital investment in the development of waste management infrastructure under the National Development Plan 2000-06. Of this, some £100 million in Exchequer EU funding will be provided to support the development of requisite waste recovery infrastructure over the life of the plan.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the systematic approach now being adopted will provide a good basis on which to address the difficulties associated with improving our national materials recycling performance.</P>
      <P>In addition, a further policy statement focusing on waste minimisation, recycling and waste recovery generally is currently in preparation. This will address in detail the factors and practical considerations which are relevant to the achievement of Government policy objectives in this area, and outline the scope of further measures which will be undertaken in support of better recycling performance.</P>

      <P>Clare County Council submitted an environmental impact statement and an associated compulsory purchase order for the proposed N18 road improvements &ndash; Dromoland to Crusheen, including the Ennis by-pass, on 26 April 2000. Interested parties may make written submissions to my Department in relation to the likely environmental effects of this proposed road development before 2 June, 2000. This is also the deadline for the receipt of objections to the compulsory purchase order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As objections have been received, a public local inquiry into all matters relating to the scheme will be arranged in due course. When the public inquiry is completed, the person who conducted the inquiry will submit a report to me, which I must consider, together with the environmental impact statement, the associated compul<Col N="293" /> sory purchase order and the submissions made before making a determination.</P>
    <P>In view of my quasi-judicial role in the process, it would not be appropriate to comment at this stage on specific issues relating to this proposal.</P>

      <P>In March 1998 my Department, in association with the Dublin Transportation Office, published a design manual for cycle facilities entitled Provision of cycle facilities &ndash; National Manual for Urban Areas, which was subsequently circulated to all local authorities. A copy is also available in the Oireachtas Library. This manual, which was prepared in association with international consultants, provides a comprehensive set of guidelines for the design and provision of cycle facilities and provides assistance to local authorities in ensuring that such facilities are implemented to a uniform and high standard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 264, 265 and 266 together.</P>
      <P>My Department lays down no specific standard for construction practices other than that the form of construction used should comply with the building regulations. I am aware that some private developers and builders, mainly in the greater Dublin area, have opted for the use of hollow block construction while others have favoured cavity wall construction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The building regulations do not place a restriction on the use of any particular method of construction or product, provided the performance requirements of the regulations are met, e.g. in relation to thermal performance and structural stability. It is a matter for building owners, designers and builders to ensure that their build<Col N="298" /> ings comply with the regulations and to select the form of construction and product which best meets their needs in achieving this.</P>
    <P>Technical guidance document L, which accompanies the regulations, provides guidance on the thermal performance standards of various elements in buildings, including roofs, walls and so on. For typical construction, the technical guidance document provides guidance on determining the thickness of insulation material required to achieve the standards, taking account of the thermal properties of both the insulation and the basic construction.</P>
    <P>My Department has initiated a review of the domestic insulation requirements of technical guidance document L, having regard to Ireland's obligations to limit greenhouse gas emissions under the Kyoto Protocol of 1997. In accordance with standard practice, my Department has consulted the Building Regulations Advisory Body on the proposed review. The BRAB has, in turn, commissioned a technical study by the energy research group, UCD, of the impact of greater insulation levels in new houses on building systems commonly used in Ireland and on indoor air climate. The study is expected to be completed by the end of June 2000. I understand that the outcome of the study will be discussed by the BRAB in July 2000. The Deputy will appreciate that I do not wish to prejudge the outcome at this stage. I will await the results of the study and the subsequent advice of the BRAB on the revision of the relevant technical guidance.</P>
    <P>In the context of the preparation of Ireland's national greenhouse gas abatement strategy, a number of options to promote increased energy efficiency in residential accommodation are being examined, including the use of financial instruments. The necessary timeframe required to allow the construction industry to provide for adjustments required, if any, in respect of any measures included in the strategy, will be taken into account in the implementation of the strategy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since February 1994, local authorities have been advised that full central heating should be provided in all new local authority housing as part of the overall cost of the schemes. While the management, maintenance and improvement of their existing dwellings, including the installation of central heating, is the responsibility of local authorities to be defrayed from their own resources, capital funding may be provided under the remedial works scheme to assist authorities to carry out major structural works to designated estates. The installation of central heating in houses may form part of the works undertaken in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The choice of heating system and fuel is a mat<Col N="300" /> ter for determination by the local authority, <i>inter alia</i>, by reference to expected capital and running costs, including possible servicing and maintenance costs, and the preference of the likely occupants. Accordingly, I have no plans to have discussions with Bord Gais on this issue.</P>
    <P>The carrying out of a survey of their housing stock is a matter for individual local authorities as part of their housing management and maintenance responsibilities. The next national housing condition survey is due to take place in 2001 and will encompass all housing stock, both private and social.</P>

      <P>The disabled persons grant scheme is administered by local authorities in accordance with the legal framework laid down in section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979, and statutory regulations made under that Act. The framework laid down in the statutory regulations is, as far as practicable, designed to give an appropriate degree of flexibility to local authorities in administering the scheme and I have no proposals to amend the regulations in this regard.</P>
      <P>It is, accordingly, a matter for the local authority to decide the staffing resources to be made available, the level of grants in individual cases and the circumstances in which a grant may be paid. It is, of course, also a matter for the authority to ensure there are no undue delays in the processing of applications for disabled persons grants and my Department will write to local authorities in this regard in the near future.</P>

      <P>The ten year restoration programme for non-national roads has as its aim the restoration of all local and regional roads in county council areas over the life of the programme, i.e. by the end of 2005. The programme is on target and is progressing systematically on the basis of priorities identified by local authorities in their multi-annual programmes.</P>
      <P>The 2000 allocation for the restoration programme is £147.4 million which represents a 58% increase on the 1997 initial allocation of £93.33 million. Monaghan County Council's restoration programme allocation in 2000 is £5.383 million, which is a 54% increase on the 1997 initial allocation of £3.485 million. During the same period the council's non-national road grant allocation under all categories has been increased by 39% from £5.933 million to £8.269 million.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that this increased level of central funding, supplemented by the council's own resources, is providing adequately for the ongoing maintenance and improvement needs of the council's non-national road network and will assist in its systematic and accelerated improvement.</P>

      <P>Thermal treatment of waste, carried on in accordance with high environmental standards, is regarded as environmentally preferable to the disposal of waste by landfill, and plays a major part in municipal waste management in many EU countries and further afield.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the policy guidance outlined in Changing our Ways, emerging regional waste management plans provide for the development of an integrated network of waste management infrastructure, including facilities for thermal treatment of waste.</P>
      <P>To inform the development and implementation of these waste management plans, two EU-funded feasibility studies were carried out in 1998 on thermal treatment-recovery options as one element in an integrated approach towards waste management. These studies examined the technical, environmental and financial advantages and disadvantages of thermal treatment in two distinct rural regions &ndash; the north-east and mid-west &ndash; and in the greater Dublin region.</P>
      <P>The studies were commissioned respectively by Meath County Council, on behalf of eight local authorities in the two rural regions concerned, and Dublin Corporation on behalf of the four local authorities in the Dublin region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has no direct function in relation to the making of waste management plans or the selection and development of waste facilities by local authorities and, accordingly, has not commissioned studies of the nature referred to. However, many international studies have been undertaken in relation to the incineration and thermal treatment of waste, and considerable information in this regard is available through <Col N="305" /> ENFO, the environmental information service operated by my Department.</P>
    <P>Irish environmental legislation, in particular the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, provides for the integrated licensing and comprehensive environmental control of waste incineration facilities. The EPA must take the precautionary principle into account and is precluded from granting an integrated licence unless, among other considerations, it is satisfied that the activity concerned will not endanger human health or harm the environment.</P>

      <P>Regard must be had to the need to give effect to the polluter pays principle, in financing the provision of waste services by or on behalf of local authorities. The October 1998 policy statement on waste, Changing our Ways, strongly advocates that local authorities move rapidly towards full cost recoupment for the waste services which they provide by means of use-related waste charges levied on all waste producers, including households and commercial-business concerns.</P>
      <P>Within this overall context, the Government will directly support the delivery of improved waste management services and infrastructure. Some £650 million is earmarked for capital investment in the development of waste management infrastructure under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. Of this, some £100 million in EU Exchequer funding will be provided to support the development of requisite waste recovery infrastructure over the life of the plan.</P>
      <P>It is the intention to expand upon the policy issues and guidance outlined in Changing our Ways with the publication this year of another policy statement focusing on waste minimisation, recycling and recovery generally. This will outline the scope of measures to be undertaken in the interests of a sustained improvement in our recycling performance.</P>

      <P>Under the SWA scheme asylum seekers can receive assistance in the form of a basic payment, a supplement for rent or diet and exceptional needs payments, ENPs.</P>
      <P>Total expenditure on SWA payments to asylum seekers in 1999 is estimated at £35 million. This includes £22.7 million in respect of basic SWA, £10 million in respect of rent supplement and £1.3 million in respect of ENPs. Total expenditure in 1998 was £22 million. This includes approximately £15 million in respect of basic SWA, £5.5 million in respect of rent supplement and £1 million in respect of ENPs. Total expenditure in 1997 was £12 million but a detailed breakdown by type of payment is not available.</P>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not available in relation to earlier years. Prior to 1997, asylum seekers were not identified separately from other SWA applicants, but as there were fewer asylum seekers at that time expenditure would have been lower.</P>

      <P>Under the social welfare system, homeless persons have the same entitlements as any other Irish citizen. If they are unemployed but capable of and genuinely seeking work, then they can apply for unemployment assistance. They can be paid basic supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, if they do not fulfil the conditions for any other primary weekly payment from my Department. In addition, they can also apply for payments such as rent supplementation, diet supplement and exceptional needs payments under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>One of the most important supports provided to homeless people through the social welfare system is assistance with rent deposits to enable them to secure private rented accommodation. Some £1.5 million was provided for rent deposits in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main policy initiative taken recently in relation to homelessness was the establishment of a cross departmental team on the issue, under the aegis of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The team also included rep<Col N="309" /> resentatives of my Department and the Departments of Education and Science, Finance, Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>Its report was published recently by my colleague, the Minister with responsibility for housing and urban renewal and the main recommendations have been accepted by the Government.</P>
    <P>As a result, action plans for the delivery of services to homeless people are to be drawn up by local authorities and health boards. Additional funding will be provided and a homeless forum will be established in each county, bringing together the statutory and voluntary agencies responding to the needs of homeless people.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was due arrears of £299.25 in respect of his free telephone rental allowance. The Department issued a cheque to him for this amount on 3 June 1999 to his home address.</P>
      <P>The person concerned wrote to Department in October 1999 stating that he had not received payment and requesting a copy of the cashed cheque. The Department obtained a copy of the cheque in November 1999, which showed that it had been presented at a local bank on 4 June 1999 and cleared by the bank on 8 June.</P>
      <P>On foot of further inquiries from the spouse of the person concerned in April 2000, arrangements were made for a local officer of the Department to interview the person concerned and his spouse, and the bank in question.

      <Quest>if he will increase the fuel allowance scheme, in view of the fact that the payment has remained static since 1985 and that the rise in fuel prices has increased the financial hardship of families on low income; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householder who are on <Col N="310" /> long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week, £8 per week in smokeless zones, is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid October to mid April.</P>
      <P>In order to be eligible for assistance under the national fuel scheme, the person must satisfy a means test. A substantial improvement in the means test was introduced by me in the 1999 budget. A person may now have a combined household income of up to £30 per week or savings-investments of up to £22,400 over and above his or her pension and still qualify for fuel allowance.</P>
      <P>Any increase in the rate of payment would have to be considered in the light of the modest increase overall in domestic fuel prices since the current rate of the fuel allowance was set, taking into account the substantial increases in primary payment rates over the same period.</P>
      <P>The national and smokeless fuel schemes were reviewed in 1998 as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The review group took the view that improvements in the national fuel scheme cannot be looked at in isolation from the improvements in the primary weekly payment rates. With regard to the payment rate, the group concluded that the present rates of payment should remain unchanged if improvements in primary payment rates fully compensated recipients for all price inflation, including fuel price inflation. In that regard, substantial increases in all the social welfare primary payments of either £3 or £6 per week were paid from June 1999 with further increases of either £4 or £7 which came into effect at the beginning of May 2000.</P>
      <P>Fuel allowances are not the sole mechanism through which assistance is provided to people with heating needs.</P>
      <P>There is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>
      <P>Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the SWA scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment, ENP. ENPs are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the national fuel scheme has increased by approximately 17% in the last seven years from £37.5 million in 1993 to £44 million in 1999.</P>
      <P>Any change in the rate of payment would have significant cost implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>As outlined in that reply, the pensions board, in reaching its decision not to recommend the extension of revaluation requirements to all pre-1991 service, expressed concern that there could be potential implications for the solvency of occupational pension schemes and a resulting loss of benefit for members, if all pre-1991 service was to be revalued.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a range of grants schemes which offer support for local self-help groups, community development, welfare rights and information work and on the provision of seed money to enable community groups to pilot initiatives identified as meeting new emerging community needs.</P>
      <P>Community groups seeking funding under the various grants schemes operated by my Department are required to have an anti-poverty focus and to promote the participation of people experiencing poverty and social exclusion. In assessing applications received under the various schemes, my Department must establish the extent to which groups, and the particular project for which funding is sought, addresses such poverty and exclusion. In allocating funding it is also necessary to take account of the overall demands under the schemes and the level of funding available to meet these demands.</P>

    <P>I can confirm that the western regional office of my Department has received an application under the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations from a branch of the Active Retirement Association based in that region. As a large num<Col N="312" /> ber of applications have been received and will take time to process, it is not possible to indicate at this stage if funding can be allocated to this group under this year's scheme. I am also aware that clarification on the group's proposal is being sought by officers of my Department and the group will be contacted in the coming weeks regarding their application.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme is a short-term payment designed to provide immediate assistance for those in need. The purpose of the scheme is to ensure that every person in the State has access to a prescribed minimum income, taking their household circumstances into account.</P>
      <P>The amount of SWA payable in all cases is the difference between the person's means and the minimum weekly income prescribed in law for the household type in question. Household income is taken into account and reduces the amount of SWA payable by £1 for every £1 means assessed. In the case raised by the Deputy, the household consists of a cohabiting couple without dependent children. The amount of SWA payable in respect of such a household is currently £123 per week, if they have no means.</P>
      <P>If a couple has means of less than £123 then the amount payable is the balance required to bring their income up to £123. If a couple has means of £123 or more, then SWA is not payable. In this particular case, the partner of the person is in employment and, as a result, the household income from this source exceeds £123 per week by some £177 per week. The person concerned has also been awarded occupational injury benefit of £77.50 per week and this increases the household income to some £375 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the SWA scheme, a weekly supplement may be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to people in receipt of social welfare or health board payments. Entitlement to a supplement is determined by the health boards and supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which clients are required to pay from <Col N="313" /> their own resources towards their accommodation costs. Any increase in income over and above the SWA rate will result in a decrease of that amount in the rent or mortgage interest supplement rate payable.</P>
    <P>The person concerned applied for mortgage interest supplement but did not qualify on means grounds. The weekly interest is £33 per week. The SWA rate for a couple is £133 but this couple's means are some £250 in excess of this rate so no mortgage interest supplement is payable.</P>
    <P>My colleague the Minister for Health and Children, is responsible for medical cards and the treatment of co-habiting couples under the tax code is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. This latter issue is being dealt with by my colleague the Minister for Finance in his response to a parliamentary question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The farm assist scheme was introduced in April 1999 and is delivering important additional supports for farmers, and particular to farm families on low incomes.</P>
      <P>Total expenditure in 1998 on the smallholder's unemployment assistance scheme amounted to some £27.8 million. In 1999, total expenditure on the farm assist scheme and on the smallholder's unemployment assistance scheme amounted to an estimated £29.8 million and it is estimated that total expenditure in the current year will increase to some £36.8 million.</P>
      <P>The increase in expenditure reflects the combined impact of a number of different factors: the general welfare increases provided for in the 1999 and 2000 budgets; the increased level of payments secured by a very substantial number of farmer claimants of smallholder's unemployment assistance whose means were reviewed in the course of their transfer to the new scheme; and the level of payments being made to first time claimants of the allowance &ndash; new applicants are receiving average payments of some £59 per week.</P>
      <P>It is necessary also to take account of the fact that a number of former claimants of smallholder's unemployment assistance are in receipt of reduced payments under the farm assist scheme, reflecting primarily the improvement in household incomes arising from the substantial increase in off-farm employment in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farm assist scheme is making a valuable contribution to supporting those who are at the lower end of the farm income spectrum. The effectiveness of the scheme is being further <Col N="314" /> enhanced as a result of a number of improvements which I have provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 2000.</P>
    <P>First, the child-related income disregards are being increased from £100 for the first two children and £200 for each subsequent qualified child to £200 and £300 respectively. Second, instead of 80%, only 70% of self-employment income, including off-farm self-employment, will be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Third, I am introducing changes in the way capital is assessed, with the first £10,000 held by a claimant disregarded, and the balance treated more favourably than heretofore.</P>
    <P>All of these improvements will take effect in October of this year.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit from 11 June 1999 to 28 September 1999. She was examined by a medical assessor of the Department on 21 September 1999 in line with normal review procedures.

      <P>The medical assessor who examined the person concerned on 21 September 1999 expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Since I came to office in mid-1997 I have allocated a total of £13 million to this scheme which allowed some 53,000 individuals to receive assistance under the scheme. I am committed to ensuring that this scheme continues to address the security needs of the most vulnerable older people in our society and accordingly a sum of £5 million has been provided for the scheme in my Department's estimates for 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While every effort is made to ensure the prompt processing of applications, failure to submit the necessary documentation or satisfactory accounts will invariably delay the processing of these applications. In administering this and other <Col N="316" /> grant schemes, my Department must ensure that all criteria are adhered to, including the provision by funded groups of satisfactory accounts in respect of previous grants. Applications are processed as quickly as possible by my Department once all the necessary documentation has been received. However if the Deputy's question relates to any particular group, I would be happy to check the position on receipt of details of the relevant group.</P>
    <P>The maximum grant available under the scheme is 90% of the once-off costs of purchasing/installing the necessary security equipment. However, the actual level of funding made available for individual applications varies according to individual needs and circumstances and according to the overall demand to be met in relation to the available resources. It is necessary to assess all applications at the same time so that an appropriate level of funding can be determined for each application, taking into account the need to target funding at those most in need of assistance under the scheme. To facilitate this process it is necessary to have one closing date for receipt of applications so that an accurate assessment of the total number of applications received and the level of funding sought can be made.</P>
    <P>This process also diminishes the administrative responsibilities of the voluntary organisations who work tirelessly in their communities to improve the social support of the most vulnerable older people and to promote the benefits of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that older people are aware and avail of this scheme. In November 1999, in order to enhance the profile of the scheme, my Department circulated a newsletter to some 311,000 pensioners, outlining details of all relevant schemes including information on the scheme of community support for older people. In addition, the scheme is advertised extensively each year in both the national and provincial newspapers.</P>
    <P>An independent review of the scheme was completed in 1999 and there are no plans to amend the terms of the scheme.</P>

      <Quest>if he will have investigations made into the anomaly where a farming couple paid PRSI on the joint income of their combined holding and the contributory old age pension is awarded only to the husband with the spouse being denied an adult dependent allowance, in view of the fact that some of the farm is in her name; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>conditions in their own right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="317" /> In relation to the question, it is understood that the Deputy has a particular case in mind. I can confirm that an old age contributory pension at the maximum personal rate, of £96 per week, has been awarded to the person concerned with effect from 26 May 2000. While the couple do share ownership of the farm, this pension award has been made on the basis of the returns of PRSI to the Revenue Commissioners which were made in the husband's name only.</P>
    <P>Entitlements in this case are under active investigation by the Department in consultation with the Revenue Commissioners. The latter are examining the appropriateness of the manner in which PRSI contributions were returned in this case. The Department will be in touch on this matter without delay.</P>

      <P>The farm assist scheme, which introduced the special arrangements for farmers on low incomes, was provided for in the</P>
      <P>Social Welfare Act, 1999, and came into operation with effect from 7 April 1999.</P>
      <P>On 30 April, 2000, there were 7,540 farm assist claims in payment, of whom 5,079 have transferred from smallholders' unemployment assistance. In addition, 406 claimants are still in receipt of small-holders unemployment assistance, and are currently being reviewed.</P>
      <P>To date 554 claimants have transferred from other schemes, including pre-retirement allowance, widow(er)'s (non-contributory) pensions and disability allowance.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,923 new applications have been received, with 1,907 of these in payment on 30 April. The balance are cases under investigation, cases where have been disallowed or cases where</P>
      <P>the applicant ceased claiming for various reasons such as securing employment.</P>
      <P>The average weekly payment to all farm assist claimants is £79.30. The former small-holders who have transferred to farm assist and are receiving on average £87.00 per week, an increase of almost £12.50 per week compared with the average weekly payment of £74.60 made under the small-holders scheme, in 1998.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 2000, provided for a number of important changes to the means test for the farm assist scheme. The child related disregards are being increased from £100 for the first two children and £200 for each subsequent qualified child to £200 and £300, respectively.</P>

      <Col N="318" /> Furthermore, instead of 80%, only 70% of self-employment income (including off-farm self-employment) will now be taken into account. There are also changes in the way capital is assessed, with the first £10,000 held by a claimant disregarded, and the balance treated more favourably than before. These changes will be effective from October, 2000.</P>

      <P>On making a claim for unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance, customers are required to prove that they fulfil the required statutory conditions of being available for, capable of and genuinely seeking work. To be regarded as fulfilling the requirement of genuinely seeking work a person must show that he or she has taken reasonable steps to obtain employment, including applying for and seeking information on jobs, and availing of suitable training opportunities.</P>
      <P>Customers are also interviewed by staff regarding their efforts to secure employment on an on&ndash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 304 and 305 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has for several years operated a range of grants schemes and community development support programmes which concentrate on a wide range of support for local self&ndash;</P>
      <P>help groups, community development, welfare rights and information work, and on the provision of seed money to enable community groups to pilot initiatives identified as meeting new and emerging community needs.</P>
      <P>The focus of these programmes is on providing support to locally-based community groups involved in anti-poverty work within their communities by supporting these communities to develop their capacity to change their situation for the better, to enable them to participate in society and have a real say in their own development.</P>
      <P>Under Partnership 2000 my Department was committed to identifying 30 new priority areas for inclusion in the community development programme. The technical group which advises me on areas for expansion of the programmes, first gathered baseline information on levels of disadvantage and poverty. In this regard the group had available to it, the report &ldquo;Targeting Disadvantage under the Community Development Programme&rdquo; which was commissioned at its request by the Combat Poverty Agency. The report ranked all areas of the State in terms of comparative disadvantage. Further research was undertaken by the regional support agencies funded under the community development programme to further identify the priority areas for assistance under the programmes.</P>
      <P>This targeting exercise identified Newbridge and north west Kildare as priority areas in County Kildare for assistance under the programmes. The Curragh was also identified as an area which may require assistance pending the outcome of pre-development work in Newbridge and north west Kildare. The Regional Support Agency for Kildare/Wicklow will be undertaking the necessary work to establish projects in these areas.</P>
      <P>The current expansion of the community development support programmes represents a very high increase in the number of funded projects to come on stream over the next 18 months or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It involves a considerable concentration of development work by this Department and the regional support agencies during that period. Increased funding for the future expansion of the community development support programmes <Col N="320" /> has been addressed in both the national development plan and in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The programmes will receive £100 million over the lifetime of the national development plan. This is some £2 million to £4 million more per annum than the 1999 provision.</P>
    <P>Further expansion in the number of community development support programme projects falls to be considered within the parameters of the national development plan funding envelope, when the current expansion has been consolidated. Once the new projects are up and running the technical group will be revisiting priority needs for the future expansion of the programmes.</P>
    <P>My Department does not have responsibility for a capital programme under the national development programme.</P>

      <P>The widow(er)'s pension schemes recognise the particular financial difficulties that arise for people following the death of a spouse.</P>
      <P>The qualifying conditions for the widow(er)'s contributory pension scheme are more flexible than those applying to the old age and retirement pensions. Widowed people can qualify by using either their own or their late spouse's social insurance record. In addition, a person may also use the full social insurance record or the record over the previous three or five years.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my Budget 2000 speech and following the review of the action programme for the millennium, this Government is committed to extending a pension rate of £100 per week to all social welfare pensions for older people. In this regard, from this month, the weekly rate of the widow(er)'s contributory pension has increased to £89.10 per week for those aged over 66. The maximum rate for a person aged under 66 years is £81.10.</P>
      <P>A widow's and widower's non-contributory pension is available to those, without children, who do not qualify for the contributory pension. This is payable subject to a means test.</P>
      <P>From this month the maximum rate of the widow(er)'s non-contributory pension is £85.50 per week for those over age 66 and £77.50 for those aged under 66.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Title to these pensions also gives access to the free schemes, where the person is over 66 years of age. In this context, special measures are in place to ensure that households do not suffer the loss of entitlements following the death of a <Col N="321" /> spouse. Widows/widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement.</P>
    <P>Widows and widowers with children who do not qualify for a widow/er's contributory pension can qualify for the one-parent family payment, the rate of which is £85.50 per week for those over 66 and £77.50 for those under 66 with effect from this month. This payment is available to both men and women who are parenting alone and is designed, firstly, to provide basic income support, taking into account the special needs and requirements of single parents and, secondly, to encourage lone parents to return to/enter the workforce so that, over time, they can achieve a greater degree of economic independence. To this end, an earnings disregard of £115.38 per week is available under the one-parent family payment means test.</P>
    <P>In the 1999 budget I introduced the bereavement grant which increased the payment on the death of an insured person from £100 to £500. This payment benefited almost 17,000 people last year. I announced a widowed parent's grant of £1,000 in the Budget 2000 to provide additional support for those with dependent children in the immediate aftermath of a bereavement. The new grant is available to widows and widowers with dependent children who qualify for a widow/er's contributory pension, one-parent family payment or a bereavement grant. The grant is expected to benefit about 1,500 widowed people each year.</P>
    <P>The improvements set out above are of specific benefit to widowed people and the position with regard to any further changes will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>Disability benefit is a short-term illness payment made to insured people who are unable to work due to illness. Control of the scheme &ndash; in the context of determining if a claimant continues to satisfy the statutory condition of being incapable of work &ndash; is exercised through the referral of cases for review by the Department's medical assessors.</P>
      <P>In the period 1 May 1999 to 30 April 2000, a total of 7,315 claimants had their payments terminated on the grounds that they were considered capable of work following medical examinations by medical assessors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Claimants whose payments are terminated are advised of their right of appeal. In the period 1 May 1999 to 30 April 2000, a total of 3,552 claimants, whose payments were terminated on the grounds that they were capable of work, appealed <Col N="322" /> and, of those, payment was restored in 1,714 cases.</P>
    <P>Disability benefit, being an insurance-based scheme, is not subject to a means test and for that reason a reduction of payment, arising from the review process, would not arise.</P>

      <P>In all my Department's schemes there is a review mechanism to ensure that entitlement conditions continue to be satisfied. Continuing entitlement under the invalidity pension scheme is dependent on the person concerned satisfying the medical eligibility criteria. This is verified through a process of selective and periodic review of appropriate cases.</P>
      <P>Invalidity pension is not a means-tested payment, therefore there is no question of payment being reduced as a result of the review process.</P>
      <P>At the end of April there were 47,488 people in receipt of invalidity pension. In the year to 30 April 2000 some 888 invalidity pension claims were reviewed. Of these 64 recipients have had their allowance terminated on the grounds that they no longer satisfy the medical criteria for receipt of invalidity pension.</P>
      <P>In all such review cases the persons concerned were informed of the decision and the reasons for it. They were also advised of their right of appeal to the social welfare appeals office. Fifty of the cases terminated subsequently appealed and, of these, 40 cases had payment restored.</P>

      <P>In all my Department's schemes there is a review mechanism to ensure that entitlement conditions continue to be satisfied. Continuing entitlement under the disability allowance scheme is dependent on the person satisfying both a means test and the medical eligibility criteria. This is achieved through a process of selective and periodic review of appropriate cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were 51,279 persons in receipt of the disability allowance as at 30 April 2000. During the period 1 May 1999 to 30 April 2000 some 8,595 disability allowance claims were reviewed. Of these, 136 recipients have had their allowance terminated on the grounds that they no longer satisfy the medical criteria for receipt of disability <Col N="323" /> allowance. Entitlement was terminated in 952 cases because of changes in means.</P>
    <P>In all such review cases the persons concerned were informed of the decision and the reasons for it. They were also advised of their right of appeal to the social welfare appeals office. Forty four recipients who had their allowance terminated on medical grounds had their payments restored on appeal. A number of other cases are still in the appeals process. It is not possible at this stage, to provide information regarding appeals in respect of cases disallowed on means grounds. No figures are available in respect of cases where the payment has been reduced.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme operated by my Department is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over as well as to incapacitated people under that age who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. The scheme provides eligible people, including spouses and in certain cases companions, with free travel on a range of services provided by the CIE group of companies and by 76 private transport operators. It also provides reciprocal travel facilities for passholders to travel to and from Northern Ireland. The scheme is estimated to cost £34.70 million in 2000. There are currently 564,000 people with a free travel pass.</P>
      <P>To avail of free travel on any of the services covered by the scheme, a pass-holder presents his/her pass to the relevant transport operator.

      <P>As I have previously indicated, over the years there has been progressive flexibility in the qualifying conditions for these pension schemes, notably the pro-rata pensions which I introduced in 1997 which reduced the yearly average for the old age contributory pension to ten and, more recently, the new arrangements which give further recognition to contributions paid prior to 1953. This is in line with this Government's commitment to extend contributory pensions coverage to as many categories of people as possible.</P>

      <Quest>if he proposes to introduce any changes in such schemes as dental and optical benefit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The treatment benefit scheme provides a range of benefits in the areas of dental, optical and aural treatment for qualified PRSI contributors and their dependent spouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards dental benefit, an examination and scale and polish is available free of charge to the qualified claimant. In the case of fillings and <Col N="325" /> extractions, my Department pays 70% of the agreed fee in accordance with the scale of fees negotiated on behalf of the dentists operating the scheme and the claimant pays the balance. An agreed fee also applies in the case of dentures with the claimant and the Department each paying 50%. For other treatments my Department pays a fixed contribution towards the cost and the claimant is liable for the balance charged by the dentist.</P>
    <P>As regards optical benefit, the qualified person can get free of charge an eye examination together with a pair of spectacles from a limited range of frames. Where a more expensive frame is chosen, my Department pays a fixed contribution with the claimant paying the balance. A similar arrangement applies in the case of contact lenses.</P>
    <P>The PRSI contribution conditions relating to entitlement to these benefits vary depending on the age of the insured person.</P>
    <P>Persons aged under 21 must have at least 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work in order to qualify while persons aged from 21 to 24 must have at least 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year of which a minimum of 13 weeks must be paid contributions.</P>
    <P>In the case of persons aged from 25 to 65, the requirement is that they have at least 260 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year of which a minimum of 13 weeks must be paid contributions.</P>
    <P>Finally, persons aged 66 or over are required to have at least 260 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in either of the last two tax years before reaching age 66 of which a minimum of 13 weeks must be paid contributions.</P>
    <P>The latter requirement, 13 weeks paid contributions, does not apply in the case of certain social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>In 1999, some 430,000 claims for dental benefit and some 183,000 claims for optical benefit were approved by my Department at a cost of some £26.6 million and £7.9 million respectively.</P>
    <P>While I have no plans to change the qualifying conditions of these schemes or to introduce other changes, the overall effectiveness of the schemes is kept under constant review.</P>

      <Quest>the current position regarding repairs to Ballybunion Castle, County Kerry, following its recent damage by lightening; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, Ballybunion Castle which is not in State ownership is in a dangerous condition following lightning damage in December last. For safety reasons Kerry County Council fenced off the <Col N="327" /> castle and in January it was inspected by a senior conservation architect from my Department and by Kerry County Council's area engineer.</P>
      <P>Following that inspection the architect provided a report to the county council on the condition of the castle. The report identified the need for urgent remedial works. The county council have recently informed me that they are in the process of removing the most dangerous portion of the castle in such a way as to allow for the rebuilding of that portion in due course.</P>
      <P>No estimate is yet available for the cost of conserving Ballybunion Castle. This can only be determined after scaffolding has been erected, which in itself is a specialist, and difficult job. In any event a conservation of the castle is likely to prove to be an expensive project. I recognise the importance of Ballybunion Castle as a landmark for the town of Ballybunion and am aware of the interest locally in its conservation. Unfortunately, the resources of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department are already fully committed to the 700 monuments currently in State care. Kerry County Council, for their part, have informed me that they do not have the resources to allocate funds for this work.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department have been in touch with the Heritage Council and with Kerry County Council as regards possible sources of funding of the conservation of the castle. One major stumbling block is that ownership of the castle has not been established and until this is done the building will not be placed on the Heritage Council's Buildings at Risk Register. The Heritage Council say they are not in a position to consider funding the conservation of a building until it has been placed on the Buildings at Risk Register.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the difficulties that are being faced, my Department is prepared to work in co-operation with the county council and other interested parties with a view to finding a solution. In this regard, senior officials of my Department are due to meet with county council officials at their request in the near future.</P>

      <Quest>if, further to Parliamentary Question No. 273 of 16 May 2000, she will review her position, as the question does not in any way reflect on the work done or the people doing it but rather on the fact that there are not enough people working in this regard and as a consequence many national monuments are in an advanced state of disrepair and in urgent in need of attention; her views on whether the time has come for a public/private approach; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I reassure the Deputy that I fully accept that his Parliamentary Ques<Col N="328" /> tion No. 273 of 16 May 2000 was not intended to reflect in any way on the staff of my Department or the quality of their work.</P>
      <P>My reply to that question dealt with the structures in place at present within my Department to maintain national monuments in State care for which there is an ongoing maintenance and conservation programme. Thus, in so far as these monuments are concerned, I could not accept that many of them are in an advanced state of disrepair, or in urgent need of attention. Where a need for urgent attention is identified, my Department prioritises the works necessary to ensure the conservation of the monument in question.</P>
      <P>Many national monuments, principally due to their age exist as ruins and were vested in the State in that condition. This should not however be interpreted as a sign of my Department's inactivity or neglect. A great deal of work, most of which would not be obvious to the general public, is carried out by my Department to minimise the risk of further decay. Conservation rather than full restoration is the essence of my Department's role in relation to national monuments.</P>
      <P>The Deputy suggests in his question that there are not enough people working on national monuments. Whilst I accept that no Minister will probably ever admit to being totally happy with his or her staffing allocation, the Deputy should note that the expenditure by my Department on the conservation of national monuments and historic properties increased from £10.787 million to £12.464 million between 1997 and 1999.</P>
      <P>However, I do accept that when vacancies arise, it can be difficult in the present climate to attract people with the required specialist skills, but this is not a problem unique to my own Department. That said, I do not see a public/private approach as being appropriate given the very specialist nature of works involved. The Deputy will appreciate also that the expertise required to carry out conservation works to national monuments is not widely available in the private sector, and in any event, the condition of our national monuments does not warrant such a major change in policy.          </P>

      <P>I am aware of the report of the Heritage Council referred to by the Deputy which indicates that approximately one-third of the archaeological sites and monuments documented in the early part of the last century have since been destroyed. It is clear that many of these sites were lost when there was no legislative policing of such sites but nevertheless the current the rate of destruction to archaeological sites and monuments which the report puts at one per cent per annum remains unacceptably high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have previously welcomed the publication of this report as it brings a new focus to the problem of the destruction of the archaeological heritage which has been a source of concern to me and to <Col N="332" /> the archaeological survey of my Department but I believe that most of the threats can be significantly reduced through better awareness and education and, in the case of planning and development, which poses the greatest risk, through improved procedures for archaeological mitigation through the planning process.</P>
    <P>Apart from raising awareness my Department also enforces the provisions of the National Monuments Acts to prevent damage. Those who have caused damage are also pursued. This includes court prosecutions as necessary.</P>
    <P>In addition, I am reviewing existing services to enhance monitoring of recorded monuments. A programme of inspections will be introduced in the context of re-organisation proposals in Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department. This will be supported by the recruitment of additional archaeologists to support the work.</P>
    <P>It is the policy of my Department to preserve in-situ all archaeological sites and monuments which are being impacted upon but where such impacts cannot be avoided, invariably through development, the policy is to preserve such sites by record. This involves allowing a site to be removed only after it has been scientifically excavated and recorded to an acceptable standard and my Department sets this as a requirement prior to any construction work taking place.</P>

      <P>The scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the Garda Síochána provides the machinery for the determination of claims and proposals relating to conditions of service for members of the force up to and including the rank of chief superintendent.</P>
      <P>Matters appropriate for discussions by the Garda Conciliation Council for ranks covered by the scheme include, <i>inter alia,</i> principles governing superannuation. Under the terms of the scheme this is not an arbitrable matter.</P>
      <P>In 1982 a claim by the Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors to have a number of allowances which are paid to members of the force made pensionable resulted in a disagreed report of the Garda Conciliation Council. Although, as indicated, this was not an arbitrable matter, the terms of the second national understanding then operable allowed the matter go before the Garda Síochána Arbitration Board. The board, the chairperson of which is an independent entity, produced its report No. 15 in March 1983 which recommended that certain allowances, including rent allowance, be made pensionable with effect from 1 October 1982. The recommendations contained in the Garda Síochána Arbitration Board report No. 15 have been fully implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="334" /> That report specified that a number of allowances, collectively known as unsocial hours allowance, should not be made pensionable.</P>
    <P>Following prolonged discussions at the Garda Conciliation Council agreement was reached in March 1994 which provided, <i>inter alia,</i> for the pensionability of unsocial hours allowances for members of the force who retired after 1 January 1993. The agreement was reached under the terms of the local bargaining clause &ndash; clause 3 &ndash; of the agreement on pay and conditions which formed part of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress. That claim does not allow for retrospection.</P>
    <P>The Deputy refers to a statement by the Minister for Finance of 4 November 1997 relating to a Government decision that public servants who retired before the commencement dates of restructuring pay deals under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work  should benefit from those pay deals on a parity basis subject to a minimum adjustment of 3% in their pensions, or 2% in the case of those pensioners who have already received an advance payment of 1%.</P>
    <P>The Government has considered the issue of pension increases for public servants on several occasions since coming into office and, in order to help it in its deliberations, referred the matter to the Commission on Public Service Pensions.</P>
    <P>It is stated in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness that following Government consideration of the report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions, which is expected in mid-2000, a working group of the public service unions, relevant Department and other appropriate parties will be established to advise on the implementation of the relevant Government decision with a view to introducing, as quickly as possible, any proposed changes in public service pensions arrangements.</P>

The number of appointments offered by Kilkenny and Carlow for the period January 1997 to April 2000 was 673 and 457 respectively.</P>
      <P>Waiting times are continually reviewed by the board and where waiting times, for whatever reason, become excessive the position is examined by the board with a view to taking remedial action where necessary.</P>

      <P>I am conscious of the need to process the applications made under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-06 in a timely fashion to facilitate the development of child care service provision. The equal opportunities child care section in my Department has received over 3,000 requests for application forms under the capital and staffing grant schemes which I announced on 28 April.</P>
      <P>Each application submitted to my Department must go through an appraisal process before a decision can be made. In relation to the named person referred to by the Deputy, an application form was issued at the start of May from the equal opportunities child care section to that address. No completed application form from the named person has been received in the Department as of today. In that light, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the matter.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my previous answer to Question No. 273 of Tuesday, 22 February 2000.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that this application under section 49 of the Registration of Title Act, 1964, was lodged on 5 November 1999.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that applications under section 49, i.e. acquisition of title by virtue of long possession, require detailed examination of the applicants claim for registration as owner and, as such, take some time to process.</P>
      <P>I am further informed that, as part of the process of such examination, the Land Registry must serve notice on any parties who may have any interest in the property. I understand that an objection has been received in respect of one such notice served. The Land Registry issued a letter on 17 May 2000 to the objecting party informing them of the procedures for lodging an objection and stating that, if no objections are received on affidavit within 18 days of 17 May 2000, the application for registration will proceed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 354 and 355 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has been allocated funding of approximately £365 million in the National Development Plan, 2000-06.</P>
      <P>My Department's equal opportunities child care programme has been allocated £250 million to invest in the development of child care service provision. On 28 April last I launched capital and staffing grant measures under the programme and to date almost 3,000 request have been received for application forms. There is no closing date for applications as the programme is being operated on an open ended process. It is not possible to say at this stage how many projects will be funded in any county during 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has been allocated a sum of £23.2 million for positive actions targeted at women. The plan provides for positive actions to tackle vertical and horizontal segregation of the labour market and for the development of family friendly initiatives. There will also be a focus on addressing the needs of women in the home who <Col N="345" /> are seeking to avail of labour market opportunities, supporting gender balances in decision making and assisting disadvantaged women. In addition, my Department has been allocated £4 million for a gender equality and monitoring unit to mainstream equal opportunities between men and women across the national development plan. There is no specific capital element to these measures. The location of projects for 2000 has yet to be finalised.</P>
    <P>There is provision within the national development plan for a programme to prepare prisoners for employment after their release. The programme is an expansion of an existing activity which has been taking place over a number of years in the prisons and it is based on a pilot research project which has been carried out within the last two years with EU funding. This is a co-ordinated programme within the national development plan, both as regards the agencies within my own Department &ndash; the prisons and probation services and the Garda Síochána &ndash; and with other state bodies working in this field. The total expenditure on work and training that is planned in prisons is approximately £46 million. There is no provision in the prisons element of the national development plan either for services or capital programmes for implementation in 2000 specifically located in the south Kildare constituency.</P>
    <P>The probation and welfare service of my Department has been allocated funding under the national development plan of almost £25 million. The proposal in respect of this funding will target a number of groups such as those under 25 years who have been before the courts and are likely to re-offend and become long-term unemployed. Another target group will be women, particularly young women with drug problems and those with families whose lives are disrupted, for example, by domestic violence. The programmes to be put in place under the national development plan relate to developments across the regions as needs apply. It is not possible at this stage to say how many offenders in south Kildare will be referred to the probation and welfare service by the courts, or will be in custody to avail of the projected developments there. There is no capital expenditure planned for this year.</P>
    <P>Funding of £16 million has been allocated for a significant expansion of the Garda youth diversion development programme. The projects in this programme aim, through a combination of intervention and preventative actions, to divert young people from becoming involved in criminal activity and its consequences. The long-term objective is to enable the target group of ten to 18 year olds to integrate into the labour force in a systematic manner and to prevent them from becoming unemployable. It is proposed to expand the number of projects on a phased basis over the life of the plan. I have recently announced the first ten projects to be established in the first phase of the expansion. A second phase will be announced later this year. An application has <Col N="346" /> been received for a Garda youth diversion project in Kildare to serve the Maynooth, Celbridge, Kilcock, Clane and Prosperous areas. The proposal is currently being considered by officials of my Department in conjunction with the Garda authorities. There is no capital element to these measures.</P>

      <P>My Department is co-operating fully with the inquiry but the Deputy will note that under the above mentioned terms I cannot, with propriety, comment on the conduct of an independent judicial inquiry, nor am I in a position to give a timescale for its completion.</P>

      <P>I am informed that the <Col N="347" /> Courts Service is preparing a five to seven year building programme to provide modern court accommodation throughout the country and that the refurbishment of the courthouse in Mullingar will be part of this programme. Court buildings are selected for refurbishment based on certain criteria including condition of the building, office locations, buildings in daily use, number of court sittings, caseload, etc. At present a number of large refurbishment projects are under way in Sligo, Trim and Cork Circuit Court, together with a number of smaller projects at Buncrana, Carrickmacross and Mallow, with a number of other projects due to commence in the near future.</P>
      <P>The Courts Service has informed me that an architect has been appointed by Westmeath County Council, which acts as the Courts Service's agents in this matter, to prepare plans for the refurbishment of Mullingar courthouse. When draft plans have been drawn up all interested parties, i.e. the Judiciary, staff, legal profession, gardaí and other court users will be consulted in relation to the facilities to be provided there.</P>
      <P>It is not possible at this stage to provide a precise timescale for the work given the nature of the planning, consultation and tendering processes. However, the Courts Service will continue to progress the project and the Deputy may be assured that I am committed to providing modern courthouse accommodation in Mullingar as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>My Department is not aware of any anticipated accommodation difficulties at the school in question in the coming school year.</P>
      <P>The general position in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy is that the staffing for a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled in the school on the 30 September of the previous year. On 30 September 2000 the enrolment at the school in question was 234 pupils. Under the current staffing schedule, this enrolment gives the school an entitlement to a principal and eight assistants for the 2000-01 school year. This represents no change from its 1999-2000 complement and the accommodation recently provided caters for this number of teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, if the board of management of the <Col N="358" /> school anticipates that the overall enrolment of the school on 30 September 2000 will qualify under the terms of circular 11/00 for a teaching post on the basis of developing school status, they may apply for such a post to the primary payments section of my Department in Athlone.</P>
    <P>If a requirement for an additional classroom arises on foot of such an appointment, the board of management should, with the approval of the patron, bring this matter to the attention of the planning section of my Department in Tullamore.</P>

      <P>In 1999 my Department sanctioned a grant of £607,000 for the Irish Deaf Society to develop a service over a five-year period to address the literacy needs of deaf people throughout Ireland.</P>
      <P>This allocation is based on a pilot programme called Linkup, which ran for two years and provided literacy training courses for 11 deaf women through Irish sign language. The expanded Linkup programme will train 25 tutors to deliver literacy classes through Irish sign language in five locations throughout Ireland.</P>
      <P>Following representations from parents, a special class was established in St. Joseph's special school, Cabra, in which the bilingual approach is followed. Special needs assistants with competence in Irish sign language have been allocated to the school to support the teachers and pupils in the use of this approach. In addition, training courses in Irish sign language have been held for teachers of deaf pupils to equip them with the necessary skills. Such courses will continue to be supported. This will enable teachers to meet the needs of those pupils whose chief method of communication is through the medium of signing.</P>
      <P>It is acknowledged that no single method of communication is suitable for all deaf students. In this context, the assessed needs of each individual child are of central importance when, in consultation with the child's parents, decisions are being made regarding appropriate educational provision.</P>

      <P>Certain Montessori teachers are granted restricted recognition to teach in certain special schools and classes. In addition, my Department has recently decided that such teachers are also eligible to apply for and take up positions as resource teachers for pupils with special needs in ordinary schools.</P>
      <P>The Montessori teachers who are entitled to restricted recognition are teachers with the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full time course in the Association Montessori Internationale &ndash; AMI &ndash; College, Mount St. Mary's, Milltown, Dublin 14, and teachers trained in St. Nicholas Montessori College, Dún Laoghaire, who have successfully completed the diploma or degree in humanities in Montessori education recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards.</P>
      <P>Issues related to the training and qualifications of primary school teachers are kept under review. At present the existing pre-service training of primary teachers is being reviewed. A working group undertaking that review is expected to complete its work before the summer. Following completion of that review it is proposed to put in place a review of the recognition of Montessori teachers as primary teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A group wishing to establish a new primary school is required to submit a formal application to the planning section of my Department. The application should include details of the number of pupils expected to enrol in the proposed new school in the initial and subsequent years and <Col N="361" /> should also indicate how it is proposed to accommodate the school. Successful applicants would be required to nominate a patron and appoint a board of management in accordance with standard procedure.</P>
    <P>Recognised primary schools are eligible for a range of current funding, including grants towards teacher salaries and capitation. When such schools have demonstrated viability and have been granted permanent recognition, they also become eligible to apply for capital grants. In order to gain recognition as a national school, and a consequent right to State funding, a school must agree to conform to the rules for national schools, to teach the national primary school curriculum and to employ fully qualified teachers.</P>

      <P>Following representations from parents of hearing impaired children, a special class has been established in St. Joseph's special school, Cabra, in which the bilingual approach is followed. Special needs assistants with competence in Irish sign language have been allocated to the school to support the teachers and pupils in the use of this approach.</P>
      <P>In addition, training courses in Irish sign language have been held for teachers of deaf pupils. Such courses will continue to be supported in order to enable teachers to meet the needs of those pupils whose chief method of communication is through the medium of signing.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the debate concerning the best method of teaching deaf children and the changes in methods which have occurred over the years. The views of the Irish Deaf Society and the parents they represent in regard to bilingualism as an approach to the education of deaf children, with Irish sign language as their first language, have already been acknowledged in the Education Act, 1998.</P>
      <P>However, it is also acknowledged that no single method of communication is suitable for all deaf students. In this context, the assessed needs of the individual child are of central importance when, in consultation with the child's parents, decisions are being made regarding appropriate educational provision.</P>

      <P>Following its consultation with various interests in the field, the Higher Education Authority has recently submitted a report to my Department on the proposal to establish a centre for deaf studies in Trinity College Dublin.

      <P>The annual certificate examinations can give rise to situations where some human factor, e.g. onset of illness, must be balanced against the requirements of equity to the general body of students. While my Department would wish to do all that it can for students who have to cope with difficulties at exam time there is also the need to apply uniform, and objective criteria to the marking of student's examination work.</P>
      <P>Essentially, my Department tries to achieve this balance through making every reasonable provision for candidates to demonstrate their full ability at the actual examination while at the same time applying the marking scheme to the work produced by each student.</P>
      <P>The purpose of making special arrangements at examination time is to ensure that a candidate is given every opportunity to demonstrate his-her level of attainment. No arrangements, however, can be made to compensate for an actual lack of attainment. The examination system seeks to measure what a candidate has achieved rather than what a candidate might have achieved if circumstances were different.</P>

      <P>The primary and post-primary school transport scheme were basically designed to cater for children in rural areas, who, if living a long distance from school, might otherwise have difficulty in attending regularly. As a general rule in order to be eligible for transport under the terms of the schemes children must be attending their nearest national school or their appropriate post-primary centre and meet the distance criteria.</P>
      <P>For pupils attending all-Irish or multi-denominational schools or pupils of Protestant denomination attending schools under Protestant management, eligibility is determined by reference to the distance to the nearest such school. Children attending special schools and special classes are given special consideration in the matter of transport to school through a separate network outside the eligibility criteria applicable under the normal school transport scheme.</P>
      <P>In some circumstances concessionary transport may be allowed subject to certain conditions.</P>
      <P>Where fare-paying transport is sought to a national school other than the nearest, the written agreement of the board of management of the nearest school is required to the provision of transport. As the Department's obligations are to eligible pupils, concessionary fare-payers may not always be accommodated.</P>
      <P>Eligible pupils who wish to attend a post-primary centre other than their appropriate one may be allowed transport from within the catchment boundary of the centre being attended, subject to there being spare accommodation available on the service and provided no extra State cost is incurred. These pupils are, themselves, responsible for getting to the catchment boundary. It is not open to the Department to allow these pupils to be picked up from within their own catchment area, as it could give rise to objections from their appropriate post-primary centre, which would be sensitive to the loss of pupils from their area.</P>
      <P>Generally, pupils are required to attend their nearest national school or post-primary centre to be considered eligible for transport purposes. To provide school transport for all pupils to attend the school of their choice would be difficult administratively and costly in terms of additional bus routes, which would most likely be required. In addition it would have major implications in the area of educational planning, particularly in relation to the provision of school facilities, and raise concerns with some schools with regard to future viability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstances, it is not intended that the school transport schemes will be expanded to transport pupils to the school of their choice, <Col N="364" /> should it be other than their nearest national school or post-primary centre.</P>

      <P>Since 1996 the student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states. Prior to this, grants were only payable to students who were pursuing approved courses in the Republic and Northern Ireland. In this context and following discussions with the local authorities regarding the necessary administrative arrangements, it was agreed that students pursuing approved courses in other EU member states, including Northern Ireland, would be paid the value of the grant in the currency of the country in which they were studying and that the value of the maintenance grant to be paid in all circumstances would be the Irish value converted to the currency of the country in which the student is pursuing his/her course.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1996, students studying in Northern Ireland were paid the amount of the grant in sterling, without reference to exchange rates. Those students studying in Northern Ireland who were assessed under the student support schemes prior to 1996 continue to receive their grants in sterling, without reference to exchange rates. Students who commenced their studies from 1996 are paid under the revised arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December last, in response to a number of representations, local authorities and vocational education committees were advised that grant-holders should be given the option of having their <Col N="365" /> grant paid either in Irish punts or in the currency of the country in which they are studying. This concession allows students studying in Northern Ireland or the UK to receive their grants in Irish punts rather than sterling if they so wish.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the current arrangements are equitable and efficient. While I appreciate the current exchange rate difficulties with sterling, I am not in a position to supplement grant aid for students pursuing courses in the United Kingdom or elsewhere in the EU. Moreover, such an approach could well give rise to anomalies and to claims of inequitable treatment between students studying in different countries.</P>

      <P>Following the Government decision in November 1998 all children with special educational needs within the primary school system, including children with dsyslexia, ADHD and emotional-behavioural disorders, now have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs.</P>
      <P>Many children exhibiting less serious forms of the behaviours associated with these disabilities are being successfully taught within mainstream classes, with the support where necessary of resource teachers.</P>
