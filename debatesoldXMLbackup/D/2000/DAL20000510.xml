      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>further to Parliamentary Question No. 12 of 28 March 2000, the nature of his detailed discussion with the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board about the European MediaLab Initiative; the actions, if any, he promised to undertake on his return relating to this project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my answer to Question No. 12 of 28 March 2000, at the meeting of the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board we had a detailed discussion on developments in the Irish economy. This included presentations on e-commerce developments in Ireland and the related MediaLab Europe initiative. This project, which will be developed in partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is expected to contribute to improving Ireland's e-commerce capability, primarily by increasing research and development activity in this area. The members of the advisory board seemed to be of the view that it was an important and worthwhile initiative. I did not promise to undertake any actions related to this project on my return to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand that MediaLab will be conducting educational activities in Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>MediaLabEurope will part of a multi-media village on which there is still much work to be done. It will be a research and development institute specialising in the initial stages in Internet and digital industry applications. It is being developed by the Government in partnership with Massachusetts Institute of Technology and will be modelled on the institute's world famous media laboratory. The Irish project, like the one in the United States, will be led by Professor Nicholas Negroponte and <Col N="1254" /> will be a third level institute with undergraduate and post-graduate students. The bulk of the operating revenue will come from industry sponsorship and, in the initial years, from the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the degrees, diplomas and certificates granted by the institute be recognised as degrees, diplomas and certificates of Massachusetts Institute of Technology; in other words, will they have the academic approval of the MIT to the same degree as similar activities located in the institute in Massachusetts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance the degrees will be linked to an Irish university, in respect of which discussions will take place shortly, with an equivalence with the standards, procedures and reputation of the MIT. It is hoped that they will form the basis of an MIT European degree to be granted to undergraduates and post-graduates of what will be MIT Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could it not be said that the fact that the MIT, which is receiving assistance for this project and is supporting it, is not willing to grant its own degrees to graduates of the facility in Dublin is an indication of a lack of adequate confidence on its part in the project?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The institute has not yet been established and the MIT does not wish to find itself in conflict with Irish universities. In the initial stages therefore it is far better for it to enter into an arrangement with an Irish institute or institutes. The intention is that from day one there will be an equivalence with its standards and that over time the degrees will form the basis of a European MIT degree. The project is still in its infancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why on earth would the MIT grant degrees on its own authority to students who pass its examinations in a facility which it will establish in Ireland with the aid of the Government cause any problem with any other Irish university?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may not be aware that some institutes are concerned that the institute will not duplicate work already being done by them. There is an effort to ensure the project commences on the right basis. There is no point speculating; in the initial stages it is intended that degrees will be linked to an Irish university or universities with an equivalence with the standards of the MIT and that over time they will form the basis of a European degree under the name of MIT Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is one to infer from what the Taoiseach is saying that Irish universities want to operate some sort of closed shop and do not want any competition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to ensure the project will work. It is not the case that Irish universities <Col N="1255" /> do not want competition. That is not the intention. In the initial stages MediaLab, an institute of world renown &ndash; this is its first time to locate outside the MIT &ndash; is expected to focus on technology in education, electronic commerce and digital expression. It has produced remarkable inventions and, in the past six months or so, made an enormous move forward in digital sound involving a new means of digitally producing and distributing sound. Its inventions have been very different to the kind of research and development taking place elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Ireland is making many moves in research and development. A few years ago we allocated practically no resources to research and development but we are moving to a position where about £2 billion is allocated for research and development projects in the national development plan. These projects are listed in the foresight programme.</P>
      <P>We wish to ensure that MIT and other projects in the multimedia village over time can have good relationships with research and development, which is a new feature of our educational institutes. We want to avoid conflict, as does MIT. It did not come to Ireland to create conflict and it wants to work with the educational institutions here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the MediaLab project is a unique hybrid between a research and development project and a post-graduate school? Would he also agree that the nature of that hybrid is that it is being funded, from the taxpayers' point of view, by a Vote from the Taoiseach's Estimate and not from the Departments of Education and Science or Enterprise, Trade and Employment?</P>
      <P>I understand that the money involved amounts to £30 million. Will the Taoiseach indicate whether, as part of the detailed contract which has all but been agreed but is in draft form, there is a clear commitment that there will be degree recognition by MIT at the end of a transitional period? Will he also indicate whether that is implied by his use of a very strange academic hybrid, an MIT equivalence degree? Will he further indicate whether, subject to proper satisfactory progress, there will be a European MIT certification for this research laboratory which is part innovation and part education?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Equivalence&rdquo; is the word MIT is using. It is not the word I am using from day one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the word the Taoiseach is using in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes it is, but it is the word MIT used in the discussions. MIT hopes to move quickly to what the Deputy suggested, namely an MIT Europe degree, which would be clearly based on its degree. However, initially it would <Col N="1256" /> prefer to link with the colleges. There has been much comment in the colleges&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, if the Taoiseach would defer, we are giving £30 million of taxpayers' money, which I support, which is clearly for research and development with an educational dimension. Does the small print ensure, subject to normal guarantees, that at the end of the transitional period of three, four, eight years or however long it happens to be, there will be an MIT imprimatur on the degree that will emerge from MediaLab? Yes or no?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the MIT Europe degree?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it will not be in the initial stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. J. Bruton: Is it not unusual that a third level institution, for that is what this is, is being set up and a lot of money being put into it without knowing from the outset what authority will accredit the degrees that will be won by students from the institution? The Taoiseach has not been able to tell the House what university or institute of technology will grant the degrees, even though the money has been committed to the establishment of the institution. When will we know who will be granting the degrees and what standard of recognition they will have internationally?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>MIT is a world-renowned institution. It is still negotiating the contract to set up MIT Europe in Ireland which, hopefully, will be finished this summer. It is looking at locations and there will be a development company to run the institution. MIT is very conscious and anxious to ensure that it has good relationships with Irish universities. In the initial stage, with the equivalence in standards, the standards in the courses will be same as MIT, Massachusetts, in the areas I mentioned. Over time, and I am not sure that MIT has worked out what time that is but it is in the period stated by Deputy Quinn, there will be an MIT Europe degree. Those are the answers to the questions.</P>
      <P>The discussions are on going. It does not yet have a location. The development board is not yet in place. We must give the commitments on resources to engage it. Deputies would have read the articles stating that there are several other places in Europe which wanted MIT, and we are lucky that it is coming to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason the Vote is in my Department is that most Departments have been involved in the preliminary discussions along with the technology foresight programme, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland. It will move to whichever Department will take responsibility for it and whichever development company will answer for it to Government level. That is the present position. <Col N="1257" /> As the discussions are finalised and the contract is available, that will become a public document.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 2 to 15, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Last August I accepted an invitation from the UN Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, to attend the United Nations Millennium Summit, which is set to take place in New York on 6-8 September next. In my letter accepting Secretary-General Annan's invitation, I indicated my hope that the outcome of the summit might be a serious and realistic programme to renew, revitalise and strengthen the UN for a new era.</P>
      <P>On 15 March 2000, the General Assembly decided that the summit's overall theme will be &ldquo;The Role of the United Nations in the Twenty-First Century&rdquo;. It also decided that the summit will be composed of plenary meetings and of four interactive round-table sessions. The themes for the round-table sessions will form the agenda for our discussions at the summit and have yet to be decided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Secretary-General presented his report for the Millennium Summit to the General Assembly on Monday, 3 April. Mr. Annan wrote to me on 24 April enclosing a copy of his report which is entitled &ldquo;We the Peoples: The Role of the United Nations in the 21st Century&rdquo;. He advised me that he prepared his report to facilitate the preparations by member states for the summit. The report identifies some of the pressing challenges faced by the world's population and proposes a number of immediate priorities for consideration at the summit itself. Heads of State or Government are urged to take action in areas such as poverty, water, debt relief, education, HIV/AIDS, slum clearance, youth employment and information technology. The Secretary-Gen<Col N="1259" /> eral also urges the summit to make special provision for the needs of Africa, and to fully support Africans in their struggle to overcome the continent's problems. In addition, the Secretary-General calls for a renewed focus on conflict prevention and disarmament and respect for international law. The adoption by national governments of a new ethic of conservation and stewardship of the environment is also identified as a priority.</P>
    <P>The report offers a broad and challenging agenda for consideration in the lead-up to, and during, the summit. Ireland is working to ensure the success of the summit through the participation of my personal representative, Mr. Noel Dorr, in the group of 16 which has already contributed significantly to identifying issues for consideration by the summit. Preparations for Ireland's participation at the summit are being handled by our permanent representative to the UN in New York and by relevant officials, primarily in the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>On 6 April, I wrote to the new Japanese Prime Minister, Mr. Yoshiro Mori, congratulating him on his appointment and wishing him well for the future. I also took the opportunity to express, both to Prime Minister Mori and to Mrs. Obuchi, the sympathy of the Irish people on the illness of Mr. Obuchi, the previous Prime Minister, and our hopes for his recovery.</P>
    <P>I was very happy to welcome former President Nelson Mandela to Government Buildings on 12 April during his private visit to Ireland. We had an interesting meeting. I enjoyed once again hearing his views on conflict resolution, arising from extensive experience. In particular, we discussed the Northern Ireland peace process and he emphasised the need for generosity on all sides to achieve progress. I thanked him for the help which South Africa has given in the peace process. We discussed developments in South Africa, and spoke about my visit there earlier this year. I mentioned the trade delegation which accompanied me and we spoke briefly about trade matters. We discussed the recent Africa-Europe Summit and Mr. Mandela briefed me on the progress of his work as facilitator of the Burundi peace negotiations. He thanked me for Ireland's support for South African reconstruction and development and asked that Ireland continue its commitment to development, not just in South Africa but also in other parts of the African continent.</P>
    <P>I received a courtesy call from the Vice-Premier of China, Mr. Li Lanquing, at Government Buildings on 19 April last. The Vice-Premier has particular responsibility for trade, investment and education, and was in Ireland as the guest of the Tánaiste. My discussions with him dealt mainly with trade and economic matters. We discussed points of mutual interest, including the development of Ireland's Asia strategy and other aspects of bilateral and multilateral relations. These included the preparations for the forthcoming <Col N="1260" /> ASEM III Summit in Korea and negotiations with the EU regarding China's accession to the WTO. We also had a brief discussion of political issues, in the course of which the Vice-Premier outlined the current Chinese position on Taiwan and said that China's desire was to achieve reunification with Taiwan through peaceful negotiation. I described developments in Northern Ireland including human rights.</P>
    <P>The next meeting of the European Council will take place in Feira in Portugal on 19 and 20 June. The agenda has not yet been finalised. However, I expect it to focus on issues of current interest to the Union, such as the Intergovernmental Conference and the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Both issues will be progressed further by the French Presidency in the second half of the year. Given the very successful Lisbon Special European Council on Employment, I also expect discussion to ensure the implementation of the conclusions agreed.</P>
    <P>With regard to the position concerning bilateral relations with Austria, I have received no communications from the Presidency or other EU Heads of Government since the announcement of the agreed position of the 14 member states on 31 January last. We did, of course, discuss this matter at the EU Council in Lisbon on 23 and 24 March. In common with other EU Heads of Government, I have received a copy of a letter issued by the Presidency to President Klestil following the Lisbon Council confirming the position of the 14 as expressed at Lisbon. I also understand that the measures of the 14 against Austria were raised during the course of an informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in the Azores at the weekend. Several partners, including Ireland, were of the view that there is a need to reflect on how this issue has developed, and to consider possible ways of resolving it. Clearly, we must continue to monitor closely developments in Austria.</P>
    <P>Official level contacts have been maintained with Austrian officials through meetings between officials in my Department and officials in the Austrian Embassy. No requests for such meetings were declined. Neither myself nor the Minister of State has had political level meetings with the Austrian Ambassador. I received an invitation, forwarded to me by the Austrian Ambassador, on behalf of the organisers of the European Economic Symposium in Alpbach which is taking place from 30 August to 1 September in Austria, which I have declined on diary grounds.</P>
    <P>I will undertake an official visit to Poland from 24 to 26 May. Preparations for the visit are ongoing involving officials from my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Irish Embassy in Poland. Accordingly, the programme for my visit is still being finalised. However, I will be meeting with the Polish Prime Minister, Mr. Jerzy Buzek, the President, Mr. Alexander Kwasniewski, and the Speakers of the Polish Parliament and Senate. I am pleased to say I will be accompanied by a large business del<Col N="1261" /> egation of 45 companies. During the visit I will meet with them and their Polish partners as well as perform the official opening of new facilities for some Irish companies expanding their operations in the Polish market. I will also host a reception for the Irish community and business interests in Poland.</P>
    <P>Apart from Poland, the only confirmed overseas visits in my diary between now and the end of July are my attendance at the European Council Meeting on 19 and 20 June in Feira and an official visit to Norway on 25 and 26 June. Prime Minister Goh of Singapore and Prime Minister Patterson of Jamaica are scheduled to visit Ireland during June and I look forward to meeting them during their visits here.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of an article published in the <i>Irish Law Times</i> which suggests that the Irish Government and other EU Governments acted illegally in the sanctions they imposed on Austria in that they did not respect or use the treaty provisions to deal with sanctions of this nature and acted instead in a bilateral fashion which evaded the treaty obligations under which Governments ought to have acted and that, therefore, the Government action was illegal?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the article but the comments have been made elsewhere. As I said previously, this was a decision made by the Portuguese Presidency at the time, following consultation and the agreement of all the other countries. As I said in the House on a number of occasions, I am satisfied the measures taken as a result of the situation which developed during November, December and January, were appropriate. I am reassured by the new Government's commitments to Europe and their common values with other member states. As the Deputy is aware, there were discussions in the Azores during the weekend and I hope progress will be made on the issue in the period ahead.</P>

      <P>I ask the Taoiseach to read the article in question. Will he agree that it is one of the fundamentals of the rule of law which applies in Europe and under which the European Union operates, as does this State operate internally, that a person against whom a sanction is proposed to be taken should be heard before the sanction is imposed? Is the Taoiseach aware that, if the treaty provisions in regard to the sanctions on Austria had been followed, that would have happened? Is he also aware that by acting outside the treaties and acting as individuals in a concerted way, but not in accordance with the treaties, the Irish Government and others conspired to ensure that the nation against whom sanctions were imposed was not given an opportunity to be heard, as any accused person ought to be in a normal democracy, before the sanction was imposed? Would he agree that this principle of law is of great importance and should not be <Col N="1262" /> modified simply to comply with considerations of political correctness or fashion?</P>

      <P>To reiterate what I have said, it was the consideration of the Presidency, and agreed by others, that not to take any action would be in breach of the treaty provisions &ndash; I previously quoted from Article 6 &ndash; and that it was necessary to take some action because of the involvement of the party in Government and its stated position. That was considered to be the minimum that the Presidency should do.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was an initiative of the Presidency. There was far more pressure to go further than this, but that did not happen. Time has moved on.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the EU is telling eastern Europe that to be eligible to be members of the EU, applicant states must comply with the rule of law, that one of the principles of the rule of law is that an accused person should be heard before they are sanctioned and surely the EU should, therefore, follow its own principles and its own procedures where it applies sanctions and hear the accused before it sentences them? Does he not agree that in this instance the accused was not heard before sentence? Regardless of whether the sentence was right or wrong, to have proceeded in such a fashion was to corrupt the treaties and is not something the Taoiseach should have done or should have agreed to.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach re-examine the juridical basis of the procedures followed in this case? There will be cases in the future where we will need again to sanction member states for doing things which they ought not to do or being of a composition or holding a political opinion they ought not to be. However, if that is to be done it is very important it be done in an exemplary fashion in accordance with the rule of law and that those who are laying down the principles about the rule of law follow them.</P>

      <P>With regard to the recent visit of the Vice-Premier of the People's Republic of China, did the Taoiseach raise with him the issue of human rights and China's application to join the World Trade Organisation? Did he impress on the Vice-Premier the interaction between human rights, democracy and access to free global trade conditions, that one side was the other side of the same coin and that China cannot expect to have access to the rest of the world's markets on equal and fair conditions if it continues to oppress its own people in general and its workers in particular?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I discussed both issues and the Deputy can be satisfied that I reflected his concerns. The Vice-Premier is primarily responsible for trade and was anxious to emphasise China's position on the WTO. He was one of the negotiators of the original WTO rounds. I raised these issues at my meeting in China 18 months ago. The UN Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Mary Robinson, was also in China at the time. I went back over some of the ground covered. In the interests of fairness, the Vice-Premier did inform me that the two key UN human rights instruments which I was raising at that stage in support of what Mary Robinson had been arguing during her high profile visits, namely, the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights and the International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, would be ratified at an early stage and that further progress would be made on the ground in this regard. Visits were also received from the working group on arbitrary detention in addition to the visit of the UN Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main channel which has been developed since then is the EU-China human rights dialogue which was recently reiterated at the 56th session in Geneva at which the position of the EU countries was outlined. We fully associated ourselves with the EU countries' statement. As China has finalised negotiations with the US, it is suspicious that Europe is saying that more remains to be implemented. I restated that this was a separate European position and that it had nothing to do with China's negotiations with the US. I do not really know why that view exists because I recall studying the briefs carefully at the time and, to my recollection, they were not linked to the US <Col N="1264" /> position. The EU-China human rights dialogue and the ongoing discussions must continue on the basis set down by the EU.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree the consolidation of the world's global economy and the triumph of capitalism will be sustained only if it is civilised in the same manner as social democracy civilised capitalism in Europe? Does he agree that we will witness a very unstable and, consequently, very dangerous project if EU member states and prime ministers such as the Taoiseach do not reinforce at every possible opportunity the point that civil rights and democracy are the other side of a functioning market economy and that one cannot have a functioning market economy in real terms without the concomitant parts of free elections, civil rights, functioning democracy and the rule of law?</P>

Aside from the discussions which were previously held in the US category, the EU has been pursuing a programme of human rights dialogue. The most recent meeting was held on 25 February.

The concern about the lack of progress in dialogue led to the EU recently agreeing to review it, with a more focused and result orientated approach.

Last summer I addressed the group when it was here and I wish to take its initiatives and progress them.

      <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied with the pace of EU negotiations for Polish accession? Does he expect that the CAP will extend in more or less its current form to Poland once Poland becomes a full member of the EU? How will Polish agriculture be dealt with in the context of EU membership?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the first question, we have tabled our own proposals, but if we are to get major change in the UN it will have to be on the basis of consensus. We participated in the group of 16 and more or less have a permanent person on it, along with our own ambassador, to formulate proposals which by and large have been successful and which have been taken on board by Kofi Annan in the document I mentioned. If we pursued things on our own without reference to others we would not have had a chance of having the proposals taken on board. We can have success in terms of genuine reform though our input in groups such as the group of 16.</P>
      <P>Regarding Poland, the CAP will have to apply to the Polish. It is a very difficult matter for Poland as it has an enormous number of very small farmers. So far in economic discussions they are falling behind somewhat which is causing them grave concern. Countries which will be in the first wave of accession want Poland to be included, as does the EU, and compromises will have to be extended to them in terms of transition arrangements to help the enormous population of what they term &ldquo;peasant farmers&rdquo;. I think Poland is on track in terms of the time scale of 2002 or January 2003.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that agriculture represents about 50% of the EU budget, how will it be possible to extend the CAP to Poland while remaining within the current ceiling which sees the CAP set as a proportion of GDP in the EU budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The headline figure for the proportion of the GDP for the EU budget is 1.27% and it is not being used; it is well below that figure at present. It will become a bigger problem in a few years' time but certainly in the first few years member states will be able to provide the 1.27%. Difficulties will arise after 2006. I have already stated my view on that to farming bodies here and we should not lose time in addressing it. The resources available for existing members under <Col N="1268" /> CAP just will not be there after 2006. The report that was prepared on Irish agriculture recently has identified that. I am meeting IFA representatives later to discuss other matters but every time I meet them I raise this issue because it would be a grave mistake to believe that in some way we can all blink in 2006 and get the same resources under CAP after that. That clearly will not happen. It will for Poland but not for us and it is something we need to address. We are addressing it but it is something that people must understand over the next few years, otherwise we will get a rude awakening in 2007.</P>

I outlined the difficulties for Europe in conceding the concessions that China has sought. China's view is that it has discussed these matters already with the Americans and, therefore, it should not have a difficulty with the EU.

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest>his views on the recommended option of the KPMG report on seaports in the Shannon Estuary where it was specified that the Shannon and Foynes Port Company would have its operational headquarters in Foynes and its administrative and commercial headquarters in Limerick; if he will confirm, in accordance with his statement at the press launch, that the headquarters for operations, commercial and administrative functions will be at Foynes, County Limerick; and the level of funding to be provided by him for the new Shannon and Foynes Port Company.</Quest>
      <QRef>[12896/00]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The KPMG report recommended that the location of the headquarters of the new single port company would be a matter for the new executive but that operational management should be located at Foynes, while Limerick should have the administrative and commercial responsibilities.</P>
      <P>Following publication of the report, I, as shareholder, decided that certainty was required regarding where the headquarters and executive location for the new port company should be. Out of the combined business of the two companies the facilities over which the most business influence can be exerted by the new port company are at Foynes. In addition, the thrust of Government policy is away from centralisation in the major towns and cities. I explained this fully to the boards and management of the two port companies when I visited them recently.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I also recently announced the establishment of a five member implementation board to initiate the process of overseeing the transition to a new single port company. There will be close liaison between the implementation board and both port company boards and their successor advisory boards in order to ensure the smoothest possible transition to a new single port company structure. While the operational headquarters will be located at Foynes, the new single port company will need to have a presence at other port locations and facilities within the estuary. This is a matter which will fall to be determined by the implementation board following full and detailed consultations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the question of funding, the consultant's report recommended an equity injection to ensure that the new company can trade and remain solvent This matter will be considered by the implementation board which will finalise fully developed and costed proposals and identify necessary levels of Exchequer funding in order to <Col N="1270" /> position itself to most effectively and efficiently discharge its functions.</P>
    <P>A new Bill amending the Harbours Act, 1996, which I hope to place before the House in the near future will,<i> inter alia</i>, provide a mechanism to inject equity essential to the future of the port company. As a shareholder it is my responsibility to ensure that the State's port industry assets are deployed to best effect and that the business is competitive, responsive to customer's needs and operates on a sound financial footing. Above all, I want the estuary ports industry to be a focal point for development of the estuary as a whole and to deliver to the best extent possible on its potential.</P>
    <P>I thank local Deputies from the locality in question, particular Deputy Finucane, for the constructive approach they have adopted. This matter has a long history and many issues remain to be resolved. However, the responsible approach to this matter taken by all Deputies, particularly that adopted by Deputy Finucane, is to be welcomed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comments. I am a native of Foynes which is the central location on the estuary and I welcome his clarification that not alone will it be the operational centre but that it will also house the commercial and administrative headquarters.</P>
      <P>The report states that equity to the tune of approximately £5 million to £8 million will be provided. Is the Minister satisfied this level of equity would be sufficient to meet requirements? The report places great emphasis on Foynes' debts. The port has an urgent need for new equipment but I do not believe it would be sufficient if the Department proceeded to provide 50% of the funding in order that an additional crane could be purchased. In the current climate, 100% of the funding will be required. Is the Minister aware that the pension requirements at Limerick port, which has been the subject of under-investment, could amount to £3 million? Will the implementation board consider these matters in the context of the project's capital requirements?</P>
      <P>At the Cabinet discussions on this matter, the Minister outlined the importance of the N69 route and also the access road into the harbour. Is he in a position to indicate whether the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has given a commitment to proceed with the construction of that access road in the near future? The level of investment required for this would be less than £3 million but it is an urgent priority. With regard to the announcement and its acceptance among the local community, people have displayed a level of goodwill in the past but this will evaporate if the access road to the harbour is not built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to allay any fears or concerns of the harbour board employees, those who work both outdoors and indoors, will the Minister confirm that section 39 of the Harbours Act, 1996, will operate in respect of the new merged entity that <Col N="1271" /> will appear? Will he provide assurances that these people's jobs will not be threatened by the changes taking place?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House has previously been advised, I have asked my Department to prepare by the end of June a comprehensive response to the committee's report. I look forward to receiving that response and to putting it into the public domain. It is now up to management to respond in a constructive and positive fashion to the committee's analysis and conclusions. If the committee has got the emphasis wrong in some respects, I have asked management to spell this out so that the overall debate can move forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee, the Department and I have the same fundamental objective which is to serve the sea fishing sector and all our client groups to the highest standards. We fully acknowledge the need for improvement. Priority is being given to sys<Col N="1272" /> tematic upgrading of the quality of customer service across the Department. A series of initiatives is already under way which will address the customer service recommendations contained in the report. The Department's recently appointed customer service manager is overseeing the implementation of these initiatives and will play a key role in monitoring customer service standards across the Department.</P>
    <P>Quality customer service objectives and key performance indicators are now built into each of the Department's divisional business plans which will enable management and staff to regularly benchmark progress. I have reviewed the business plans intensively with my Department's management team. I have also asked the Department to give key priority to implementing quickly and in full its IT development strategy. A top class IT infrastructure is essential to ensure we have the real-time management information and communications capability required to effectively meet the needs of our client base.</P>
    <P>The committee highlighted what it termed a poor relationship between the Department and the fishing sector. The extent to which there is a communications deficit with local groups and individual fishermen is being discussed with the national fishing industry organisations in the forum of the sea fisheries liaison group. At a meeting of the group on 19 April to discuss the report, the Department invited the industry representatives to offer suggestions on how to enhance the structure and <i>modus operandi</i> of the sea fisheries liaison group and for their views generally on the findings and recommendations in the report. This input and feedback from the industry representatives, in consultation with their members, will assist and inform Department's implementation strategy and response to the committee's report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that this is the second report to emerge in respect of this matter, will the Minister indicate the aspects of the first report which remain to be implemented? What financial arrangements have been made to deploy sufficient numbers of staff to ensure that the report's recommendations are implemented? How many members of the Department's senior staff will be involved in ensuring that the second report is fully implemented or does the Minister intend to delegate responsibility for that to the new committee he has appointed? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first part of the Deputy's question, I am not in a position to indicate the aspects of the first committee's report which have not been implemented. I would have to answer that as a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a very intensive effort in the Department to respond positively to the criticisms that have been made. A number of those criticisms were unfair and unreasonable. However, the senior departmental team, including all the principal officers, are involved in a <Col N="1273" /> response which deals with improving customer service. With the key performance indicators and our divisional business plans being implemented, I am satisfied that we are seeing a much improved customer service. We have, however, staff difficulties. Some 40 staff positions are currently vacant and the Civil Service Commission has not been able to fill them, even though they are approved staff positions. Notwithstanding that, we have a brilliant staff in the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, which is responding well to the huge demands placed on them. It would be wrong for anyone to get the impression that significant progress is not being made in respect of a range of new policy initiatives that are being undertaken together with the traditional work of the staff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate in simple terms what exactly he proposes to achieve as a result of this report? What is the main objective?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The main objective is to respond to the legitimate criticisms in the report by putting in place the required organisational and structural arrangements. One such criticism concerns the Department's inability in the past to respond efficiently and effectively to queries and demands from the industry. That has improved considerably. I am satisfied that structures are in place to bring about further improvement. I assure the Deputy that the Department's staff, from junior level upwards, are working apace to ensure we respond effectively. That is our main objective in responding to the report. We will also respond to other aspects of the report which I would not accept, and we will explode some of the myths therein.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest>the progress, if any, he has made in negotiations with the EU in securing the back-dating of forestry grant and premium payments to farmers and others who have participated in forestry plantation schemes during the past decade.</Quest>
      <QRef>[12686/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the application for higher forestry incentives submitted to the European Commission proposed increased premium levels for those who planted under Council Regulation 2080/92 as well as for those proposing to plant in the current season. Due to the protracted nature of the discussions with the Commission, it was decided that the primary focus would be on securing increases which would have an impact on planting in the current season. The substantial increases in grants and premiums announced by the Minister of State on 6 March will help achieve that objective. The increased rates of grant and premium apply to all those who have planted since 1 October 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am now pursuing as a matter of priority the <Col N="1274" /> question of adequate premium increases for those who planted in earlier years. At a meeting with Commissioner Fischler on 28 March, I stressed the importance I attach to this matter. The Deputy, however, will appreciate that there is absolutely no question of back-dating afforestation grant levels.</P>
    <P>A further detailed submission in support of the case was sent to the Commission last month. Our case is now being considered by the Commission. I anticipate that negotiations on this issue are likely to be difficult. However, I assure the Deputy that I am determined to secure adequate increases in premium levels for those who planted between 1992 and October 1999.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister is holding the fort for his assistant, the Minister of State, who I understand is &ldquo;down under&rdquo; investigating ways and means of improving the Department's mariculture and aquaculture sections. I thought the Minister of State might be here to answer this question but as he is in New Zealand I have no doubt the Minister will do so to the best of his ability. I am disappointed with the Minister's reply because when the Minister of State announced the regulations concerning increases in forestry grants, I understood that he was almost certain the premiums would be back-dated to include people who were the pioneers of the forestry industry since 1990. I thought that we would have definite information today but it appears from the Minister's reply that the matter has been consigned to the back burner by the EU. The Minister cannot see any hope of paying increases to the farmers concerned. If the grants cannot be increased to those who pioneered the industry, the Minister should at least insist that they should enjoy the higher premium rate from the EU as well as those who are now entering the industry. People who had the determination and drive to enter the forestry business from 1990 onwards made a significant contribution to the industry and they should not be forgotten. They will bring their plantations to fruition within the next ten or 15 years, yet they will be penalised if the Minister does not insist they must be included in the new premium grants when he meets his European counterparts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of my Minister of State but I will do my best to stand in on his behalf, hopefully to Deputy Sheehan's satisfaction. A significant effort is being made and I think Deputy Sheehan will acknowledge that the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, has had great success in getting premia increased to their current levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Since then, I have had a further meeting with Commissioner Fischler and my officials have had a subsequent meeting also. The <Col N="1275" /> difficulty, however, is that the Commission has said that between 1992 and now people contracted to a level of premium and there was no question of that being increased. The Commission's argument is that it is done and finished with. We have put up strong counter arguments along the lines mentioned by the Deputy. The Deputy asked me to insist on the matter with our European partners, but the reality is that we must obtain an agreement from the Commission to this increase. If we cannot convince the Commission on that point then, unfortunately, there is not much we can do. Until now the Commission has been quite negative in its response, although we have put up a cogent case stating that people who planted afforestation since 1992 deserve increases in the same way as those who were paid other agricultural premia. I am satisfied that our case has been made as well as it could have been. All we can do is keep up the fight and try to convince the Commission to accept our viewpoint.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware. the report of the consultancy study carried out by AIB Capital Markets and Merrill Lynch to assess the options for the corporate development of Coillte Teoranta was published last month and a copy has been made available to each Member of the House. The main conclusions of the consultants' report are as follows. Until the challenges facing the sector have been resolved, a change in the <Col N="1276" /> ownership structure of Coillte Teoranta should not be considered. Various options outlined, including outright or partial sale and IPO, are regarded by the consultants as realistic options for consideration in the longer term, if their recommendations are successfully implemented. Certain elements of the strategic plan for forestry &ndash; in particular the need to achieve planting targets &ndash; need to be continuously and closely monitored. A considerable increase in sawmilling processing capacity, or increased use of existing capacity, will be required to absorb the growing volume of sawlog. In addition, new markets must be developed for the increasing volumes of sawn wood coming on stream.</P>
      <P>The consultants made a number of recommendations under various headings, namely, development programme, revised strategic plan-efficiency programme, marketing, ownership, afforestation, reforestation, sustainable forest management, Coillte Teoranta enterprises, and dividends.</P>
      <P>I have circulated the report widely to the various sectoral interests, including of course Coillte Teoranta, for their comments. I will listen carefully to the views of all stakeholders. When this consultative process is completed I will develop a strategy to enable Coillte Teoranta to maximise its opportunities and move forward in building on its existing strengths.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>The main elements of the report were publicised by the Minister on Wednesday, 19 April. The consultants, as he rightly pointed out, did not say it should not be privatised but rather that it should be deferred for five years. That is my reading of the statement issued by the Minister in accordance with the report. Does that mean that the Government's policy now is that, in view of the consultants' report, the privatisation of this most important national forestry resource will be deferred, scrapped or re-examined at the end of the five years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no change for the five year period of the policy that Coillte Teoranta should remain a State enterprise. If many of the recommendations in the report are implemented and Coillte Teoranta is able to develop in the way set out in the report &ndash; and I have further thoughts on how I would like to see it develop &ndash; and becomes a strong enough company to be considered for privatisation in five years time, the Government will consider that. However, there is no hard and fast position on what will happen in five years time. It will depend on what happens in the interim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Minister's consultations with the board of Coillte Teoranta, has it indicated to him its opposition to the whole question of privatisation? Does he agree that, in view of the consultants' report, privatisation would not be in the best interests of the State, the farming community and all who have invested in this important indus<Col N="1277" /> try? Can he confirm the board is opposed to it? I am glad he has stated it will be put on the back burner for at least another five years. We will oppose it then, at which time we will be back in Government.</P>

      <P>I have not discussed the matter with the board since the report was published, which is why I have asked it to respond to the report. At that stage we will have discussions with the board and senior management. I think everybody is of the view it would not be appropriate for Coillte Teoranta to be privatised at this time. The company is not ready for that to be even considered. Coillte Teoranta and the timber industry have very significant development potential. The next five years can bring about very significant development. However, there must be changes and a great increase in many aspects of the industry.

      <P>We are also anxious to encourage Coillte Teoranta and the industry to increase sawmilling capacity. Coillte Teoranta and the Department are encouraging the private sector sawmilling industry to increase capacity considerably. As the Deputy knows, there is a serious shortfall in the industry's capacity to deal with the saw log product that is coming on stream, which is holding back the industry.</P>

It remains Government policy that the Irish economy benefits to the maximum extent possible from any current and future offshore exploration activities, within the constraints of EU legislation. I have continually impressed on the Irish Offshore Operators Association and the individual operators that Irish workers and suppliers of goods and services, including service ports, must be given opportunities to participate fully in such activities and I will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy it is my intention to maximise the use of Irish goods, services and employment in respect of all offshore operations. Crucial to that is the need to ensure all potential contractors or suppliers of service are made aware of present and future requirements of operators and main contractors. As I said in my previous reply, I have asked Enterprise Ireland to intensify its business awareness efforts. In that context, a seminar called Contract Awareness for the Offshore Sector was held in Westport on 14 April last. The seminar brought together the main parties involved in the Irish offshore sector and enabled Irish companies in the goods and services sector to hear at first hand of the opportunities offered by the offshore sector.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say the seminar was a success and I am confident that, as a result, Irish companies will realise they have the skills to participate in the exploration industry through the supply of goods and services. There is a commitment by Enterprise Oil to increase servicing activity from Ireland this year and it has already agreed contracts with a number of Irish companies for the provision of various services.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have agreed with Enterprise Ireland that it will work directly with the Irish Offshore Operators Association and specific operators to ensure there is early notification of future offshore work to potential Irish participants. I am glad to say that the Irish Offshore Operators Association and its members are committed to fully supporting these opportunities.</P>

      <P>What volume of jobs and business will be created by the Enterprise Oil service base in Killybegs in Donegal compared with its other service base in Scotland? Was there any success this year in regard to the rig Enterprise Oil will be drilling from off the coastline, in terms of the SIPTU group of workers who traditionally worked on offshore rigs during the summer season or the &ldquo;weather window&rdquo;, as it often described? In previous years, Enterprise Oil has shown no commitment to employing such workers in the traditional way. Has there been any success or movement in that direction?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give exact figures in regard <Col N="1279" /> to Killybegs. However, there has been a considerable increase in the services and work being carried out from there. As far as I am aware, it is more than double the services carried out from Killybegs last year. People in Killybegs are quite happy with the level of activity being generated this summer in comparison with last summer.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any improvement in the situation concerning the SIPTU workers. I discussed this matter with Enterprise Oil. I was informed that the offshore rig, which is now in operation, would bring its own team of workers and, consequently, it would not be possible to employ the SIPTU workers. I have re-emphasised to Enterprise Oil my desire that Irish workers would be employed in all sectors of its activities. I will continue to press that case with Enterprise Oil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>While I recognise that under EU law the Minister cannot compel Enterprise Oil to employ Irish rig workers, it is regrettable that Enterprise Oil, unlike other companies, has not abided by a tradition which dates back to the 1970s. In regard to looking to the future and creating goodwill, particularly with SIPTU, it is regrettable that no part of the contract in terms of the staffing of the rig &ndash; admittedly the rig arrives crewed &ndash; provides for Irish workers even on the catering side. I wish to express my disappointment that Enterprise Oil has not grasped the nettle and has not encouraged Irish workers to work on the rigs, as in the past.</P>
      <P>In regard to the trillion cubic feet of gas which, hopefully, will be brought ashore, have any projections been done by the Department and Enterprise Oil on the number of potential jobs, direct and indirect, which will be created? Now is the time to plan for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the second part of the question, we have to wait until the appraisal well is completed &ndash; as the Deputy is aware, it has been in progress for the past couple of weeks &ndash; before we or Enterprise Oil will know whether the find is commercial. Only then can any further appraisal be done on the job potential. In regard to the SIPTU workers, the Deputy will be aware of the poor relationship which has existed between SIPTU and Enterprise Oil in the past. I have tried and continue to try to repair that bad relationship but until such time as it is repaired and there is goodwill once again on both sides, there will not be much progress in respect of the SIPTU workers. That is not to say Irish people are not employed on the rig. As far as I am aware, there may well be Irish people based in the UK. I am aware that the catering supplies company has some Irish involvement, although I am not exactly sure what it is. I was reassured by Enterprise Oil that it would try to accommodate Irish workers in whatever way possible within EU regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I received a number of reports from the Irish industry about widespread discarding of small fish from larger pelagic vessels in the EU fleet. This problem appears to be more acute in the mackerel and horse mackerel fisheries and if it is as widespread as alleged would be detrimental to the long-term interest of the fisheries and the Irish pelagic sector.</P>
      <P>In the light of the industry concerns which I share, I have pressed the case with Commissioner Fischler for the placing of observers on board large vessels in the EU pelagic fleet. The Commissioner confirmed that the Commission would convene a meeting of those member states involved in the relevant pelagic fisheries before the summer with a view to progressing a pilot scheme for observers.</P>
      <P>The priority now is to make practical progress in developing and agreeing such a programme with the member states concerned and I will be continuing to press Commissioner Fischler and my EU colleagues for early progress. In particular, I will be raising the matter with my Dutch counterpart next week during bilateral discussions.</P>

      <P>I know the Minister had a meeting recently with Mr. Fischler. As he is aware, Mr. Fischler comes from Austria which does not have a navy or a fishing fleet. Will the Minister indicate whether he believes Mr. Fischler appreciates the marine area? </P>
      <P>Will the Minister look at the Norwegian experience of conservation, particularly in regard to mackerel, and the approaches they adopt, particularly in regard to discards, etc? The Irish fishing industry will willingly accept conservation measures provided there is a uniform approach throughout the European Union. Will he consider that in the context of the discussions, that it will be in place in the summer and that measures are uniform throughout the European Union as they apply to people involved in the mackerel fisheries area?</P>

      <P>I accept the last point that the Irish pelagic sector is prepared to go along with conservation measures provided there is a level playing pitch. I am satisfied with the level of responsibility among fishermen and the sector generally. <Col N="1281" /> At last there is a realisation that unless we have conservation, we will not have a fish stock in either the pelagic or the white fish sectors in the future.</P>
      <P>Commissioner Fischler, above all European politicians, is very much aware of everything in his brief and not least the marine, although he comes from a country far removed from it. I was very impressed with the depth of his knowledge and his understanding of the sector. We discussed with him the review of the Common Fisheries Policy and put to him some of the proposals we believe must be central to that review. He was most interested in the proposals from the review group and was very knowledgeable about what is at stake and the progress which is needed. I am satisfied we have a friend in court in Commissioner Fischler as we face the challenge of conservation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the report in <i>The Irish Times </i>of 30 March in which it is reported that Commissioner Fischler said he would consider having observers on the larger ships. In that report, the Minister stated that was a very positive reply from the Commissioner. Will that happen or is the Commissioner just considering it? Does the Minister agree there is agreement among Dutch and Irish fishermen on the question of conservation but that there is no long-term plan, that nobody knows what will happen next week, in six months or next year and that that is the main problem &ndash; that is, there is no strategic long-term plan for fisheries in the Community?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in the reply, it is our priority to insist that there should be observers on board the larger pelagic vessels. There is no doubt in the minds of many fishermen but that many smaller fish are being dumped overboard and that there is a serious erosion of the stock as a result. I put it to Commissioner Fischler, as one of our main priorities, that we must get agreement at EU level on the operation of those observers. It should be possible to land people on the larger boats by helicopter. I see no reason anybody interested in conservation would not be agreeable to that. It will be one of the more significant fights I will have with my Council colleagues. There is no reason to believe the Commissioner is not serious about implementing such a policy.</P>
      <P>I would not accept there is no policy in regard to the future. The Common Fisheries Policy operates, although it has some deficiencies about which there is no question. In the review, which is coming up, we will be better prepared, as a result of the work of the policy review group, to put forward a case which will improve our position in respect of the Common Fisheries Policy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>A prospecting licence for the area concerned was issued for a term of two years from 1 April 1996. An extension of two years was also granted from 1 April 1998. The licence expired on 31 March 2000 and the licensee does not now propose to seek a further renewal. I understand that the deposit is not regarded as a viable mining project for the licensee.</P>
      <P>The next prospecting licence competition, which will be held on 1 August 2000, will test whether there are other companies interested in seeking a prospecting licence to assess the viability of the deposit in the area. I take the point about the benefits of job creation and downstream economic activity being located in a mine area. Generally speaking, this is a feature of successful mining operations.</P>
      <P>I am well aware of the regional importance of an industry such as mining as a source of employment, albeit that it is a capital intensive industry, and would welcome any soundly based, environmentally friendly and viable proposals for a mining lease in the Glangevlin area. As a matter of policy an application for a mining permit in any area is only accepted from the holder in good standing of a prospecting licence for that area. This ensures that the applicant can inform himself of the nature and layout of the mineral body. I should add that the fact that the last licensee has surrendered the licence does not mean there is no prospect of a worthwhile discovery in the area.</P>
      <P>I will let the Deputy know if I grant another prospecting licence for the area concerned following the next competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and I regret that prospecting to date has not indicated a viable gypsum deposit in the Glangevlin area. Glengevlin is in a very undeveloped area and is a part of County Cavan that has been starved of employment opportunities. In view of that, will the Minister ensure that his Department does everything to expedite the issue of a further prospecting licence? Does the Minister agree that in the issuing of any licence, his Department should insert conditions or incentives to ensure that any successful mining applicant would be obliged to have downstream activity locally <Col N="1283" /> should the gypsum deposit prove viable, from a mining point of view?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be most anxious to encourage any prospecting company to pursue the potential of this mine, or any other. Generally, I am very pleased to see that the level of prospecting and drilling is as strong as it has ever been. This is very significant for the mining industry.</P>
      <P>The licence was surrendered because the licensee indicated that the mining and hydro-geological problems would impose too many technical and operational restricitions for the prospect to become a viable mining project. Detailed reports of the prospecting activities which were carried out are being assessed by my Department and these reports will be considered further before the August competition.</P>
      <P>I am hopeful that there will be further applications in August. Failure by one company is not regarded as closing the door on the possibility of finding a viable deposit. In the last competition, which awarded the Glangevlin licence, there was only one applicant. I hope there will be a better response on this occasion.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest>the steps being taken to deal with the problem of flags of convenience vessels in Irish waters; the discussions, if any, he has had with EU Commissioner Fischler on this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>At my meeting with Commissioner Fischler on 28 March, one of the main areas of discussion centred on the need to ensure compliance with the rules by all EU fishing fleets. As the Deputy may be aware, the rules have been tightened by virtue of the new EU fisheries control regulations which came into force last year. The regime now in place allows for enhanced inspection and monitoring arrangements for flagships. I believe that the specific requirement whereby flagships must provide at least four hours notice of intent to land into ports other than those of their flag state will prove to be a very effective measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this juncture, the primary focus must be towards ensuring that the rules are effectively enforced by all member states. The Commissioner shares my determination to deal with the problem and I can assure the Deputy that <Col N="1284" /> Ireland's fisheries protection services at sea and on land are rigorously monitoring and controlling flagship activities in the Irish zone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the many clashes at sea and damage done to Irish vessels, particularly by Spanish vessels, does the Minister agree that the main problem arises ships under flags of convenience? I agree that improvements have been made but what further improvements does the Minister envisage to deal with the long standing problem of ships under flags of convenience using Irish ports to fish unlawfully and to cause havoc to our own fishing fleet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary problem with regard to flagships arises from the difficulty of ensuring that these vessels are not over-fishing the quotas available to them. For this reason our concern is to eliminate the illegal activities of flagships through effective controls. The introduction of satellite monitoring, the new EU control regulation which came into force in July 1999 and the higher level of boardings by the Naval Service will all combine to counteract any illegal activity by flagships. The new requirement under the EU control regulation that flagships should give four hours notice will be particularly helpful.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to say if the problem is caused by flagships. I do not have sufficient information to say whether it is or not. I can say that between 1 January and 30 April 2000, there were 391 boardings and 18 detentions. We are monitoring the activities of those ships very carefully and we will continue to monitor the situation carefully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>First, may I clarify that of the 18 detentions, six were of flagships.</P>
      <P>We did not go into that detail during my meeting with Commissioner Fischler. However, we are carefully monitoring the activities of flagships. There is close liaison and sharing of information on fishery control, including flagships, between ourselves and the UK authorities. This has contributed to a general tightening of the regime.</P>

      <P>I fail to comprehend how the Minister thinks that the four hours notice of landing can be effective when from 6 p.m. on Friday until 9 a.m. on Monday there are no fishery inspectors in Castletownbere or in any other fishery harbour to monitor landings by those vessels. They are at liberty to land as much fish as they like between 6 o'clock on Friday evening and 9 o'clock on Monday morning. If the Minister were to traverse the roads of west Cork during any weekend he would see huge articulated lorries packed to the brim, leaving for the continent.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to an identical question on 22 March there is a range of issues involved in this very complex and sensitive matter. On the one hand, there is a binding international commitment on the State, issues to do with safety of marine investigation in our general area and the issue of whether we should or could depend on GPS, a radio navigation system operated and maintained by the United States and, on the other, there are the understandable concerns of local communities in the area of the planned site about the impact of the proposed station on them.

Clearly, we are not in a position to proceed because of this. I am concerned that we are unable to pursue our international obligations. To this end we may be able to find a community which is willing to accept the project given that the people of County Clare are not prepared to do so. Having looked seriously at the project I do not accept that there are any serious health risks associated with it. I have discussed the matter with the French minister with responsibility for the Loran C mast on the French coastline who has undertaken to supply all of the information available to him.

      <P>Having regard to the desirability that new regulations should be in place before the next general election and the fact that we have not seen legislation coming from the Committee on Members' Interests, to agree in principle to introduce legislation at Second Stage does not in any way pre-empt the detail of the legislation but provides a realistic framework and timetable within which the legislation could be in force before the next general election.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputies Bruton and Quinn. There is no doubt that past events which have recently come to light have undermined confidence in politics. It is our job and duty as leaders to make sure we restore that confidence. Deputy Bruton wrote to me a week ago stating that this should be done by way of constructive dialogue between the parties and I accept that view.</P>
      <P>I also acknowledge the proposals tabled by Fine Gael and the Labour Party which have been helpful in trying to resolve this issue. The Labour Party is to move three Private Members' Bills today. We have dealt with an amount of legislation in this area but we have to make it clear that it is our determination to ensure that people's confidence in the democratic process is restored. We have worked hard across a broad front to bring about a more rigorous regulatory framework in public affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1290" /> Admittedly, there are other issues such as the lobbyists Bill which have not been addressed. The work of the finance and Members' interests committees in bringing forward standards in public office legislation will be available this session. Whatever deliberations we can come to in joint dialogue can be included in that Bill but some issues may not be appropriate to it.</P>
    <P>The corruption Bill is before the House and Fine Gael and the Labour Party have also prepared corruption Bills and have issued proposals. The Government is prepared to enter into constructive dialogue with the political parties to amend existing legislation and to see what needs to be done as regards other legislation. I am happy to do so.</P>

      <Col N="1291" /> It may be useful to have a short debate in the House next week as the parties will consider what to do the following weekend. There are still some difficult matters to be dealt with which do not relate to decommissioning. We have to try to resolve those issues and we may have a clear view on them this day week. Until they are resolved I would still have some concern. We have made a substantial breakthrough on the issue with which we were dealing but, as always in Northern Ireland, there are other issues. Perhaps we could reflect on those issues in the House next week. The House's contribution might help to focus people on the bigger picture so that we can move on with all the institutions rather than getting caught up in what are important items. I do not say they are not important as every item is important but some are more important than others. However, we have to try to find a resolution or at least a solution, a compromise or whatever on those items.</P>
    <P>I am not in the business of telling any person he or she does not have a point of view as that would be very wrong. We have to do our best to find an amicable solution to these issues rather than creating another dilemma.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that the list of legislation scheduled to be published between now and the summer recess makes no reference to the prisons service Bill. The Bill languishes at No. 75 on the list. This is relatively simple legislation to establish a prisons service board, parole board etc., on a statutory basis.

Is this the correct way to do business? We had serious difficulties with that legislation because a raft of amendments was introduced after Second Stage. To add a further raft to it on Report Stage is a bad way to deal with legislation on this critical issue. When will we see the promised overarching immigration Bill?

      <P>On Committee Stage I accepted the principle behind Deputy Howlin's amendment to include bodies which might be established by means other than by statute. At the time I indicated that I wanted to reflect further on the precise wording of the amendment.

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&ndash;The State shall, within 6 months from the passing of this Act, ratify or otherwise become a party to the following instruments&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) Protocol No. 7 to the European convention, done at Strasbourg on the 22nd day of November, 1984;</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) the Torture Convention,</P>
      <P>(<i>c</i>) The Racial Discrimination Convention;</P>
      <P>(<i>d</i>) the European Social Charter (Revised) done at Strasbourg on the 3rd day of May, 1996, and the Additional Protocol to the European Social Charter providing for a system of Collective Complaints, done at Strasbourg on the 9th day of November, 1995.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We discussed this amendment on Committee Stage. I have reread the Minister's response and retailored the amendment to meet some of his concerns. I have rescheduled the time frame from two months to six months within which the State shall, from the passing of this particular enactment, ratify or otherwise become a party to the following instruments: Protocol No. 7 to the European convention, done at Strasbourg on 22 November 1984; the Torture Convention, the Racial Discrimination Convention and the European Social Charter (Revised) done at Strasbourg <Col N="1301" /> on 3 May 1996, and the additional Protocol to the European Charter providing for a system of Collective Complaints, done at Strasbourg on 9 November 1995. The two changes I have made since Committee Stage are, first, to extend the time from two months to six months, which I hope is adequate time for the Minster to agree that these important enactments should be brought into effect in this State. They all do not require legislation. The Minister went through the various relevant ones in response to a Committee Stage amendment. Second, I have deleted the reference to the minorities convention, since that has subsequently been ratified. The Minister will be aware that these amendments formed part of the Labour Party Private Members' Bill on human rights, which has been on the Order Paper for some time. The purpose of that Bill was to make the European Convention and these other instruments part of domestic law, so that there would be a developed corpus of law.</P>
    <P>It is important that we are not only party to international conventions and that we do the right thing at international fora, but also that we take the critical next step and enact such provisions into domestic law or make whatever administrative arrangements or orders as are required to fulfil the obligations we freely enter into. The corpus of domestic law made by our courts sometimes far outreaches some of the international obligations placed on us by these conventions. That is beside the point. It makes it all the more reasonable for us to enact lesser provisions so that we can be listed in international bodies as compliant with the requirements imposed on us in signing up to these conventions in the first instance. I hope the Minister has had the opportunity to reflect further on the arguments I made on Committee Stage and that he is now in a position to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>My main difficulty with the amendment is that it seeks to force the Government to ratify, or otherwise become a party to, the four instruments in question. That course of action is wrong because it is contrary to the doctrine of the separation of powers as enshrined in the Constitution. As I said on Committee Stage, Ireland, in so far as the adoption of international treaties and obligations is concerned, takes a dual approach because of the effect of Article 15 of the Constitution, which provides that exclusive power for making laws for the State is vested in the Oireachtas. Article 29.6 states: &ldquo;No international agreement shall be part of the domestic law of the State save as may be determined by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;. This latter provision has been interpreted as precluding the Irish courts from giving effect to an international agreement if it is contrary to domestic law, or grants rights or imposes obligations additional to those of domestic law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the State wishes to adhere to an international agreement it must ensure that its domestic law is in conformity with the agreement in question. In <Col N="1302" /> some cases the entire contents of such an agreement are transposed into domestic law by providing that the agreement shall have the force of law in this State. In other cases it may only be necessary to transpose certain provisions of the agreements, simply because other provisions are either already incorporated in our law or are of a nature that do not require incorporation. Sometimes transportation provisions are not required. For example, that is the case with regard to the Council of Europe framework convention for the protection of national minorities, which was ratified in May 1999 and which has featured in the debate on this Bill.</P>
    <P>Apart from that fatal flaw, the question of ratification of all the instruments mentioned in the amendment is already the subject of detailed consideration. In so far as protocol No. 7 to the European Convention on Human Rights is concerned, that matter is relevant in the context of the Government's recent decision to incorporate the convention into Irish law by October next in the context of the Good Friday Agreement and against the background of the legislative and other developments that are taking place in the immigration area. Legislation on the so-called torture convention has already passed through the other House and is presently awaiting Report and Final Stages in this House.</P>
    <P>The convention on racial discrimination is being examined now that the Equal Status Act has been enacted. The 1996 revised European Social Charter, together with its additional protocol, which deals with a system of collective complaints, has been the subject of consultations with both the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish Business and Employers Confederation. I understand the question of our signature of ratification of both of these instruments is under active consideration.</P>
    <P>It must be accepted, therefore, that there is no need to place a statutory obligation on the Government to do what is already well in the process of being done. Apart from that, there is the more fundamental objection, which relates to the question of the Legislature binding the Executive in a manner that requires careful examination and consideration, as to how best and by what means the State should take on board international treaties, agreements or conventions. Accordingly, this amendment is opposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's comments. This amendment deals with a fundamental issue. I hope the Minister is a parliamentarian who will not always be a member of the Executive and that he will be sympathetic to the view that it is the role of the Legislature to legislate. The Executive, on behalf of the State, negotiates and signs international agreements, which are ratified by the Houses of the Oireachtas, as the sovereign assembly of the representatives of the people. Legislation is uniquely and solely the prerogative of the Oireachtas and it is an available option to any Member to <Col N="1303" /> institute legislation. Given this, there is no difficulty in any Member seeking, on a Private Members' basis, to bind the Executive to any enactment. That is part of the legislative forum.</P>
      <P>We are trying to make the Executive more accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas. I have argued the case in committee that we are almost unique within European Parliaments to have a functioning Executive that is not accountable in the same way as most European Executives are to their Parliaments. For example, in Denmark an international treaty would not be entered into without the fullest debate in a committee of its Parliament. A treaty or international obligation would be processed by such a committee and the member of the Executive responsible would make himself amenable and accountable to the Parliament.</P>
      <P>The tone of the scripted answer from the bureaucracy that the Minister has read out, seeks to delimit the power of this House and its elected Members. The Minister should reflect further on the principle involved here because it is wrong. We should be much bolder in broadening the sphere of purview available to Members of this House and the committees of the House. That was the inanition in the debate we had when we established committees of the House.</P>
      <P>I reject the notion that because there is some mechanism &ndash; I will not detail the component parts, which are being dealt with at various stages in legislation &ndash; we should not put a time frame by which the parts should be enacted. It is good to keep the Executive on its toes and it is useful to insert such a time frame in the legislation. I would be happy to revisit the six months provision if the Minister needed nine months to ensure that all these provisions will be included.</P>
      <P>I reject the idea that because our domestic law is greater than these enactments it diminishes the need to specifically enact the obligations we place on ourselves at EU or UN level. It is important that, even if our own domestic arrangements confer greater rights, we would be seen to enact provisions to which we sign up at international fora.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Our system, which is outlined in the 1937 Constitution, is well known. Deputy Howlin, as a former member of the Executive, knows better than most that the Executive is elected by the Legislature and the Members of this House and that the acceptance or non-acceptance of legislation is and always has been a matter for the Executive. There are very sound and solid constitutional reasons for that. In my view, it would not be possible for us to depart from that position. Of course, executives are removed if there is not a sufficiency of votes for them in the House and that usually leads to a general election at which the people make their decision. Either way, general elections are held every few years in our system and that ensures that the people have their say. When the people <Col N="1304" /> who are voted in change, the Government changes. That is the prerogative of the Oireachtas and, to that extent, Members of this House have considerable control over the Executive in that they make or break it.</P>
      <P>I do not believe it would be possible for the Legislature to delimit the powers of the Executive in the manner suggested by Deputy Howlin without travelling down what, to say the very least, would be a very dangerous constitutional road. It would be unprecedented in the history of the State for the Legislature to bind the Executive in the manner suggested and, in my view, there are very good reasons these structures are structured as they are, one of which is to ensure that we have the maximum amount of checks and balance which can be provided in a republic. I do not believe that this Republic would be served by the enactment of the measures espoused by Deputy Howlin; neither do I believe that Deputy Howlin espoused those measures when he was in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is occasionally wont to overly dramatising events and his response to this amendment is nothing less than that. It is not an earth shattering amendment and, I dare say that if I had had time to research it, it is probably not unprecedented. It is within the purview of any Member of this House to introduce a Private Members' Bill requiring the Government to do all manner of things as long as they would not involve a cost on the State. The Minister has produced a raft of Private Members' Bills requiring the Executive to take certain actions. For the Minister to say that this proposal, which simply seeks that conventions, protocols and international treaties to which we have freely signed up as a people should be brought into effect within a defined period, would somehow cause a constitutional crisis which would undermine the Executive is so far-fetched as to be quite silly.</P>
      <P>It is important that we sign up to international agreements. Given that we are often one of the first countries to be proactive in the human rights area and often, indeed, initiate such agreements, it is wrong that we are so tardy in bringing those agreements into force in domestic law. I am not laying the blame for that solely on the current Minister as it is a practice which has existed for some time.</P>
      <P>There is a fundamental general principle at issue here. We have genuinely improved the business of these Houses with the establishment of a committee system whereby Ministers discuss policy and sometimes, as the Minister did with this Bill, bring heads of a Bill to a committee in advance of the Executive making decisions on it. Judging by the comments he made, if it were left to this Minister to decide whether committees of the House should debate heads of Bills before they are ultimately determined by the Executive, that would be a dreadful trespass upon the Executive and its rights. Clearly, it is not and has not been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1305" /> We should have a more open response from the Executive and improved interaction and accountability between the Executive and the Members of this House. The Minister was correct when he said that my opinions have shifted somewhat since I was a member of the Executive. I negotiated positions for this country in regard to the preliminary work on the Kyoto Protocol, for example, without having held full discussions with the appropriate committees of the House. I would hope that we can do better in the future and involve committee members in debating our international obligations, what flows from them and how we can best transpose them into our domestic scene. That is all I am seeking to do.</P>
    <P>I welcome the progress we have made on some of these enactments and I assure the Minister that if he is determined not to accept this amendment, we will revisit the progress made on these agreements by way of parliamentary question or any other avenue open to us in the coming weeks and months.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) Of the members of the Commission, <Col N="1306" /> not less than 4 of them shall be men and not less than 4 of them shall be women.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I agreed to specifically provide for gender representation on the human rights commission. In the course of drafting the amendment with the parliamentary draftsman, it was felt that the most appropriate way of providing for this was to do so by way of a separate subsection in section 5. I am therefore proposing that a new subsection (2) be introduced to provide for gender representation. This separates the purpose of gender representation from the requirement in subsection (11) that the commission be representative of Irish society. As a consequence, the reference to the commission comprising both men and women in subsection (11) is being deleted.</P>
    <P>I also acknowledged on Committee Stage that the proposed amendment could cause practical difficulties in regard to appointments and the filling of vacancies on the commission. The purpose behind amendment No. 5 is to ensure that the commission can continue to act, notwithstanding the fact that there may be a temporary vacancy in either the male or female ranks of its members. Accordingly, I would ask Deputy Howlin to withdraw his amendment as section 5(2) now meets his concerns.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) to encourage ratification by the State of human rights instruments or accession to those instruments, and to ensure their implementation,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of a number of amendments which <Col N="1307" /> seeks to extend the functions of the human rights commission under section 8. The first additional function this amendment proposes to give the commission is to encourage ratification by the State of human rights instruments or accession to those instruments, and to ensure their implementation. It is important the commission should have clear functions. In responding to this amendment on Committee Stage, the Minister said the import of the amendment was already covered by section 8 (<i>c</i>). I argued that this was not the case and if the Minister was convinced that the amendment was a good one, it should be explicitly stated that the commission should be obliged to encourage ratification by the State of human rights instruments or accession to those instruments. Paragraph (<i>c</i>) does not explicitly state the commission should advocate the ratification of agreements.</P>
    <P>This relates to a point I made on a previous amendment, that the State enters into national agreements on human rights but often they languish without being transposed into domestic law. It would be good for the State, the legislature and the executive for the commission to have a clear function to encourage such ratification. I hope the Minister, having reflected upon it, will not find the additional function too burdensome and will not reject it simply on the basis that he decided it was not a good idea on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I oppose this amendment dealing with a role for the commission in encouraging ratification for the reasons I outlined on Committee Stage. It will be open to the commission in any event, as part of its function under the existing section 8 (<i>c</i>) to recommend to the Government that it should accede to or ratify particular human rights instruments. The provision in question is deliberately widely drawn in order to encompass precisely this type of role for the commission. It may take the initiative in the matter, which is relevant in the context of the type of activity contemplated by the amendment. It must also be borne in mind that the commission would take action in this area because it would see a need for the Government to act to strengthen, protect and uphold human rights in the State. The implementation of the instruments in question is already taken care of by the existing provisions in the Bill. It is hardly possible that the commission, having raised the matter, will sit back and let it rest.</P>

I am disappointed the Minister is trenchantly refusing to concede that because I am sure he agrees with it.

      <P>This amendment proposes another important function to be given to the commission, to contribute to the reports which the State is required to submit to United Nations bodies and committees, and to regional institutions, pursuant to its treaty obligations. The Minister will, no doubt, repeat this is already encompassed in its purview. However, it does not do any harm to be explicit. It would be an addition to state the commission should be part of the body which prepares our international responses, if it is to be a powerful commission on human rights. Perhaps the Minister has had an opportunity to reflect further on this matter. I have not resubmitted all the additional functions I sought on Committee Stage. I have selected some which I thought it was important to explicitly state. I hope the Minister will accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied the role for the commission intended by this amendment is adequately catered for by the provision of section 8 (<i>b</i>). That is the primary intention behind that paragraph. I envisage that the commission will have a large input into the various reports the State is obliged to submit to various international committees operating in the area of human rights, particularly UN committees, which examine our reports on UN covenants on civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an explicit difference between section 8 (<i>b</i>) and my amendment. Section 8 (<i>b</i>) states the function of the commission shall be to consult with such national or international bodies or agencies having a knowledge or expertise in the field of human rights as it sees fit. This amendment seeks to give a role to the commission to contribute to the State's response where it is required to report to United Nations bodies and committees or to regional institutions, pursuant to its treaty obligations. I propose that it would not only have the right to consult international bodies, as the Minister has provided for in paragraph (<i>b</i>) but rather that it would have a legislative right to be part of the State's response. I understand why many in the establishment would not like the human rights commission to have such a right but it is clearly and quantifiably different from only having the right to consult internationally. I hope the Mini<Col N="1309" /> ster will accept that. If he does not want the commission to have the right to be part of the contribution to our international bodies, he should say that. There should not be a pretence that this amendment is covered by paragraph (<i>b</i>) because it is not.</P>

      <P>I obviously disagree. I also refer Deputy Howlin to paragraph (<i>c</i>). We must recognise the commission is meant to be independent of the State. Its independence is of tremendous importance in the context of the work it is being charged to carry out. Its independence must not be compromised, lest there be any confusion between the role of the State on the one hand and the commission on the other. It is important that the commission has the role of an independent watchdog in this respect. If it is seen to be making contributions to submissions which the State makes, it is clear there is a blurring of the distinction between the State and the commission. The commission is not part of the State apparatus and is not a subservient agency of State. It will be independent in the exercise of its function as a statutory authority under this legislation. I respectfully submit that to introduce a provision of the kind suggested by Deputy Howlin would blur that distinction and that would be undesirable. There is a more substantive reason which I have outlined, that is, the intrinsic independence of the commission which is fundamental in terms of the pillars utilised to construct this authority.</P>

It can be critical of the State but its views should be encompassed in any report required by the United Nations or any regional assemblies which have treaties or protocols to which Ireland is party. Clearly I will not win the Minister over, which I regret. I will not press the matter further.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 10<i>a.</i> in the name of the Minister is a half way house in terms of giving the right to the new commission to examine any legislative proposal and report its views on any implications of such a proposal for human rights. Unfortunately, it includes the caveat &ldquo;if requested by a Minister of the Government&rdquo;, and I would like to tease this out. In reality it could be the stumbling block beyond which no legislative measure ever progresses. A Minister or Government could simply not seek the views of the commission, even on measures with significant or serious implications for human rights, in advance of publication of legislation. So while I welcome the Minister's three steps forward, I am sorry he has not taken a full five steps. However, I certainly will not oppose his amendment on that basis.</P>
    <P>My amendment provides for something which committees of the House may automatically seek in any event. Bills with clear human rights implications would, as a matter of course, be referred to the human rights commission by committees of the House before a debate on Committee Stage in order to get their observations, as committees have done in the context of other interested bodies. Therefore, my amendment would be somewhat redundant, but it is useful to explicitly state what it provides for.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment represents some progress from the previous position, but does not go as far as I would like. However, I acknowledge that he has at least reflected on the arguments made on Committee Stage and I am grateful that he has produced some progressive proposal on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I apologise to the House, and in particular to Deputy Howlin, for the lateness of the arrival of the draft amendment. This was because I said I would consider two of Deputy Howlin's amendments at this stage. Obviously I had to discuss the matter with the Government and seek the opinion of the Attorney General. We have already dealt with the gender issue and are now addressing the question of the commission examining legislation. The Government met yesterday, and the drafting of the amendment obviously took some time.</P>
      <P>The matter was considered in great depth over a long period, but having given due consideration to it I felt I could not go all the way in terms of what was being suggested, namely, that the commission could examine the legislation independently of a request from the Minister sponsoring it. The reason I decided this should not be the case was that the legislation would have to be referred as a matter of course and duty to the commission, which would represent an interference with the function of the Executive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Howlin said I have gone half way, but <Col N="1311" /> being honest I think I have come a little more than half way in providing that it will be possible for a Minister to refer legislative proposals to the commission in order to seek its views on any implications for human rights. Deputy Howlin's view is that it will be a stillbirth in terms of the possibility of legislation going to the commission at all&mdash;</P>

      <P>I accept it is a possibility, but I do not accept it would mean that as a matter of course. Some legislation will have a direct impact on human rights and the wish of the Minister will be to seek the expert views of the commission. In fairness this is a generous response to the amendment. More importantly, it improves the legislation and in general terms should be welcomed by people involved in the area and by society.</P>

      <P>I welcome what the Minister has done, but the reservation that referral can only be at the request of the Minister could give rise to some difficulties. In terms of the UN guidelines, I thought a fundamental function of the commission was the receipt of legislation from the Executive, without which the commission is very much reduced in terms of its power and influence. I am not sure how much further the Minister can go to meet the concerns raised, but in the context of the Seanad debate I hope greater consideration is given to ensuring the difficulty envisaged by Deputy Howlin, where a Minister may not establish the relationship with the human rights commission, does not arise. Otherwise difficulties not now foreseen by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will arise.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will move towards deleting the words &ldquo;if requested by a Minister of Government&rdquo; to ensure there will be a proper, adequate and appropriate examination of all legislation. I thought this was fundamental to the legislation establishing the commission and in terms of allowing the commission function along the lines hoped for by Members on all sides, namely, to receive, examine, report on and influence legislation.</P>

      <P>We must have regard for certain complications. Granting a power to the commission to review draft proposals is acceptable provided the Minister refers them to the commission. However, the imposition of a duty on the commission would not be acceptable, either on policy or constitutional grounds.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1313" /> Of the amendments relating to the functions of the commission, I regard this as one of the most important. I seek to give the commission a new responsibility. Section 8(<i>d</i>) states that one of its functions shall be &ldquo;to promote understanding and awareness of the importance of human rights in the State and, for those purposes, to undertake, sponsor or commission, or provide financial or other assistance for, research and educational activities&rdquo;. I seek to add &ldquo;including to assist in the formulation of programmes for the teaching of, and research into, human rights and to take part [this is a critical component] in their execution in schools, universities and professional bodies&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister argued on Committee Stage that the amendment is somehow encompassed in section  8(<i>d</i>), as drafted. I do not believe that. Since Committee Stage, there has been an unanswerable demand and requirement for proactive education on human rights within the education system and the Oireachtas should explicitly instruct this new, important commission that this will be one of its important roles. I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment, since he has rejected all the others. Education of people in the area of human rights is urgently required because of the changing nature of our society and the growing multiculturalism of this State, which I welcome. I hope the Minister accepts the logic of my argument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment was discussed on Committee Stage. I remain firm in my view that it is not needed. The provision in section 8(<i>d</i>) enables the commission to promote understanding and awareness of the importance of human rights in the State. That is the primary objective of the provision. For that purpose the commission can undertake research and educational activities as it can sponsor or commission such activities or provide financial and other assistance for such activities. The role of assisting in the formulation of programmes for the teaching of, and research into, human rights and taking part in the execution of such activities in educational and professional bodies is covered by the subsection, particularly by the reference to undertaking research and educational activities throughout the State. My view has not changed since Committee Stage.</P>

It is important for us to explicitly state that the commission should be involved directly in teaching and research programmes in the area of human rights and that it should take part in the execution of such programmes in schools, universities and professional bodies. It is clear that they are needed. I am not happy that the role is explicit enough in section 8(<i>d</i>), but what can I do when I do not have the <Col N="1314" /> bodies to ensure the instruction is given? I wish to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 16, to delete &ldquo;in its absolute discretion&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to hear the Minister's response on this because we did not have much time to hear his views on Committee Stage. I am not a lawyer but he is. I want clarity in regard to this matter. Section 8(<i>g</i>) contains the phrase &ldquo;absolute discretion&rdquo;. The Minister clearly stated on Committee Stage that it is normal for a High Court or Supreme Court judge to have &ldquo;absolute discretion&rdquo; in these and like matters. I am advised that the key point is that no decision is made in &ldquo;absolute discretion&rdquo;. I refer the Minister to Hogan and Morgan, who I am advised are leading authors on administrative law in Ireland. On page 686 of the 3rd edition of &ldquo;Administrative Law in Ireland&rdquo; they state:</P>
      <P>Since judicial review has now been given a constitutional pedestal its removal could not be effected by any statutory formulae. In a sense the absolute discretion is an indirect attempt to create an ouster clause.</P>
      <P>In other words it is asserted that &ldquo;absolute discretion&rdquo; is unusual and it is also contended to be of dubious constitutionality.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, it is discretion without having to provide a reasoned opinion. I do not regard this a hugely important issue but I was concerned by the Minister's response on Committee Stage. I am interested in his response to the normalcy of &ldquo;absolute discretion&rdquo; in legislation, whether judicial review is subject to it under the terms he indicated on Committee Stage and whether he will comment on the quote which I read into the record from accepted authorities on administrative law in Ireland.</P>

      <P>There was a discussion on this matter on Committee Stage and Deputy Howlin contributed extensively to it. I explained then, and I hold the same view now, that the courts must be independent in the exercise of their function. That is necessary in terms of our written Constitution and it is a feature of many other jurisdictions, irrespective of whether they have a written constitution. In those circumstances the right which is provided is a right to apply only. The court in its &ldquo;absolute discretion&rdquo; will make a decision thereafter. That must be the way. I do not believe the Deputy sees this as a crucial issue and that is fair enough. However, if I was to interfere with the independence or the discretion of the court in the manner which is being suggested, it would rapidly become a crucial issue.</P>

I would be obliged if he had <Col N="1315" /> responded to the points I made, rather than stating the consequences of accepting the amendment. Judicial discretion is a normal part of the administration of law and judges have a right to determine a case. However, we are arguing about whether that right is absolute and I am advised that such absolute right is not normal, is unusual and is, potentially, constitutionally dubious. I quote from authorities who assert that opinion because I am not a lawyer. I am anxious to hear the Minister's response.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>k</i>) to carry out within a period of three years after coming into effect of this Act a comprehensive human rights audit in respect of legislation and regulation in force, to ensure compliance with this legislation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment should not have been grouped with amendment No. 10 and others because it is entirely different. I did not realise until we concluded the debate on the earlier amendments that it was grouped with them. Amendment No. 17 differs from those amendments because it has nothing to do with proposed legislation, examination of proposed legislation or receiving any legislation in Bill form.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 17 is very important because it proposes that, when the commission is established, one of its first undertakings should be an assessment of all the legislation on the Statute Book over a specified period. It is important that such an examination should cover all legislation relevant to a broad range of Departments. I refer to legislation dealing with asylum seekers, refugees, the equal status or otherwise of members of the Traveller community.</P>
      <P>Similar commissions have been established in other jurisdictions. In New Zealand, for example, the new commission uncovered a raft of legislation which required amendment. This was all for the good of that country and its citizens.</P>
      <P>We did not have a good opportunity to discuss this matter on Committee Stage and, for that reason, I tabled this amendment because it is important that such an assessment of legislation be carried out. If the Minister has a difficulty with limiting such an assessment to three years, I have no problem with his amending the proposal. However, it is important that the human rights commission should embark on a root and branch examination of all legislation which has been placed on the Statute Book since the foundation of the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The position on this amendment, to my recollection, is that it was fully debated on Committee Stage. With regard to the time limit for the proposed audit of legislation <Col N="1317" /> and regulations to be carried out by the commission in amendment No. 17, I stated at that time that it will be open to the commission to undertake an audit under its existing functions.</P>
      <P>I refer Deputy Flanagan to section 8 (<i>a</i>) in respect of placing a time limit on the period within which the commission should conduct such an audit. I readily admit, as I indicated on Second Stage, that the Bill is silent with regard to the time frame within which such an audit should be undertaken and completed. This is not an accidental omission, it was done on purpose. We must be careful not to over-burden the commission, particularly during its infancy. The proposed amendment is based on New Zealand human rights legislation. Deputies will recall my earlier reference to the fact that in 1993, when the New Zealand human rights commission was given such a remit and required to complete such an audit within a four year time frame under section 5 of that country's 1993 human rights Act, the commission was in the advantageous position of having been in operation since 1977.</P>
      <P>As already stated, I would prefer to leave matters as they stand. I would like the commission to determine its priorities and work programme in light of the matters it considers should be prioritised and investigated immediately. I am deeply conscious of the independence of the commission and I referred to it already in an earlier reply to Deputy Howlin. The independence of the commission is such that if it is considered that an audit of the type to which Deputy Flanagan referred is an immediate priority, the commission will be free to instigate one under section 8 (<i>a</i>). On the other hand, it might not wish to conduct such an audit immediately.</P>
      <P>My difficulty is that I do not want to tie the hands of the commission. I accept that Deputy Flanagan has a point, but I ask him to recognise that this is, in all probability, the more desirable course and allow the commission to develop and evolve its own way of operating.</P>

      <P>In page 11, lines 12 to 15, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;and&rdquo; in line 12, down to and including &ldquo;force&rdquo; in line 15.</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to delete the words &ldquo;and which has been given the force of law in the State or by a provision of any such agreement, treaty or convention which has been given such force&rdquo;. Subsection (3)(<i>b</i>) is important because it defines human rights as meaning &ldquo;the rights, liberties and freedoms conferred on, or guaranteed to, persons by any agreement, treaty or convention to which the State is a party.&rdquo;. I want to put a full stop after the word &ldquo;party&rdquo;. However, the Minister goes on to require that such treaties should have been given the force of law in the State, because the subsection continues: &ldquo;and which has been given the force of law in the State or by a provision of any such agreement, treaty or convention which has been given such force&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the note he sent me, which I requested on Committee Stage and which I have read with some interest. I am grateful for the explanation contained therein. The Minister's definition of human rights is quite interesting, but I do not find convincing the reasons the courts should not be given powers in relation to agreements, even though the agreements themselves are not currently part of statute law. There is a very restrictive definition of human rights in this section; that is only where the treaty referred to is part of our domestic legislation. It is too restrictive.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say the section does not make sense unless the treaty is currently law, but as I tried to explain on Committee Stage, since in this section we are only dealing with declarations, there is no reason the commission should not get a declaration regarding a conflict between a statute and a treaty which the State has ratified but has not yet implemented. I do not see why that poses a difficulty for the Minister and neither do I see why my amendment is not acceptable to the Minister, even having read his welcome and elaborate note.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 12, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;15.&ndash;There shall be established within a period of six months following the enactment of the within legislation a joint committee comprising representatives of the Commission and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, as a forum for consideration of human rights issues in the island of Ireland. The joint committee shall consider, among other matters the possibility of establishing a charter, open to signature by all democratic political parties, reflecting and endorsing agreed measures for the protection of human rights of every person living in the island of Ireland.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I read a newspaper report of a comment by the Minister on this matter which probably renders my amendment redundant. Perhaps it is not the case, but I believe the Minister intends recommending that an appropriate joint committee of the human rights commission here, once set up, and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission would be established. There is a commitment to do so under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement in any event, but I hope we can ensure &ndash; particularly in the context of the weekend's deliberations &ndash; progress that will give rise to the re-establishment of the Northern Assembly, Executive and other bodies. Notwithstanding that, we should proceed with such a joint committee and have it up and running as soon as possible. There is still a strong culture of political violence on the island, despite the ceasefires and the progress that has been made. It is fundamental to the Good Friday Agreement that we should all work together towards establishing a culture of human rights. A joint human rights committee, comprised of representatives from North and South, would underpin such work. I hope it can be established during the summer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to accept the amendment. Section 8 (<i>h</i>) already specifically provides that the human rights commission is to take whatever action is necessary to establish and participate in the joint committee of representatives referred to in paragraph 10 of the section entitled &ldquo;Rights, Safeguards and Equality of <Col N="1320" /> Opportunity&rdquo; of the Agreement Reached in the Multi-Party Talks.</P>
      <P>The equivalent provision applicable to the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission is clause 69, subparagraph 10, of the Northern Ireland Act, 1998. That provides that the commission should do all it can to ensure the establishment of the committee referred to in that section of the agreement. I see no need to elaborate on the provision in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Both commissions through their respective joint committees are mandated by the terms of the agreement to consider, among other matters, the possibility of establishing a charter, open to signature by all democratic political parties, reflecting and endorsing agreed measures for the protection of the fundamental rights of everyone living in the island of Ireland. I envisage that the substance of the work to be carried out by the joint committee will be decided after the committee has been formed and will be subject to each commission. As set out in the letter sent to the Northern Ireland parties by the two Governments on 6 May last, the Government intends that the joint committee will be established by the end of July 2000.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for moving on this important issue, although it was on the shelf for most of the spring. I was interested in a television contribution last night by the Ulster Unionist MP, Mr. John Taylor, who was critical of the Irish Government for its tardiness in this matter. He stated that, in spite of the length of time that had elapsed since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, we still had not set up our human rights commission. I hope Mr. Taylor will have an opportunity of reading today's Official Report so that he can see we are proceeding. I trust the Minister will proceed to take the Bill through the Seanad at the earliest opportunity. I look forward to the establishment of the commission, which will be a radical new departure in our arrangement of matters of State. I also listened with interest to the Minister's comments on the incorporation of the European Convention into our domestic legislation, which will be a most exciting venture and one of great importance to the country and the people.</P>

I thank him for having listened to the debate on Committee Stage and for having moved amendments on Report Stage where he felt they were appropriate. He certainly did not have a closed mind on the matters raised. I wish the new commission every success in the extremely important work it will carry out on behalf of the citizens of this State.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate on the various Stages of the Bill. I particularly thank Deputies Flanagan and Howlin for the considerable amount of work and effort they put into it. The Bill has been improved accordingly.</P>
      <P>We had some differences of opinion on certain issues, which is to be expected. However, I am confident the commission will not find itself fettered, in so far as its role and functions are concerned. The Government's main aim and purpose has been at all times to give the commission the tools and material it needs and to let it get on with the job it has been assigned. That is abundantly clear from the Taoiseach's statement in December 1998, when he said the commission would be a model for other jurisdictions and that the legislation would be designed to lead, rather than follow, the standards of best international practice for such human rights institutions as are laid down in the 1993 Paris principles.</P>
      <P>It is relevant to say at this juncture that if, in the light of experience after two years of operation, some fine tuning of the commission's role and functions is required, section 24 of the Bill provides an in-depth and comprehensive review mechanism for that purpose. The commission is statutorily mandated in this respect. It will be very interesting in two years time to see how the commission has operated in line with the legislation and what additional powers, if any, it thinks might be required.</P>
      <P>In regard to Mr. Taylor's comments, to which Deputy Flanagan referred, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has had 26 Bills passed in this House since the Government was formed, about 15 Bills are before the House and seven more are being drafted.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to authorise a contribution of £20 million by the Government to the twelfth replenishment of the resources of the International Development Association.</P>
      <P>The International Development Association, or IDA for short, is an affiliate of the World Bank. It is one of the bank's main instruments in the fight against extreme poverty. It was set up in 1960 to assist the poorest countries which cannot afford to borrow money from the World Bank on its normal terms. It lends to countries with a <i>per capita</i> income, in 1998 terms, of less than $895, that is, less than $3 a day. There is also an exception for small island economies that have limited credit worthiness. The beneficiaries of IDA lending are essentially the 2.3 billion people, comprising 53% of the total population of the developing countries, who live in the 78 countries which are eligible to borrow from IDA. Today, 1.5 billion of these people survive on incomes of $2 or less a day, and some 1.07 billion on less than $1 a day.</P>
      <P>The mission of IDA is to support efficient and effective programmes to reduce poverty and improve the quality of life in its poorest member countries. IDA helps build the human capital, policies, institutions, and physical infrastructure needed to bring about equitable and sustainable growth. Research conducted by the World Bank has shown, however, that positive growth rates do not automatically lead to poverty reduction. Additional measures are needed to ensure this takes place, and IDA is the primary multilateral agency which is specifically charged with ensuring these measures are identified and undertaken. IDA's goal is to reduce the disparities across and within countries, to bring more people into the economic mainstream and to promote equitable access to the benefits of development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1323" /> Sustainable poverty reduction depends on forming effective partnerships, and on systematic inclusion of the poor in the development process. To achieve this, the focus must be on: results, to get the biggest development return from scarce aid resources; sustainability, to achieve enduring development impact within an environmentally sustainable framework; and equity, to remove barriers and open up opportunities for the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>The current debate on development issues often focuses on cases where progress and development fall short of what was expected at the outset. While this is right and necessary if we are to improve performance, we should not lose sight of how much has been achieved over the years. Over the past generation, more has been done to reduce poverty and raise the quality of life than during any comparable period in human history. Advances in health care, in particular, have brought enormous benefits to the developing countries.</P>
    <P>Since 1970, infant mortality rates have been cut in half and life expectancy has increased from 55 years to 64 years. Growth in food production has outpaced that of population. Child malnutrition rates are 20% lower than they were 30 years ago and certain nutrition deficient diseases have almost disappeared. Primary school enrolment rates in developing countries have reached almost 80% and gender disparities have narrowed, with the ratio of girls to boys in secondary schools rising to 45%. Adult literacy has similarly risen from 46% to 70%. There is greater consensus than ever before, in rich and poor countries alike, on what governments must do to improve the lives of their people. The developing countries themselves have been the motor driving these achievements, but their efforts have received strong support from donors, including IDA.</P>
    <P>That said, it must also be recognised that a large number of developing countries at the lower end of the income spectrum continue to experience unacceptably high levels of poverty and deprivation. In these countries, poverty reduction strategies must help build capacities to address the weaknesses in governance and in institutions which lie at the root of their poor performance.</P>
    <P>As a major step toward concerted action for development, the international donor community has agreed to focus on a series of key goals in partnership with developing countries. These goals, which are based on United Nations conferences and resolutions reflecting broad agreement by the international community as a whole, were set out in <i>Shaping the 21st Century: The Contribution of Development Co-operation</i>, issued by the development assistance committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, in May 1996.</P>
    <P>The goals for 2015 include reducing by half the proportion of people living in extreme poverty, achieving universal primary education in all countries and universal access to reproductive health <Col N="1324" /> services, reducing by two-thirds the mortality rates of children under five and by three-quarters maternal mortality, ensuring full access to primary health care and reversing trends in the loss of environmental resources. The goals for 2005 include demonstrated progress toward gender equality by eliminating gender disparities in primary and secondary education and the implementation of national strategies for sustainable development in all countries.</P>
    <P>IDA is operating firmly in the context of these goals. In relation to poverty, in particular, it undertakes research to reach a comprehensive understanding of poverty and its determinants with a view to choosing approaches to public policy which will have the highest impact on poverty alleviation.</P>
    <P>The recently inaugurated Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers is an innovative approach in the fight against poverty, and one which has found wide acceptance among both donor and recipient countries. Among other innovations, they offer a framework within which the World Bank, including IDA, the IMF, donors and beneficiary countries can work together to enhance development impact in a participatory manner, integrating priority measures for poverty reduction and structural reforms within a growth oriented macro-economic framework.</P>
    <P>IDA offers loans which are free of interest, carrying only a nominal service charge. The loans have maturities of 35 or 40 years with a ten year grace period on repayment of principal. They are funded by IDA replenishments, which consist of grants provided mainly by its richer member countries. These donor replenishments are supplemented by repayments made by IDA's borrowers in respect of earlier loans and transfers from the available net income of the World Bank.</P>
    <P>The twelfth replenishment, IDA12, amounts to SDR 8.65 billion and covers the period starting 1 July 1999. This donor funding, when combined with the reflows and World Bank transfers, will allow IDA to commit lending of about SDR 15.25 billion between 1 July 1999 and 30 June 2002.</P>
    <P>The largest pledges to IDA12 were made by the United States, Japan, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Italy and Canada. Some less wealthy nations also contribute to IDA. Turkey and Korea, for example, once borrowers from IDA, are now donors. Countries currently eligible to borrow from IBRD &ndash; Argentina, Brazil, Czech Republic, Hungary, Mexico, Poland, Russia, the Slovak Republic, South Africa, and Venezuela &ndash; are also IDA12 donors.</P>
    <P>The Irish contribution to IDA12 will amount to £20 million. This is made up of a basic contribution of approximately £15 million &ndash; 0.18% of total donor resources &ndash; an increase from 0.13 % for IDA11. We have also pledged a supplementary contribution of £5 million which brings the total for Ireland to about 0.24% of total donor contributions. Of the donor countries, Ireland, Finland, Greece and the UK have increased their basic shares from that in IDA11, in addition to <Col N="1325" /> which Ireland, Australia, the Czech Republic and Israel have added supplements to their basic contributions.</P>
    <P>Deputies may note that the Irish agreement to exceed our previous share was instrumental in evoking increases in basic contributions and other supplementary payments and thereby helped bridge the funding gap facing IDA12 and bringing the difficult negotiations on this replenishment to a successful conclusion. The actual cash payments for IDA12 will be made over a six year period beginning in the year 2000. Contributions to IDA are payable from the central fund.</P>
    <P>Although it is not specifically a matter for the current IDA replenishment, the HIPC debt initiative is of crucial importance for many IDA countries. As Deputies will be aware, one of the most serious problems with the implementation of this initiative has been the funding question. The IMF has now funded its contribution through donor contributions to the PRGF, formerly ESAF, HIPC Trust and through the sale of gold.</P>
    <P>The principal vehicle for World Bank participation, together with some other multi-lateral creditors, is the World Bank HIPC Trust Fund. This fund provides relief to eligible countries on debt owed to participating multilaterals and is administered by IDA, with contributions from participating multilateral creditors and from bilateral donors. The bank has made transfers from its IBRD net income and surplus to the HIPC Trust Fund to provide relief on debt owed to IDA.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, only part of the total expected debt relief on IDA debt under the initiative is currently funded. The 13th IDA replenishment, on which negotiations will commence this summer, will, therefore, have to make provision not only for donor financing of ongoing IDA lending, but specific provision will have to be made for donors to contribute further to the relief of existing IDA debt owed by HIPC countries.</P>
    <P>Contributions to multilateral bodies, such as IDA and the World Bank, qualify as part of Ireland's overall contribution to overseas development in the context of the UN target of 0.7% of GNP.</P>
    <P>The resources to be provided by IDA12 replenishment represent the principal means through which IDA pursues its poverty reduction strategies. IDA does not simply throw resources at the problem. It has developed a careful, thoughtful, financially sound and economically, socially and environmentally sustainable policy framework for poverty reduction. The main focus points in this poverty reduction framework are: investment in people; investment in economic growth for sustainable poverty reduction; support for good governance for broad-based poverty reduction and protecting the environment for the future.</P>
    <P>Investment in people will be delivered through the support of the social sectors, principally in the following areas: education, health, population <Col N="1326" /> and nutrition, social protection, gender equality, labour and capacity building.</P>
    <P>IDA has not only developed a suitable framework, it has also set out its strategy to translate poverty reduction objectives into country allocations. These allocations will be performance-based.</P>
    <P>IDA also intends to increase its effectiveness in reducing poverty by: working with partners to tailor IDA programmes; the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper process; continued support for the HIPC debt initiative and promoting employment generating, private sector-led growth. It will also establish clear goals to monitor progress and aid effectiveness. Monitoring will take place in the context of the international development targets for the 21st century and specific poverty reduction targets for specific countries of operation.</P>
    <P>As IDA12 funding is rolled out, IDA will monitor progress through: poverty assessments; social assessments; poverty monitoring and analysis; periodic poverty papers and public expenditure reviews and analysis. IDA will also try to enhance effectiveness through openness and transparency in its own operations. Country portfolio performance reviews are planned as the implementation of the IDA12 action plan is unfolded.</P>
    <P>It has been noted previously in the context of IDA replenishment proposals before this House that sub-Saharan Africa presents a particularly difficult development challenge. IDA will continue to make special efforts in this region, which has minimal access to alternative sources of investment capital, low social indicators and severe institutional and infrastructure constraints.</P>
    <P>It is encouraging to note, however, that many of these countries are now pursuing sound policies and experiencing greatly improved growth rates, opening up a window of opportunity to improve the lives of their poorest citizens. The problem is that investment levels in these countries are too low to sustain this growth so substantial support from the international community, including both the public and private sectors, is still urgently required.</P>
    <P>Under IDA 11, approximately 40% of IDA resources went to sub-Saharan Africa. In order to support African countries that are committed to poverty reduction, economic reform and sustainable broad-based growth, IDA intends to increase this share, with the aim of raising it to 50% of IDA12 resources as long as the performance of individual countries warrants it. During the recent replenishment negotiations on IDA12, Ireland fought hard to have the 50% target instituted as IDA's special focus on Africa is consistent with Ireland's ODA programme.</P>
    <P>Deputies are well aware that high levels of external debt are a serious constraint to development for many low income countries. Why then does IDA assistance continue to take the form of loans, albeit on highly concessionary terms, rather than outright grants? Funding of IDA <Col N="1327" /> through donor replenishments accounts for only approximately one half of current IDA lending. The other half is accounted for very largely by repayments on previous IDA loans. A move to a system of grants, or to some mixture of grant and loan assistance, would ultimately require either a scaling back in IDA activity or an increase in donor contributions. In effect, the approach of increased donor contributions is the one chosen but it is being implemented through the HIPC initiative rather than within IDA itself, although, as I indicated, the 13th replenishment will have to address this matter directly.</P>
    <P>IDA currently offers selective and limited grant funding. These grants are available under the terms of the HIPC initiative. At the finalisation of negotiations for the 12th replenishment, IDA had provided grants of US$75 million for an education project in Uganda, $150 million for economic reform in Mozambique and a $315 million grant was pending approval for Cote D'Ivoire.</P>
    <P>In addition, IDA directors have recognised the unique problems faced by post-conflict countries, particularly in the immediate post-conflict phase, where quick action is crucial but where normal donor relationships either do not exist or have been disrupted by the conflict. IDA deputies agreed, in the context of a framework for post-conflict countries, that exceptional IDA grant funding could also be provided as a last resort where other funding sources are inadequate and where the use of IDA credits would be inappropriate. Such post-conflict IDA funded grants, if any, during IDA12 will, however, be very limited.</P>
    <P>In relation to current IDA projects, it should be noted that because of their high grant element, IDA credits do not generally worsen borrowers debt service burdens at least in the shorter term, although they do not reduce them unless they are replacing non or less concessional financing.</P>
    <P>Overall IDA assistance is positive, progressive and imaginative and is fully focused on meeting basic human needs and on raising the aspirations and potential of the poorest sections of humanity. It is not, however, sentimental. IDA assistance is now measured against the policy performance of the recipient countries. While neither IDA nor the World Bank group have any interest in taking control of the domestic policy-making process in recipient countries, the requirements of effective aid giving require that certain minimum standards are met in areas such as governance and the fight against corruption. To ignore these realities is to risk wasting resources which could be used to achieve real results in countries which are making serious efforts to improve their institutional capacity. Good governance is critical to sustainable, broad-based economic development and improvements in human well-being. Poor governance, including corruption, undermines the efficient and equitable provision of public goods and services and blocks opportunities for the <Col N="1328" /> poor and weak to benefit from the development process.</P>
    <P>The key components of good governance are: good public sector management with accountable public institutions that give priority to productive social programmes and to policies designed to reduce poverty and support sound fiscal choices; transparent policy making and implementation; clarity, stability, and fairness in the rule of law; and openness to the participation of affected citizens in the design and implementation of policies and programmes that impact on them.</P>
    <P>IDA has strengthened its analytical framework to assess the quality of overall policy performance in recipient countries, including governance factors, that will be applied in the allocation of IDA12 resources. Where weak governance is a big development constraint, the issue will be treated thoroughly in the country assistance strategy. IDA is fully prepared and equipped to render such assistance as is necessary to Governments which make serious efforts to address these problems</P>
    <P>Ireland's membership of IDA was authorised by the International Development Association Act, 1960. Our contributions to the various replenishments have each been authorised by amendments to that Act. This Bill will enable us to make our contribution to IDA12.  I, therefore, recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and say that Fine Gael support it. One of the greatest challenges facing the developed world is to provide a more prosperous future for the world's poor. The IDA is among the key multilateral institutions involved in this task and is specifically charged with responsibility for poverty reduction and the promotion of growth and development. Today, three billion people live on less than £1.56 per day and 1.3 billion people live on less than 78p per day. Some two billion people do not have electricity, 1.5 billion do not have access to safe drinking water and 115 million children do not receive schooling. These startling statistics are outlined in the explanatory memorandum. They give us an overview of the difficult task ahead of the developed world in facing up to this crisis.</P>
      <P>The gap between rich and poor countries continues to grow. By the end of this year the number of people living in absolute poverty will have increased to 1.5 billion, a quarter of the world's population. As richer nations increase their share of global wealth, the real level of overseas aid they have given has fallen. It would seem that the OECD nations have decided to neglect the needs of people living in poverty, despite rhetorical claims to the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Conflict, natural disasters, low commodity prices and financial crises have decimated whole societies. In Indonesia 13 million people lost their jobs and real wages fell by between 40% and 60% as a result of the Asian financial crisis. In Brazil, half of those who rose out of poverty in recent <Col N="1329" /> years have now fallen back below the poverty line. The African continent is entering the new millennium with 44% of the population of sub-Saharan Africa &ndash; 250 million people &ndash; living on less than $1 per day. Despite the fact that sub-Saharan Africa contains the world's most impoverished and indebted nations, only one among its number, Mozambique, was included in the top ten recipients of official development aid in 1996-97.</P>
    <P>If the globalisation of finance, labour markets, communication and commerce is inevitable, then the globalisation of rights and responsibilities must follow. The elimination of absolute poverty is achievable; the war against poverty itself eminently winnable. However, to do so it is vital that resources are channelled to practical poverty eradication efforts and to challenge the forces that create poverty. Many aid donors have implemented welcome policy improvements during the past year. Most donor Governments have declared that poverty eradication is central to their aid policy. Many also adopted a more coherent and transparent policy on aid and pledged to make aid more effective. However, the resources allocated by most donors fall far short of what is needed to realise this rhetoric.</P>
    <P>Aid alone cannot eradicate poverty but it can contribute effectively to this goal where it is integrated into a comprehensive approach to development that addresses the inequalities between and within countries. Giving political priority to reducing poverty is meaningful only when equal priority is given to overcoming the causes of poverty. This includes addressing unequal access to education, information and decision making as well as material resources. The challenge for political leaders is to go beyond aid and work for deeper and more comprehensive approaches to intractable poverty.</P>
    <P>Winners and losers in the globalisation race are inevitable but it is a fairly safe bet that the small elite and expanding middle class who set the rules of the race will be the winners and the vast number of poor people, mostly living in developing countries will be the losers. At the moment, key questions such as how to ensure that the process of economic globalisation enhances rather than reduces human security are barely being asked in global trade forums and Government ministries, let alone answered. It took too long for official donors to acknowledge that World Bank/IMF structural adjustment programmes have often left the most vulnerable worse off. The prescription of transparency and free market solutions being offered to poor countries share many characteristics with the structural adjustment models. Just as aid has been used to offset the social costs of structural adjustment, it now seems that it is being used to offset the cost of rapid globalisation.</P>
    <P>The approach of donor countries to the burden of debt also illustrates the failure of political leaders to engage with poverty as an issue and to take into account the human impact of their <Col N="1330" /> decisions. The daily denial of education and health care to children in Africa, to pay debts for which they and their families have no responsibility to people and countries who are at worst comfortably off, is a fundamental injustice which cannot continue.</P>
    <P>An increasing number of economists now suggest that income inequality inhibits growth and poverty reduction and that growth plus increased social spending may be an insufficient answer to poverty, where social, political and economic systems channel power and resources to those who already enjoy them. Aid needs to be spent both on interventions that benefit poor people directly and on supporting a wider policy environment for poverty elimination in which poor people can voice their interest. In both cases, the chain of causation between the spending of each aid dollar and benefit to poor people needs to be evident and plausible. To reduce poverty we need to address the cultural and social interests that sustain the unequal access to economic opportunity and social resources. Aid spending that aims to support the broad, pro-poor environment but fails to address these dimensions is unlikely to increase equality.</P>
    <P>The independent review of poverty reduction and development assistance, <i>The Reality of Aid, 2000 </i>highlights NGOs' concern in all OECD countries that donors translate the improved poverty orientation of their policy into practice. The review looks at the performance of the various donors and makes an annual report.</P>
    <P>In many of the world's poorest countries both coverage and quality of basic education have deteriorated in the past quarter century and gains made during the 1960s and 1970s have been wiped out. In developing countries 40% of children grow up without completing four years of primary school, the minimum needed to have a chance of acquiring basic literacy and numeracy. During the 1990s donors and Governments recognised the crucial importance of increasing access to basic education. The target the international community set itself for achieving universal primary education has already been shifted from the year 2000 to 2015. Even if the meaning of &ldquo;education&rdquo; was reduced to &ldquo;enrolment&rdquo; the prognosis on current trends is that an estimated 75 million children will still be out of school in 2015.</P>
    <P>Donors and Governments could do much more to improve the strategic effectiveness of development co-operation as a catalyst for education reform. Increasing the volume and improving the poverty targeting of aid are part of what is needed to reinvigorate the &ldquo;education for all&rdquo; movement but of even more importance is harnessing the energies and capacities of civil society organisations as actors in the process of change.</P>
    <P>I have received correspondence from concerned individuals to the effect that some of the large number of school books available because of major changes in the curriculum and the rate at which school books are being changed at pri<Col N="1331" /> mary and second level could be donated to Third World countries. Perhaps the Minister will consider this suggestion.</P>
    <P>The biggest failure of education policy during the 1990s has been its failure to overcome the growing trend towards two tier education systems, one for the rich, another &ndash; under funded mismanaged and ineffective &ndash; for the poor. This is happening in Africa where there is a tier of education which is both advanced and sophisticated and another for the poor which is collapsing. When the state school system becomes a ghetto for the underprivileged offering neither economic opportunity nor self-respect and social inclusion, poor parents reject it while those who are not poor lose any stake in maintaining it. A coherent plan to make education serve the poor and marginalised better, requires, on the one hand, an enabling macro-economic environment and, on the other, a participatory and transparent national process of reform.</P>
    <P>In a context of falling official aid, donors have referred to increased private investment as though this is an alternative. Growth founded largely on the influx of foreign capital without institutional reform or public policy designed to increase employment is not reliable. Between 1990 and 1997 foreign capital flooded into emerging markets. The flows of capital had barely begun to diminish as a result of the international financial crisis when we witnessed just how precarious and weak were the foundations underlying the macro-economic balance attained. Erratic short-term capital flows have led to volatility in developing countries.</P>
    <P>As part of the effort to increase aid effectiveness and to focus on countries likely to show results a number of donors are reasserting their intention to concentrate official development assistance. Judging from recent data there is less, not more, concentration. In 1986-87 30% of aid was concentrated on the top 15 countries. This had fallen to 25% in 1996-97. Official development assistance to low income and least developed countries fell by US$3.6 billion or more than 12% in 1997. While it is true the share of total aid allocated to low income and least developed countries increased by one percentage point in 1997, the world's poorest countries with an average income of less than US$2 a day are receiving reduced amounts of aids. The percentages are lamentably low.</P>
    <P>Allocation of aid to countries where poor people live may be a crude measure but it is also a fundamental first step on the road to poverty eradication. Aid can be a catalyst but its role is always going to be subsidiary to the major influences on poverty which include Government policy, economic and social stability, global trade and financial conditions as well as the efforts of poor people themselves.</P>
    <P>Aid cannot be a substitute for other action. Richer countries cannot think that they are taking meaningful action on poverty if they provide aid <Col N="1332" /> but fail to address some of the structural inequalities which consign one quarter of the world's population to live in absolute poverty. Equally, poor countries should not focus only on the failure of OECD donors to meet their international commitments when reform of domestic policy is also an area of unfulfilled obligations. Aid must be seen by all Governments as a scarce and precious resource not to be wasted on projects that enhance the prestige or suit the convenience of the donor or recipient but have little relevance to the poorest people.</P>
    <P>Another major trend in the 1990s which can be both positive and negative in terms of poverty elimination is the increasing integration of OECD Government approaches to aid, development co-operation, foreign affairs, trade and security policy. On the one hand, this improves coherence and, on the other, dwindling aid resources are being asked to do more and more each year. If one looks at some of the countries that benefit from the aid channelled directly from Ireland one will see that entire systems are collapsing. What is happening in certain African countries gives cause for concern. This is contributing to our refugee problem. Much more emphasis needs to be placed on good governance. To this end the explanatory memorandum states:</P>
    <P>Good governance is critical to sustainable, broad-based economic development and improvements in human well-being. Poor governance, including corruption, undermines the efficient and equitable provision of public goods and services and blocks opportunities for the poor and weak to benefit from the development process. IDA has strengthened its analytical framework to assess the quality of overall policy performance in recipient countries, including governance factors (accountability, transparency, the rule of law and participation by civil society) that will be applied in the allocation of IDA 12 resources.</P>
    <P>What is happening in countries such as Zambia brings this issue into focus. In providing funding IDA will have to stress the need to improve the democratic process and governance. The problem is that in countries which have benefited substantially from IDA assistance during the years, people do not want to relinquish power.</P>
    <P>On the protection of the environment, large parts of Africa in which some of the most important ecosystems in the world are to be found have been destroyed through the over exploitation of timber and oil resources among others. Entire herds of wild animals and other species have been wiped out. The support available from outside has contributed to this. It is important that aid given by way of IDA helps promote environmentally sustainable growth.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to investment in people and primary education is critical. As a nation which puts so much emphasise on education, we should stress to the IDA that we expect our money to be used to promote education pro<Col N="1333" /> grammes, particularly at primary level. Education is the solution to the problems of many Third World countries but there is a decline in the provision of quality education for poorer sectors in those countries.</P>
    <P>There was reference to clean water and sanitation and preventative and reproductive health services. Nutrition is a very important issue because we see television images of large numbers of people obviously living on a poor diet. It is pathetic to see what is happening in many parts of Africa and Asia.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael welcomes the increase in aid. As we become more prosperous there is a greater expectation that Ireland will provide even more aid. In the past, Ireland has always been very forthcoming and our NGOs have been to the fore in providing assistance in many parts of Africa and elsewhere. Missionaries still travel from this country to do great work in many under-developed countries and there is an acceptance here that we have an obligation to Third World countries. Even when times were tough and when the economy was not going well we fulfilled our obligations in various ways. This development continues that policy and we will have to look at expanding our policy in the future to provide greater resources to those countries that need our help.</P>

      <P>I have had the benefit of a briefing from the Minister of State's officials, one of the curious effects of which is that one already knows the answers to most of the questions one proposes to put. I will not detain the House unduly on this issue but I support the Bill and the replenishment. We could usefully use the time available to look at overall Government strategy on overseas development aid and review the debate we had this time last year on the Bretton Woods institutions.</P>
      <P>I could not help remarking to myself during Deputy Deenihan's contribution, the facility with which parties which would normally be of the centre or perhaps the centre right, produce seriously radical proposals when talking about the Third World. I do not mean this pejoratively but I assure Deputy Deenihan that I fully endorse his comments on tackling the power of the ruling elite, the need for the distribution of power and income and so on. Perhaps it might be useful if we could import some of that radicalism into what we do in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy is reacting in that way to what I said. I come from a constituency with a powerful Labour Party Member of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all about dialogue and debate. The statistics are stark and informative and little less than an indictment of our global order. About 20 to 25 years ago, when I was becoming politically aware, the North-South Initiative was instituted by Willy Brandt, Edward <Col N="1334" /> Heath and others and first brought to the consciousness of those in the north the need to engage in dialogue with the Third World and to radically redistribute resources between north and south, not only in terms of global social justice, if I can use that term, but also in terms of our own self-interest.</P>
      <P>Twenty five years later it is worth taking stock and there are two central messages. The Minister of State is right to emphasise that there has been progress. In recent years there has been some evidence of donor fatigue, particularly when dealing with crises and natural disasters in the Third World. There is also greater cynicism when people view situations, in Ethiopia for example, where there is also armed conflict. In that context, it is important to emphasise that progress has been made and that aid does matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State and Deputy Deenihan are right to say aid is not everything and that it does not solve the problem. In many ways, aid is merely an indicator of our engagement with and commitment to what is a major global issue. Nonetheless, it is important that people know progress has been made and that their dollars, euros or pounds are being well spent. However, it is also important that we acknowledge that a great deal remains to be done.</P>
      <P>In some ways, some of the problems are getting worse and are being exacerbated, most noticeably in recent years, by the process of globalisation. Free trade has undoubtedly damaged the economies of some Third World countries who depended on cash crops and effectively maintaining a closed or relatively closed economy. Some of these countries depended, unsustainably, on artificially maintaining prices of commodities they produced and sought to exclude goods from other countries from their own markets. Much of that was unsustainable but the rate at which those barriers were dismantled and at which the global economy has become globalised has damaged the economies of some Third World countries and the sustainability of growth in those countries.</P>
      <P>It is worth looking at our recent record on ODA. Deputy Deenihan is not quite right. We squeezed the ODA budget in the 1980s, along with everything else. We did not sustain that budget in the bad days. It was cut and was relatively slow to recover. The Minister of State will remember that during its brief period in office, the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government published a plan to increase the percentage contribution of GNP spent on ODA and that was successfully achieved during that Government's two years in office. This policy was continued during the two and a half years of the subsequent Government. Nonetheless, the progress brought our percentage contribution from about 0.21% to about 0.3%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Government took office three years ago with a commitment to reach 0.45% but it seems certain that it is not going to reach that target. The Minister of State will argue that there has been a change in that GNP is calculated differently. However, this only tells part of the <Col N="1335" /> story. Unfortunately, it is clear that, two years ago, the Department of Finance effectively imposed cash limits on Ireland's ODA commitment rather than what, no doubt, it would have seen as an open-ended commitment to increase the percentage contribution at a time when GNP was increasing at a very fast rate. The Department thought it more sustainable or desirable to have a defined contribution in terms of the actual numbers of millions of pounds. The overall result is that, in terms of what we can afford, we are spending less and that is deplorable in current circumstances. If we cannot afford to meet the UN target now, then when are we going to be able to do so?</P>
    <P>This year's current budget surplus is about £5,000 million, of which we contribute just over £200 million in ODA. Progress has been made. The absolute figures have increased and there is a commitment to increase them further. However, the reality is that we have made progress at a far slower rate than we could and should have done and that is deplorable.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement, made a couple of weeks ago by the Taoiseach that the Government would look to meet the UN target by 2007. However, we are far too slow. We can do better than that, but at least there is a realisable commitment to meet the target at some point in the future and that in itself is a good thing. I am not suggesting we could simply meet the target overnight. Nobody would argue that we could usefully spend the money in the morning. It would be necessary to prepare the way with a sustainable plan negotiated in co-operation with the NGOs, many of which do sterling work in the Third World, but there is no reason that could not be done in a period of 18 months or two years rather than the period of seven or eight years being suggested by the Government.</P>
    <P>Last year we had a useful debate on the issue of Third World debt and Ireland's contribution to it, the first such debate in a number of years. The Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, will recall that we made a contribution on a number of different levels regarding the reduction in Third World debt. Much of the debate in this House, certainly the controversial part of it, centred on the so-called enhanced structural adjustment facility. The difficulty was largely two-fold. It was and still is seen as a facility which is administered by the IMF and subject to many of the constraints and much of the influence which the IMF inevitably beings to bear. This debate is relevant to the International Development Association because the heavily indebted poor countries initiative, to which the IDA contributes, is dependent on a structural adjustment programme being agreed with countries which qualify for that. This involves the sort of structural adjustment programmes which are still effectively imposed by the IMF. Deputies on this side of the House argued that we should delay any contribution which Ireland might make until we see progress. <Col N="1336" /> There had been a number of studies, both internal and external, and there was a greater awareness of the need to improve the performance and availability of ESAF.</P>
    <P>Before I came into the Chamber I read over last year's joint statement of the Ministers for Finance and Foreign Affairs. They pointed out succinctly the difficulties they saw at that time with the ESAF programmes. They talked, for example, about the need to place an emphasis on sustainable debt to take human as well as economic developments into account in drawing up programmes, the need for greater transparency, the need for speedier implementation of the HIPC initiative, the need to look at the social impact of the policies which were implemented by the IMF as well as the purely macro-economic impact, the need for greater consultation with local civil society and the need, in so far as it could be done, to work with local groups, governments and civil societies by contrast to the way in which things had traditionally been done, which is, to impose the IMF macro-economic template on individual countries in a way which in many cases has been shown to be inappropriate. I mention this statement now because I want the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, to tell the House when he is responding to the debate the progress which has been made on all of these issues because the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, who took the Bill last year, stated that the Government was anxious to pursue all of those various issues in the period after Ireland committed money to ESAF, and I gather that has now been done by the Government.</P>
    <P>I read the brief statement which the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, made last September at the joint annual discussion in Washington. It nodded in the direction of the debate which occurred six months previously in the House and the various concerns which were brought forward at that stage, but there is not an indication from the Minister's statement or anything I have read to suggest that significant progress has been made in opening up and reforming the operation of ESAF programmes in the way sought not only by us but by many other groups also.</P>
    <P>On the issue of debt forgiveness and debt reduction, I am sure I speak for everybody in the House when I compliment the Jubilee 2000 Committee on the fantastic work it did towards the latter end of last year in gathering support, not just in Ireland but in many other countries, for an initiative largely from the richer countries to reduce the level of Third World debt. I welcome the agreement reached by the G7 in Cologne, when it agreed to effectively reduce Third World debt by an additional $45 billion over and above what had already been agreed as part of the HIPC initiative. Some have said that in many cases some of that debt was not being repaid anyway and that simply writing off debt which had effectively already been written off is not of great assistance, but nonetheless a reduction of $45 billion in the debt burden of the 41 poorest coun<Col N="1337" /> tries is a significant reduction and something to be built upon.</P>
    <P>We all heard last autumn's statement of President Clinton when he effectively said that he would wipe out all of the debt owed by the poorest countries to the United States. It is not clear to me that that has happened yet. It would not be the first time that we have heard rhetoric from the US on this issue which has somehow or other run into the sand when it got near Congress. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, can give us some indication of what is happening on that score. There has been a good deal of progress in the past 12 months at the level of the G7 and also within the European Union. We can be particularly happy with Britain and Germany, for contributing to the urgent international debate on this issue.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill. My only concern about the International Development Association is whether this is the best way Ireland can contribute, for example, to the reduction of Third World debt. Part of what Ireland did last year was to make a specific bilateral contribution of about £13 million to Tanzania and Mozambique, two countries with which Ireland has a close working relationship. I wonder is that the more effective way to do this. I realise there is almost peer pressure to contribute to the international institutions and if one implies a knowledge of how to do it better, in a sense one will lose the argument. Nonetheless Ireland needs to stand back and consider whether we should take the bilateral route to debt reduction. If I had to choose, that would be my choice.</P>
    <P>I gather that Ireland contributes not just specifically to the International Development Association and to what the IDA does but also to the World Bank Trust which effectively forgives debt owed to the IDA and, therefore, Ireland is coming at it from both sides. I wonder whether this is the most useful deployment of funds.</P>
    <P>The issue of debt is the most urgent one which we can currently grasp and with which we must come to terms. Recently that came home to me clearly during the floods in Mozambique, a country with which Ireland has a special relationship which has made considerable political progress in recent years. It has a relatively stable government now and by the standards of Africa it is reasonably stable in macro-economic terms. Its inflation rate is around 10% and it has experienced low levels of growth over recent years, but all that was wiped out to all intents and purposes when the floods came. The country did not have the capacity to respond to that, partly because Mozambique's debt-service ratio is about three times GNP, which is utterly unsustainable and unpayable. If we wiped out the debt, we would be doing Mozambique and ourselves a service. If we were being clinical and honest about it, we would say that debt reduction and debt forgiveness is a moral political imperative but it also suits us because the debt overhang sucks liquidity out of <Col N="1338" /> the global economy. In effect, countries like Mozambique which could be engaged in global trade and the global economy are being forced out of that simply because they must spend so much of their export earnings and national income on debt reduction. That is not in their interests and neither is it in our interests.</P>
    <P>We must look at the ways in which we make money available for overseas development aid. I some indication from the Minister of the reforms which we talked about last year and the progress which he has seen in that regard, but I support the Bill in principle.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputies T. Ahearn, Connaughton and Bradford. I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann:</P>
      <P>&ndash;deploring the failure of the Government to make reasonable proposals to resolve the current dispute with non-consultant hospital doctors,</P>
      <P>&ndash;alarmed at the continuing deterioration in our health service at a time of unprecedented economic prosperity,</P>
      <P>&ndash;acknowledging that the hours presently worked by non-consultant hospital doctors detrimentally impact on doctors' health and undermine their ability to provide proper patient care,</P>
      <P>&ndash;concerned at the inability of the Health Service Employers Agency to constructively address and resolve industrial relations issues within the health service as evidenced by its failure after six months of negotiations to make any substantive proposal to resolve issues in dispute relating to non-consultant hospital doctors,</P>
      <P>&ndash;conscious of the serious damage to the health service that will result from strike action by non-consultant hospital doctors and the effect of such a strike on patients resulting in the further escalation of the in-patient hospital waiting lists,</P>
      <P>&ndash;acknowledging the crucial role played by non-consultant hospital doctors in our hospitals,</P>
      <P>&ndash;agreeing that the hours presently worked by non-consultant hospital doctors are totally unacceptable and are inadequately remunerated,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ndash;deploring the fact that some non-consultant hospital doctors have been forced to take legal action to secure overtime pay<Col N="1339" /> ments due to them and that substantial arrears of remuneration for overtime hours worked are presently payable to non-consultant hospital doctors,</P>
    <P>&ndash;noting that 98% of non-consultant hospital doctors voted for industrial action for higher overtime rates, shorter working hours and better staffing ratios,</P>
    <P>&ndash;condemns the failure of the Minister for Health and Children to intervene at an early stage to facilitate the reasonable resolution of the issues in dispute, and calls on the Minister for Health and Children to immediately enter into substantive negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation in order to resolve the current dispute and to avoid a damaging strike occurring.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Political brinkmanship, crisis management and industrial relations ineptitude are the hallmarks of the Government's approach to our health service. Last October, the Government's failure to engage in constructive dialogue in negotiations with the nursing unions resulted in the first ever nurses' strike in the State. In the past six months, the Irish Medical Organisation, in discussions with the Health Service Employers Agency, has attempted to resolve a number of serious difficulties that affect non-consultant hospital doctors. This has proved impossible and we are now confronted with the possibility of non-consultant hospital doctors taking strike action on 17 May next to force the Government to resolve genuine grievances which in justice must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The present Government and both the current Minister for Health and Children and his predecessor have failed to realise that our health services have entered not only a new millennium but a new era. Nurses have already fought part of the battle to force the Government to recognise this fact. Junior doctors are now fighting on another but related front. Their fight should not be categorised as simply an industrial relations dispute; it is more than that. Like the battle fought eight months ago by the nursing unions, it is concerned not simply with working conditions and remuneration but about the type of health service we should have in this State and crucial standards of patient care.</P>
    <P>Our hospital service is consultant-led. There are currently 1,250 consultants in hospitals throughout the State and 2,700 junior hospital doctors. It is now widely acknowledged that our consultant numbers fall far below what is required to provide proper patient care and it is estimated there is a need to appoint an additional 800 consultants to properly meet patients' needs and to bring to an end the escalating waiting lists crisis. Without the 2,700 junior hospital doctors in our hospitals, we would not have a functioning health service. The reality within our hospital services is that junior doctors are expected as a minimum to work a 65 hour week. This is supposed <Col N="1340" /> to be their maximum working time. In fact, a substantial number of junior doctors are on continuous duty for up to 36 hours and work between 80 to 100 hours per week. The hours junior doctors are currently required to work detrimentally impact on their health, impair their capacity to make clinical judgments and, as the doctors themselves accept, put patients at risk. The hours currently worked by junior doctors are totally unacceptable and should not be tolerated by either the medical profession or by the general public.</P>
    <P>For some time now there have been discussions at European level about the Working Time Directive and its application to non-consultant hospital doctors. While final decisions have yet to be made as to the exact date by which the 48 hour week will be extended to junior doctors, it seems that at European level, from the date when the directive comes into force, a gradual reduction of working hours will result in taking a nine year time span before the working week for junior doctors is reduced to 48 hours. There is no commitment from the Government to do better than that. Fine Gael believes that there should be commitment to a speedier time frame by which junior doctors will not be obliged to work in excess of a 48 hour week. In moving towards the reduced working week, a junior doctor should not be required to work in excess of a 65 hour week or be required to work the excessive hours previously referred to. Essentially, an 80, 90 or 100 hour week is a consequence of the failure of the State and of this Government to ensure our hospitals have available to them the crucial number of required consultants in a variety of specialities, including consultants who specialise in accident and emergency procedures.</P>
    <P>The pay currently received by junior doctors for work in excess of 48 hours in any week is equal to half the basic hourly rate paid to them for normal work. They receive a salary scale known as &ldquo;half time&rdquo;. No one else within the public or private sector would work overtime for half their normal hourly working pay. To add insult to injury, we learned in recent weeks that hundreds of junior doctors throughout the State are due overtime arrears payments going back many months and some have been forced to take legal action against their employers. A number of hospitals have been named and shamed for failing to pay junior doctors the miserly salary to which they are entitled for overtime hours already worked. These include, St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, Dublin, Cork University Hospital, Galway University Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital.</P>
    <P>In what other area of the public service would a State employee tolerate being required to work excessive overtime for a half time payment which is not even made? In years gone by, we watched in wonderment, scenes from the old Soviet Union and then in the newly reformed Russian State where State employees took to the streets to <Col N="1341" /> demand pay State bodies had withheld from them for many months. The manner in which junior doctors have been treated by the Department of Health and Children by health boards and hospital administrators has much in common with the treatment of Siberian miners by the old Soviet administration. Since the naming and shaming of the various hospitals, some of them have cried foul. Are they to be believed? An independent inquiry conducted by the ICTU former president, Mr. Philip Flynn, found that non-consultant hospital doctors in one of the country's biggest hospitals, University Hospital Cork, were required to work unrostered hours for which they were not paid. He recommended in his report that compensation payments be paid to the doctors concerned.</P>
    <P>University College Hospital, Galway, is currently facing a number of Labour Court actions from non-consultant hospital doctors demanding adequate pay for overtime worked. One case was already before the Labour Relations Commission just last week. The commission gave the hospital three weeks to resolve matters and presumably to make payments that are clearly due. From my contact with a number of different doctors, it is now clear that hospitals and health boards have consistently failed to honour the 1997 NCHD agreement. Junior doctors, on whom the functioning of the health service is dependent, are entitled to be angry.</P>
    <P>The lack of insight by the Department of Health and Children, health boards and hospital administrators is extraordinary. It is almost beyond belief that at the very time non-consultant hospital doctors were balloting on proposed strike action, health service employers were depriving them of basic salary entitlements. Under Partnership 2000, the 1% increase in basic salary was due from 1 April. This should have been added to the most recent pay cheques received by junior doctors. However, reports from Cork, Galway, Limerick and Dublin show that payments have not been made. Neither health boards nor hospitals are entitled to ignore partnership agreements. Neither are they entitled to withhold overtime payments due to doctors for hours worked.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael motion before the House this evening in acknowledging the crucial role played by non-consultant hospital doctors in our hospitals not only seeks agreement from this House that the hours currently worked are totally unacceptable, it also asks the House to agree that junior doctors are inadequately remunerated. Proper pay scales must be put in place to adequately reward doctors for the overtime hours worked by them. Immediate action must also be taken by the Minister for Health and Children to require that all arrears of remuneration of overtime already worked, which is currently outstanding, be paid immediately by the health boards and hospitals liable for such payments. If our health boards and hospitals have been so under-funded by the Government as to render it impossible for <Col N="1342" /> them to discharge their salary obligations, the Minister should provide immediately the additional funding required to resolve this extraordinary problem.</P>
    <P>No junior doctor anywhere in the State should be forced to take legal action or to bring an application to the Labour Relations Commission to obtain from his or her employers, money due for overtime worked. In this context, junior doctors have been treated scandalously. Instead of being given the respect to which they are entitled, they are being treated with contempt by their employers. They are effectively being exploited.</P>
    <P>Junior doctors have other concerns which are not selfish but which are of great importance to a properly functioning health service. These include the essential need to receive well structured, audited training. Many rightly regard their present training as inadequate. For too long doctors have been forced to work abroad for between five and ten years prior to their having any possibility of a consultancy appointment in an Irish hospital. There is something seriously wrong with a system of medical education and training which compels doctors to leave the State and which renders it impossible to obtain a consultancy appointment if they do not do so. Non-consultant doctors have been used and abused by the health service, which has depended on them to provide a cheap acute hospital service at a cost to their well being and training.</P>
    <P>For six months the Health Service Employers Agency, on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, has been engaged in discussions with the IMO about the plight of junior doctors. It is astonishing that during that time, a substantive offer of any kind does not appear to have been made to resolve the issues in dispute. The Minister, like his predecessor, has also failed to take the action necessary to bring about a resolution and to ensure that an unnecessary strike will not seriously damage our health service.</P>
    <P>Serious questions must now be asked as to why the Health Service Employers Agency appears incapable of constructively addressing industrial relations issues within the health service within a reasonable time frame and why it is addicted to confrontation rather than committed to dispute resolution by conciliation. The former Minister, Deputy Cowen, sat on the sidelines engaging in megaphone diplomacy in the six months lead-in to the nurses strike and only engaged in substantive negotiations with the nursing unions after strike action had taken place. The Minister, while making more moderate and conciliatory public comment on issues affecting junior doctors than we came to expect from his predecessor, has not done anything to date to effect a resolution of the dispute and to avoid a strike. His meeting last Thursday with the IMO was apparently a mere listening exercise. Seven days before the junior doctors are due to strike, neither the Health Service Employers Agency nor the Minister has made any substantial proposals to the IMO to address the grievance of junior doctors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1343" /> On previous occasions in this House I criticised the Government for effectively institutionalising a two tier health service &ndash; one for the rich and one for the poor. At a time of unprecedented economic wealth and with a first world economy, near the top of the OECD economic ladder, we have a public health service for a second world economy. We spend less of our GDP on health care than any other OECD country, with the exception of Poland, Mexico, Korea and Turkey. Even such developing economies as the Czech Republic, Portugal and Hungary spend more. Difficulties experienced by junior doctors, the frustrations and problems experienced by patients attending the accident and emergency departments in the acute hospitals, the pain and suffering of patients on the in-patient hospital waiting lists are a consequence of this. Another consequence is the death of patients on waiting lists who are awaiting essential cardiac operations.</P>
    <P>Not only is our health service under funded, there is a lack of essential vision. Since his appointment, the Minister has been talking about the health service. In a speech delivered by him on 17 April, he spoke about nurses and nursing as a profession being grossly undervalued and he promised to effect change. We heard similar things from his predecessor two years ago. In his speech to the IMO conference on 14 April, the Minister spoke of health as &ldquo;the central enabler in our fulfilment of our potential as a nation&rdquo; and committed himself to &ldquo;a radical overhaul of Ireland's health care systems&rdquo; saying such an overhaul was overdue. The Minister has been in Cabinet for almost three years and his fine words bear no relation to decisions made by the Government on the delivery of health care during its term of office and for which he, as part of the Government, is responsible.</P>
    <P>A reshuffle of Cabinet duties does not relieve the Government or Ministers from responsibility for past failures. If the structure, organisation and medical manpower in our hospitals is in need of urgent reform, the urgency results from this Government during its three years in office, failing to make many of the crucial decisions necessary for proper patient care and for failing to ensure the speedy implementation of decisions made. If the industrial relations within the health service are in a shambles it is the fault of the Government and the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Health Service Employers Agency as a body appears incapable of constructively addressing genuine industrial relations problems within our health service. If the Minister sits back, like a spectator at a football match observing what is happening and doing nothing, the problems that result are his responsibility. Every few days he issues a script proclaiming reforms he believes are required in the health service. A health service cannot be built by proclamation. What is required is action, not words.</P>
    <P>A one day strike by junior doctors on 17 May <Col N="1344" /> will result in 7,500 out-patient appointments being cancelled or postponed, up to 40% of which will affect new patients, who may have been waiting for many months. On 17 May also, 700 people scheduled for elective surgery throughout the State will have their operations postponed and will continue to languish on the in-patient waiting lists. Many of those whose operations will be postponed will already have been statistics on the waiting lists for well in excess of one year, some for two years and some possibly, in the context of ear, nose and throat operations, for up to three years.</P>
    <P>The most effective action the Minister can take today with regard to the health service is to immediately enter into substantive negotiations with the IMO to resolve the current dispute with non-consultant hospital doctors and to avoid a damaging strike occurring. If he is not willing to enter directly into such negotiations he should compel the Health Service Employers Agency to make specific proposals to the IMO to resolve all issues currently in dispute. In the absence of specific proposals being made, either by the Minister or the HSEA, there is no basis on which the Labour Relations Commission can constructively intervene in the present damaging dispute.</P>
    <P>We know that non-consultant hospital doctors do not wish to be on strike. We know the strong sense of obligation and commitment they have to patients throughout the country and to those who require their medical care. We also know that many of them have studied long and hard for many years to practice as doctors. The last thing any of them want to do is to withdraw a service that they have dedicated themselves to provide.</P>
    <P>It is a scandal that for the second time within a period of 12 months, the Government has allowed a situation to arise whereby dedicated health care professionals feel the only way their genuine grievance can be listened to is to force a Government response by taking strike action so that problems in the health service will be addressed and patients can obtain the care to which they are entitled. We will be confronted by a one day strike on 17 May, which will retain 700 people on the in-patient hospital waiting lists. We will be confronted by a two day strike the following week, which will ensure that another 1,400 people on the elective surgery waiting lists will have operations postponed.</P>
    <P>It is time for the Minister to stop talking about the need for reform as if he was an Opposition politician without power to implement decisions. It is also time he did something to bring to an end the rot in the health service, to restore public confidence in the public health care system and to recognise the difficulties and problems confronted by health care professionals, and, especially in this instance, by junior doctors. </P>
    <P>It is the Minister's job to ensure these problems, which should have been addressed weeks ago, are now addressed. This debate should not be necessary and the threat of industrial action should not be hanging over this House. Some <Col N="1345" /> 98% of the junior doctors who balloted on this issue should not have been forced to vote in favour of strike action because they felt no other course of action was open to them. The Minister has an opportunity this evening to say something constructive and I ask him not to simply urge the junior doctors to go to the Labour Relations Commission. I ask him to specifically set out the Government's proposals to resolve this dispute and, if they will allow the Labour Relations Commission to make very real progress and will allow a strike to be avoided, the Minister will be acting in the public interest. If the Health Services Employers Agency cannot do its job properly, it is the Minister's repsonsibility to intervene and talk directly to the junior doctors. He should not wait until we have had a one day strike, nor should he allow the current difficulties to continue to fester and place the care of patients at risk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is almost impossible to comprehend that the Government has for months ignored the warning signals that a strike by non-consultant hospital doctors was inevitable unless some meaningful effort was made by the Minister to resolve the dispute by engaging in consultation on the major issues involved.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shatter for introducing this motion to the House at a very opportune time and allowing the Minister the space to ensure that the strike scheduled for 17 May does not proceed. It is also impossible to understand that the Government did not learn any lessons from the first ever nurses' strike in this country. When the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, succeeded in getting the nurses back on the wards he was satisfied that he had got the better of them. It must be accepted that patients did suffer during that strike and that the entire health service was seriously affected. Although six months have passed since that strike occurred, the wounds still remain and the anger and sense of grievance live on. This will happen again if the Minister allows the forthcoming strike to proceed.</P>
      <P>Nurses continue to be dissatisfied and aggrieved and are still awaiting the fulfilment of the agreement which was intended to end the dispute. The effects of the nurses' strike will have very serious consequences into the future. The Minister is aware that there is currently a shortage of nurses in this country. Young people are very reluctant to pursue a career in nursing and there is an alarming exodus of qualified nurses to alternative career opportunities. Worst of all, there is a feeling of hopelessness among those who continue to work in our hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowen may have succeeded in getting the nurses off the street and back on the wards but he broke their spirit and killed forever their sense of vocation. Nurses know that there is little, if any, appreciation of their contribution to the health services. The antagonistic attitude shown by the Government towards the nurses is further <Col N="1346" /> evident in the blatant refusal to give student nurses parity with all other third level students in regard to free fees. I cannot accept that the Minister is actually willing to put his energies into recruiting nurses overseas. Each step he has taken has been a negative one and he is killing the nursing profession in this country.</P>
    <P>The tabling of this motion confirms that the Government did not learn any lessons from the nurses' strike. The Government is again prepared to take on another section of the medical profession, put patients' lives at risk and reduce the quality of medical care rather than take realistic and positive steps to resolve the issues at the centre of the dispute. A strike is inevitable unless the Minister takes action now.</P>
    <P>We all know that junior doctors are over-worked, exhausted and stressed out. They simply cannot keep going. Is it fair to expect any human being to deliver a quality medical service for up to 100 hours per week? The minimum requirement is 65 hours per week but the reality for almost all junior doctors is that they work far longer hours than that. Junior doctors are expected to care for patients who are seriously ill. They are expected to make accurate clinical judgments and serious decisions. In many cases, a patient's survival depends on decisions made by junior doctors. We must not allow potentially brilliant and successful doctors to be forced out of medical careers through exhaustion, nor must we allow patients to be treated by over-worked and tired staff.</P>
    <P>It is to their credit that junior doctors have tolerated intolerable and inhumane conditions for so long. It is further to their credit that they have managed to work exceptionally well and to deliver good patient care in appalling circumstances. They have also managed to avoid a catastrophe. It is to their regret and against all their medical principles to be at a stage where they simply do not have any option but to take to the streets on strike. Is the Government prepared to allow this to happen? Is the Government prepared to inconvenience patients and cause disarray in hospital schedules? Patients must be cared for and the price is too high to allow this strike to proceed. It is not worth the risk.</P>
    <P>There are many serious problems throughout the entire health services. Why would the Minister want to add to them? Recent newspaper reports and the woeful recollections of families at the Lindsay tribunal surely provide sufficient evidence that we should direct our energies and resources towards the improvement of our health services rather than use them in conflict and dispute. Does the Minister realise that our hospitals simply cannot function without the contribution of the 2,700 junior hospital doctors? Does he realise they have a justified case? Is he prepared to put the health of our junior doctors at risk by forcing them to continue to work in appalling circumstances?</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to respect the role of junior hospital staff and to allow them to pursue their <Col N="1347" /> training, develop their skills and succeed in their careers. After all, our future is dependent on them. The future of medical care in our hospitals is dependent on our junior doctors. I urge the Minister not to allow this dispute to proceed and not to allow our junior hospital doctors to take to the streets. I appeal to him not to kill their ambition, determination, spirit and vision. He should assist them to become confident, fulfilled, caring, contented and dedicated doctors. The future of our health care system is dependent on them.</P>
    <P>We should respect the role played by junior hospital doctors and their contribution should be acknowledged. The Minister now has an opportunity to do this by entering into negotiations with them. I urge him not to spare any effort or resources in ensuring that our junior doctors do not have to go on strike on 17 May, thereby preventing many patients from experiencing difficulties. The Minister must prioritise the future of our health services and should encourage and support our junior doctors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, thank Deputy Shatter for tabling this motion although I regret that it was necessary so close to the impasse with the nursing profession.</P>
      <P>I did not think we would allow it to happen that the other major branch of the health carers would have no alternative but to go out on strike. We cannot blame the Government for everything that has happened because it has not been in power for very long. However, there must be a way out of this dispute. It cannot be allowed to drag on because of the Government's attitude that, as far as it is concerned, others will have to do the job. If the Government continues to think along those lines, it will have a strike on its hands. If it learns from this debate and the views of the public, it will quickly take action after tomorrow's vote.</P>
      <P>The proposed strike by the junior hospital doctors is a sad reflection on how our health service operates. There must be something rotten in the set-up somewhere along the line. It is about time it dawned on the Government and the health service employers that we cannot deliver a service for the new millennium based on structures which barely worked 25 years ago. This has not sunk in with the Government and the health authorities. Nurses and junior doctors are at a crucial contact point with patients. They are the first people likely to come in contact with patients. As a lay person I cannot understand why these workers are either ignored or belittled. They provide a crucial service. The nurses had to go to extreme lengths seven or eight months ago to make that point. It is obvious that nobody learned a lesson from this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Junior hospital doctors must work scandalous hours. The Minister, myself and many of our colleagues often work 80 to 100 hours a week. However, ours is a different type of work. I would <Col N="1348" /> not like to be the patient attended to by a junior doctor if I knew they had worked 80 hours. I would rather be diagnosed by the porter. It is unfair that they must work 65 to 80 hours a week. There will be a public revolt on this matter and I do not know how this will be resolved by the Minister. It must be demonstrated to junior hospital doctors that their work is valued; this is normal for other workers . It takes a great deal of perseverance and money to become a doctor. It is a difficult process. Doctors deserve better than the way they are treated in the workplace. The Minister would do well to take heed of what is being said here and outside. The public are fed up and the more they know about hospital conditions, the more criticism they will have.</P>
    <P>There has been a general breakdown in the delivery of services. I do not know if this is because of money or administration but every week at my clinic &ndash; I am sure the same is true for the Minister &ndash; I receive letters and telephone calls from people who have not been treated properly. Last Friday I received a letter from a constituent, a 65 year old woman, who, in January 1999, sought a consultation for severe arthritis in her knees. She recently received a letter from the Western Health Board stating that it was likely she would get an appointment in the next five or six months. I would like to see me or the Minister waiting for 18 months with arthritis in our knees. I would not accept that in any circumstances. Perhaps the woman is waiting because she has a medical card. If this strike goes ahead and there is more unrest, how much longer will that woman have to wait? The only people hurt will be that woman and the thousands like her.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows the Minister has great negotiation skills and now is the time for him to demonstrate them. If the dispute is not resolved, we will have to acknowledge that neither the Minister nor the Government is able to deal with the matter. The Minister will learn a serious lesson if he does not solve this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleagues on the motion tabled by Deputy Shatter. I wish the Minister well in his endeavours to bring this possibly dangerous situation under control before 17 May. This is his baptism of fire in his new ministry. The only occasions on which we get an opportunity to discuss health issues in Dáil Éireann is when we are trying to avert a crisis. We never seem to have time to discuss health policy and management or chart a new agenda for the future. We are always dealing with crisis management. The dispute involving the junior hospital doctors which the Minister must now try to bring to an end is almost a carbon copy of the nurses' dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As my colleague, Deputy Theresa Ahearn said, the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, brought the nurses' dispute to an end, but at a high price as far as morale is concerned. We do not want the same bitterness <Col N="1349" /> among junior doctors on 18 or 19 May we saw with the nurses. The Minister's immediate intervention in this dispute is urgently needed. Unfortunately, the efforts so far have been unsuccessful. The cause is obvious and justifiable. Nobody should expect people to work 100 hours per week in the delivery of health care services.</P>
    <P>When the public read about this dispute, they find it inexplicable and inexcusable at a time of record national resources because of the Celtic tiger, although record resources may not be available to the Department of Health and Children. As one of my colleagues said, we appear to have a Third World health care system in a first world economy. This is unacceptable. I am aware of the position in Cork &ndash; as is the Minister &ndash; which was outlined by my colleague, Deputy Shatter. This cannot be justified and cannot be allowed to continue. We cannot allow the dispute to go ahead on 17 May. The Minister has had direct talks but he must return to the table. The direct intervention of a Minister is not always necessary but the Minister of Health and Children is facing a crisis which requires it. A clear statement from the Minister indicating that he does not wish the dispute to go ahead and that he will put an offer on the table is the minimum we can accept.</P>
    <P>I support Deputies Shatter and Connaughton on the wider aspect of our motion which concerns the health care system as a whole. As constituency representatives, daily we are made aware of the most bizarre cases of the absence of health care. We find it difficult to explain to our constituents why they, their elderly parents and relatives must wait 18 months, two years and more for the delivery of such services. These issues need urgent attention. The public is demanding a response from the Minister in his new role. I wish him well and I look forward to what he has to say &ndash; I hope it is positive.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1350" /> I wish to share time with Deputy Batt O'Keeffe. I thank Deputy Shatter and Members of Fine Gael for tabling the motion, thereby facilitating a debate on this issue.</P>
    <P>I wish to update the House on the latest developments. In view of the serious situation which would arise from the decision of the Irish Medical Organisation to proceed with industrial action, the Labour Relations Commission earlier today invited the Health Service Employers Agency and the Irish Medical Organisation to meet its chief executive and director of conciliation in the commission's offices. The purpose of the meeting was to initiate conciliation talks on the current issues in dispute. The commission has proposed the following agenda for these negotiations: the current contract and outstanding difficulties, including overtime payments; future contract negotiations, including rostering-shift arrangements; future overtime arrangements and the method and level of payments which may apply; and any other issues which the parties deem appropriate. The Health Services Employers Agency immediately responded and accepted the invitation from the chief executive of the Labour Relations Commission. It seems the Irish Medical Organisation did not accept this invitation from the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
    <P>To progress this matter further, the commission offered elaboration on point one of its proposed agenda. It was also agreed that these issues relating to the contract, the previous contract and payments which were not made, must be addressed as a matter of urgency and the Health Service Employers Agency indicated it was prepared to honour in full its commitments regarding that contract and wished to ensure the existing contract is adhered to in future. The Health Service Employers Agency also indicated it was prepared to agree to a verification process under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission in regard to any moneys which may be due under the terms of the 1997 contract as part of the negotiations. I wholeheartedly endorse this position in terms of endeavouring to resolve these issues as urgently as possible and honouring the commitments in the 1997 contract.</P>
    <P>The commission is anxious that the parties commit themselves to achieving a comprehensive settlement on the above issues, is conscious of the short time scale involved, particularly in view of the one day strike threatened for 17 May, and the need to work with the parties over the next available days to assist in effecting a solution on the issues in dispute.</P>
    <P>This is a complex and difficult problem to resolve. I acknowledge that non-consultant hospital doctors play a vital role in the staffing of hospitals and their participation in patient care is essential to the way hospital services are provided. Clearly, there are problems with the hours worked by some of our non-consultant hospital doctors and the issue of excessive working hours needs to be resolved for the improvement of patient care as well as the well-being of junior <Col N="1351" /> doctors. I am prepared to tackle the issues involved in a constructive way that will provide mutual benefit for non-consultant hospital doctors and the hospital system. It is acknowledged by health service employers and the Irish Medical Organisation that the current working hours arrangements are responsible for where we are today. There is a long history and culture attached to the way junior hospital doctors have been treated down through the years. That being so, more of the same will not do. Negotiations when they begin will have to include reform and changing the way we manage things in hospitals.</P>
    <P>The origins of this dispute are partly historic. Like many sectors of society, the health service has undergone major change, much of it unnoticed. We take for granted new services, new drugs, new treatment regimes and so on. The new diagnostic and treatment equipment is always obvious. However, in the midst of this sea of change certain landmarks remain strangely familiar. One of these is the basic structure of the medical profession and how this is reflected in the way our hospitals are staffed and operated. In the medical staffing of hospitals, we still adhere to the hierarchy of consultant, registrar, house officer and intern.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the hospital system has encountered enormous change in recent years, especially in relation to the increased volume of patients who present for treatment. I accept that the staffing of our hospitals, that is, doctors, nurses, paramedics, etc., must be configured to take account of these changes. When I recently met the representatives of junior doctors, I accepted that because of the complexities involved in the issues of overtime and unrostered hours, these matters should go to third party mediation. The meeting was more than just a listening exercise. Repeatedly during the meeting I sought to arrive at a process with the junior hospital doctors by which these issues can be resolved. I have not been involved in a stand off with junior doctors. I have met them and contact has been maintained between them and my office, and the Government has been eager to resolve these problems. It is clear that the best vehicle to resolve the issue is third party independent arbitration, particularly through the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to changes that are necessary in the hospital system. This is especially true in the case of the medical staffing in public hospitals. The Medical Manpower Forum was established by my predecessor, Deputy Cowen, to investigate the medical staffing in our hospitals and bring forward recommendations.</P>
    <P>One of the reasonable expectations of a patient entering hospital is that he will be looked after by medical and nursing staff who possess the skills and experience necessary to undertake the task. A patient in hospital should, at all critical points in the care process, be looked after by a fully trained doctor. The Medical Manpower <Col N="1352" /> Forum was established to focus on addressing the imbalance in hospitals between career posts and training posts, the need to improve postgraduate medical training to keep more Irish medical graduates in the country, and the need to provide the highest quality of medical care for those who require the services of hospitals.</P>
    <P>Currently, there are approximately two junior doctors for every consultant employed. Non-consultant hospital doctors regard career prospects as poor and a large number emigrate. Young doctors tend to leave at the point where they have just acquired the skills and expertise and are ready to make a real contribution to Irish hospitals. Women doctors also leave the system and there is a need to examine the reasons this is happening so that solutions can be found to facilitate the optimum use of their skills and develop training structures to accommodate their needs. I am not happy to preside over such a system and I intend to make major changes in the way hospitals are staffed.</P>
    <P>Other areas which require attention are the different needs of larger and smaller hospitals, combining other disciplines with medical staffing, for example, general practitioners and nurses, and coping with the demographic changes which have occurred in society.</P>
    <P>The Medical Manpower Forum, in association with the various medical interests, will address: longer term contracts for non-consultant hospital doctors &ndash; I want to give greater certainty to young doctors as to where they will be working and what they will be required to do; a system of structured rotations that includes training in the larger teaching hospitals as well as smaller general hospitals &ndash; this will give young doctors a broad range of experience and make them fit to fill posts as consultants in the health service; revised arrangements for medical training and the need to take into account the requirements of women &ndash; there is much to be done here and I am anxious to get on with agreed improvement and make greater provision in the system for the needs of women; institutional structural reform to allocate clear responsibility for ensuring the quality of training in hospitals; and the need to place more fully trained doctors in our hospitals &ndash; this is especially needed at night and at weekends.</P>
    <P>The Medical Manpower Forum seeks to propose policies that maintain and improve patient care while providing a satisfactory working environment and career structure for all hospital doctors. While the forum is expected to advocate an increase in the number of trained doctors-consultants, major changes are recommended to the structure of training for NCHDs as follows. Each hospital should have a training strategy and there should be development of training partnerships with UK and US hospitals, accreditation of training placements abroad, with training structures and opportunities made available in modular form, both full and part-time, forming part of an overall professional development structure that also meets the needs of nurses and other grades <Col N="1353" /> of hospital staff. The report will address the need for improved medical education, advocating the development of new training structures which allocate protected time to research, and the provision of career opportunities for Irish medical graduates with a research orientation, a five year National Research Strategy, development of links with private funders and exploration of role for senior medical researchers.</P>
    <P>The Medical Manpower Forum has much to offer NCHDs and I hope it will be able to publish its first report shortly. One of the problems with industrial relations difficulties is that it keeps us from doing what needs to be done on the more strategic issues.</P>
    <P>Another major influencing factor affecting working hours of junior doctors is the Working Time Directive. NCHDs as doctors in training were one of a number of groups excluded from the original EU Working Time Directive adopted in 1993. Other excluded groups were transport workers, sea fishermen and offshore oil and gas workers. Following adoption of the 1993 directive, the European Commission endeavoured to bring forward proposals to deal with the excluded sectors. The Commission recognised that there would be serious difficulties in bringing these sectors within the precise scope of the 1993 directive. Therefore, the Commission embarked on a series of consultative exercises to address the specific requirements of the excluded sectors.</P>
    <P> Ireland has never opposed the idea of offering NCHDs a level of protection equivalent to that provided by the 1993 directive. However, any provisions covering hospital doctors would have to take account of the need to provide 24 hour medical cover for hospitals and to afford reasonable continuity of care to patients. There would also have to be a reasonable transition period to reach the objective of 48 hours per week without significant disruption to the existing medical career structure.</P>
    <P>In November 1998 the European Commission published its proposals in relation to the excluded groups in the form of a draft directive to amend the 1993 directive. The Commission's proposals went to a Council working group for consideration. A number of member states had varying degrees of difficulty with the Commission's proposals. Eventually the German Presidency presented a series of compromise proposals to a meeting of Labour and Social Affairs Ministers held on 25 May 1999. These included a 12 year transition period with a progressive reduction in hours to 48 hours at the end of the period. The United Kingdom, which had been holding out for a 15 year transition period, proposed a 13 year period. Further debate in the European Parliament and at the Commission resulted in further compromise.</P>
    <P>I am glad agreement has been reached on a formula which provides for a nine year transition period to apply the directive to junior doctors. I took the initiative to move from 13 years to nine years and I would like it noted that this is an indi<Col N="1354" /> cation of my goodwill in relation to junior doctors. Ireland has always stated that it will reduce junior doctors' working hours to an average of 48 per week at least as quickly as required by any European legislation. We want to do this in partnership with the IMO and all interests as fast as we can within the logistic capabilities of so doing. I am confident that, with the full co-operation of the profession, we can achieve that objective in the nine years allowed. As part of our preparations for this eventuality we are conducting a major study of NCHD working hours on a joint basis with the Irish Medical Organisation. The study is being undertaken at eight hospitals by PA Management Consultants. The report of the study will be available in June.</P>
    <P>I turn to the issue of funding. The health budget this year is in excess of £4 billion. The increased investment in health funding under this Government is unprecedented. A major opportunity is opening up to bring about fundamental and lasting improvement in services. It will take sustained effort but the challenge is to deliver a service that has the confidence of the entire community where standards are uniformly excellent and where it is acknowledged that decisions, including those relating to resource allocation, are made wisely and on the basis of objective evidence concerning needs.</P>
    <P>The Government has made available an extra £1,500 million to the Department of Health and Children since taking office. This is a 56% increase in the day to day resources for services and this level of increased investment will be sustained. An indication of the priority attached to health by this Government can be seen in the fact that the previous Government made available just over £400 million in extra funding. By comparison the additional £1,500 million allocated by this Government has allowed a long awaited acceleration in the development of the health services.</P>
    <P>The Government has also recognised that, in moving forward, the current health infrastructure is inadequate for the delivery of a truly modern and efficient service. Under the national development plan, £2 billion in capital spending has been made available to develop health facilities of the highest order. The inclusion of health in the NDP was a statement of priority in its own right since it is recognition, for the first time ever, of the central importance of health facilities in the social and economic infrastructure of this country. The £2 billion being provided is almost treble the capital resources provided over the previous seven years. The record increase in funding offers an historic opportunity to fundamentally address the weaknesses within the system. The Government will play its part in working with all those in the sector to bring about the necessary improvements.</P>
    <P>I would now like to give the House a detailed statement on the background to this dispute. The Irish Medical Organisation, on behalf of NCHDs, lodged a formal claim with the Health Service Employers Agency on 8 December 1999. The <Col N="1355" /> claim included a demand for the payment of overtime as is the case with nurses, payment for all hours on call in addition to hours worked, a pay claim in line with comparable grades in the health service, increases in annual leave, the payment of an unsocial hours premium as per nurses, a review of allowances, claiming here a parity with teachers academic allowances, improved and compressed pay scales for house officers, training grants for all NCHDs and relocation expenses, increased examination refunds and increases in living out allowances.</P>
    <P>The HSEA and the Irish Medical Organisation met to explore the details of this claim. The HSEA gave a detailed response to the Irish Medical Organisation claim. Its response on salary levels was to point out that we are all parties to a national agreement which defines the parameters within which an offer could be made. The attempt to establish a link between nurses and NCHDs was not accepted. The HSEA proposed that overtime at nationally agreed rates could be paid to NCHDs in the same context as other health service grades. This development would of necessity involve a review of shift working and on call arrangements.</P>
    <P>The IMO was reminded that under the early settlers clause of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness it is due an additional 3% increase. This is in addition to the 2% increase which is outstanding from Partnership 2000 and which the IMO has not drawn down. This brings the total increase available under the Government's pay policy to 5%. Provisions on parental leave would be applied to NCHDs as they are applied to other health service grades. Unsocial hours payments would be paid to grades between 6-8 p.m. and were paid to grades where the shift encompassed the 6-8 p.m. time frame. The HSEA pointed out the unrostered hours mechanism had been used on two occasions since 1997 and could not be deemed a failure on the basis of its use in two instances.</P>
    <P>The parties agreed, however, to jointly examine an appropriate third party appeal process in addition to the continued operation of the unrostered hours mechanism. The HSEA accepted that there was a case to be made particularly in regard to short rosters. A review of recognition of additional appropriate qualifications would take place. The HSEA was sympathetic, subject to detailed discussion to the extension of the training grant to all NCHDs. Travel expenses would apply as with other grades in the health service subject to local authorisation. The HSEA expressed itself sympathetic in principle to a payment on rotation where it is incurred by the nature of the contract, for example, as part of a rotation scheme. It indicated that it would examine examination refunds in the context of the training grant.</P>
    <P>There exists a dual responsibility to ensure residences provided are of an acceptable standard and are maintained to that standard. I am com<Col N="1356" /> mitted to a refurbishment programme for these residences where they fall below acceptable standards. Medical indemnity is currently under review by the Department and its insurers. The HSEA, as the representative body for publicly funded health service employers, must conduct its negotiations with health service unions within the parameters of the pay agreement of the day and with due regard to Government pay policy. There is also a responsibility on employers and trade unions to conduct industrial relations in an orderly manner and, where agreement is not possible through direct negotiation, to avail of the State's industrial relations machinery so as to avoid exposing the health service to the very damaging effects of industrial action and the consequent hardship to the community at large.</P>
    <P>It should be acknowledged that the Labour Relations Commission has considerable expertise in the field of industrial relations and has been successful in resolving many difficult disputes in the past. I appeal to the IMO again to enter into discussions in the LRC on a substantive agenda, which has been laid out by the LRC in correspondence with both the HSEA and the IMO. Two offers have been made in regard to the agenda. Very little separates the two sides in terms of a decision to enter the LRC. I am totally committed to resolving this dispute. I see absolutely no necessity for a strike and I mean that genuinely having examined the issues and talked through the issues with the junior doctors because they can be resolved.</P>
    <P>There is a responsibility on all sides in the interests of the patients to give the LRC process a chance. I am absolutely convinced that if we enter into the LRC we will come out at the other end with a substantive and comprehensive agreement that will make a difference to the quality of life of junior doctors and as a result of which they will be held in high esteem. I want to make sure that in any agreement that emerges structures are in place which will guarantee its success in terms of its subsequent implementation at local level. I will spare no effort in trying to resolve this issue and to avoid the necessity for industrial action because there is none at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, for his efforts in attempting to resolve the dispute involving the non-consultant hospital doctors. The genuine way in which he presented his case clearly indicated that he wishes to ensure that there will not be any disruption in the hospital system. It also indicated that there is a recognition of difficulties relating to an extremely complex issue which has been with us for many years. There is also a genuine willingness on the part of the HSEA to deal with the issues. That has emerged from the negotiations which have taken place with the Labour Relations Commission. There is an acknowledgement of the inherent difficulties to which this issue gives rise and there is a resolve <Col N="1357" /> on the part of the HSEA and that of the Minister to ensure that hospital services are not disrupted. No one, not the non-consultant hospital doctors, the Department of Health and Children or the Minister, wants to see such a disruption.</P>
      <P>People must be constructive, stand back and take stock. In the interests of non-consultant hospital doctors, our hospitals and patients, every effort must be made by people on all sides to ensure that realism is brought into play and that there is no disruption in services which would have an adverse impact on patient care.</P>
      <P>There has been a great deal of media speculation, and rightly so, regarding the plight of junior doctors. As already stated, this problem has been abroad for a long period but we must remember that the Minister is new to his portfolio. One of the things we tend to forget is that this issue has been exacerbated by the ever increasing number of patients with which hospitals are obliged to deal. This, in turn, has impacted on the number of hours junior hospital doctors are required to work. Everybody has a role to play, particularly the consultants in our hospitals. Not alone do these people have a responsibility in respect of their contracts, they also have a responsibility in relation to the contracts of non-consultant hospital doctors. Consultants are team leaders and they must recognise that they have a role to play in terms of providing leadership and arranging staff rosters.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to junior doctors is that a system which included a basic working week of 39 hours and rostering of 65 hours was arrived at in 1989. This system was introduced in 1990 and gave rise to considerable costs because it involved increasing the number of non-consultant posts by 400. It is interesting to note that the number of junior doctors has continued to increase in the interim. It rose from approximately 2,000 in 1990 to 3,000 at present, an increase of 50%. Despite this increase, however, we continue to encounter problems similar to those which obtained in 1989. If that is the case, there is a need to fundamentally examine the structures which are in place and which were outlined by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need to develop solutions that reflect the current services on offer in our hospitals. The increase of 50% in the number of junior doctors has led to an imbalance in the number of trainee places on offer <i>vis-à-vis</i> consultant posts. One of the main reasons for the establishment of the Medical Manpower Forum was to examine the question of staffing in hospitals and to make recommendations as to how the underlying problems could be solved. The forum identified that there is an uneven distribution of hospital staff. For example, there are too many trainees, too few trained staff, a limited availability of senior clinical decision makers, shortages exist in particular areas of speciality, bulges and bottlenecks in career structures, problems in respect of out-of-hours cover and difficulties in relation to the level of medical cover which has impacted on the deliv<Col N="1358" /> ery of accident and emergency services in particular.</P>
    <P>While the primary concern of all involved is an improvement in patient care in our hospitals, everybody would agree that this can best take place in the context of reform and enhanced training and career structures for hospital doctors. Certain recommendations made by the Nursing Commission and other changes that are taking place should be allied to this.</P>
    <P>The Medical Manpower Forum has enabled the Department of Health and Children, the statutory bodies, the professional bodies, the voluntary hospitals and everyone involved to participate in building an agreed analysis of the plausible solutions to the problems that were identified. The forum's report will lay the foundation for a constructive resolution to the differing aspects of the hospital medical staffing debate. For example, it recognises the need for more and earlier opportunities for fully trained doctors to take on responsibility that is commensurate with their training, experience and expertise. Non-consultant hospital doctors have a desire to attain such opportunities.</P>
    <P>The report also establishes that there is a requirement for more fully trained doctors. The need to enhance post-graduate training arrangements is also recognised. Furthermore, the need to give higher priority to the development and maintenance of research opportunities is part and parcel of the report's recommendations. The requirement for greater flexibility in employment arrangements to match need and availability is highlighted, as is a recognition that the competent discharge of an increasingly high volume of work arises from demographic and other changes. The apparent inequalities of opportunities highlighted by the changing gender composition of the medical profession is also recognised in the report.</P>
    <P>Nobody wants a strike. I was interested to hear the Minister state that this dispute hinges on the fact that the IMO considers that the terms of the 1997 agreement were not honoured. There is a need for an unequivocal statement from the HSEA that it intends to honour that agreement. I was interested to hear the Minister state that, according to the Labour Relations Commission, this commitment has been given to the non-consultant hospital doctors.</P>
    <P>It is important for negotiations to take place in an atmosphere of normality. In that context, it would not be conducive to have an ongoing dispute. Rather, the Labour Relations Commission must be allowed to take on board the commitment from the HSEA that it is willing to honour the commitments entered into in 1997. It is important that the HSEA, the Labour Relations Commission, the non-consultant hospital doctors and the IMO, having agreed to a process in respect of the additional hours worked, should reach final agreement regarding the amount of money owed to non-consultant doctors.</P>
    <P>A dispute will affect the very people that the Minister, the Department, the non-consultant <Col N="1359" /> hospital doctors and everyone involved in the area of health want to help. No one wants patient care to be affected. We want to ensure that agreements which were entered into are honoured. The Minister accepts that a great deal of work remains to be done in respect of the career structure which applies to non-consultant hospital doctors. There is an opportunity for meaningful negotiation and a dispute will not help to further the cause of non-consultant hospital doctors, it will only hinder patient care.</P>

      <P>I welcome the motion that has been moved tonight by Fine Gael, which is warmly supported by the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe began by stating &ndash; and I will paraphrase what he said &ndash; that if we did not have so many patients there might not be a problem. I have heard of passing the buck, but that is really stretching it to the limit. After three years of this Fianna Fáil/PD Government, it is interesting somebody from the Government back benches essentially discovering that there are problems in our hospitals and that the dispute that is threatening from the NAHD is symptomatic of those very serious problems. I would like to remind Deputy O'Keeffe that the Government was elected to tackle the waiting lists. In that regard he is right &ndash; there are now more patients on the waiting lists than when the Government took power three ago. That is not the patients' fault, however. It lies fairly and squarely with the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's speech was startling in that it contained glowing comments about the employers &ndash; the HSEA. His sentiments are not shared by the non-consultant doctors, who have experienced extreme frustration and are now reaching breaking point. The IMO must make its own decision, and I respect that, on the proposals which have been outlined tonight. However, it is very damaging to say that this dispute is largely about the refusal of the HSEA to honour the current contract. If one tries to build a relationship based on trust, that track record is a serious impediment. Indeed, more may well be required of the Minister. Time will tell if he is doing enough. I hope he is but I do not have the confidence to say that this will be enough. He will be tested as to whether he can live up to his own rhetoric. If he does not do so, yet again a crisis is looming in our hospitals that will have profound effects. The health system is already under serious pressure. The crisis is not being caused by some natural disaster or a new epidemic; it is a man made crisis. The Minister must bear responsibility for the fact that this matter has not been dealt with. He appears incapable of dealing <Col N="1360" /> with the problem and we have a hospital management structure that has proven itself incapable of dealing with it.</P>
    <P>This crisis is preventable and curable, yet all the signs so far are that it will, if anything, deepen in the coming days. Non-consultant hospital doctors have declared their intention of taking industrial action from next Wednesday. Time is running out. They have voted to do so not by a margin but by a landslide; 92% of those balloted voted for industrial action. Yet again we are seeing health workers doing what goes against their professional commitment to patient care but who are being forced, out of desperation, to take industrial action in defence of basic improvements in their working lives.</P>
    <P>There is a terrible sense of <i>déjà vu</i> about this strike. The hospital service has still to fully recover from the effects of the biggest industrial action in the history of the State. Last October the nurses action lasted nine days. Its impact was unprecedented, both in terms of its effect on our hospital services and in terms of the sustained public support for the righteousness of the workers cause.</P>
    <P>Now that non-consultant hospital doctors are due to take industrial action, the public is entitled to answers as to why the Government has done nothing effective, so far, to prevent it. The public knows only too well how indebted we are to junior hospital doctors. Anyone who has to attend a hospital can attest to the commitment and hard work of nurses. It is worth noting, however, that public recognition of the essential work of young doctors is equally well grounded. We have the good fortune of having excellent people working in and committed to our hospital service. The Government, however, seems intent on forcing those health professionals out of the hospital and onto the street before they can have their legitimate grievances addressed.</P>
    <P>When the threat of a nurses strike became known last year it was understood by everybody that a deal would be struck. The only question was would the deal be struck before a strike or after the damage was done. The same inevitability is now coming into play in the case of this action being taken by young doctors. Again there is no doubt that a deal will be struck. The only question is will the Government have the wit, energy, commitment and good sense to provide a sound solution before the day of reckoning dawns. It may be that the Government is incapable of learning from experience. It may be that the new Minister is at heart no better than the last Minister for Health and Children or it may be that this Government is so punch-drunk from the sordid revelations that are tumbling out of the Flood tribunal that all its energies are concentrated on damage limitation measures and on holding the frail edifice of this Coalition together instead of tackling the problems of our health service.</P>
    <P>This is a test and so far the signs do not look good. Exactly a year ago &ndash; 11 May 1999 &ndash; I <Col N="1361" /> raised the plight of non-consultant hospital doctors in this House on the Adjournment. This coincidence only reinforces the serious lack of progress made over the last year on the issue of doctors pay and conditions. On that occasion I drew on statements made by the Irish Medical Organisation that itemised the points at the heart of this issue, which have been repeated in the Minister's statement. They include excessive hours of work, pay, unrealistic rostering, on-call duties and the distribution of duties between junior and senior doctors. These issues were known about a year ago when they were outlined by the IMO. Twelve months later the problems, if anything, have become worse. We all know of doctors who are working over 100 hours a week, yet a year ago the IMO stated clearly that rostering doctors for more than 65 hours a week is dangerous to the physical health of NCHDs and has the potential to retard both the development of a quality health care system and to give rise to malpractice claims by patients. The IMO could not have spelt it out more clearly.</P>
    <P>The practice of exploiting young doctors in training is dangerous to patient care. One year on, the Minister and his Department have not moved on the issue. That is why the junior hospital doctors voted for industrial action in overwhelming numbers. One year later, the employers organisation, the HSEA, has proved to be as intransigent as ever.</P>
    <P>At the time I outlined the reality for young doctors as follows:</P>
    <P>What this means is that doctors can and do end up working an intolerable number of hours. Indeed, there is evidence of doctors working up to and even over 100 hours a week. Regularly, junior hospital doctors do not get proper coffee breaks or even a chance to eat lunch. They may head into a day's work having been on call the night before and, following a day's work, having had only two hours sleep. If they want to take a holiday they have to make reciprocal arrangements with colleagues by providing cover for them. If someone is sick another doctor has to fill the gap.</P>
    <P>The current blanket exemption from the protection of the EU directive on working time for these doctors is unacceptable and poses an unjustifiable risk to patients. It is only a matter of time before a major medical error is made by some unfortunate junior hospital doctor suffering from exhaustion. That is the nightmare of which junior doctors are conscious on a daily basis and one that must be addressed within the shortest time-frame possible.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that any worker, but particularly workers who are dealing with matters of life and death, should be deprived of their legal right to rest breaks or minimum hours. We do not make the demands on lorry drivers or factory workers that are currently being made on junior hospital doctors manning our acute hospital services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1362" /> How relevant those words are still. On behalf of the Labour Party, I subsequently published a Private Members' Bill entitled the Protection of Patients and Doctors in Training Bill, 1999. This was done out of our concern for the plight of these doctors. While some climb down was made by the Government on the EU directive, the difficulties experienced by doctors were not addressed over the past year. We now have coming to a head a crisis that was forewarned by the doctors.</P>
    <P>It is well known that we have a shortage of nurses and that this is having a major impact on service delivery. In an article by Dr. Mick Molloy published last month by the IMO, important points were made about a pending shortage of young doctors, which the Minister disregards at his peril. That Irish graduates are haemorrhaging from our health system has been, to an extent, disguised by the entry of non-national doctors. Standards set by the Medical Council have had an impact on this ready source of manpower.</P>
    <P>However, a further point made by Dr. Molloy is that Irish graduates are increasingly, and at an earlier grade, being attracted to Britain and the US by shorter hours, better working conditions and better training and promotion prospects. We cannot afford to continue to lose our highly skilled doctors because the Government and the Minister cannot get their act together.</P>
    <P>Dr. Molloy's prescription includes a ministerial body to be set up to deal with issues of retaining Irish doctors and attracting foreign doctors, as well as modernising the present system of training of doctors, which we recognise is serving neither those working within the service nor those availing of it. Does the Minister intend to take the doctor's advice on this matter or is he still depending on the outcome, whenever that will be, of the protracted deliberations of the medical manpower forum? There is a crying need for reform of the training structures for doctors and for a widening of the numbers of consultants employed to create a specialist provided service instead of the current consultant led one.</P>
    <P> This Government has resources undreamed of by any previous Government, yet its failure to tackle the needs of health care has been absolutely dismal. Despite the increase in funding, all the Government has succeeded in doing is to increase the numbers on hospital waiting lists. Instead of the root and branch reform that the service so badly needs, we have pious aspirations from the Minister. While we expect a certain amount of pious aspirations from Ministers, we also have glib dismissal of serious proposals that set out to achieve the twin great aims of excellence and equality in health care</P>
    <P>In particular, I am talking about the major proposal published by the Labour Party, which outlines in detail a substantial framework for the future of the health service. According to A. Dale Tussing, the eminent health economist who has studied both the Irish health system and international models:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1363" /> There are two currents in healthcare reform in Europe and North America. One group of reformers seeks to address inequality of access to healthcare and seeks a level playing field, removing artificial distinctions based on income or social class. Another group of advocates seeks more allocational efficiency in the delivery of medical care and uses decentralization and market solutions as the principal device for achieving it. The Labour Party discussion document, &ldquo;Curing Our Ills&rdquo;, focuses on the former set of goals but, in the bargain, manages to address and achieve the latter as well. It is a 21st century document.</P>
    <P>Despite this endorsement from a very eminent man, the Minister has refused to even discuss the ideas we have published. Fortunately, others in the health services have been enthusiastically engaged in the process of debate. The Minister badmouths our proposals without having any serious proposals of his own to solve the central problems in health care &ndash; the requirements of excellence and equality. He spreads misinformation instead of delivering reform, in which he is ably assisted by his Cork batman, Deputy O'Keeffe.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, patients suffer and die unnecessarily because they cannot get into hospital. Some of those who have made it into hospital are being put at risk because of the enormous stress on young doctors in training. That these young doctors are now taking action to protect their patients is to their great credit. What is shameful is that the Minister for Health and Children has not yet taken the definitive action needed to resolve this dispute in the interests of patient care.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate. The scandal of junior hospital doctors working around the clock can no longer be tolerated and the legal basis of it is questionable. For doctors to work up to 100 hours per week is a danger to their health. More crucially, they will readily tell you that, despite their best efforts, they are unable to give the level of patient care they would wish after being on their feet for hours on end.</P>
      <P>Just over six months ago, as Deputy McManus said, nurses took to the streets for the first time ever. Despite predictions from some quarters that the lack of public support would force nurses back into the wards, the reality was that public support and understanding of the nurses' actions hardly dwindled throughout their strike. The result was that the Government was forced into dealing with the nurses' claim, as it should have from the outset. However, a number of outstanding matters have not yet been addressed, despite firm commitments given by the Government in that regard. I will return to that another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my firm belief that if the junior doctors are forced to strike, the public will offer its full support. Those of us who have been attended to in <Col N="1364" /> hospital by junior doctors know they work hard. They, like any other workers, deserve the kind of rest periods and breaks for meals which are provided for under the Organisation of Working Time Act. No member of the public wants to be cared for by a junior doctor who has been on his feet for 15 or 16 hours without a break and hardly any food to sustain his energy levels.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of a world class health system and, to this end, I compliment my colleague, Deputy McManus, on her recently published radical document on the health services. Since moving to the Opposition benches three years ago, I have had to come into the House on more than one occasion to highlight the extensive inadequacies in the health service, particularly the failure by the Government to fund the completion of phase 2B of the Longford-Westmeath General Hospital. I have given an unequivocal commitment in the House that I intend to pursue the Minister vigorously to provide the finance of about £20 million which is needed to complete this development for the people of Longford and Westmeath.</P>
    <P>I have tabled a host of parliamentary questions relating to constituents of mine who are on public waiting lists for essential operations and whose conditions are deteriorating by the day because of the delay in having their needs attended to. One example of the pain and suffering waiting lists have inflicted on people is a constituent of mine who was on a waiting list for an essential hip operation for some time. During the wait, his other hip deteriorated to such an extent that he and his family lost complete faith in the public health service and several weeks ago raised £4,000 for the essential operation to be carried out on a private basis. He is being operated on this week.</P>
    <P>This is a scandalous system. It is all right if one has the money, but it is not so good if one does not. People who cannot afford to pay for essential treatment are being forced to do without. Given our healthy financial position, we should end the scandalous existence of a two tiered system of access to the health service. Those on low incomes find the nation's health service weighted against them. That is a scandalous way to enter the new millennium. The failure of the health system to look after people without financial muscle is shown by the waiting lists. There are about 38,000 people on the waiting lists for various specialities.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to the provision of orthodontic services, especially for young people. I met a parent the other day whose 16 year old daughter has a severe problem with her teeth. The parents are in receipt of social welfare payments and are unable to afford the £1,500 required to ensure she receives appropriate treatment. Why can the outdated determinants of eligibility for the receipt of orthodontic treatment by young people, which were introduced in the 1980s, not be radically changed? Everyone with a modicum of common sense knows the embarrassment many young <Col N="1365" /> people feel at having to live with teeth outcrops and so on. Let us do the decent thing and give that service to all the people who need it.</P>
    <P>Clearly, if one has money to pay for treatment one will get it, but if one does not one must suffer on. While the inequalities of our health service might have nothing to do with the impending action by junior doctors, they are symptomatic of the mess that is the Irish health system in 2000.</P>
    <P>This week, I have had the opportunity to view some of the recommendations of a special project team which was established to assess the needs of Longford-Westmeath General Hospital. It is clear from these recommendations that not only are more staff, equipment and facilities required at the hospital, there is also insufficient accommodation available for junior doctors to take rest periods whenever they are lucky enough to get them. The report recommends that a total of 11 rooms are necessary to facilitate the current level of junior doctors on call at any given time.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> With your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I would like to share my time with Deputy Belton and Deputy Joe Higgins. Seldom has an event sparked such universal public concern than the manner in which the Garda handled the so-called siege in which John Carthy was shot dead outside his home in Abbeylara, County Longford, three weeks ago.</P>
      <P>The key question is, could his killing have been avoided? Could the so-called siege have been brought to a more humane end? Were the tactics and methods employed by the Garda the correct approach in this kind of situation? Let us look at the circumstances. Here we had a 27 year old only son living with his widowed mother and with no criminal record. Apart from a minor scrape with local gardaí his record was blemish free. Here we had somebody who had already received residential psychiatric treatment a short time previously, who was obviously emotionally very upset and who was caught up in a situation which he had not envisaged when he barricaded himself in the house. How a minor domestic situation about which a mother was anxious concerning her son's possession of a shotgun was allowed to escalate to a major siege has to be central to any investigation or inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until the full facts emerge as to what exactly <Col N="1366" /> happened during the 26 hour siege, the public perception of what happened is coloured and conditioned by newspaper photographs of what occurred &ndash; the emergency response unit lurking behind walls wearing bullet proof vests and helmets; up to 60 gardaí armed with HK 33 assault rifles, Israeli Uzi submachine guns and pump action shotguns.</P>
    <P>Here was a small country cottage with a lone labourer suffering from depression armed with a double barrelled shotgun, a limited number of cartridges and hopelessly out numbered. There was no hostage involved. There was no risk presented to any member of the public. Until the full facts emerge then the public perception is that the situation was badly handled. There is one overriding public belief and that is that John Carthy should not have died.</P>
    <P>A number of questions require answers. How did the gardaí justify the huge Garda presence at Carthy's house since there was not a hostage involved? Who decided, and at what stage, that the heavily armed Garda emergency response unit was required in such numbers? Why was Marie Carthy not allowed into the house to talk with her brother? Is it true that the emergency response unit which was called in had only recently commenced their special training? Did the gardaí attempt to communicate with Michael Finucane, the solicitor John Carthy had indicated he wished to see in his telephone conversation with his friend Kevin Ireland, an hour before he was shot dead? Could the gardaí simply not have left the vicinity of the Carthy home on Wednesday evening after the dispute with Mrs. Carthy and her son occurred and sent for the psychiatrist who had recently treated John Carthy? Have the Garda only got instructions to shoot-to-kill when confronted by a person with a gun or have they the option of wounding the person with a view to disarming him? Are plastic bullets a Garda option in such circumstances?</P>
    <P>Was any warning shot fired? How many shots were fired and how many gardaí were on the scene when Mr. Carthy emerged from his house? How many bullet wounds were there in the body? Why was the body of Mr Carthy not left where he died until it was inspected by the State pathologist, Dr. Harbison, instead of being taken to Mullingar? John Carthy had his shotgun confiscated by the Garda some time ago on the grounds that he was not a fit person to hold such a weapon. Is it true that the gun was restored to him on the basis of a report from a psychiatrist?</P>
    <P>It will be three weeks tomorrow since John Carthy was killed. The investigation got under way immediately. I cannot understand how and why it has not been concluded. After all, nobody else was involved except John Carthy and the known gardaí at the scene. It should be concluded and it must be published and it must be published in full and not a sanitised or edited version.</P>
    <P>If the leaked version in last Monday's <i>The Star</i> newspaper is an accurate account of what is in the Garda report, it is simply not acceptable and <Col N="1367" /> I will join the Carthy family and the Abbeylara community in their call for a full public inquiry.</P>

I understand the Garda are carrying out a comprehensive investigation of the events leading up to this dreadful tragedy. As I have already said, it is important that all the facts are made public by the Garda and the Minister. Confidence must be restored. The family has asked for a certain amount of privacy at this time and are entitled to do so.</P>
      <P>The events leading up to this tragedy, the tactics used during the siege and the awful ending to it must be looked at. I have every confidence the Garda will do so.

        <b>:</b> The tragic death of John Carthy in Abbeylara, the circumstances surrounding it and the Garda report should have been the subject of an urgent discussion in Dáil Éireann today. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should have come into the House and answered questions on it. I regret the Ceann Comhairle did not allow me to raise the matter today in that way.</P>
      <P>It seems incomprehensible to people that the Garda would not have been sufficiently prepared and trained to bring the situation in Abbeylara to an end without loss of life. Flooding the environs of the Carthy home with detectives wielding machine guns and other severe weapons was an entirely inappropriate response to a situation where an individual armed with a single shotgun was holed up in an agitated state. In the event that a certain use of force was called for, why was there not to hand equipment which would temporarily disabled John Carthy rather than have him shot dead? Is such equipment in the hands of the Garda? If not, why not and if so, why was it not in place in Abbeylara?</P>
      <P>What is the current state of the Garda inquiry? Was the Garda the source of a report in a daily newspaper two days ago purporting to be leaks from the inquiry? Will the Minister tell us when will the report be published? We should have it instantly. I call on the Minister as well as the Garda to hold a full public inquiry to get to the bottom of this tragic and sad affair which shocked everyone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for this opportunity to respond to the questions raised by Deputy Higgins concerning the death of Mr. John Carthy at Abbeylara in County Longford last Holy Thursday. The death of any person in circumstances such as this is tragic, and our first <Col N="1368" /> thoughts must be for and with the family of Mr. Carthy. I am very conscious in speaking on the matter of the sadness they must be feeling at this time and I would like to once again express my deepest condolences to them.</P>
      <P>A death such as this, involving the use of lethal force by the Garda Síochána, clearly raises serious questions which must be answered and serious issues which must be addressed. The use of firearms by members of the Garda Síochána is, in itself, an exceptional occurrence in what remains in general an unarmed force. That tradition of unarmed policing has been one of the great strengths of the Garda Síochána, but there are occasions where the Garda Síochána must have the capacity to use firearms, and the circumstances where this can occur are strictly regulated by the Garda authorities. The use of firearms is an option of last resort.</P>
      <P>Any incident involving the use of firearms by gardaí is, therefore, regarded by the Garda authorities as a serious matter. When, as in this case, the use of firearms results in a death, it is a matter of the utmost priority for the Garda authorities to determine the facts leading to and surrounding the death in order to know what happened, why it happened and what lessons might be learnt for the future.</P>
      <P>That is why the Garda Commissioner has appointed a chief superintendent to conduct a thorough investigation into the death of Mr. Carthy. The investigation commenced immediately after the incident and, I am informed, is being conducted as a matter of urgency and with speed.</P>
      <P>I know there has been a great deal spoken and written about this incident, with much comment and analysis in the media and I understand the desire for answers which underlies this. It is undeniably a matter of public interest which raises serious issues. It is, however, very important, while the investigation into the death of Mr. Carthy is under way, for everyone to avoid speculating as to what may or may not have happened, to avoid drawing premature conclusions, and to refrain from attributing blame. To do so would do nothing to help achieve the objective which all of us share, which is to establish the facts surrounding the death of Mr. Carthy and to see what lessons may be drawn from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we must do is await the outcome of the investigation. It will be a thorough investigation. It is being conducted with urgency and it will establish the facts. The Garda Commissioner and I have expressed our intention that all of the facts established by this investigation will be put into the public domain. When the full details of the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Carthy are known, then we in this House and the public in general will be in a position to form a view on, and draw conclusions from, this tragic event. There will also be an inquest which will <Col N="1369" /> further enhance public scrutiny of the circumstances surrounding Mr. Carthy's death.</P>
    <P>I know there have been calls for a public inquiry but I believe it would be premature at this stage, in the absence of complete knowledge of all the circumstances, to conclude that there are reasonable grounds for such an inquiry. Let us first examine the facts established by the inquiry which is under way before we form conclusions as to further action.</P>
    <P>I am glad of this opportunity once again to extend my sympathy for the family of Mr. Carthy, to assure the House that a thorough investigation is urgently under way into the circumstances surrounding his death, that the facts established by that investigation will be made public and that any lessons which can be learned will be learned.</P>
    <P>In particular, it would be remiss of me not to refer to the very balanced contributions which have been made in public and in the House by local Deputies Albert Reynolds and Louis Belton. It would also be remiss of me not to comment upon what I regard as a tendency by the main spokesperson on Justice in the main Opposition party, Fine Gael, to be judgmental where the gardaí are concerned prior to any inquiry having been completed. I make the request, not for the first time, that this tendency cease. In as much as each individual is presumed innocent until proven guilty, the members of the Garda Síochána are entitled to the adoption of the rule of law and to expect due process. They have a right to expect this from the general public and, not least, from the main spokesperson on Justice from the main Opposition party.</P>

      <P>The people of Tralee have been both welcoming and accommodating towards refugees and asylum seekers over the past two years. There are 180 asylum seekers in Tralee as well as 80 Kosovars. Some 40 more places are available in the Johnston Marina Hotel, which at present houses 60 refugees. This will bring the figure to 300, the largest concentration of refugees and asylum seekers outside Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was little or no consultation between the directorate for refugee and asylum support services regarding the dispersal of these people to Tralee, and the directorate would have to accept that they have received no resistance, to date, to its dispersal programme in Tralee or Listowel. When the Kosovars, for example, arrived in Kerry, a group of people from Tralee welcomed them at Kerry airport. The Listowel Urban Council received the 24 asylum seekers in the council chamber on arrival. Local charities and individuals donated clothes and other necessities to the asylum seekers. The asylum seekers themselves <Col N="1370" /> accept that they have been made very welcome in both towns.</P>
    <P>However, the proposal to house 200 or so people in 50 housing units on the grounds of Ballymullen Army Barracks, without any consultation with the local community or the provision of information to the residents of the village of Ballymullen and the surrounding communities, has infuriated the local population of 277 people or so.</P>
    <P>The village of Ballymullen is situated on the outskirts of Tralee. It is a small community with a long history. It has two shops, two public houses, a creamery, an electrical shop, two guest houses and an Army barracks. The majority of the people living in the village are retired. A number of old people live alone and, as one individual remarked at a recent public meeting, there are 90 year old people looking after 75 year old people. It is a very closely knit community with a proud history associated mostly with the Army barracks and with a number of wars fought over the last two centuries.</P>
    <P>The people are rightly concerned about this proposal. An influx of between 200 and 300 people, irrespective of who they might be, into such a small community confined to two acres of land, is not acceptable on humanitarian or any other grounds. It is not acceptable for the residents of Ballymullen or the unfortunate asylum seekers. This is not an appropriate solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>I am aware of no commitment to any extra community health care or other services. The Minister is aware of the state of the health services in Tralee because his brother is a member of the Southern Health Board. Tralee General Hospital has the longest out-patient and one of the longest in-patient waiting lists in the country. There has been no commitment by the Southern Health Board to provide extra services to cope with this influx of refugees in addition to those there already. The services are stretched already and this is most unfair to people who are to be dispersed to Tralee. It is unfair to the refugees and asylum seekers and to local people.</P>
    <P>This is not a good decision. It is contrary to any civilised dispersal policy. The UN High Commission on Refugees recently issued clear guidelines regarding the housing of refugees and asylum seekers. These guidelines rule out the housing of refugees in what are potential ghettoes. If one accommodates such a large number of people in close proximity, irrespective of who they are, one creates a potential ghetto.</P>
    <P>The infrastructure &ndash; health services, education and so on &ndash; to cater for such a large influx of people is not in place. Last night Tralee Urban Council gave permission to build houses at a density of eight houses per acre in the town, just half a mile from the location of the barracks. Furthermore, in a recent discussion on Kerry Radio, Peter Mahony of the Irish Refugee Council said that this type of housing solution was unacceptable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1371" /> I appeal to the Minister not to pursue this proposal at Ballymullen.</P>

      <P>The proposal to locate 40 asylum seekers in the Vee Valley Hotel in Clogheen, County Tipperary, was handled in an inept, incompetent and very arrogant manner. The lack of information, consultation and negotiation has caused a serious impasse, resulting in a 24 hour picket being placed on the hotel for the past two weeks.</P>
      <P>There is no better way to cultivate uncertainty and insecurity, to generate concern and fear than to withold information and refuse any opportunity for consultation or negotiation.  </P>
      <P>It is incredible to recall how the information reached Clogheen that the proposal was to increase the population of that little village by 40% overnight. The news came to the community and public representatives by rumour and hearsay until eventually just one official telephone call was made by the directorate to the local priest. There was no communication with the local school which would have to cater for additional children, the hospital or Garda station, the social welfare office in Caher or officials of the health board.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the decision to locate 40 asylum seekers in Clogheen was based solely on the availability of accommodation. Had that accommodation been capable of catering for 200 refugees, would the Minister have proceeded to locate 200 refugees in Clogheen? It appears that the only credible policy the Minister has is to find suitable accommodation, which, worse still, seems to be accepted as suitable on the word of the proprietor. From our experience in Clogheen no investigation was carried out into the suitability of the accommodation selected.</P>
      <P>The attitude and generosity of the people of Clogheen should not be judged from their resistance to the imposition of 40 asylum seekers in their community by stealth. There is a tremendous community spirit among the people of Clogheen. Their generosity cannot be questioned. It is proved by their tremendous response to fund raising for the local hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has a problem and I support him in finding a solution. It is not what he is doing however that is at issue but how he is proceeding to deal with the problem. It is both unfair and wrong not to approach the people of Clogheen and give them full and adequate information, to negotiate with them and ask them to become part of the programme to deal with asylum seekers. The Minister will kill their sense of generosity, sharing and being part of a programme to deal with a national problem if they are not made feel that their views and concerns will be taken into <Col N="1372" /> account and that they will have a say in the location of asylum seekers within their community.</P>
    <P>The infrastructure of Clogheen has not been investigated. Nobody seemed to ask about the availability of transport. Nobody seemed to be worried about providing interpreters, language classes, leisure facilities and activities for asylum seekers during daylight hours within their new surroundings. It is not sufficient just to find accommodation, this must be backed up by adequate resources and facilities to ensure those who seek refuge here will be able to expect not just a roof over their heads but that their other needs will also be met. They should be given the opportunity to learn our language and mix with local communities.</P>
    <P>The situation in Clogheen is very serious. The Minister should break the impasse and make himself available for consultation and negotiation. The people of Clogheen will not be found wanting if they are dealt with on equal terms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">

      <P>I reject out of hand the tendentious comments of Deputy Ahearn. We are dealing with a very serious and sensitive issue and the interests of the people of Clogheen and asylum seekers would be best served if we approached this issue in a calm, sensible and rational manner.</P>
      <P>The number of asylum seekers entering the country has increased dramatically in recent years, but particularly since July of last year. The current rate of arrival is approximately 1,000 per month. On the basis of recent trends it is anticipated that at least 12,000 applications for asylum will be made this year. The significant increase in the number of persons applying for refugee status has resulted in an acute shortage of accommodation in the greater Dublin area. To put it at its starkest, the supply of accommodation in the greater Dublin area has been exhausted. Apart from the shortage of accommodation in Dublin, it is not desirable from an integration point of view to have all asylum seekers located in the capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to the emergency which has developed it is necessary to source suitable accommodation throughout the country as a matter of urgency. The alternative, which is unacceptable, is to have asylum seekers sleeping on the streets and in parks. There is no avoiding this key point. In the longer term, my aim and that of the Government is to achieve a fair and balanced distribution of asylum seekers throughout the country and to have particular regard, among other factors, to the size of the local communities when deciding the numbers of asylum seekers to be placed in them. For reasons to do with the number of asylum seekers entering the State however all offers of accommodation, wherever they arise, have to be fully and carefully considered. The severe shortage of accommodation in all areas of the State allied to the continuing increase in asylum <Col N="1373" /> applications is giving rise to enormous difficulties in meeting the basic needs of asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>Information meetings organised by the Directorate for Asylum Support Services take place at all locations where it is proposed to accommodate asylum seekers. Such meetings take place before asylum seekers are accommodated in localities. The directorate strives at all times to inform local communities as early as possible. The directorate is often constrained however with regard to the amount of notice which can be given because the time from the date accommodation is secured to the date on which asylum seekers need to be accommodated is often very short. Neither I nor the Department can predict daily the number of applicants who travel here to make applications. Nevertheless they all have to be housed and have their basic needs met. Opposition Deputies can protest all they like but there is no denying or escaping that basic fact.</P>
    <P>Society in general and host communities have a major role to play in the reception of asylum seekers. The directorate is available to support and encourage communities to interact with asylum seekers and not to see them as a burden. Following a recent meeting in Tralee, a number of organisations and individuals have indicated their wish to become actively involved in assisting asylum seekers in the area and involving them, where possible, in local and voluntary organisations. Individuals in the Clogheen area have also indicated that they would like to be involved in providing support for asylum seekers in the locality. In this regard, officials from the directorate are available to assist local support groups.</P>
    <P>It is the policy of the directorate to help establish local support groups and monitoring committees in locations where asylum seekers are accommodated. Local support groups usually comprise representatives of local community groups and endeavour to involve asylum seekers in community and sporting activities. Local monitoring committees establish links between the managers of centres for asylum seekers, resident groups and local business interests. These committees can work in a collaborative way to resolve issues that may arise and to ensure good ongoing liaison between management of the accommodation centres and local communities. A number of communities have established support groups and monitoring committees. I welcome and very much appreciate their initiative and goodwill.</P>
    <P>Asylum seekers are actively participating in voluntary ventures in many centres and local communities have welcomed this participation. Family groups have adjusted quickly to their new surroundings. Children in particular are very adept at adjusting to new surroundings.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious, as is the case with all locations where asylum seekers are accommodated, that the management structures put in place in Ballymullen and Clogheen will be vital to the success of the sites. I am also conscious of the need for liaison between the local community and asylum seekers. With this in mind, the direc<Col N="1374" /> torate will require the highest standards from the management of accommodation centres and the operation and security of the sites and their impact on local communities will be monitored on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>Mobile home accommodation, which is what is planned for the Army barracks in Ballymullen, is particularly suitable for family groups. The Tralee site was inspected by architectural staff of the Office of Public Works with a view to assessing its suitability for development as a mobile home site. This professional examination concluded that the site was capable, following the appropriate works, of accommodating up to 50 mobile homes and the ancillary management, catering and other necessary structures. On Monday I met local representatives from the Tralee area to discuss the proposal to accommodate asylum seekers there. I assured them that I would pass on the points raised by them to the directorate. In turn, I have been assured by the directorate that it is committed to adopting a sensitive approach to the numbers to be accommodated and that, in the main, families will be located there. The directorate has arranged a meeting tomorrow with local and community representatives from Clogheen.</P>
    <P>In general, I hope that the fears and concerns of local communities can be quickly allayed. The fact that communities in several towns and villages throughout the country have had asylum seekers in their midst for some years, in some instances without any undue difficulties, is a very positive sign. There is no reason to believe that the situation will be any different in those areas which for the first time have an asylum seeker cohort in their communities.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me if I did not point out that, since becoming Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have repeatedly stated in the House that there would be a difficulty about the number of asylum seekers coming into the State. I stated repeatedly that certain measures were required and was opposed across the floor of the House on numerous occasions on almost every measure I sought to introduce. Surely I can be forgiven for looking at Opposition Members and asking if I had done what their front bench spokespersons wanted me to do over the past three years, how much more serious would the accommodation difficulty be tonight? How much more difficult would the position be?</P>
    <P>If I had listened to all the pressure brought to bear on me as Minister in this House, and to all the criticism I had to confront over the past three years on this matter, I suggest, without fear of contradiction, that the system which is being criticised tonight would be in a state of absolute collapse.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter. The need for a new school in Rathmore, County Kerry, has never been more pressing. In anticipation of a new school, no funding for upgrading existing facilities has been forthcoming from the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>In June 1998, the boards of management and parents of the Presentation Convent primary school, Shrone national school and St. Joseph's boys national school agreed in principle to the proposed amalgamation of the three schools. Of the schools, St. Joseph's is most in need of replacement but that is not to discredit the needs of the other schools. St. Joseph's school is a hazard to teachers and pupils and the standard of accommodation is so bad that even the Department accepted that it is one of the worst schools in the country. The building was condemned by the environmental health officers of the Southern Health Board two years ago and by the INTO.</P>
      <P>I recently visited the school and was shocked by the level of disrepair. The toilets are housed in an outside building which is unfit for human use. In all kinds of weather, children must cross the yard to use these highly inadequate facilities and there is no staff to ensure that they are safe at all times and that they return to their classroom afterwards. This is no fault of the hard pressed teachers.</P>
      <P>The three classrooms in the school are completely inadequate and do not represent the standards which children and teachers should expect in 2000. The roof of the main building leaks continually and is in constant need of repair. This acts as a distraction and discomfort for all using the building. It is no surprise that rats found a safe haven under the computer desks in all the classrooms in the winter of 1998. The windows in the building are completely rotten and cannot be opened which is proving very uncomfortable given the current balmy temperatures.</P>
      <P>Because of the lack of space in the school, the remedial teacher is forced to work from a prefabricated building located across from the yard. This is also inappropriate given that pupils must leave the supervision of the school to gain crucial assistance with their schooling. It grieves me to raise this matter at a time of unprecedented wealth and that children are subjected to archaic facilities such as outside toilets which are inadequate for any person, never mind a child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are providing computers and up-to-date technology in all our schools and this is welcome. However, there is a serious disregard for children when we cannot provide them with the basics of <Col N="1376" /> decent classrooms and toilet facilities. The reason the boys national school has fallen into such a bad state of repair is that the management expected it would transfer to the vocational school when the new community college was completed some years ago. The Department then proposed the amalgamation and this was agreed. In spite of the best efforts of management, and Fr. Horgan in particular, nothing positive has happened.</P>
    <P>I raised the inadequacies of this school in a parliamentary question last month and the Minister responded by saying that the case had been referred to the property managment section of the Office of Public Works. This response was highly unsatisfactory and unacceptable to the people of Rathmore. The pupils and teachers in Rathmore boys school have waited long enough and I want a commitment from the Minister to prioritise the acquisition of the site and progress with the building of a new school as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, asked me apologise to the Deputy for his inability to be in the House and to thank her for giving him the opportunity to outline the current position regarding the proposed provision of a new primary school at Rathmore, County Kerry. For my part, being from the same constituency as the Deputy, I also thank her for giving me the opportunity to sing from the same hymn sheet.</P>
      <P>The management authorities of Rathmore boys national school applied to the Department of Education and Science for funding towards upgrading and refurbishing the existing facilities. A technical inspection of the school building was subsequently carried out by the Department's architectural service. Following further consideration of the matter, the question of rationalisation of primary schools in the Rathmore area was raised and discussions held between the Department and the various interested parties. Agreement was subsequently reached between the Department and the relevant school authorities to amalgamate into a new school on a green field site. A number of sites were identified and the Department has instructed the property management section of the Office of Public Works, which acts as its agent in the acquisition of sites, to pursue the purchase of a suitable site for the new school.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that as soon as the site has been acquired, architectural planning for the building project will proceed as quickly as possible. The Department is fully committed to the provision of a new primary school in Rathmore and the Minister and I thank the Deputy for giving us the opportunity to outline the current position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 to 24, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My keynote address to the annual conference of the Irish Management Institute on 7 April was focused on the main challenges facing the Irish economy and society in the years ahead &ndash; princi<Col N="1378" /> pally, globalisation, EU enlargement and rapid technological change.</P>
    <P>In particular, I emphasised the need first, to invest heavily so as to position Ireland to become a world-class leader in the global, knowledge-based, digital economy; second, to build on that through the pursuit of top-class policies on connectivity, education, regulation and partnership; and third, to deliver, through social partnership, the potential inherent in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. That will require all sides to adhere to both the letter and the spirit of the programme.</P>
    <P>Through the provisions set out in the Government's own programme, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and the national development plan, we are well positioned to ensure the long-term sustainability of economic and social progress. I made the point in my address, however, that the enormous potential of these highly ambitious programmes can only be realised fully if we maintain the level of discipline which has served us so well in the past.</P>
    <P>My address to the Institute of Directors on 20 April was focused on similar themes though, naturally, I gave particular prominence as well to the strong economic relationship between Ireland and Britain.</P>
    <P>Copies of both my speeches are available in the Oireachtas Library for further reference.</P>
    <P>With regard to the first plenary meeting under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness on 26 April, the primary focus was on agreeing the detailed arrangements to secure full implementation of the new programme. In that context, it was agreed to convene in the immediate future the housing forum and the public transport forum, together with addressing a number of other priority issues affecting quality of life and social inclusion.</P>
    <P>Consideration was also given to the current inflationary pressures in the economy and the meeting was satisfied that there are solid grounds for expecting inflation to have fallen significantly by the end of the year. However, the vigorous implementation of all the terms of the PPF will be necessary to maintain a low inflationary environment. In addition, it was agreed that the Government and the social partners will monitor developments and discuss the options which are available to secure the low inflationary conditions provided for in the PPF.</P>
    <P>On the issue of widening representation in the social partnership process, I indicated in the House last month that the spirit within which the four pillars have operated over recent years suggests the desirability that any organisation wishing to become part of the process should secure the agreement of the appropriate social partner pillar. In the event of a positive response, the Government would consider such applications sympathetically, taking due account of such factors as continuance of a fair balance in representation as between the four pillars.</P>
    <P>Regarding the inclusion of the organisations <Col N="1379" /> specified in the questions, it is my understanding that none of them have yet sought formal agreement for inclusion under the appropriate pillar. With regard to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, obviously only those organisations involved in its negotiation will be involved in its implementation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure has met on six occasions to date. Its last meeting was on 18 April 2000.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure is an integral part of Government and its meetings, as with any Cabinet committee, are an integral part of the business of Government. The practice has grown up over time of allowing questions in the House as to the date and number of meetings of such committees. Questions as to the business conducted at Cabinet committee meetings have never been allowed in the House on the grounds that they are internal to Government. The reasons for this approach are founded on sound policy principles and the need to avoid infringing the constitutional protection of Cabinet confidentiality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 to 43, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Following the meetings referred to by Deputies and numerous other meetings, I am happy to report to the House a major breakthrough.</P>
      <P>I am laying before the House a statement issued by both Governments on Friday night last and a letter to the Northern Ireland parties sent by both Governments on Saturday morning.</P>
      <P>The statement by both Governments last Friday was responded to by the IRA on Saturday. The British Prime Minister and I welcomed the IRA statement and announced that, following consultations with the International Independent Commission on Decommissioning, Mr. Martii Ahtisaari, the former President of Finland and Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa, former Secretary General of the African National Congress, had agreed to head the recurrent inspections of a number of IRA weapons dumps as set out in the IRA statement.</P>
      <P>We have, I believe, secured, following weeks and months of intensive discussions and negotiations, a map for the comprehensive implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. In the shorter term, the British Government will bring forward an order to enable the Northern Ireland Assembly and its Executive to be restored by 22 May next, the second anniversary of the referendums that overwhelmingly endorsed the Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will, of course, be familiar with the background to the situation. In my statement to this House on 15 February, following the suspension of the institutions, I expressed my disappointment at what had transpired, but I pledged that we would dedicate ourselves to ensuring the earliest possible restoration of the institutions, so that the progress we had all welcomed could be built upon and developed. In the period of their suspension the institutions have been sorely missed and commentators and politicians on all sides have expressed the need for local, accountable governance in Northern Ireland and for the effective operation of the North-South institutions. Senior political figures from Wales and Scotland have looked forward to the activation of the British-Irish Council. It is certainly the case that when <Col N="1382" /> difficult regional issues have to be dealt with, it is most appropriate that they be dealt with by representatives who are accountable regionally and who have the best regional knowledge. The many ordinary issues, across the range of economic and social activity, require agreed, democratic decision making and consensus at local level.</P>
    <P>Few anticipated the progress achieved in the time when the institutions were in place. We have now regained the opportunity to build on that work and to re-establish the basis that will allow democratic politics to flourish.</P>
    <P>Above all, the progress we have made allows us to fulfil the democratic wishes of the people as expressed in the referendums, North and South, following the successful negotiation of the Good Friday Agreement. The people voted then in overwhelming numbers for a new beginning, a new future. In this process there cannot be winners and losers, because that is only storing up trouble for the future. We have now, genuinely, a win situation and the opportunity must be grasped.</P>
    <P>Over recent months, we have seen probably the most difficult time in this process. What recent days have shown is that there is a genuine commitment on all sides to work together to find solutions and to confront the difficult issues. I also believe that recent days have shown just how robust the Good Friday Agreement is. The Agreement does provide us with a sound basis for future relationships and governance. Everything in the Agreement, its whole basis and philosophy, is founded on the principles of reconciliation, tolerance and mutual trust. Our relationships must be based on partnership, equality and mutual respect. There is absolutely no doubt that there will be further difficult times ahead, but we do have the means at our disposal to resolve those difficult issues, if we work in accordance with the principles underpinning the Agreement. We cannot allow a return to the sterile negativity of the past.</P>
    <P>It is the obligation of all democrats to ensure that the violence of the past is firmly put behind us and that we achieve a new way forward. In this regard, the IRA statement of Saturday is highly significant. I have always said that the IRA ceasefires and the ceasefires of loyalist paramilitary organisations have made a crucial contribution to the search for peace. But now, the commitment by the IRA, as set out in their statement, to resume contact with the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning; to initiate a process to completely and verifiably put IRA arms beyond use in such a way as to avoid risk to the public and misappropriation by others and ensure maximum public confidence; and the agreement to put in place a confidence-building measure to confirm that weapons are secure are all immensely positive developments. I would like here to express my appreciation to Mr. Martti Ahtisaari and Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa, both widely respected international figures, for agreeing to undertake the inspections. We also, of course, <Col N="1383" /> look to early commitments by the loyalist paramilitary organisations.</P>
    <P>The issue of decommissioning had been a persistent challenge, which had to be addressed satisfactorily. It was also critical that we address issues around the implementation of other aspects of the Agreement. This has now been done over a range of outstanding issues. With regard to security, the British Government will progressively take all the necessary steps to secure as early return as possible to normal security arrangements in Northern Ireland, consistent with the level of threat at the time. The statements of last weekend have been highly significant and, in response, the British Government will be taking further substantial normalisation measures by June 2001. A number of important measures in this regard were announced yesterday, which I warmly welcome. We will, of course, continue to oppose with resolute and determined action any group that uses or threatens violence to disrupt this process and we will take whatever measures are necessary to do so.</P>
    <P>We have a timetable for the implementation of the Patten report and the criminal justice review. The need for a new beginning to policing in Northern Ireland is central to the Agreement. It is in the interests of all in Northern Ireland that the police service be able to function fully and freely in all areas and across all communities. People from both communities want to be able to give unqualified support to the police service and want police men and women to be made welcome in every home.</P>
    <P>One thing that emerges clearly from the debate on policing is that both communities are committed to realising a police service that is fully effective and representative. The achievement of this objective is absolutely necessary to peace and stability in Northern Ireland and is a crucial part of the implementation of the Agreement as a whole.</P>
    <P>It is also in everyone's interest that the criminal justice system delivers a fair and impartial service, is responsive to the needs and concerns of communities, and has the confidence to deliver an efficient and effective service.</P>
    <P>With regard to rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity, incorporation of the EHCR into British and Irish domestic law will take effect from October 2000. This will require legislation in this jurisdiction. As Deputies will be aware, the Human Rights Commission Bill is before this House and the Irish Commission on Human Rights will be established in July 2000, so that the Joint Committee of both Human Rights Commissions required under the Agreement will therefore be established by the end of July 2000. The British Government will ratify the Council of Europe Charter on Regional or Minority Languages by September 2000 and significant measures relating to the Irish language will also be taken.</P>
    <P>Following last Friday and Saturday's statements, it is up to all of us to ensure that the resto<Col N="1384" /> ration of all of the institutions provided for in the Agreement becomes a reality. I would call on the pro-Agreement parties to respond positively to recent developments. I welcome the positive reactions we have already seen, even if tinged with caution in some cases. I would also urge all those in civic society, who have done so much to support the process from the start, to once again lend their support. Some have already done so. I welcome in particular the statements by the two Primates and by the Group of 7 in Northern Ireland. We have a unique opportunity to pursue democratic politics constructively, for the betterment of everyone on this island and on these islands. We have the opportunity to build trust between parties and between communities. We have the opportunity to work together for the sake of all our futures. The alternative would not bring about a better situation for anyone but those who seek a return to confrontation and mutual distrust. And it is only in that atmosphere that extremism and violence can flourish.</P>
    <P>I would like here to pay tribute to all of those who have worked so hard in recent weeks. Prime Minister Blair, Secretary of State Mandelson, my colleagues, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Brian Cowen, the Attorney-General, and Minister of State O'Donnell, all of the pro-Agreement parties and officials of both Governments, who worked tirelessly and intensively on this process. I would likewise like to pay tribute to the smaller parties, the Alliance Party, the Women's Coalition and the PUP and UDP for their constructive contributions. I would also like to thank Deputies in this House for their assistance. Once again President Clinton and his Administration have been unstinting in their support, including through the issuing of statements after the Government's statement last Friday and the IRA statement last Saturday.</P>
    <P>The result of all of our efforts is that people have moved and we have made hugely significant progress. The story of this process to date has been one of historic achievement and periods of profound frustration. I believe that we are now in a position to move to a new phase of political stability and steady economic and social progress within a framework that can deliver true equality. The constitutional and institutional issues are agreed. The process of change is actively under way. We must all seize the opportunity and build the future together.</P>
    <P>Apart from the ongoing formal and informal contacts with political representatives, the Government endeavour to keep in touch with the broadest possible spectrum of opinion in Northern Ireland.  In this regard, I and my office continue to avail of the good services of individual clergy and community leaders to help further the cause of peace, stability and reconciliation.  They have an important role to play and I have always valued their support, as on this occasion. However, I have not had any formal meetings with Church leaders recently.</P>
    <P>On 13 April the Minister for Justice, Equality <Col N="1385" /> and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, in reply to Priority Questions, said that the Garda Commissioner had asked a senior officer to investigate the allegations that had been made about gardaí in relation to a number of murders. I replied to the letter I received from David Trimble on the matter on 14 April and I conveyed this information to him.</P>

The Government has agreed in principle to the recommendations of the group.</P>
      <P>The establishment of an office of solicitor to the DPP and the transfer of functions from the criminal division of the Chief State Solicitor's office to the new office has taken some time because of detailed and ongoing negotiations between the official side and the union side in relation to staffing and resources. It is hoped that those negotiations will reach finality in the near future.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 to 48, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I last briefed the Dáil on progress under the strategic management initiative in October 1999. At that time I referred to the launch last July of the next phase of the SMI, and to the specific initiatives which were designed to improve the functioning of the civil service and its capacity to deliver high-quality services effectively.</P>
      <P>I am circulating a table to Deputies on the progress on various elements of the SMI. I am looking forward to continuing further early progress on the individual initiatives.</P>
      <P>The agreement of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, with its focus on public service modernisation, will facilitate the speedy implementation of the framework for public service modernisation, with a particular emphasis on developing a sectoral approach. Strategies for the civil service; and the education, health and local authority sectors are set out in detail. The programme also makes a specific link between the achievement of performance indicators relating to the modernisation programme and the payment of the final 4% of the pay agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the specific issue of regulatory reform, the following are the main developments. In July 1999 the Government published Reducing Red Tape &ndash; An Action Programme of Regulatory Reform in Ireland. Among other things, the action programme required each Department and office to consult with customers and other interested parties as to the priorities for regulatory reform. Based on those consultations, each Department and office has now listed the relevant legislation, both primary and secondary, and the regulatory reform unit and the statute law revision unit in the Office of the Attorney General have been working closely to establish priorities for a work programme of consolidation, revision, repeal or restatement, as appropriate. Consultation with Departments and offices on this programme is ongoing. When completed, the work programme will be submitted by me to Government for its approval. The Attorney General has made proposals for the enactment of legislation which will empower the Attorney General to prepare versions of Acts of the Oireachtas, to be known as restatements, in a more readable form without altering the substance of the legislation and, accordingly, will not <Col N="1387" /> require the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas. The aim of this proposal is to make statute law more accessible and readable. It is expected that the Bill will be brought before the Oireachtas as soon as possible. Finally, the OECD are undertaking a country review of regu<Col N="1388" /> latory reform in Ireland, which will be completed early next year.</P>
    <P>These initiatives demonstrate the Government's ongoing commitment to making it easier, where possible, to do business with Government, and to make legislation more coherent and accessible.</P>

      <P>The former Chief Justice, Mr. Liam Hamilton, began his work at the end of January. He is the sole member of the independent commission of inquiry into the Dublin, Monaghan and Dundalk bombings. I have made clear that, if the former Chief Justice requires any additional resources or support, these will be provided. Detailed terms of reference in regard to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings were agreed with the former Chief Justice and with the Justice for the Forgotten group representing the injured and bereaved relatives some time ago. Mr. Hamilton is engaged in his examination of these bombings.</P>
      <P>While it had been hoped the former Chief Justice would have been able to submit his report on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings before the summer break, it is understood that this will not now be possible, although it is hoped that the report will be available in September. Discussions between the relevant Departments and offices on the detailed terms of reference for the examination of the Dundalk bombing are close to finalisation, following which they will be the subject of consultation with the legal representatives of the victims' relatives and with Mr. Hamilton.</P>
      <P>As regards the specific case raised by the Deputy, I have received a number of representations to hold a public inquiry. However, the best way forward is for the Government to extend the remit of Mr. Hamilton to this case on a basis broadly similar to that which applies in the case of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. In this regard, discussions between the Departments and offices concerned on the detailed terms of reference are close to a conclusion, following which proposals will be put to Government. If approved by the Government, the proposed terms will be the subject of consultation with Mr. Hamilton and the legal representatives of the victims' relatives.</P>
      <P>I have also received representations seeking different forms of examination of other cases of concern referred to in the report of the Victims Commission, such as the earlier Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the Castleblaney bombing of 1976 and a fatal shooting at the bridge between Lifford and Strabane in 1971. Commissioner Wilson's report, while not recommending that these cases should be the subject of a formal inquiry, did recommend that &ldquo;the Government, taking heed of the need to preserve the confidentiality and safety of information, should, on request from the families of victims, produce reports on the investigations of murders arising from the conflict over the last 30 years where no one has been made amenable.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will shortly make a submission to Government on the report of the Victims Com<Col N="1390" /> mission, and this will take account of the report's recommendation in relation to these other cases.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>The approved staffing levels in the Office of the Attorney General are set out in the following table which will be circulated in the Official Report. The vacancies are to be filled by means of open competition through the Civil Service Commission. The arrangements for a senior draftsman recruitment competition are being made.</P>
      <P>The vacancies in the administration category are at clerical level. Assignment has already been received for four of these vacancies. In addition, the office uses contract staff for a number of specialist positions, including library, drafting, indexing and typing. The office is in discussion with the Department of Finance and expects to increase its numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that there are difficulties in <Col N="1392" /> accessing the Statute Book on the website of the Office of the Attorney General. I understand the problem is being addressed by the office.</P>
    <P>The existing service on the website is the Acts of the Oireachtas 1922-97 only, and is an interim solution which was put in place at the beginning of 1999. The Office of the Attorney General is making the arrangements to have the Statute Book 1922-98, comprising Acts, statutory instruments and chronological tables, available on the website. One of the reasons for the existing difficulties is that the service uses the same software as the version of the Statute Book published on CD-ROM at the end of 1998. The software used to publish the Statute Book had been optimised for use on CD-ROM. Another difficulty is that the current service is hosted in South Africa, the base of the company which originally carried out the project.</P>
    <P>Following a review of the issues involved and a subsequent tendering exercise, the office recently selected a company to carry out required enhancements and updates to the website facility. This will comprise making the latest electronic version of the Statute Book available on the web, that is, Acts of the Oireachtas, statutory instruments and the chronological tables to the statutes 1922-98, and improving the design and search capabilities of the service. In addition, the service will be implemented in a format more suitable for use on the Internet and will be hosted in Ireland. The approximate duration of the project is four months.</P>

      <P>An error was made in decomposing the January 2000 provisional retail sales index increase published on 31 March into its price and volume components which resulted in the implied annual price change in the retail sector being too low. An inadvertent error was involved, not one of a methodological nature. This was identified in the calculation of the final detailed retail sales index for January 2000 and a correction was issued by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, on 11 April 2000. Procedures have been put in place to ensure this error is not repeated.</P>
      <P>I am fully satisfied with the procedures in place in the CSO to ensure reliable and timely statistics are made available to users and I commend the CSO on its longstanding policy of publicly correcting any errors identified in the statistics it publishes.</P>

      <P>My introductory meeting with Commissioner Fischler on 28 March was constructive and wide-ranging. I outlined to the Commissioner my immediate and longer-term priorities for fisheries and forestry. The key areas discussed were: the need for transparency and a level playing field in fisheries control and enforcement across all member states; the conservation imperative and the need for enhanced technical conservation measures to protect juvenile fish and fish stocks generally; the case for radical reform of the Common Fisheries Policy to reflect, <i>inter alia,</i> the rapidly changing market and technological environment; the need, on conservation grounds, for early practical progress on a programme for observers on larger vessels in the EU pelagic fleet; the need for a tough stance by the European Union on behalf of Ireland and other member states in the north east Atlantic blue whiting negotiations; and in relation to forestry; the case for increases in afforestation premium levels for pre-2000 planting; and the eligibility of Coillte Teoranta for premium payments.</P>
      <P>As a first meeting I found the discussions useful. I intend to have further bilateral meetings with Commissioner Fischler on a regular basis to ensure the critical issues for Ireland in fisheries and forestry are highlighted and progressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The gas field off County Mayo, the Corrib Field, has not yet been declared commercial; further appraisal drilling is being undertaken and Enterprise Oil hopes to be in a position to decide on commerciality in December this year.</P>
      <P>The final decision as to whether the field is commercial will depend on factors such as the volumes of gas in place, the quality of the reservoir, the quality of the gas, the flow rate of wells, market availability and price and the cost of development. Calculation of the size of the gas accumulation is too imprecise at this stage based on data currently available but this will be known with more precision once the accumulation has been fully appraised.</P>
      <P>Should the results of this appraisal drilling enable the company to establish that the field is commercial then it will be the duty of Enterprise Oil to apply to me forthwith for a petroleum lease and subsequently, a plan of development with a view to its development. Should the field be declared commercial my understanding from the company is that it would be its intention to have the gas in production by mid-2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plan of development mentioned above will <Col N="1395" /> contain details on the design, siting, construction, establishment, operation, abandonment and removal of facilities, including the export pipeline from the field to the onshore terminal, for the production, processing, storage or shipment of gas produced. Any transmission pipeline downstream of the onshore terminal does not form part of the development and is, therefore, not subject to my approval, being a matter for the Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>
    <P>Pending completion of the appraisal programme no decision has been taken on an upstream pipeline location. However, it is understood that Enterprise Oil is considering a number of different possible pipeline routes and landfall locations. Initial route surveys have been conducted over several possible routes and more are planned for this year.</P>
    <P>I note BGE's recent announcement of extending the national grid from Dublin to Galway and Ennis and it is likely that this could have an influence on decisions by the Corrib licensees regarding the marketing of the gas. Responsibility for the national gas grid is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may wish to note that in the 2025 report published recently by Bord Gáis, in regard to ways in which expected demand will be met after 2004, the Corrib gas accumulation was identified as one of the three preferred supply options to be considered further. The other two options identified were the duplication of the existing Scotland-Ireland interconnector and the construction of a gas pipeline from Scotland through Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to this matter is as was outlined to the House on several occasions by my predecessor, Deputy Woods, and more recently by me on 10 February last. Briefly, my colleagues and I in Government would prefer if these shipments did not take place. The sensitivities of the Government and public to the use of the Irish Sea generally for the transport of the materials mentioned by the Deputy to and from Sellafield have been made known on many occasions to the UK authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious of the fact that they are, however, for the present, a reality. My main concerns regarding any transport of this nature are to ensure the vessels do not pass through waters under our jurisdiction. I have assurances from the UK authorities that they will not. The UK auth<Col N="1396" /> orities have also stressed that voyages by such vessels through waters solely under UK jurisdiction are kept to a minimum and are already limited to one or two per year; and to ensure the highest possible levels of safety are applied both in terms of the vessels employed and the operational requirements applied to them.</P>
    <P>As Minister, I have to accept that the vessels transporting these materials may be involved in an accident arising from hazards of navigation or from occurrences such as workplace accidents which will require assistance from Ireland's emergency services. In this connection, the Irish Coastguard, in co-operation with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, in recent months engaged in a communications exercise on board one of these vessels. The aim of the exercise was to ensure the limited shipments that do take place are as safe as possible and there are no adverse effects on the environment. Arrangements have also been made with both the United Kingdom and France that Ireland will be notified in advance of shipment dates, the nature of cargoes and all other relevant details.</P>

      <P>Following my appointment last month of the full membership of the National Salmon Commission, I moved immediately to consult the new body on the introduction of tagging of all angling and commercially caught wild salmon. At its inaugural meeting the commission agreed the publication on 14 April of the draft salmon tagging regulations which I had presented to it for its consideration and advice. The publication, nationwide, of my notice of intent to make the regulations triggered a 30 day statutory period for public consultations. It has also enabled detailed consideration by the commission of the mechanics and timeframe for full implementation of tagging of rod and net caught salmon. The consultative period is designed to ensure all interested parties have an opportunity to make known their views. The commission will make its recommendations to me on the regulations and the introduction of the scheme at the end of the statutory period on 13 May. Those recommendations will be fully informed by the public consultation process and the advice to the commission from the central and regional fisheries board and the Marine Institute. They will also reflect the commission's comprehensive analysis of all the complex issues involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By inviting the commission to address tagging as its first priority, my objective was to bring the <Col N="1397" /> discussion and planning phase to the point of decision and having decided, to fully gear up for implementation. We are now at the point of decision.</P>
    <P>Salmon tagging, backed up by the national fish counter programme, will enable us to quantify our salmon in a new way. The real time conservation and management which will flow from the system will pay major dividends for anglers and commercial salmon interests but above all for the national salmon resource itself. I look forward to receiving the advice of the commission which I hope will position us to move ahead.</P>

      <P>On Sunday, 25 July 1999, an unidentified vessel was in collision with the Irish fishing vessels <i>mv Renegade</i> in the Irish Sea, outside our territorial waters. The unidentified vessel which was heading on a southerly course did not stop after the incident. The <i>mv Renegade</i> was holed as a result of the collision and took water in the engine room. Pumps were put on board by the emergency services and these were used to lower the water level in the engine room and enable the vessel to reach port.</P>
      <P>An investigation into this collision is being carried out under section 728 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, by a surveyor from the marine survey office of my Department and various lines of inquiry are being followed to try to establish the identity of the merchant vessel which collided with the <i>mv Renegade. </i> It is a basic tenet of maritime law that the flag state is responsible for the regulation of its vessels' behaviour in international waters. I am advised by the chief surveyor from the marine survey office that the flag state of a vessel suspected of being the other vessels involved in the incident has been contacted with details of the collision and requested to provide assistance to the marine survey office in its investigation. While some information has been forthcoming from the flag state concerned as a result of this contact, further information is awaited which it is hoped will establish beyond doubt the identity of the vessel which collided with the <i>mv Renegade</i>.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is intended that my Department's investigation into this collision will be completed once all relevant information has been received from the flag state which has been contacted in the matter. While I do not wish to prejudge the findings of the investigation, should it succeed in establishing the identity of the vessel involved, I will act immediately to take up the matter for<Col N="1398" /> mally with the relevant flag state Administration and to request that appropriate action be taken against this vessel in accordance with that Administration's responsibilities under international maritime agreements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 154 together.</P>
      <P>Offshore petroleum exploration activity continues with 22 exploration licences in place covering 118 blocks or part blocks. In addition, there are six offshore licensing options and two leases in place. Applications for two further licensing options and one lease undertaking are under consideration in my Department.</P>
      <P>As I said in my reply of 22 March last to another question from the Deputy, a plan of development for the south west lobe of the Kinsale Head gas field was approved last year and the field was brought into production in October. I also mentioned that there are important developments taking place in relation to two other hydrocarbon accumulations in our offshore, the Corrib gas accumulation and the Helvick oil field.</P>
      <P>The present position in relation to the Corrib field is that the licensees commenced drilling a third appraisal well last month on completion of which they intend to drill a further well. They hope to be in a position to decide whether the gas find is commercial in December next. The final decision as to whether the field is commercial will depend on factors such as the volumes of gas in place, the quality of the reservoir, the quality of the gas, the flow rate of wells, market availability and price and the cost of development of the field.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Oil is reported as saying that the field might contain more than one trillion cubic feet of gas-in-place. However, it is too early at this stage to give a precise figure for the size of the gas accumulation and the licensees will not be in a position to do so until they have fully evaluated the discovery. Should the results of their appraisal programme show that the gas can be commercially produced it will be necessary for the licensees to apply to me for a petroleum lease and submit a plan of development for the field for my approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1399" /> In regard to the Helvick oil field, a number of estimates of recoverable oil and gas have been made. However, it is generally accepted that the amount is less than ten million barrels of oil and six billion cubic feet of gas. The Helvick oil field is held under a petroleum lease by Providence Resources which has declared the field commercial. A detailed plan of development for the field was due to be submitted to me for approval by the end of April this year. Following recent discussions between officials of my Department and the licensees, submission of the plan of development has now been deferred until later this year.</P>

      <P>Ballycotton Harbour is owned by Cork County Council. The county council is, therefore, responsible for its maintenance or development of the harbour's facilities and it is a matter for it, in the first instance, to determine what works may be required at the harbour.</P>
      <P>Comprehensive development proposals for the harbour were put to my Department last year by the Ballycotton Development Association.

      <P>The question of grant aid for the major development envisaged will be addressed in the context of the overall needs of harbours generally, the relative priority of such works and the funding available for them. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that funding has already been made available for repairs to the breakwater, and that further moneys are being provided in the current year for the completion of those works.</P>

      <P>My Department has maintained an ongoing close dialogue with the Irish fishermen's organisations concerning the negotiations on the allocation of the blue whiting stock in the north east Atlantic. My Department has brief the industry on the outcome of the recent negotiations in the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission and in the coastal states group and on the forthcoming resumption of negotiations in June.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the views of our fishermen's organisations on the current blue whiting negotiations. This is an issue of paramount importance to our pelagic sector. The European Commission is leading the negotiations on behalf of the European Union and my Department has taken a very active lead in the formulation of a robust EU position on the issue and has worked to ensure other key member states support our strong line. I have also written to and spoken with Commissioner Fischler to underline the imperative of a tough line by the Commission's negotiating team. The commissioner has confirmed that a strong EU stance is needed in these complex and difficult negotiations.</P>
      <P>The NEAFC has agreed that a two pillar model of staged co-operation will drive the process. The first pillar will seek to reach agreement on the allocation and management of blue whiting stocks in the waters of the coastal states, including Norway and the European Union. The second pillar will involve negotiations on the allocation and management of stocks in international waters. The European Union has had a series of discussions with Norway, in which the Irish representatives have been involved, as part of the coastal states group negotiations.</P>
      <P>We will continue to highlight the interests of Irish fishermen in the framework of these negotiations and to press the Commission to ensure EU interests are protected.</P>
      <P>The task of reaching agreement on this contentious issue will not be an easy one. Current blue whiting catches exceed one million tonnes. The scientists advise that in the medium to long-term catches should not exceed 650,000 tonnes. There are fundamental differences between the parties concerned which featured prominently at the last working group meeting in April of the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission. A further meeting of the Coastal States Group will take place on 14 and 15 June which will try to reach agreement on the first pillar. Any agreement reached will be submitted to the NEAFC in November where it is expected that overall allocations will be decided for next year.</P>

      <P>Following Council agreement, at Ireland's behest, last November to include specific provisions to support young fishermen within the new fisheries structural funding framework, 2000-06, the national investment support for the seafood sector under the national development plan will incorporate a scheme to encourage young fishermen under 35 to invest in the industry and operate safe modern vessels. The details of the scheme are being finalised by the Department and BIM, as part of the current process of finalising and agreeing with the Commission over the coming months the operational programmes under the NDP generally.</P>
      <P>The scheme, in essence, provides for the payment of premia to support vessel purchase to fishermen under 35 years, who can, <i>inter alia</i>, demonstrate that they have worked at least five years as fishermen or have equivalent vocational training.</P>

      <P>My Department is in the process of assessing applications to participate in the albacore tuna driftnet fishery this year and will submit recommendations for my decision shortly.</P>
      <P>The number of driftnet licences is determined by the parameters set in EU Council Regulation 1239/98 which provides for the ban on driftnets end 2001 and which specifically limits the number of vessels that my participate in the tuna driftnet fishery to 60% of the number of fishing vessels which used driftnets during the reference period 1995-97. Another critical parameter is the recommendation by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas which limits the size of EU and other contracting parties' albacore tuna fishing fleets. Based on these parameters and from a preliminary analysis of information available to my Department, it is envisaged that the issuing of tuna driftnet authorisations to up to 18 vessels will be possible this year.</P>
      <P>In working to finalise arrangements for the tuna driftnet fishery this year, my Department has consulted in detail with representative organisations of the fishing industry and held an all day meeting in Cork on 14 April, which was attended by a wide range of interested parties, including representative organisations and individual fishermen, and which comprehensively covered all the issues and challenges for the tuna fishery in 2000 and future years. I have also discussed the issue with a number of fishermen's organisations and individual fishermen.</P>

      <P>A vessel may not engage in sea fishing unless it has been licensed in accordance with section 222B, as amended, of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959. The Department has no evidence that vessels without entitlements to beam trawl are so doing. If the Deputy has evidence of such activities, the Department would be glad to investigate.</P>
      <P>As I advised in my reply to the Deputy's Question No. 92 of 4 April 2000, there are a number of vessels in the polyvalent segment of the fishing fleet which are not precluded by the terms of their sea fishing boat licences from fishing by means of beam trawls, or which are permitted to engage in beam trawling for a proportion of their fishing time.</P>
      <P>Complaints have been received by my Department from fishermen using other types of gear about alleged damage to fishing grounds caused by vessels which engage in beam trawling. These criticisms are not accepted, however, by representatives of the beam trawling sector.</P>
      <P>To build better co-operation and consultation between fishermen using different types of gear in shared fisheries my Department has encouraged meetings between beam trawler owners and other fishermen. We will facilitate further discussions, with a view to assisting both groups to achieve a common understanding on issues of mutual interest and concern.</P>

      <P>The designation of waters as salmonid or otherwise is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local <Col N="1403" /> Government, under the EU Council directive on the quality of fresh water needing protection or improvement in order to support fish life, 78/659/EEC. Under the directive, higher water quality standards are set for salmonid waters than for other waters.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Regional Fisheries Board requested the Department of the Environment and Local Government to designate the River Fane as a salmonid river in 1997 and I have therefore asked my Department to consult urgently with the Department of the Environment and Local Government with a view to progressing the fisheries board's request in light of our concerns about the declining state of salmon stocks in the River Fane and the timeframe and actions envisaged to achieve the necessary water quality standards under the directive. The Eastern Regional Fisheries Board has also informed me that the reported salmon catch in the River Fane dropped dramatically last year from 480 in 1998 to 60 in 1999. The reported catch in the River Fane over the last five years as supplied by the board is as follows:</P>

      <P>As I outlined in my replies to similar questions raised in the House on 10 February and 22 March, the study referred to by the Deputy presents empirical data and costs about the number of exploration and appraisal wells drilled offshore Ireland since 1971, and indicates the employment created onshore arising from this expenditure in the past and the potential for such employment in the future. The study draws straightforward conclusions from these levels of past activity. It also puts forward a programme of action which addresses the issue of opportunities for Irish industry in the domestic and international offshore industry. I see the report as a constructive contribution to public discussion on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned in my reply in March, I have met a delegation from the Irish Offshore Operators Association and had a very useful discussion <Col N="1404" /> on how Irish industry could increase its share of goods and services supplied to the offshore exploration sector. I highlighted my expectations that Irish companies should be given full and fair opportunities to compete at all stages of exploration and to bid for work. I also expect that every effort will be made to accommodate smaller suppliers.</P>
    <P>I also mentioned that a seminar on contract awareness for the offshore sector was being organised by my Department in conjunction with the Irish Offshore Operators Association for 14 April in Westport. The seminar brought together the main parties involved in the Irish offshore and enabled Irish companies in the goods and services sector to hear at first hand of the opportunities offered by the offshore sector.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have asked Enterprise Ireland to work closely with the Irish Offshore Operators Association and specific operators to ensure there is early notification of future offshore work to potential Irish participants. I am glad to say that the Irish Offshore Operators Association is committed to fully support these opportunities.</P>
    <P>Given these developments, I see no reason for an independent assessment of the IOOA study or its conclusions.</P>

The first report recommended national investment priorities for the seafood industry, 2000-06, and this was effectively delivered through the Government allocation of funding of £171 million to the seafood sector under the national plan. The second report focused on the need for additional technical conservation measures in order to secure a sustainable future for European fisheries. In fully endorse this report and have conveyed it to Commissioner Fischler who has undertaken to have it examined by his services.

      <P>Applications for foreshore leases to allow the construction of offshore wind farms were made to my Department in late 1988 and early 1999. Development of major commercial projects of this nature and situated on the foreshore away from the land posed a new challenge to my Department. It is also an areas where there is very little international experience. At the time the electricity market in Ireland was not liberalised and legislation to allow for liberalisation was in course of passage through the Oireachtas. The applications were disallowed and applicants were advised that applications for foreshore licences to allow the investigation of the suitability of sites would be accepted and processed but that no foreshore leases for energy generation projects would be issued until after a firm policy framework had been established.</P>
      <P>Discussions took place with the private sector, the Commissioner for Electricity Regulation, who was not at that stage functioning under statute, and with industry and regulators abroad as well as many bodies in both the private and State sector in Ireland in an effort to devise a policy which would maximise the opportunities for development of green electricity production, minimise interference with other users of the foreshore, protect the marine environment and maximise the return to the State from the use of scarce foreshore resources.</P>
      <P>Following on from these discussions a consultation document entitled Offshore Electricity Generating Stations &ndash; Note for Intending Developers issued on 23 February of this year to more than 150 interested parties. The consultation period expired on 30 March and more than 30 submissions were received from interested parties.</P>
      <P>The observations received are currently being examined in my Department. There will also be further discussions with the Commission for Electricity Regulation to ensure that the administration of the Foreshore Acts in the context of offshore electricity generation is in harmony with the administration of the Electricity Regulation Act.</P>
      <P>I expect to be in a position to agree a policy document next month and to consider recommendations for the issue of foreshore licences immediately thereafter. I confirm that an environmental impact statement will be required for every offshore electricity generation project as part and parcel of the foreshore lease application. The public will be given the opportunity to consider and comment on every such application before I make a decision on the application.</P>

      <P>The report of the Irish emergency towing vessel study was published in January of this year. One of the three recommendations of the study was that an ETV should be deployed in Ireland to empower the State to pro-actively protect its coast and all maritime activities in the Irish pollution responsibility zone in accordance with the provisions of the intervention convention. Among its functions would be the conservation of ecologically sensitive areas, protection of amenities and marine economic activities, reduction of pollution costs and enhancement of search and rescue activities. The report stated that the most cost-effective method of deploying an ETV would be a dual function vessel having a secondary role in fisheries protection.</P>
      <P>I can assure the House that I am giving particular attention to this report and its recommendations. The economic, human and environmental costs of a major oil pollution incident off our coasts are incalculable. If we can put in place on a reasonable cost benefit basis the infrastructure to prevent such an occurrence, rather than do so after such an event, it is my strong view that we should do so. It is my intention to seek approval in principle before the end of this month from the Government for the securing of an ETV capability.</P>

      <P>In the published review of the seaports in the Shannon Estuary the consultants recommended that the location of the headquarters of the new single port company would be a matter for the new executive but that operational management should be located at Foynes while Limerick should house the administrative and commercial responsibilities.</P>
      <P>My view as a shareholder was that a speedy determination was needed as to where the headquarters and executive location for the new port company should be. The reality is that out of the combined business of the two companies the facilities over which the most business influence can be exerted by the new single port company is at Foynes. Also, the thrust of Government policy is away from centralisation in the major towns and cities. I explained this fully to the boards and management of the two port companies when I visited them recently.</P>

      <P>On 3 March 1997, Dublin Port Company was corporatised and since then has been statutorily responsible under the Harbours Act, 1996, for the management, control, direction and development of the harbour as a commercial State company. Freeing up the port from direct State control gave it the commercial freedom needed to operate as a modern, customer oriented service industry, while enhancing accountability for operation and financial performance.</P>
      <P>Dublin Port is a multi-modal port catering for all cargo modes, as well as for passengers. In terms of capacity, Dublin port had a record throughput in 1999 of 15 million tonnes (net), which was an increase of 15% on the 1998 figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To determine the needs of the ports industry my Department commissioned independent consultants in 1998 to complete an EU funded national seaport capacity study. The study is a significant tool in ensuring the development and maintenance of adequate infrastructural capacity at strategic Irish ports to cope with economic growth and to underpin future development plans to deliver that capacity and has identified requirements up to 2007. The study had determined that throughput at Dublin Port would be 14.4 million tonnes in 1999 against traffic projections for 2007 of 22.2 million tonnes. Given that the throughput at Dublin Port, along with that at other ports, has been exceeding the projects, my Department <Col N="1413" /> determined the need to update the study. In this regard, consultants have recently been commissioned to update the study and this is currently under way.</P>
    <P>Based on the examination of the port industries' importance to the economy and of its development needs over the period to 2007, I am aware that a substantial investment programme for ports is required. This programme will comprise a number of complementary measures which will seek to maximise the use of existing facilities and infrastructure, and ensure sufficient new infrastructure is added as demand grows. Dublin Port has identified its investment requirement and this is being considered for co-financing in the context of available funds under the National Development Plan 2000-06 and the capacity of the port, and possibly port users, to fund such new infrastructure as well as the cost of existing facilities.</P>

These will be tabled at the June Fisheries Council and I will seek the support of EU colleagues for a workable package of Irish Sea conservation measures acceptable to the fishing industry.</P>
      <P>The Commission also agreed at my request to progress with the relevant member states, a pilot programme for observers on large pelagic boats to address the problem of discards and grading. The Commission will convene a meeting of those involved to advance the issue.</P>
      <P>Ireland will continue to be the fore at EU level in pressing the conservation imperative together with the need for transparent and consistent enforcement across member states, in the interests of fish stocks and the industry.</P>

      <P>I had a very useful first discussion with Commissioner Fischler on the 2002 review of the common fisheries policy on 28 March last and I intend to have further regular discussions with him on progressing our current CFP priorities in conservation and control, as well as the prospects for change in the review itself.</P>
      <P>I made clear to him my view that the CFP review should be seen as an opportunity to deliver much needed reform and overhaul to reflect the radically changing context in which the CFP must operate. I pointed out that, since the last review of the CFP in 1992, there have been fundamental global changes in markets, fishery management regimes and in technology which need to be reflected in the CFP. Commissioner Fischler confirmed that he is attaching a very high priority to the forthcoming review and his services are currently undertaking a comprehensive analysis which will result in the publication, by the Commission of its own report at the beginning of next year for council's consideration.</P>
      <P>I also briefed the Commissioner on the national CFP strategy review group in which he expressed interest. We have facilitated a meeting between the review group and the EU Commission in Dublin next week, which will be an excellent opportunity to highlight the key strategic issues, as the group sees them, directly to the Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>An assessment of offshore oil and gas developments since 1992 has not yet been completed. A preliminary examination shows that four frontier licensing rounds have been held since 1992. In 1994, five licences were issued, two of which have since been relinquished. In 1995, eight licences were issued, five of which have since been relinquished. In 1997, 11 licences were issued and in 1999 two licences were issued. In addition, ten other licences were issued under the open door system between 1992 and 1997, of which seven have subsequently been relinquished. In total, 36 exploration licences have been granted since 1992, of which 26 were frontier licences. A total of 14 of those licences have been relinquished, including seven of the frontier licences.</P>
      <P>As I outlined in my replies to questions raised in the House on 10 February and 22 March last, the present licensing terms and financial and taxation provisions were introduced in 1992 and have been supported by every Government since then. Without these terms there would be little or no exploration off the Irish coast.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there is a body of opinion which believes that our licensing terms are too generous and also believes that there are vast quantities of oil and gas in our offshore about to be exploited by foreign exploration companies with little benefits accruing to Ireland. The reality is that companies are not queuing up at present seeking exploration licences in our offshore.</P>
      <P>It is a stark fact that the prospectivity of our offshore area has been demonstrated, over the period 1971 to date, to be consistently low. It is almost 30 years since Ireland's last commercial find. Although 133 exploration and appraisal wells have been drilled in the Irish offshore since 1971 to date, all undertaken and financed by the exploration companies, there has been limited success, with only the Kinsale-Ballycotton and the Helvick fields being declared commercial. This level of success in making commercial finds does not compare with the UK or the North Sea. In addition, our waters are deep and operating conditions are among the most difficult in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given these facts, the 1992 terms were designed to maintain the competitiveness of the Irish offshore in comparison to other exploration areas. Without exploration there can be no pros<Col N="1417" /> pect of production, which carries with it the best prospects of benefit to the economy. As I have stated previously I will review the terms when and if I consider it necessary, having regard to the overall need not to jeopardise the interest or involvement of oil companies in our offshore areas.</P>

      <P>The year 2000 safety on the water campaign, which I launched on 4 April 2000 is the most intensive campaign to date in trying to get the water safety message across to all those using our waters and sees a concerted co-operative effort on behalf of all major interests in the marine and safety sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main elements of the campaign are as follows. Irish coast guard volunteers will distribute Safety on the Water publications at piers, slipways, fishing tackle shops and caravan parks to target those who may not yet have taken the <Col N="1419" /> safety message on board. A standard safety on the water talk has been devised by the coast guard for interested groups on water safety topics The RNLI's Get Splashed publication is being re-issued and a competition based on it will be run for primary schools. The Irish water safety on the water schools' pack will be publicised again while my Department will also run its annual colouring competition for primary schools which carries a serious safety message. In addition, local radio will broadcast my Department's yearly safety message to the public which will be a hard hitting safety on the water and accident prevention warning.</P>
    <P>Also under this campaign, the RNLI plan a sea check blitz on slipways, targeted mainly as non-regulated boat users, as the leisure boating season gets under way. When a boat has been checked and found to be in order, the owner receives a special sea check sticker for display. I wish the RNLI continued success with this initiative and I encourage all boat owners to avail of this excellent service.</P>
    <P>Finally, The Irish Sailing Association will co-ordinate a campaign for affiliated boat clubs and Irish water safety is conducting courses on learning to swim and lifeguard training as part of the ongoing nationwide water safety campaign. I cannot overemphasise the importance of learning to swim for every child and indeed adult in the country as a basic water safety measure.</P>
    <P>With reference to the issue of safety on leisure craft, as the Deputy is aware, the action group on small powered recreational craft, including personal watercraft, recently presented me with its final report. On the basis of this, I am currently proposing the introduction of a legislative framework for the regulation of recreational craft, be they commercial concerns or purely pleasure craft. This is being achieved through amendments to the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, which are included in the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Bill, 1999. The select committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine is currently scheduled to examine this at its session on 16 May. Following on the enactment of this piece of legislation, I hope to quickly introduce implementing regulations based on the recommendations of the action group's final report.</P>

      <P>Thirty nine fish kills were reported to my Department in 1999. Five fish kills have <Col N="1420" /> been reported to date in 2000. The comparable figures for 1997 and 1998 are 42 and 39, respectively. The state of fish stocks is a key barometer of water quality in our rivers and lakes. Fish kills are among the most dramatic and damaging impacts of pollution, usually arising from unauthorised or accidental discharges of high strength wastes.</P>
      <P>I welcome the recently published report of the Environmental Protection Agency on Ireland's environment. The report includes a comprehensive overview of the water quality status of river and lake systems as well as an assessment of fish stocks and outlines the remedial and management strategies under way to tackle eutrophication and pollution threats. The report acknowledges the critical role of the central and regional fisheries boards working with all relevant agencies and sectoral interests in pollution prevention, reduction and detection, as well as enforcing water pollution legislation and prosecuting offenders. In terms of fish kill levels, while improvements have been achieved, particularly in relation to tackling pollution problems in the agricultural sector, there is no room for complacency as is outlined by the fish kill incidents of recent days.</P>
      <P>Our conservation and development objectives for inland fisheries crucially depend on water quality of rivers and lakes. The fisheries boards, angling clubs and organisations have a major role to play in water quality and pollution prevention strategies at national and catchment level, working with the relevant State agencies, local authorities and the sectors. The new structures membership and overall framework for the boards positions them very well to drive the inland fisheries agenda on water quality. I have asked my Department and the central and regional fisheries boards to give particular priority to water quality initiatives, including raising the profile of the Inland Fisheries Environmental Forum on Water Quality, and supporting the catchment management approach. I have also asked my Department to develop a structured liaison on water quality issues at senior official level with the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development as well as the EPA.</P>
      <P>The national development plan provides for investment of over £2 billion in water and waste water strategies up to 2006. I will be working with my colleague the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to ensure that water quality programme and strategies for river and lake catchments fully reflect the fisheries perspective. For our part, the Department, the fisheries boards and all inland fisheries interests will work together closely to address water quality as the major priority for the resource.</P>

      <P>Phase one of the Bray coastal protection scheme, consisting of the construction of <Col N="1422" /> a groyne and breakwater, was completed last year, and phase three, which comprises repairs to the harbour wall, will be finished this year. Further works are required, however, to provide essential protection for the promenade and seafront, in the interests of public safety and the infrastructure itself.</P>
      <P>The nature of phase two works to be undertaken is primarily a matter for Bray Urban District Council and my Department's role is one of providing technical advice, project management services and financial assistance. I understand that this matter has been considered in considerable detail by the local authority, drawing on, <i>inter alia, </i>technical evaluations of alternatives commissioned by my predecessor. The urban district council's decision was that phase two should proceed in the form of a beach nourishment scheme.</P>
      <P>Funding has been provided in the coastal protection programme for 2000 for the phase two works at Bray and the urban district council has confirmed to my Department that it is in a position to provide the necessary local contribution. Preparation of tender documents for the works is now under way in my Department.</P>

      <P>While I am aware of reports of increases in drink prices from CSO press releases, media reports, etc., specific detailed information in relation to price increases is not available to my Department. Since the 1980s the policy of successive Governments has been to promote greater competition and consumer choice, including through the mechanism of greater price transparency, rather than through statutory price control.</P>
      <P>Last August, I made an order entitled the Retail Price (Beverages in Licensed Premises) Display Order, 1999, which requires publicans to display certain prices immediately outside or immediately inside their premises. I believe that consumers must be given fair warning of the prices being charged before they enter a pub so that they can take their custom elsewhere if they believe those prices to be unreasonably high.</P>
      <P>The Retail Price (Beverages in Licensed Premises) Display Order is enforced by the Director of Consumer Affairs. In that regard, I understand that a systematic enforcement operation is under way in relation to the order and that a number of publicans have received final warnings regarding their non-compliance with the order, in advance of a final inspection to determine whether prosecutions should be initiated.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1427" /> The part-time integration option is aimed at persons who are unemployed and in receipt of a payment in respect of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, qualified adults, one parent family payment or widows-widowers pension for a minimum period of 12 months. Persons in receipt of a disability payment who obtain approval from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to engage in employment of a rehabilitative nature can also participate in the programme.</P>
    <P>The eligibility age for participation in this CE option was raised from 21 years to 25 years on 1 January 2000 with the following exceptions: travellers, ex-offenders, refugees, people with disabilities, people referred under drugs task force, offshore island inhabitants, 18-24 year olds referred through EAP who are 18 months or more unemployed.</P>
    <P>Participants remain on this programme for a period of one year. A limited number of people can remain for a second year in circumstances where it will facilitate their progression to employment.</P>
    <P>The part-time job option/rate for the job is targeted at persons who need a longer programme in order to become job ready. Participants must be 35 or over and three years unemployed and in receipt of the payments stated previously. The participant can remain on this option for a period up to three years.</P>
    <P>Other changes to the programme which are part of the restructuring process include the duration of participant breaks between schemes has been increased from six to 12 months, and future participation in CE by an individual will be capped at three years. An individual's previous participation on the programme will not be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Offshore island residents are exempt from these changes which took effect from April 2000.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to implement the phased reduction in the participation levels on CE which has a target participation rate of 28,000 by the end of 2003.</P>
    <P>A special working group will be established shortly to consider issues relating to the future funding of essential services currently provided under CE as required under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The findings of this group will be considered by Government at the appropriate time.</P>

      <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, is the principal legislation dealing with workplace health and safety. Under the 1989 Act, the national authority for occupational safety and health, known as the Health and Safety Authority, is the State body charged with overall responsibility for the administration, enforcement and promotion of workplace safety and health. Matters arising from this responsibility are, therefore, a day-to-day function of the authority, as indeed are matters relating to the recruitment of, and assignment of duties to, staff within the authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1429" /> The provisions of the 1989 Act apply to all employers, including the self-employed, and cover all places of work. Under Section 12 of the Act, every employer must prepare a safety statement. This safety statement should be based on an identification of the hazards and an assessment of the risks to safety and health at the place of work to which the safety statement relates. The concept of a safety statement is as applicable to a farm as it is to any other business or place of work. It is essential that farmers assess all the risks, both to themselves individually and to others who may be on the farm, before undertaking farm tasks, and then put in place the necessary safety measures before attempting these tasks. The key to tackling the issue of safety in any workplace centres around the principles of awareness, assessment and prevention, and while inspection activities by the Health and Safety Authority are an vital element in improving workplace safety, they are not the only approach which can or should be taken.</P>
    <P>The Health and Safety Authority will continue to treat safety in the agricultural sector as a high priority throughout 2000. The authority's published programme of work for this year has set a target of over 1,000 inspections in that sector. The authority has also organised a national farm safety awareness week commencing on 19 June 2000.</P>

Matters arising from this responsibility are, therefore, a day-to-day function of the authority.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the authority that the Moate Community College project on farm safety has not yet been finalised. In the authority's published programme of work for 2000 a significant emphasis has been placed on raising health and safety awareness in the farming sector. Aside from the farm inspection programme, where it is planned to carry out over 1,000 farm inspections during the course of the year, a major national farm safety awareness week will commence on 19 June 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1430" /> The purpose of the farm safety week is to raise awareness of safety issues amongst the farming community. As part of the week's activities inspectors of the authority will carry out 400 farm inspections nationwide. Inspections will focus on the high risk areas, such as child safety on the farm, safe use of tractors and machinery, safe livestock handling and safety statements.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Farm Safety Task Force, established by the Health and Safety Authority in 1996, is working closely with the authority to ensure the success of the awareness campaign. The task force is co-ordinating the various activities planned during the week involving all the farming organisations, Teagasc, the insurance industry, the co-operative movement, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the Department of Education and Science and also both national and local media.</P>
    <P>The authority has informed me that it is confident of a successful outcome to the awareness week which should reflect in a more widespread adoption of accident prevention measures leading to a significant reduction in farm accidents.</P>

    <P>The social economy programme aims to maximise the role of social economy enterprises in the regeneration of local economies within local dis<Col N="1431" /> advantaged areas, communities and communities of interest experiencing disadvantage. The programme will be particularly targeted at disadvantaged communities and long-term unemployed persons.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the social economy programme are to promote the emergence and consolidation of the social economy; to maximise the potential of the social economy to generate employment that is sustainable and of high quality, subject to labour market constraints; to regenerate both urban and rural communities by providing urgently needed local services, employment opportunities and experience for people who have been distanced from the labour market; and to promote equal opportunities between men and women. Three categories of project will be funded under the social economy programme: community businesses, which are ultimately expected to be financed from trading income alone; deficient-demand social enterprises, where the demand for particular goods and services within a community is not matched by resources to pay for these due to disadvantage or low density of population; and enterprises based on public service contracts, where public services in disadvantaged areas and communities are subcontracted to local social economy enterprises.</P>
    <P>The next step is the establishment by FÁS of local working groups to ensure the principle of partnership between statutory bodies, the social partners and local community-voluntary interests. The local working groups will oversee the operation of the social economy programme at local level, including identifying and prioritising areas of social economy activity. Working groups will advise and make recommendations to FÁS on specific funding applications under the social economy programme.</P>
    <P>Community and voluntary groups will be able to apply for funding to establish local social economy enterprises under the programme. Applications will be submitted to the local FÁS Office and will be vetted by the local working group in each area.</P>

      <P>The draft retail planning guidelines, to which the Deputy refers, were issued in April 1999 by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, who has primary responsibility in this area. He invited all interested parties to make submissions to his <Col N="1432" /> Department for consideration before finalisation of the guidelines.</P>
      <P>I understand that a significant number of submissions have been made to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, a small number of which were also copied to my Department for information. I have not met delegations on the subject.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure that the wider economic, social and environmental aspects of the guidelines are fully understood and considered, I agreed with the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, that further analysis would be carried out on the likely impact of the guidelines on competition, prices, consumer choice and the supplier base. To this end, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and my Department have jointly commissioned a study to examine the likely impact of these guidelines on competition within the Irish retail sector, the supply of products to consumers at lower prices, consumer choice and the supplier base.</P>
      <P>The results of this study, which is nearing completion, together with the submissions made by interested parties following publication of the draft guidelines, will help inform the final policy position on retail development to be pursued by the Government via the planning system.</P>

      <P>I understand that my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, has already indicated that he will be undertaking a round of consultations with the representative organisations on the proposals in the agri food 2010 report and that these consultations should not take longer than three months.</P>
      <P>Any proposal to employ a non-European economic area national in the food or agriculture sector would require, in the normal course, the issue of a work permit by my Department. Such permits are usually granted where the employer concerned can demonstrate that he or she has been unable to find an Irish or other EEA national to do the job concerned and where the relevant labour law and immigration requirements are met.</P>
      <P>The provision of training for foreign workers in food safety issues in their own languages is not a matter for my Department. This is the responsibility of employers and is something that should be taken cognisance of when recruiting. I am informed by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland that food safety training for non-nationals in different languages is currently being provided by CERT and by the National Hygiene Partnership. CERT recently launched free induction packs for foreign workers in the food sector in Spanish, French and Italian. The National Hygiene Partnership has produced its &ldquo;Hygiene Matters&rdquo; booklet in Spanish and is hoping to translate it into Mandarin Chinese and Eastern European languages in the near future. The Environmental Health Officers Association currently makes local arrangements to have interpreters present where necessary during the delivery of their hygiene training programmes. They allow extra time during assessments to allow interpreters to translate for non-nationals.</P>

      <P>The £560 million technology foresight fund was established in response to the increasingly important link between technological development and the future competitiveness of Irish based industry. The new fund will be used to establish Ireland as a location for world class research excellence in niche areas within information and communications technologies and biotechnology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1434" /> A dedicated foundation, operating under the aegis of Forfás, is in the process of being established to manage, allocate, disburse and evaluate expenditure from the fund. A high level implementation group has also been established to advise on the arrangements and decisions required to ensure the smooth launch of the foundation. The implementation group will hold its second meeting this week and will report to the Tánaiste and me after it has fully completed its deliberations and work, in about two months.</P>
    <P>Given that the foundation is only in its initial stage of establishment, no applications for funding have been received to date.</P>
    <P>However, the Deputy will wish to be aware that Forfás, with the assistance of the implementation group to which I have already referred, is making appropriate arrangements for a first call for proposals from the fund. These arrangements will be in accordance with accepted best international practice. Applicants will compete for funding and will be assessed by international peer review involving panels of independent experts. The call will provide details of the scale of funding available and the areas to be funded within biotechnology and ICTs.</P>
    <P>A workshop organised by Forfás took place last week to assist in defining the areas which may be funded for the first call. The work-shop was attended by some 130 representatives of the research community in Ireland and abroad and is regarded as having been exceptionally useful. Once the new arrangements are in place it is envisaged that there will be a period of at least two months for submissions of proposals during which the proposed call will be promoted both nationally and internationally.</P>
    <P>The precise allocation to any individual successful proposal will be a matter for the foundation to decide when it has been established. I should point out that the overall objective of the fund is to ensure world class research excellence in the selected niche areas and only proposals which meet the criteria set down by the foundation will be funded.</P>

      <P>The development of the maritime sector is highlighted in the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium, as reviewed in November 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme gives unique recognition to the strategic importance of the shipping industry and commits to establishing a national maritime <Col N="1437" /> college, together with an Irish maritime development office and a national port users forum.</P>
    <P>The commitment to set up the Irish maritime development office was delivered, with the necessary legislation to set that body up on a firm statutory basis being passed last December. For the first time in the State's history the shipping industry and the onshore shipping services sector has its own dedicated development office.</P>
    <P>The Government's purpose in setting up the Irish maritime development office is not just to encourage the growth of the Irish merchant fleet, but also to facilitate the growth in Ireland of a wide range of shipping related services; ship financing, manning, agency, insurance, chartering, brokerage and maritime legal services. This growth will be achieved through the development of existing Irish services and the attraction of such services from abroad.</P>
    <P>A fully costed and developed plan for the establishment of a new national maritime college has been finalised and is in the process of being submitted to Government for determination. This new college, specifically focused on maritime education, will greatly increase the attractiveness of careers at sea and in the shore based maritime sector.</P>
    <P>In terms of moving the industry forward, I am pursuing a structured and inclusive approach following consultations with all the representative bodies and interests in the shipping industry. A range of fiscal reliefs for both seafarers and their employers have been secured in recent years.</P>
    <P>I am continuing to press the case for incentives and fiscal measures beyond those already in place in terms of corporation tax, income tax allowances for seafarers and PRSI refunds to employers. I will also look at the possibilities for modifying the existing reliefs to make them both more attractive and more effective, and my Department is closely monitoring the tonnage tax situation and especially developments on that front in the UK. This is also being factored in to ongoing discussions with the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>A video and brochure were launched in November 1999, to encourage our young people to take up careers at sea and pursue professional educational and training courses in the maritime area. Copies of the video were placed with every career guidance teacher and are available to interested students.</P>
    <P>The shipping sector is well positioned for the future and we can look to it to capture real opportunities and generate new and sustainable jobs.</P>

      <P>Under my Department's coastal protection programme for 2000, I approved the allocation of financial assistance to Mayo County Council for coast protection works at three locations in the county at a total cost of £135,000. County Mayo's coastal protection requirements are being kept under review in the context of overall priorities and the funding available for such works.</P>
      <P>It is essential that best value for money is obtained from the significantly increased funding provided for coastal protection under the national development plan. The programme is being developed and implemented in close co-operation with all relevant interests and I have asked my Department to consult with local authorities on the scope for involving community groups in particular and suitable projects.</P>

      <P>Quota transfers of any species, including blue whiting, between member states are dealt with through bilateral quota swaps between the member states concerned. Under Article 9 of Council Regulation 3760/92, member states may, after notifying the Commission, exchange all or part of their fish quotas with other member states.</P>
      <P>My Department regularly swaps amounts of quota with other member states for key quota species in short supply for the Irish industry. The industry is kept advised of on-going quota swaps which are negotiated to ensure best commercial advantage for the Irish industry. In this context, my Department keeps under review the scope for blue whiting quota swaps with other member states. To date, opportunities for exchanging other quota species for blue whiting have not transpired.</P>

      <P>My Department is fully supportive of objectives contained in the Boyne Valley integrated development plan involving as it does the co-ordinated and integrated management of the development of tourism, heritage and amenity in the Boyne Valley.</P>
      <P>The fisheries interest in the plan is represented by the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board which is an active participant on the management committee which is overseeing the implementation of the plan. The eastern board informs me that it devotes to the river Boyne catchment 25% of its total budget of £300,000 for the improvement and protection of fisheries within its fisheries region. The board also employs a Boyne fishery manager who has the function of promoting the river Boyne as a fishery and the valley as a tourist destination. Included in the specific measures which have been adopted by the eastern board are the production of a river Boyne valley fishery brochure in a number of European languages and the operation, in co-operation with local angling interests, of a one stop shop system for the issue of fishing permits to visiting anglers.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above, under the tourism angling measure for the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999, a total of £202,680, of which £140,516 is European Regional Development Fund funds, was allocated to five public sector projects in the river Boyne catchment. Furthermore, under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 a total of £7 million has been allocated to recreational and tourism angling in the southern and eastern regions, and the detailed arrangements for the expenditure of this funding will be finalised for approval by the European Commission in the coming months.</P>

      <P>A sea fishing boat licence granted under section 222B, as amended, of the Fisheries Consolidation Act, 1959, permits the holder to fish for bivalve molluscs, including scallops, unless it contains a term or condition expressly precluding such fishing. There are also certain sea fishing boat licences which permit the holder to fish only for bivalve molluscs.</P>
      <P>No further applications have been accepted since 14 April 1999 for sea fishing boat licences authorising the holders to fish only for bivalve molluscs. This decision was taken, pending a review of the State of stocks and levels of fishing activity, in the interests of the conservation and rational exploitation of the fish stocks concerned. Some 27 fishing boat licences permitting fishing only for bivalve molluscs have been granted since then on foot of applications received before that date, and licence offers have been made in 27 other cases where applications were received before then.</P>

      <P>To meet this requirements, the allocation of drift net authorisations for both the 1998 and 1999 seasons was carried out on the basis of objective criteria related to track records of vessels in the fishery. Priority was given to licensees whose vessels had the strongest track record in the fishery. In some cases more than one participating vessel was owned by the same licensee and hence that person could be entitled to more than one authorisation. The geographical origin of applicants was not a criterion.</P>

    <P>In the last five years, Ireland has held its own in the face of a world-wide decline in exploration expenditure. The minerals of interest to prospecting licence holders include gold and precious stones in addition to zinc, lead and gypsum. The continued interest in exploration for minerals in this country is indicated by the fact that expenditure under prospecting licences rose from £6.49 million in 1995 to £9.34 million in 1998. Estimated outturn for 1999 is £10 million.</P>
    <P>In the period 1995 to 1999 four new State mining facilities &ndash; leases and licences &ndash; were granted under the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1999: a State mining licence to Arcon Mines for the Galmoy zinc and lead mine in County Kilkenny; a state mining lease to Ivernia West and Minorco Lisheen &ndash; now Anglo American &ndash; for the Lisheen zinc and lead mine in County Tipperary; two State mining licences to Tara Mines Limited for additional minerals adjacent to the existing mine at Navan. On hydrocarbons exploration and development the Kinsale gasfield, the only national developed resource, <Col N="1445" /> has been in production since 1978, while its south-west lobe was brought into production in October 1999</P>
    <P>At present, the Corrig gas find is still being appraised and further drilling is due this year. The licensees expect to be in a position by next December to declare whether or not the find is commercial.</P>
    <P>The Helvick oil find has been declared commercial. It is regarded as a marginal field and a plan of development will be submitted for my approval later this year.</P>
    <P>Under the Fisheries Operational Programme 1994-1999, over £14 million grant aid was allocated to support investment of £50 million in the fishing fleet. In the early years of the programme, support was allocated to the modernisation of 239 vessels. In June 1998, a programme of renewal of the Whitefish Fleet was introduced. This programme has resulted in the introduction of 30 new vessels and ten modern second-hand vessels into the fleet, the modernisation of 63 existing vessels and the provision of essential safety equipment ón board 561 vessels.</P>
    <P>In the fish processing sector, a total investment of £26.5 million has been supported since 1994, securing existing jobs and creating over 263 new jobs. During the early part of the programme, a high proportion of the available funding was allocated to upgrading projects to facilitate compliance with EU health and hygiene regulations. The upgrading of the sector was essential in order to maintain employment and position the industry to expand and develop. During the latter part of the programme investment support was concentrated on development projects that increased output and added value. A targeted programme of market support was also implemented.</P>
    <P>A training programme for the sector was implemented with a strong emphasis on improving the accessibility of courses with the introduction of mobile training units and the opening of a new regional training centre in Castletownbere. The provision of safety training was given priority.</P>
    <P>Over £17 million has been invested over the past five years in tourism angling under the tourism angling measure of the Tourism Operational Programme 1994-1999, with the objective of upgrading the coarse, game and sea angling facilities to best international standards. Nearly 160 projects were undertaken throughout the country, particularly in the more remote and disadvantaged areas where the majority of the fisheries are located. The main areas of development under TAM included physical in-stream and bank development, fisheries stocks enhancement and management, establishment of new fisheries and the acquisition and development of certain strategic sport fisheries.</P>
    <P>To continue the process of developing the inland fisheries, including further increasing tourist angling and revenue, and the creation of additional jobs in the sector, a sum of £24 million <Col N="1446" /> has been allocated by the Government in the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>
    <P>There has been significant investment in the acquaculture sector over the last five years. In particular, under the acquaculture measure of the Operational Programme for Fisheries 1994-1999, over £11 million in Exchequer and EU funding has been made available for development and expansion of the aquaculture sector. Over 100 projects were undertaken to expand the shellfish sector, to modernise fin-fish farming operations and to enhance environmental and quality management and monitoring on the ground. The total investment during the programme amounted to over £31 million.</P>
    <P>To continue the process of developing the sector, and with a particular focus on achieving critical mass, greater diversity in production and value added opportunities, the Government has allocated £25 million in the National Development Plan 2000-2006, which will attract a total investment of over £60 million in the sector over the next six years.</P>
    <P>The National Seaweed Forum was established in October 1999 to identify how the seaweed sector and resource can be developed to maximise its contribution to the national and local economics and to the income of people in coastal communities. The forum is due to present its report to me by July 2000.</P>
    <P>As part of my strategy for the marine tourism sector, a new division, the marine tourism and leisure division, has been set up in my Department. A report was published in 1999 by the Marine Institute which identified the potential for the development of the water-based tourism and leisure sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since gas production commenced from the Kinsale Head gas-field in 1978, from the Ballycotton gas-field in 1991 and from south-west Kinsale in October last year, over 1.5 trillion cubic feet of gas has been produced to date. However, gas production from the fields is in decline and will continue to fall during the remaining life of the fields until they reach their expected economic termination by about the year 2005.</P>
      <P>Future gas supplies from Kinsale and Ballycotton depend not only on the amount of gas remaining in the reservoir and how much it is possible to extract from a technical point of view but also on the economics of producing and selling the gas. The latest projected figure of recoverable reserves from the field, as estimated by my Department, is some 210 billion cubic feet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1447" /> With regards to future arrangements for the extraction of gas, Marathon is in the process of a substantial investment programme to up-grade gas compression facilities in the fields which will be completed later this year. These compressors are intended to boost natural well pressures which decline as the fields are depleted. Along with this upgrade, Marathon will evaluate all means of ensuring maximum productivity from the Kinsale Head and Ballycotton gas-fields and of course my Department will continue to monitor the fields' progress.</P>
    <P>The above statements relate to proven reserves. The extent to which proven commercial reserves will be established in respect of the Corrib field will depend on the outcome of assessments to be undertaken later this year.</P>

The Office of Public Works is in the process of completing the formalities for the purchase of the Oldbridge Estate and it is hoped that these will be completed within a matter of weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1450" /> The heritage service of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is responsible for the development and operation of the site in line with proposals to be drawn up by the committee referred to above. Consultants were appointed by the heritage service to carry out a planning study for the battlefield site and they have placed advertisements in newspapers, North and South, inviting individuals and groups to make submissions to them in regard to the study. The consultants have been advised that the report should be produced by the end of July and this will inform the committee's deliberations on how to interpret and develop the site.</P>
    <P>A number of other measures have been and are being implemented at present to make the area more accessible to visitors. These are principally the erection of special signs at various points of interest around the area, some small-scale road improvements &ndash; small lay-byes to facilitate usage of the signs, surface repairs etc. &ndash; and work has commenced on the preparation of a visitors leaflet.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the Government's policy towards the forthcoming talks in New York, under the aegis of the United Nations, to resolve the conflict between Turkish and Greek Cypriots.</Quest>

      <P>The Government fully supports the efforts of the UN to advance the process towards a political settle<Col N="1451" /> ment in Cyprus in the current round of talks between both sides. Although the backdrop to the talks has improved following the recent improvement in Greek-Turkish relations, it is difficult to predict the likelihood of substantial progress being achieved. The Government has urged the parties to make every effort to move the process forward. It has also made clear to them and to the United Nations that Ireland is ready to provide any assistance which would be considered useful in promoting progress.</P>
      <P>In November 1999, Turkish-Cypriot leader Denktash agreed to take part in UN-sponsored indirect or proximity talks with Cypriot President Glafeos Clerides. These proximity talks took place from 3 to 14 December. A second round of talks was held from 31 January to 8 February this year. The purpose of these two rounds of talks was to prepare the groundwork for comprehensive negotiations. Four core issues are on the table in these discussions: security, territory, property, including compensation, and distribution of powers. The talks are due to restart in New York later this month, but they may be postponed due to the illness of President Clerides. The UN mediator, Alvaro De Soto, has confirmed that the next round of talks will also be based on indirect meetings.</P>
      <P>The Government believes that the UN framework of a bi-zonal, bi-communal, federal approach remains the appropriate one for an eventual settlement to the Cyprus issue. We have a particular interest in a successful outcome to the peace process. Ireland has contributed from the outset to the UN peacekeeping operation in Cyprus and we currently have 20 personnel with UNFICYP. The Government hopes that the recent positive developments in Greek-Turkish relations can be built upon and that these developments will help to facilitate concrete progress towards a settlement in Cyprus.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the risks which some witnesses at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia &ndash; ICTY &ndash; lay themselves open to by acting as witnesses in cases before the tribunal. ICTY has been in touch with a number of Governments, including Ireland, concerning participation in a witness relocation programme. The <Col N="1452" /> purpose of this programme is to relocate temporarily the small number of witnesses for whom the risk of returning to their former home is very great, to the territory of a state outside the former Yugoslavia as a means of protection.</P>
      <P>I am looking at the possibility of Ireland responding positively to the request of ICTY. Participation in the scheme raises a number of issues which involve other Departments. Consultations with them are currently in progress.  </P>

      <P>I am not aware of any Dutch grant scheme specific to on-farm small scale wind powered generators but if the Deputy has other information I would be glad to receive it. In September last, I published my Green Paper on Sustainable Energy. One of the objectives of the paper is to promote the increased use of alternative and renewable sources of energy for electricity generation and to do so in a way which maintains the competitiveness of the sector.</P>
      <P>In this regard I have increased the target for additional renewable based electricity generating plant from 186 megawatts (MWe) to 500 MWe to be installed in the period 2,000-2,005. The bulk of the increased target will come from the wind energy sector.</P>
      <P>I have stated on a number of occasions my commitment to participation by local communities, including the farming sector, in renewable energy developments. However, I recognise that there are constraints to the widespread deployment of renewable energy technologies. In that context, I have established a renewable energy strategy group tasked to examine all aspects of, and obstacles to, the further deployment of these technologies. Among the issues that the group will examine will be the factors which impede the development of small scale renewable energy projects and the prospects for net metering and billing, which, if feasible, would enhance the outlook for micro-scale projects. In that context, the question of additional support measures for such projects will be examined. The group commenced its study in November 1999 and will report back to me on the wind energy market by the end of June this year.</P>

      <P>Electricity production accounts for about 40% of the total national primary energy requirement. The alternative energy requirement programme &ndash; AER &ndash; launched in 1996, has contributed to the increased deployment of renewable energy based electricity generating plant within the electricity market.</P>
      <P>In September last I increased the target for additional renewable energy based electricity generating plant to be installed in the period 2,000-2,005 from 186 megawatts (MWe) to 500 MWe. It is estimated this will increase the production of electricity from all renewable energy sources from 6% to 12% of total electricity production.</P>
      <P>The new target will be met by means of additional competitions under AER and direct sales of green electricity to final customers under the accelerated liberalisation of the green electricity market provided for in the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999.</P>
      <P>I have also established a renewable energy strategy group to examine all obstacles to the deployment of renewable energy technologies. The group's initial report, which will concentrate on obstacles to the increased deployment of wind energy technologies, is due for completion in the middle of the year.</P>

In the opinion of those organisations, there is no failure of monitoring and enforcing of all existing ICAO and HSA safety standards for groundhandling services, whether supplied by airline or non-airline service providers. Aer Rianta's by-laws provide further safeguards in respect of safety in the airport.</P>

      <P>Aer Rianta, in common with many other major European airport authorities, have been aware for some time of the need to design and implement a noise management strategy. The first part of such a noise management strategy is to have a comprehensive review carried out taking account of the location of the airport, type of aircraft in use, schedule of arrivals and departures and, most importantly, the location and configuration of local communities.</P>
      <P>This comprehensive review, undertaken by a leading noise specialist on behalf of Aer Rianta, was started in mid-1999 and has now been completed. The draft report has been received by Aer Rianta with a view to implementing its recommendations. The draft report does indeed recommend that noise monitoring equipment be installed at various appropriate locations both within the immediate environments of the airport and at more distant points.</P>
      <P>The recent completion of the review paves the way for the procurement and installation of the necessary equipment which obviously will take some time. When installed and operational, this will provide valuable information on the noise profile in the vicinity of Dublin Airport.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 173 and 174 together.</P>
      <P>The Exchequer subvention is paid to CIE rather than to the individual companies in respect of the provision of socially necessary, non-commercial public transport services. The allocation of this subvention to the individual subsidiary companies is a matter for the CIE board.</P>
      <P>The amount of subvention for the past three years allocated by CIE to Dublin Bus was as follows: 1997 &ndash; £7,000,000; 1998 &ndash; £8,895,000; 1999 &ndash; £13,244,000. The subvention has not been based on detailed costings per route. It had been the Government's intention to sign a public service contract, PSC, with CIÉ/Dublin Bus, in order to replace the traditional Exchequer annual subvention to CIÉ with a transparent mechanism, under which payments could be directly related to the uneconomic services provided. However, when I put proposals to Government for the introduction of a public service contract with Dublin Bus, the Attorney General advised that this would not be possible under existing legislation.</P>
      <P>In reviewing the regulatory regime for the bus market in Dublin the issue of how to support necessary but uneconomic services is being considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the firm view of the Irish Government that the continued operation of the old Magnox reactors at Sellafield and the storage in liquid form in tanks at the Sellafield site of high level liquid radioactive waste constitute the dominant threat of a major accident.</P>
      <P>The Magnox reactors are the oldest of the commercial nuclear installations in the UK, some of which date back to 1956, and have exceeded their original design life by over 20 years.</P>
      <P>I have raised the concerns of the Government about both of these matters on numerous occasions in correspondence and in meetings with the relevant UK Ministers. In summary, the Government wants to see the Magnox reactors shut down and decommissioned and the speedy vitrification of the high level liquid waste at Sellafield.</P>
      <P>The UK Ministers contend that the Magnox reactors can continue to operate safely. They have pointed out to me that the reactors are subject to regular safety reviews by the UK Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, NII, before they are permitted to continue in operation. Nevertheless, I am unconvinced about the safety of these reactors. The number of incidents involving these reactors and the recently published NII reports which were severely critical of safety management and safety culture at the plant, only serve to re-inforce the Irish Government's concerns.</P>
      <P>The UK-NII is committed to the vitrification of the liquid high-level waste to buffer stock levels by the year 2015. However, the Government wants to see the vitrification process accelerated and the backlog of liquid waste vitrified by much earlier than that date.</P>
      <P>The Government is determined to bring about the closure of the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing facility. While the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland's radioactivity monitoring programme provides re-assurance that there is no significant risk to the health of the Irish public as a consequence of the radioactivity contamination of the Irish marine environment, any contamination caused by the Sellafield discharges is totally objectionable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the matter of radioactive discharges to the marine environment, the Government has submitted a draft decision to be considered at the meeting next month of the OSPAR Commission. <Col N="1458" /> This meeting will be considering,<i> inter alia,</i> a report as to how the contracting parties to the OSPAR Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic intend to implement the OSPAR Strategy on Radioactive Substances adopted at the OSPAR Ministerial meeting in July 1998 and which has as its objective the virtual elimination by the year 2020 of radioactive discharges to the marine environment. The draft decision tabled by Ireland calls on the contracting parties to the OSPAR convention to agree that the implementation of the OSPAR strategy be accelerated and that there should be a cessation of reprocessing and associated activities and, in particular, there should be an immediate cessation of reprocessing and associated activities at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>I have been seeking the support of the Nordic countries, who have expressed similar concerns about the Sellafield discharges, for a concerted and co-operative approach at the OSPAR Commission meeting against nuclear reprocessing, including the Sellafield discharges. I have just completed a recent visit to Nordic capitals in order to strengthen that support. I will also be seeking backing from the other OSPAR countries as well.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, and as I pointed out in my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 51 and 53 on 29 March 2000, the Attorney General is currently examining the prospects for litigation against Sellafield following the publication of the NII reports referred to above.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Arrangements for licensing of third generation, 3G, mobile phone systems are, in the first instance, a matter for the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. As Minister for Public Enterprise, however, I have an overall policy role in regard to the telecommunications sector and, specifically, in relation to the allocation of radio spectrum. In line with this responsibility, I intend being fully involved in developments on this issue. The Minister for Finance has also a role in this area in relation to the fees which may be imposed for such licences and I can confirm that my Department has already been in contact with the Department of Finance on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As for the method of allocation of licences, I should point out there are a number of options available to Ireland in this regard, including the holding of auctions as done in the UK, the use of comparative selection processes or so-called &ldquo;beauty contests&rdquo;, and the distribution of licences by means of lotteries. It is possible that combi<Col N="1459" /> nations of each of these options may also be used. While the use of auctions may seem attractive as a means of raising large amounts of money for the Exchequer, there are concerns that the costs to operators might ultimately be passed on to the consumer. The high price to be paid may also have a negative effect on an operator's ability in the areas of research and development, infrastructure roll-out, and the delivery of advanced services. These are matters still for discussion.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the director has recently started an examination of all aspects relating to the 3G licensing issue, including the method of licence allocation, and I understand that she proposes carrying out a public consultation during the summer as part of this examination. My Department will be holding discussions with the office of the director on all the relevant issues in this regard in the very near future.</P>

      <P>Members of the second line reserve, which consists of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil and An Slua Muirí, are awarded An Bonn Seirbhíse, the Service Medal, on completing seven years' satisfactory service. A bar is added to the medal on completing 12 years' satisfactory service and a second bar on completing 21 years' satisfactory service.</P>
      <P>Service in the second line reserve is rendered on a voluntary part-time basis. Specific Defence Forces regulations apply to the organisation and administration of that body. These provide for such matters as the assessment of conduct during service on a broader and more general basis than would be appropriate in relation to the Permanent Defence Force. However, members of the second line reserve and the Permanent Defence Force are treated similarly in that completion of a specified period of satisfactory service is recognised by the award of service medals and bars. The relevant periods required in the case of the second line reserve compare very favourably with those required of members of the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The restructuring of the Reserve Defence Forces is an ongoing process. As you may be aware, the White Paper on the Defence Forces states that there has been an acceptance of the steering group report as the general basis on which the development of the Reserve Defence Force can proceed. I have previously stated my intention of carrying out further wide ranging consultation with stakeholders in this process. Matters such as changes in units designation will be decided in the <Col N="1460" /> course of bringing forward an implementation plan. The military board report has suggested the restructuring should take place over a period of nine years, broken into three year phases. There will be a gradual evolution from the present structure to the new organisation. Standing down is probably not an appropriate description of this process in relation to the whole organisation, though it might be so in the case of some units.</P>
    <P>It is normal where units are stood down, amalgamated or re-designed that the occasion is marked by appropriate military ceremony. I have no doubt that this will be the case in the current process including a suitable ceremony to mark the name change from An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil to An Cultaca Airm.</P>
    <P>The military authorities have not recommended the provision of a medal for all past members on the grounds of cost and practical difficulties attached to processing the many thousands of ex-members. However, if such a measure was to be considered, it should be confined to members serving on a specific date.</P>

    <P>(Mr. Walsh): The social butter scheme, which was fully fundable by the EU, was one of a number of measures used to contribute to balance within the EU dairy market. Ireland was the only member state which operated it. The aid level was progressively reduced from year to year and a decision was taken by the EU Agriculture Council in December 1998 to allow the scheme to operate for one final year. The new basic Council regulation governing the EU dairy regime as agreed under Agenda 2000 did not provide for this scheme beyond January 2000. There was, therefore, no legal basis for continuing the scheme beyond that date.</P>

      <P>To address this problem, the REP scheme was revised on 1 January 1999 to include a new supplementary measure A. This measure includes the requirement that framework plans be drawn up, under the supervision of my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage Gaeltacht and the Islands, for all commonage land.

      <P>Pending the completion of the commonage framework plans, my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands have put an interim national commonage framework plan in place.

      <P>When the detailed commonage framework plans are completed it will be a condition of the headage and premium schemes that farmers with commonage land must be participating in an approved REPS plan or a national agri-environment plan to be operated by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>

      <P>It is a basic condition of REPS that each applicant must have an agri-environmental plan prepared for his farm by a professional planner. The plan includes a schedule of maintenance for hedgerows drawn up by the planner, specifying the location, timescale and nature of the work to be carried out. In making his application under the scheme, the applicant agrees to abide by this and other requirements of his plan.</P>
      <P>As a result of a REPS compliance inspection in January 1998, the participant named was penalised 10% for failure to retain hedgerows as specified in his agri-environmental plan. He appealed this penalty unsuccessfully to his local farm development service, and subsequently to the REPS appeals committee. The appeals committee considered the matter but noted that the applicant had not followed the maintenance schedule specified in his plan, and, therefore, decided that the penalty must remain in place. The participant was informed of this decision in June 1999. When a REPS penalty is appealed, the decision of the appeals committee is the Department's final position.</P>

      <P>It is a requirement under EU regulations that a minimum of 10% of ewe premium scheme applications are inspected on-the-spot. Every effort is made to complete these inspections within the 100 day retention period so as to facilitate flock owners as far as possible. The retention period ended on 28 April this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inevitably inspections are carried out when ewes are in lamb and every effort is made to avoid handling ewes. On most farms it is not necessary to assemble the sheep as it is possible to check the number of sheep and establish that <Col N="1465" /> they are eligible by inspecting the sheep in the fields. However, in some circumstances such as where sheep are kept on commonages, it is not always possible to carry out these checks without assembling them at one point, particularly where there are large flocks involved or the flocks are inter-mixed.</P>
    <P>Given the application timeframe involved in the ewe premium scheme, there is really no scope for changing the current on-the-spot inspection procedure.</P>

      <P>The rural environmental protection scheme has been widely publicised in the media, and promoted by Teagasc, approved planners and the local offices of the Department. This wide publicity, along with the very evident advantages of participation to farmers, has contributed to the achievement of the high participation levels over the first five years of the programme. Since its introduction in 1994, participation in the REP scheme has grown steadily to the current level of 45,500 participants, farming an area of over 1.5 million hectares.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently negotiating with the European Commission the terms of the rural development plan, 2000-06, incorporating four measures &ndash; agri-environment, early retirement, compensatory allowances and forestry. The rural development plan has been prepared under Council Regulation (EC) No. 1257/1999 on support for rural development. When negotiations are complete and before a new REP scheme is launched appropriate steps will be taken to make the agricultural community aware of the new scheme and the measures contained therein. Under the new scheme, the level of participation is projected to rise further to some 70,000 by 2006.</P>

    <P>REPS now plays a pivotal role in the promotion of sustainable agriculture by supporting the production of quality food in an extensive and environmentally friendly manner, while at the <Col N="1467" /> same time protecting wildlife habitats and endangered species of flora and fauna.

It is estimated that there are approximately 3,600 farmers in the county, none of whom would be precluded from making an application to join the scheme. REPS is a voluntary scheme and it is a matter for each farmer to decide whether the scheme is suited to his or her farm enterprise.</P>
      <P>In the country as a whole some 45,500 farmers are participating in REPS, and payments totalling over £500 million have been made under the scheme since its inception in 1994. A sum of £1,500 million is available for REPS in the period 2000-06 and this will ensure a very significant increase in the participation rate in the coming years.

      <P>The rural environmental protection scheme is open to all farmers and the scheme has been widely publicised since its introduction. The uptake over the first five years of REPS was significant and in line with projections and at present some 45,500 farmers, out of a total of over 140,000, are participating in it and farming over 1.5 million hectares in accordance with its provisions. Payments to farmers under the scheme to date amount to over £500 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1468" /> The conditions of eligibility are published in the scheme document and agri-environment specifications. Any farmer who submits an application complying with the scheme conditions and specifications is approved for payment. It is of course accepted that not all farmers may choose to farm in a manner which would meet the eligibility criteria for participation. However, there is evidence that participation in REPS is likely to generate increased farm income, particularly because farming in accordance with the scheme gives rise to more efficient and economic use of artificial inputs.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently negotiating with the European Commission the terms of the rural development plan, 2000-06, which incorporates proposals for a new REP scheme. The plan has been prepared under Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 on Support for Rural Development. Funding of £1.5 billion is available for REPS for the period 2000-06 and it is projected that participation levels in the scheme will have risen to 70,000 by the end of 2006.

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Milk quotas were introduced on 2 April 1984 and producers' quotas were based on deliveries during the 1983 calendar year plus 497 gallons for producers with deliveries of less than 14,000 gallons and 3.55% for producers with deliveries of more than 14,000 gallons.</P>
      <P>Ireland, like all other member states in the European Union, has a national milk quota and can, therefore, produce up to that level without penalty. Milk production in excess of the national quota is, however, subject to a super levy. Super levy liability is calculated in accordance with EU legislation on the basis of milk deliveries to registered milk purchasers in the milk quota year.</P>
      <P>In addition to the provisions relating to the imposition of a super levy when actual milk deliveries have been exceeded, the relevant EU regulations include measures to restrict increases in the fat content of the milk deliveries. Penalties are imposed when the butterfat content of milk deliveries during a milk quota year exceeds the national butterfat representative level. Each producer has a butterfat representative level, which is based on the fat content of his or her milk deliveries during either 1984-85 or 1985-86 milk quota years, whichever is the higher. At the end of each milk quota year, milk deliveries of each producer are adjusted to take account of the difference between the fat content of the producer's milk deliveries and his or her butterfat representative level. The milk deliveries are adjusted upwards or downwards by 0.18% for each 0.1 grams/kg difference between actual fat and butterfat representative level.</P>
      <P>Each year every co-operative or dairy submits details of the aggregated total of their producers' actual deliveries and fat adjusted deliveries. On the basis of these figures, the overall totals at national level are calculated by my Department and, in accordance with the relevant provisions in the EU regulations, super levy liability is calculated on the higher of the two quantities, that is, actual or fat adjusted milk deliveries, provided that this quantity exceeds the national quota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the EU regulations make it clear that it is not possible to collect levy from <Col N="1470" /> some producers on the basis of actual deliveries and other producers on fat adjusted deliveries for the same milk quota year. Neither is it possible to assess a producer's levy liability on the basis of fat adjusted deliveries if, at a national level, the total of the fat adjusted deliveries is lower than the total of actual deliveries. The latter situation applied when the super levy liability was established in respect of the 1995-96 and 1996-97 milk quota years and, therefore, the super levy liability of each producer had to be calculated on the basis of actual deliveries. In the 1997-98 milk quota year, on the other hand, the fat adjusted milk deliveries exceeded the actual deliveries as well as exceeding the national quota. The super levy liability was, therefore, established on the basis of the fat adjusted deliveries. The provisions in relation to this matter and the reasons why super levy was charged have been outlined by my Department to the person named in the past.</P>

      <P>In operating the REP scheme, which is 75% co-funded by the EU, my Department has to have regard to the need to maintain appropriate standards of monitoring and control. Pre-payment, 5%, inspections are a key component of the control systems, and payments can not be made to REPS participants chosen for inspection until an inspection has taken place.

      <P>Application for payment was received from the applicant concerned on 14 October 1999. The application was processed and at pre-payment stage the application was selected at random for a 5% plan and on-farm inspection. Arrangements are being made to have the inspection carried out as soon as possible and if everything is in order payment will be made without delay.</P>
      <P>In operating the REP scheme, my Department has to have regard to the need to maintain appropriate standards of monitoring and control. Compliance inspections are a key component of the control systems, and payment cannot be made to REPS participants chosen for inspection until they have taken place. A range of circumstances, including the competing demands on human resources arising from the various schemes and services provided by my Department, can on occasion lead to delays in arranging inspections. My Department remains committed to providing an efficient service for REPS participants while at the same time meeting its responsibilities to appropriately monitor and control the scheme. In this context the matter of staff resource levels is under active examination.</P>

      <P>There was no increase in the rate of pension under the scheme of early retirement from farming in January 1999. The rate was reduced by some 5.05% arising from the revaluation of the pound on the introduction of the euro. The Council of Ministers approved the payment of compensation over three years to participants in the schemes affected by reductions arising from the introduction of the euro. Full compensation was approved for losses arising in 1999. A lump sum payment in respect of this compensation has now been paid to all those participants in the early retirement scheme who qualified &ndash; the last of these payments issued in March. The Council approved compensation at a reduced rate in respect of losses in 2000 and 2001, but arrangements for payment have yet to be confirmed by the European Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The criticism in the agri-food 2010 group about the lack of progress in implementing the recommendations of the beef task force related to the need for rationalisation in the beef sector. The task force report recognised that responsibility for the matter rested primarily with the processing industry itself and, indeed, recommended that the industry should create a special fund to facilitate the removal of surplus/obsolete capacity to expedite the rationalisation process. In so far as Government action is concerned, the report recommended that public funds should be provided for an industry investment and development programme involving capital expenditure in existing and new facilities and the suppression of inefficient operations which are surplus to requirements. The Government has already decided, in the context of the national development plan, to give priority to the beef sector at primary slaughtering and processing level. An operational programme to give effect to this decision is under preparation. This initiative, operating in partnership with the industry itself, should facilitate development and rationalisation in the beef processing industry in a planned way.</P>
      <P>As far as the other recommendations of the task force are concerned, I have established a monitoring committee to oversee the implementation of the recommendations relating to price transparency export promotion, carcase classification and graded pricing. I understand that considerable progress has been made on these areas within the monitoring committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remaining recommendations of the beef task force largely concern primary production and, depending on their nature are for implementation by the industry itself and by the relevant State agencies in co-operation with my Department. These recommendations call for an improvement in the quality of cattle through better breeding and husbandry practices in order to ensure an adequate supply of high quality beef needed to meet the demanding requirements of the EU market. Both Teagasc and the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation have intensified their efforts <Col N="1478" /> in recent months to promote the development of quality breeding by producers. For example, Teagasc has just completed a series of eight road shows designed to give producers guidance on the ideal heifer replacement essential for the production of quality beef.</P>
    <P>However, in the final analysis, producers' decisions in this area will be based on the extent to which prices paid by beef processors regard quality production. This is primarily a matter for the industry itself. The introduction of mechanical classification would facilitate progress in this area. In view of this, my Department has funded a major trial on mechanical classification in order to evaluate the accuracy of mechanical systems relative to the current system of visual assessment. This trial showed that mechanical classification has potential but needs to be improved if it is to replace visual assessment. My Department is also currently involved in discussions at EU level on the standards to be achieved by mechanical system if they are to be approved for use. I hope for progress in this area in the coming months. In conclusion, I am satisfied with the progress being made on implementation of the task force recommendation to date and I expect to see further substantial progress in the next few months.</P>

Both objectives are set out in my Department's statement of strategy, as well as in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
      <P>The agri food 2010 report points out that these two objectives dominate Irish agricultural policy at present. It goes on to comment that:</P>
      <P>There is some tension between these objectives, but the political consensus is that both are valid. The task is to reconcile them in a way that provides a clear guide for future policy, and realistic targets to aim for. The current very favourable economic environment provides a unique opportunity to advance both objectives simultaneously.'</P>
      <P>The committee made a number of recommendations in their report with this objective in mind. I am now undertaking a round of consultations with the representative organisations on the findings and recommendations of the committee, which I hope to complete quickly. I will make a definitive response to the report when these consultations are completed.</P>

      <Quest>his views of the criticism of the agri food 2010 group that the EU carcase classification scheme measures meat yield rather that meat quality, as understood by the consumer; and if he has any plans to make representations to have the classification scheme adjusted so as to more accurately reflect consumer needs.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU beef carcase classification scheme, which applies in all member states under EU legislation, is a system for describing the shape and fat cover of the carcase in a standardised manner. It was set up in 1980 in order to provide a uniform method of recording beef prices and determining eligibility for intervention in each member state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the classification system is primarily concerned with meat yield, it is used in the beef trade to reflect consumer requirements in relation to quality. For example, research by An Bord Bia has shown that consumer demand in the United Kingdom for a higher fat cover is reflected in the general demand from traders in that market for grades URO, 2, 3, 4. On the other hand, demand in France, where consumer's preference is for leaner beef, is for grades EUR, 2, 3, 4. It is not practicable for the classification system to measure other quality aspects such as flavour, tenderness etc. because these are highly subjective, vary from market to market and are dependent on how the beef is handled post classification and, in particular, the maturation period. These qualitative aspects are <Col N="1480" /> best captured under the type of quality assurance scheme operated by Bord Bia. There are also a number of private schemes, such as the KK Club, the Irish Angus Producers Group, Hereford Prime Beef, etc., which are designed to produce the type and quality of beef demanded in individual markets.</P>
    <P>In view of that it is not appropriate to extend the present EU beef carcase classification scheme to include quality aspects which would make the present scheme more subjective rather than increase its objectivity.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the decline in the genetic merit of the beef herd in Ireland over the past ten years as reflected in carcase quality; if this is attributable to a reduction in use of artificial insemination due to the movement from full-time to part-time farming with consequent movement towards the use of natural service bulls which may not be of the high genetic quality of artificially inseminated bulls.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The deterioration in recent years in the carcase classification grades achieved by Irish beef cattle can be attributed to several factors including changes in the numbers and quality of cattle exported live, increased usage of Holstein genetics in the dairy herd, a drop in the usage of AI from beef breeds and the absence of sufficient quality based price differentials for beef carcases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beef cattle breed improvement activities in Ireland were, until recent times, fragmented between a number of organisations including my <Col N="1482" /> Department, AI organisations and breed societies. However, the pooling of resources and expertise to form the recently established Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, is providing a real opportunity to make significant progress in developing the breed characteristics of our beef cattle. One of the main objectives of ICBF is to improve the genetic merit of the national herd particularly by improving genetic evaluation and information on breeding quality. Breeding objectives are being clearly defined in the context of changing market requirements and farming systems. ICBF is working to identify our top bulls through genetic evaluation and the use of sophisticated IT systems. It will then be for all the relevant interests in the industry to promote the widespread use of those selected bulls.</P>
    <P>Teagasc is now also using focused programmes to pro-actively promote the production of quality beef on a cost effective profitable basis using efficient breeding and feeding systems. All of these measures will assist farmers in today's production and market led environment to produce quality beef more efficiently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 2010 committee report was presented to me on 24 March. It contains a considerable number of recommendations and findings. I am undertaking a round of consultations with the representative organisations on these findings and recommendations in the period ahead. It would be inappropriate for me to take a definitive position on any individual proposal in the report until these consultations are completed, which should not take longer than three months from the date on which I received the report. At that stage, it is my intention to formulate a comprehensive response to the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Specifically in relation to the beef sector, I would point out that the opinion of the agri food 2010 group that the optimum structure can best be achieved by a 35% reduction in slaughtering capacity is consistent with the 1998 McKinsey report on the beef sector and the 1999 report of the task force on the beef industry, which was chaired by the secretary general of my Department. I share the view expressed in these reports that the removal of excess slaughtering capacity <Col N="1483" /> would both improve the profitability of the industry through lower unit costs and enhance its ability to compete on the European market. In addition, it would provide for more full time jobs and the development of a more skilled workforce and, accordingly, improve the attractiveness of employment in the beef processing sector. It should be noted, however, that the agri food 2010 report recognised that such extreme rationalisation is unlikely because of seasonal or regional patterns of production, that the realistic scope for Government action is limited and that responsibility for dealing with this issue rests primarily with the shareholders in the industry.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the Government does have a role in this area and, in order to secure a better industry structure, it has decided in the context of the national development plan to give priority to the beef sector at primary slaughtering and processing level. An operational programme to give effect to this decision is under preparation. This initiative, operating in partnership with the industry itself, should facilitate development and rationalisation in the beef processing industry in a planned way. Issues of the capacity and structure of the processing industry in the other sectors referred to also require attention, and these matters will form part of the consultation process on the 2010 committee findings.</P>

      <P>The person to whom the Deputy refers was admitted to the early retirement scheme in 1995 under a joint management arrangement with her husband. It is a condition of the scheme that participants must apply, on reaching their 66th birthday, to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for both the contributory and non-contributory old age pension. This condition also applies to participants' partners in a joint management application. If a pension is awarded it must be offset against the farm retirement pension. Participants in the scheme are told of this condition when they join, and they are required to notify my Department if they or their partners in joint management are awarded an old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The husband of the person named became entitled to the non-contributory old age pension with effect from 26 March 1999 but this was not confirmed to my Department until January of this year. Having become aware of the position, my Department adjusted the early retirement pen<Col N="1484" /> sion with effect from the February 2000 payment. The overpayment which had occurred in the meantime is being recovered, and as the conditions of the scheme are unequivocal with regard to the offsetting of national pensions my Department has no option but to do so. My Department is seeking to reduce the inconvenience to the participant and her husband by spreading the recovery of the overpayment over 24 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the only tax free allowance available for those with a specific disability is the blind person's allowance. This allowance was introduced in 1971 in recognition of the exceptional circumstances faced by visually impaired persons. Apart from the cost, which would be significant, extending this allowance to persons with other disabilities would raise the difficult issue of how to define disability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there are a number of other tax-free allowances available for people with disabilities. These are: the incapacitated child's allowance; the dependant relative allowance; and, the allowance for employment of carer for an incapacitated person. In addition, there are a number of further tax measures from which disabled persons can benefit: Medical expenses relief &ndash; section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 provides for tax relief in respect of various defined health expenses; covenants &ndash; unrestricted tax relief can be claimed on covenants in favour of permanently incapacitated minors other than from parents to their own minor incapacitated children. Unrestricted tax relief can be claimed <Col N="1486" /> on covenants in favour of permanently incapacitated adults; disabled drivers scheme &ndash; the scheme, details of which are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994, (S.I. No. 353 of 1994) provide valuable benefits to those severely and permanently disabled persons who qualify under its term. Under the scheme, a new car may be purchased every two years free of VAT and vehicle registration tax, subject to certain monetary limits. In addition, the annual road tax is not charged and the qualifying person is eligible for the provision per annum of 2,728 litres of road fuel free of excise duty; VAT relief &ndash; the VAT Act of 1972 provides for the application of a zero rate of VAT on a range of medical equipment and appliances e.g. hearing aids. Certain disabled persons may be entitled to a refund of VAT for certain equipment which is not zero rated under the VAT (Refund of Tax) Order (No. 15) 1981 (S.I. No. 428 of 1981); investment income &ndash; income arising from the investment of compensation payments made by the courts to those who are permanently incapacitated is free from income tax; and, land leases &ndash; there is a special exemption from income tax in respect of income derived from leases for incapacitated farmers.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate I receive numerous requests, many from very worthwhile causes, for the introduction of new reliefs or the extension of existing ones. Tax reliefs by their very nature reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system much more difficult. Government policy in recent years has been to reduce the burden of taxation to reward effort and to improve the incentive to take up employment. This has benefited all taxpayers.</P>

    <P>For these reasons the Government considered that reductions in the stamp duty rates applicable <Col N="1487" /> to all residential property, as recommended in the Bacon report, would be more beneficial to first time buyers and the housing market in general than a specific total exemption aimed at first time buyers only. The cost of eliminating stamp duty for first time buyers of second hand houses would be at least £50 million.</P>

    <P>The amounts shown for capital expenditure on social housing include the following: provision and improvement of housing by local authorities and voluntary housing bodies, provision of accommodation by local authorities for members of the travelling community, the task force on special housing aid for the elderly and communal facilities in voluntary housing schemes. In addition, local authorities spend a considerable amount from their own resources on house construction. In 2000, this will amount to £80 million.</P>
    <P>I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the national development plan which included provision for housing for the first time. Over the period of the plan £6 billion &ndash; 1999 prices &ndash; is being provided for social and affordable housing. The plan provides for a multi-annual local authority housing programme to deliver an additional 35,500 units, with 5,500 units each year in the first four years of the plan. Provision has also been made for funding to facilitate an output of 1,000 units per annum under the local authority affordable housing scheme and the shared ownership scheme run by local authorities will also provide 1,000 units per year. The plan also provides support for an increase in voluntary housing sector output so that it can increase from its 1998 level of 500 units per annum to 4,000 units per annum during the plan period.</P>

      <P>A premises constructed by a local sports club met the Department of the Environment and Local Government's requirements for a driving test centre in Castlebar. Details of the driving test centre requirements were furnished to the sports club at their request, but with absolutely no commitment to lease such space if constructed.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works, in the interests of competition and to ensure that all possible options had been identified, advertised for proposals for accommodation for the driver testers.</P>
      <P>In addition to the sports club, another location proposed by a different local sports club also emerged as suitable. Both parties were requested to submit tenders on a value-for-money basis and the proposal put forward by the original club was the more competitive one.</P>
      <P>To have selected the location on a different basis would not have been the best use of taxpayers' money. The tender competition was conducted and evaluated fully on a like with like comparison of proposals. The driving test centre had previously been accommodated on a short-term basis, in premises owned by both competing sports clubs.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that all pay increases due under Partnership 2000 have been paid to clerical grades in Revenue. The Deputy may, however, be referring to increases arising under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</P>
      <P>On 31 October 1997, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners was advised of the agreement on the restructuring of grades represented by the Civil and Public Service Union which included clerical grades. The restructuring agreement is extremely complex. It provided, among other things, for basic pay increases, advancements/ upgradings for specified proportions of all grades represented by the CPSU, the creation of a new higher clerical officer pay scale and for the assignment of specified proportions of all clerical staff to this new scale. The agreement also provided for detailed local discussions with the CPSU regarding the arrangements for implementing certain aspects of the agreement.</P>
      <P>Arrears of salary were paid in December 1997. In August 1998, following further discussions with the CPSU, the Department of Finance issued specific instructions to Departments, including Revenue, on the manner of advancement/ upgrading. Discussions took place with the local union representatives regarding the holding of competitions for such appointments and staff were notified of these arrangements in May 1999. As a result the appropriate advancements/upgradings have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assignments to the higher scale for the clerical officer grade could only begin in December 1999 after the advancements had been made. The <Col N="1491" /> assignments to the higher scale on a seniority basis for the clerical officer grade with an entitlement from 1 December 1995 were made and arrears of salary have been paid in the majority of cases. However, 21 clerical officers who were former assistant officers of Customs and Excise had a different salary scale to all other clerical officers and a specific salary scale had to be calculated by the Department of Finance for this group. This was received in Revenue on 4 May 2000 and the relevant officers will be paid the arrears within six weeks.</P>

In cases where the issue of the certificate is refused, it is open to the applicant to appeal this refusal to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, an independent board whose decision is final.

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, couples who are not married are not eligible for married treatment under the income tax code. However, I would point out that the revised standard rate income tax band, which was initiated this year, takes the first step in putting in place individual tax bands so that each person will have his/her own individual band which will no longer be based on marital status. When this process is completed, tax treatment will be based on a single non-transferable band for each income earner.</P>
      <P>The home carer's allowance which I introduced last December may be claimed by a married couple who are jointly assessed for tax and where one spouse cares for one or more dependent persons. I have no plans to make the allowance available to couples who are not married.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that at the time the instrument transferring the lands in question was presented for stamping young <Col N="1493" /> trained farmer relief was applied for and subsequently granted to the applicant. The relief, which was due to terminate on 31 December 1999 but extended in my budget speech on 1 December 1999 until 31 December 2002, amounted to a reduction of two-thirds of the duty that would otherwise have been payable. Furthermore, in addition to applying that relief consanguinity relief also applied as the lands were being transferred between family members. These combined reliefs reduced the effective rate of stamp duty from 6% to 1%.</P>
      <P>I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the introduction of full relief from stamp duty for young trained farmers arising out of the discussions on the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and which is provided for by the Finance Act, 2000, applies only in respect of instruments executed on or after 1 January 2000.

    <P>&ldquo;Net receipt&rdquo; means the total tax deducted and paid over in a year less repayments made in the same year. The net receipt of the tax in 1999 includes a single payment of £14.5 million which was regarded as a once-off and not included in the budget estimate for 2000.</P>
    <P>The cost to the Exchequer of reducing the rate of withholding tax on professional fees from 24% to 22% is estimated at £6.4 million in 2000 and £11.6 million in a full year. These costs are included in the ordinary costing of a cut in the standard rate of income tax.</P>
    <P>To determine the amount of withholding tax on professional services collected in 1999 by category of service provided would require an individual examination of all the relevant returns furnished to date by the accountable bodies. Such an examination could be carried out only at disproportionate cost.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that basic data are not available which would enable the amounts of withholding tax referable to third party costs to be identified.</P>

      <P>Professional services withholding tax applies to a payment made by an accountable person, generally public bodies, in respect of professional services. Where an accountable person makes such a payment, they are obliged to deduct tax at the standard rate of income tax in force at the time of payment. The obligation to deduct tax applies as regards the entire payment, including any element which is for the reimbursement of expenses, outlay or third party costs. This general rule applies to advertising agencies as well as to all other industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that payments made to an advertising medium, e.g. a newspaper, or to a person acting as agent for the advertising medium, e.g. an advertising agency, in order to obtain advertising space or <Col N="1495" /> time are not subject to PSWT as such payments are not made in respect of professional services.</P>
    <P>Where advertising space or time is provided as part of an overall professional service or by an advertising agency as part of an advertising, i.e. professional service, the total payment is subject to PSWT. Where a separate contract is drawn up by an advertising agency in respect of advertising space or time, payments made under this contract are made purely for advertising space or time. Revenue accepts that PSWT need not be deducted from payments for such space or time, as the payment is not being made in respect of a professional service.</P>

      <P>The Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Act, 1993, provided for two separate amnesty schemes, namely, an incentive amnesty under which, subject to compliance with specified conditions, certain liabilities to income tax and capital gains tax, together with interest and penalties, could be discharged by payment of 15% of the underlying income or gains on a confidential basis to the chief special collector established under the Act; and a general amnesty under which other tax arrears had to be paid in full with remission only for interest and penalties. The actual rate of tax applicable to the payments made under the general amnesty depended on the nature of the tax and the rate applicable in relation to that tax at the time the liability originally arose.</P>
      <P>The aggregate amount of tax and levies remitted to the chief special collector under the 15% incentive amnesty is £185.4 million on behalf of 38,400 individuals, the latest available estimate. This represents an average payment of £4,828 per person. Under the special statutory confidentiality arrangements which apply in relation to the incentive amnesty, the chief special collector may only supply certain information to me and this only in the form of aggregates of the total amount of the declared amounts, the total amount paid under the incentive amnesty, the total amount of value-added tax remitted to the chief special collector and the total number of individuals who remitted amounts to the chief special collector. In these circumstances it is not possible for me to provide the breakdown requested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The total yield of tax, PRSI and levies under the general amnesty, including £14.1 million in value-added tax paid to the chief special collector, is estimated at close on £76 million. It is not possible to provide the breakdown requested by the Deputy in respect of the full amount received under the general amnesty because detailed separate figures on numbers of individuals and companies availing of the general amnesty were not maintained by the Collector-General.</P>
      <P>However, I understand that an analysis of the £76 million carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General suggested that this was received from 15,055 taxpayers indicating an average yield of £5,048 per taxpayer. A more detailed breakdown of payments totalling £46.8 million was included in the annual report for 1994 of the Comptroller and Auditor General and is reproduced as follows:</P>

      <P>Site investigation works and other surveys required to finalise the detailed design of the Nore River (Kilkenny city) drainage scheme are currently under way in Kilkenny city. The next steps in the process are the preparation of contract documents, which necessitates the completion of the detailed design, and the invitation of tenders from contractors. It is envisaged at this stage that construction works on the scheme will commence in the autumn.</P>
      <P>Until the detailed design is finalised, which will include a programme for the effective sequencing of works for the scheme taking all aspects of the project into account, it is not possible to say what priority might be accorded the works on the wall at John's Quay. However, the Commissioners of Public Works have requested that these works be undertaken at as early a date as practicable in that works programme. As is customary in drainage schemes, liaison will be maintained with affected landowners prior to works taking place on their properties and during the course of such works.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland is not a bilateral creditor of any of the world's poorest countries nor a member of the G8. It is, therefore, as a member of the multilateral lending organisations, in particular the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, that we can best exercise our influence to seek to contribute to easing the debt burden of these countries.</P>
      <P>The HIPC initiative, driven by the World Bank and the IMF, is the official response to the need for debt relief, particularly at the multilateral level, but also involving substantial, if not complete, relief in respect of official bilateral debt. As originally conceived, the initiative is aimed at both (i) freeing the most heavily indebted poorest countries from the burden of the unpayable element of their debt and (ii) offering them a definitive exit from the debt treadmill which is seriously undermining their development.</P>
      <P>Following the recent review of the initiative, it has been substantially enhanced &ndash; the amount of debt relief on offer has been doubled and a wider range of countries is to get faster and deeper relief &ndash; and my concern now is that these improvements are fully financed. I would remind the Deputy that Ireland was to the fore in calling for such improvements, in particular <i>via</i> the submissions made by my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs to the review of HIPC which led to the improvements.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the wide public concern for a serious attack on the problem of unpayable debt which is reflected in the extent of popular support for Jubilee 2000. However, I am not convinced that a blanket call for debt cancellation is attainable, at least as far as multilateral debts are concerned. I would remind Deputies that the HIPC initiative also envisages substantial reductions in bilateral debt and I am heartened by the indications that an increasing number of countries are prepared to do so. We have been advocating and supporting this development in our international dealings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion the enhanced HIPC initiative is the only realistic mechanism through which multilateral debt relief for heavily indebted poor countries can be achieved. Successful and timely implementation of the enhanced framework would create an opportunity for further enhancement, which I would fully support and consider vital for future growth and development in HIPC countries. In this regard, I am particularly concerned that the number of countries processed to date falls short of projections under the enhanced HIPC framework and I am also somewhat disappointed at the amount of pledges to the HIPC trust fund that have been converted to paid-in contributions. Given these concerns, the Deputy <Col N="1500" /> can be assured that I will use my best endeavours to press for the full and speedy implementation of the HIPC initiative, both in terms of the number of countries processed and also its financing.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that Ireland is contributing fully to the enhanced initiative. We are also participating in the alleviation of bilateral debt relief in relation to some of our priority aid countries even though our own bilateral assistance has been in the form of grants. Ireland contributed £12.1 million in 1999 to the debt relief package and is committed to payment of a further £2.9 million by 2008.</P>

      <P>Under the Establishment Order of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, IBTS, the service charges for the blood components, blood products and services it provides to hospitals. The cost of such components, products and services increased by 2% on 1 January 2000 to take account of general cost increases in the health services during the year and the ongoing implementation of the service's development programme. Health agencies received a 2% increase in their overall non-pay allocation for 2000 to cover price increases such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1503" /> The Deputy may, however, be referring to the 48% rise in the price of blood and blood components on 1 January 1999. This level of increase ensured a substantial additional investment in the service in order to meet the highest international standards in transfusion. The additional income was used to fund, <i>inter alia,</i> the full year costs of the blood safety programme including the costs of the new blood tests, PCR and leucodepletion, the additional costs of ensuring regulatory compliance, the additional costs of implementing the service's reorganisation plan and the additional costs of implementing the service's consultant manpower, quality assurance and training plans.</P>
    <P>The IBTS continues to implement an efficiency programme to achieve greater economy and effectiveness without compromising blood safety.</P>
    <P>My Department allocated approximately £6.4 million additional targeted funding to health agencies in their allocations for 1999 to cover the increased cost of blood and blood components. This increase was in addition to the general increase allocated to them to cover non-pay price rises during the year.</P>

      <P>I assume that the report that the Deputy is referring to is the Mid-Western Health Board's 1998 Annual Review of the Child Care and Family Support Services. The Deputy should note that according to the report, while the number of reported cases has increased from 407 to 803 between 1990 and 1998, the number of confirmed cases has dropped by 12% over the same period.</P>
      <P>The rise in the number of reported cases is part of a national trend which has arisen due to a number of factors. These include greater public awareness arising from high profile reports of child abuse cases such as the Kilkenny incest investigation and the Madonna House inquiry. It is anticipated that the implementation of the Protection for Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act, 1998, may lead to a further increase in the number of reported cases of child abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware Children First &ndash; National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children have been issued and additional funding has been made available to all the health boards to facilitate their implementation. Since 1997 approximately £2.3 million in additional funding has been allocated to the Mid-Western <Col N="1504" /> Health Board to strengthen and further develop child care and family support services.</P>
    <P>Resourcing decisions are made against the background of regular contacts between officials of my Department and officials of the health board. As a result of this the allocation for 2000 includes funding given specifically for the implementation of the Children First &ndash; National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children. It will be used for staff training, the further development of child protection services, establishment of a child protection notification system and the strengthening of the child protection investigation procedures.</P>
    <P>In addition, extra capital resources are being allocated in the national development plan for investment in child care and family support services. Indicative figures for capital funding to be provided under the national development plan have issued to health boards and the details are being worked out between the health boards and my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health Research Board is the statutory body with responsibility for health research in Ireland.  Its functions are to promote, assist, commission or conduct medical, health and health services research and such epidemiological research as may appropriately be carried out at national level, to assist and support other health agencies in promoting or conducting epidemiological research and to liaise and co-operate with other research bodies in Ireland or elsewhere in promoting, commissioning or conducting relevant research.</P>
      <P>This Government has made a significant commitment to the Health Research Board and this is shown by the significant increase in funding since 1997. As part of my commitment to ensuring that the HRB is properly resourced I have provided additional funding of £2 million which will increase its allocation this year to £9.503 million. This is approximately 2.5 times the 1997 original budget of £3.835 million and demonstrates the importance this Government attaches to the role of health research in achieving health and social gain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there are no formal mechanisms for co-ordination in place the HRB liaises and co-oper<Col N="1506" /> ates with a number of bodies in areas of common interest. These links are determined by the nature of the research. In the area of data gathering and with regard to the national intellectual disability database for example, the HRB has formal links with the health boards. In areas of research funding it liaises with hospitals and health boards. It also has informal links with Enterprise Ireland to ensure there is no double funding of research projects.</P>
    <P>The Health Research Board and the Higher Education Authority have jointly commissioned the consultancy group PREST to carry out a study of research infrastructure &ndash; equipment and facilities for science and technology in the Irish universities. A report on this study is expected to be completed in June 2000. The board is also represented on the implementation group established to advise the Government on the new strategic research foundation.</P>
    <P>The board participates in a tripartite arrangement with Enterprise Ireland and the British Council to encourage collaboration on an east-west basis. In addition there are international research contracts in place between the HRB and the Wellcome Trust and the HRB and the United States National Institutes of Health. My Department is party to a memorandum of understanding between the Northern Ireland Department of Health and Social Services and the US National Cancer Institute to promote an all island approach to cancer research.  </P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that there is already in existence a North-South co-operation project grants scheme aimed at promoting co-operation between researchers on both parts of the island.  This year for the first time, the scheme is being co-funded by the Health Research Board and the Northern Ireland R&amp;D Office.  I have made an additional £500,000 available to the HRB for North-South research and when this is matched with funds from the Northern Ireland R&amp;D Office a total of £1 million for North-South co-operation research will be available this year.  </P>
    <P>The Health Research Board has commissioned the CIRCA Group Europe to carry out a survey of expenditure on health research in Ireland and the final report is due later this month. Preliminary data suggests that the annual expenditure on health research in Ireland in 1998 was in the region of £20 million excluding that spent by the business sector.</P>

      <P>I am concerned at the possibility that placenta may have been used in the 1990s in the production of cosmetics. However, I am pleased to note the quoted assurance given by the Master of the National Maternity Hospital that this was not the case with regard to placenta shipped to France from that hospital.</P>

      <P>The Health and Safety Authority has overall responsibility for advising on and enforcing health and safety legislation and regulations. Health agencies, as with all other employers, have the responsibility for ensuring workplace health and safety.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>In view of this special provision, I do not feel it justifiable, nor did previous Governments on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means or in the case of children, to their parents means as a general rule. It is, of course, open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness refers to the fact that health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme and will consult with the social partners by the end of 2000. Particular emphasis will be placed on the <Col N="1511" /> needs of families with children, and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits.</P>

      <P>The fluoridation of the public piped water supplies is an important programme for the protection of dental health and is subject to the provisions of the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960, and various regulations made under the Act. The safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation as a public health measure have been evaluated frequently by the World Health Organisation and other reputable authorities, such as the Health Research Council of the United States, and concerns about adverse health effects have not been substantiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October 1999, the faculty of public health medicine of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland issued a report which endorsed the safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation &ndash; I have <Col N="1515" /> arranged for a copy of this report to be forwarded to the Deputy. All the reputable scientific evidence confirms the safety of fluoride when it is available in public piped water supplies at the optimal levels. These levels are the same as those required under the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960. A survey of adult dental health carried out in 1991 found no significant difference in regard to general health status between fluoridated and non-fluoridated areas.</P>
    <P>If an authoritative body in this country or internationally indicates that there is an issue of public health significance relating to the use of fluoride in water which should be investigated my Department would support this research in the usual manner.</P>

      <P>The Registration of Births and Deaths Acts, 1863 to 1996, and the Marriages Acts of 1844 and 1863 provide that An t-Árd Chláraitheoir shall retain certified copies of the records of births, deaths and marriages returned to him on a quarterly basis by local registrars and that he shall compile and make available an index to such records at his office. Persons are entitled, under statute, to search these indexes on the payment of the approved fees and to obtain certified copies of entries identified from the index.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, a joint programme of work, aimed at modernising the civil registration service, is being undertaken by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and my Department, which will involve the review of the entire registration system, including registration law, the structure of registration on a national basis in order to identify the changes necessary to capitalise on the use of modern technology to capture registration information in an electronic format at the point of registration in a modern, efficient and legally adequate system. It is the intention that the system will incorporate a link to all life events associated with each person. The objective is to implement a modern, efficient and effective sys<Col N="1518" /> tem geared to the needs of the 21st century. Funding of £7.3 million for the modernisation programme was approved in 1999.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also be aware of the steps that are being taken to maintain and improve indexes to the records of births, deaths and marriages, including the special project for the capture of the records of births, deaths and marriages and associated indexes in an electronic format which has been ongoing in Roscommon for some time. When this archival records project is completed, it will improve the efficiency, flexibility, access and management of the records and the associated indexes and will provide potential for the development of a range of services, which would not be possible in a system reliant on printed indexes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 307 and 346 together.</P>
      <P>The professional body responsible for standards and practices in pathology in Ireland, the faculty of pathology, Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, has circulated guidelines which cover consent arrangements for post-mortem examination and, in particular, the retention of tissue-organs for further diagnosis, teaching and research. The faculty has recommended to its fellows that specific consent for retention of tissue for such purposes be sought for all post-mortem examinations. The faculty considers that it is essential to be explicit in relation to this issue and the guidelines have been issued to all members of the faculty.</P>
      <P>The chief medical officer of my Department wrote to the chief executive officer of each health agency on 9 December 1999, asking them to ensure that a policy of informed consent by next of kin to the carrying out of a post-mortem and retention of tissue-organs operates in each health agency.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the guidelines of the faculty of pathology, which will ensure that tissue and organs will only be used for diagnostic, treatment and research purposes when explicit consent has been obtained from next of kin, will form the basis for best practice in this area.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that on 9 February 2000 I announced my intention to hold an inquiry into post-mortem examination policy, practice and procedure in the State and that on 4 April 2000 I outlined the details of the inquiry to be held. The inquiry will be non-statutory and will be conducted in two phases. The first phase will be chaired by an eminent senior counsel who will present me with a report of the inquiry's findings within six months.</P>
      <P>On receipt of this report I will then table a motion that the report be presented to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children. The committee, on considering the report, will come to its own conclusions having regard to the terms of reference of the inquiry, holding a public hearing and calling witnesses as appropriate.</P>
      <P>I understand that it is an established practice among hospitals to transfer organs to other hospitals' laboratories, both in Ireland and the UK. This most commonly arises where a second opinion is required or when technical or professional expertise available in a different institution is required.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the inquiry provide for a review of post-mortem examination policy, practice and procedure and therefore any issues in relation to the transfer of organs to other medical institutions may be reviewed.</P>

      <P>Section 59 of the Health Act, 1970 provides for the supply of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances under the general medical services scheme and the community drugs schemes. I have brought forward proposals to amend section 59 of the Health Act, 1970, in the recently published Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 2000. My purpose in amending section 59 of the Health Act, 1970, is to improve and update the statutory basis for the regulation of the schemes, to promote an equitable and more accountable service and to better provide for the delivery of community pharmacy services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should explain that Council Directives 85/432/EEC, 85/433/EEC and 85/584/EEC deal with the mutual recognition of qualifications in pharmacy. Attempts were made by the European Commission on several occasions to introduce measures which would facilitate the free movement of pharmacists. However, restrictions in most member states on the freedom of pharmacists to open new pharmacies became a major stumbling block to the adoption of any Council directives which would provide for the free movement of pharmacists. Member states that had restrictions on the opening of new pharmacies were unwilling to remove them and other member states, including Ireland, were unwilling to support a measure which would impact unfairly on their own graduates. For example, while Irish graduates were restricted from opening pharmacies elsewhere, their peers from other member states were not restricted from opening pharmacies in Ireland and in other countries with no con<Col N="1523" /> trols. Eventually, a compromise proposal was worked out which provided for a derogation incorporated in Article 2.2 of Council Directive 85/433/EEC which was a derogation from the obligation to recognise EC qualifications in respect of &ldquo;new pharmacies,&rdquo; in this case pharmacies which have been in operation for less than three years. Regulations were then made in this country to give statutory effect to the directives.</P>
    <P>Issues arising from unrestricted pharmacy openings were later addressed in Ireland by the introduction of the Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations, 1996. However, these regulations quickly became the subject of a judicial review and it was decided to defer any change to the regulations dealing with the mutual recognition of qualifications until all legal issues concerning the Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations, 1996 were resolved.</P>
    <P>My view is that the derogation in Article 2.2 of Council Directive 85/433/EEC is not a satisfactory solution in the longer term. The Deputy will appreciate, however, that it would be premature to amend the regulations providing for the mutual recognition of qualifications until all legal issues concerning the Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations, 1996, have been resolved.</P>

      <P>Respite care is provided in a number of ways. In some cases it is provided in a residential setting. It is also provided by host families through the various &ldquo;Share a Break&rdquo; schemes. The home support services can also provide shorter respite breaks for carers. These services enable agencies and health boards to respond to each family's needs in a flexible manner and with a package of care which is designed in consultation with the carers.</P>
      <P>This year additional revenue funding of £35 million, with an annual cost of £45 million, has been allocated towards the development of new residential, respite and day facilities for persons with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to services for persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism, additional capital funding of £30 million has also been made available this year as part of an £80 million investment programme over the next three years to support these services. It is anticipated that the additional capital and revenue funding will enable a further 185 new respite <Col N="1524" /> places to be provided this year. This is in addition to the 80 respite places which were put in place in 1999. The Government is committed to meeting the identified needs of persons with an intellectual disability within a defined timeframe of three years starting with this major acceleration of investment this year.</P>
    <P>In relation to services for persons with physical and sensory disabilities almost 100 new respite places have been put in place over the past three years. Of the funding provided this year, £3 million, rising to £6 million in 2001, has been targeted at home support services.</P>
    <P>The additional funding provided this year for services for persons with disabilities brings the total revenue and capital funding provided by this Government to date to £188.7 million, with a full year cost in 2001 of £202.7 million.</P>

      <P>The Health Act, 1970, in section 15 provides that the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Acts, 1926 and 1940, should apply to the appointment of chief executive officers and other such offices under health boards as the Minister for Health and Children may determine from time to time with the consent of the Local Appointments Commissioners. In 1971, the then Minister determined that the Acts should apply to permanent posts with professional qualifications, to all <Col N="1525" /> grades of health inspector, posts of matron, deputy matron, assistant matron, chief nursing officer, assistant chief nursing officer, and to superintendent and assistant superintendent public health nurses.</P>
      <P>As a consequence, appointments to all such posts are made following open competition conducted by, and on the recommendations of, the Local Appointments Commission. The approval of the Minister to such appointments is not required. However, section 18 of the Health Act 1970, provides that the qualifications for the appointment of an officer to a health board shall be approved of or directed by the Minister. In addition, section 14(2) of the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996, provides that a person appointed as a chief executive officer of a health board shall hold office under a contract of service with the board upon such terms and conditions as may be determined by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently taking steps to devolve responsibility for recruitment to certain posts from the Local Appointments Commission to the health boards. While the range of posts to be devolved has yet to be finalised, it is envisaged that responsibility for recruitment to all top level administrative, professional and technical posts will remain with the Local Appointments Commission. My Department has invited a small group representing the Local Appointments Commission, the health boards and office for health management to prepare a protocol setting out the most appropriate procedures for operating a devolved system of recruitment, having regard to best practices in human resource management. The protocol is expected to be completed shortly and it will then be the subject of discussion with the relevant health service unions.</P>

      <Quest>the reason he will not allow the General Register Office to release to the National Library microfilm copies of the 19th century civil registers of births, deaths and marriages with accompanying indexes in view of the fact that this material is already widely available outside of Ireland through the Mormon Church based in Utah, USA; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The administration of the registration system is a matter for An tArd-Chláraitheoir, the Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages, and for local registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
      <P>The Registration of Births and Deaths Acts, 1893 to 1996, and the Marriages Acts, 1844 and 1863, provide that An t-Árd Chláraitheoir shall retain certified copies of the records of births, deaths and marriages returned to him on a quarterly basis by local registrars and that he shall compile and make available an index to such records at his office. Persons are entitled to search these indexes on the payment of the approved fees and to obtain certified copies of entries identified from the index.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The indexes to the records are printed and bound and are not in a microfilmed format. Indexes for a proportion of the more recent records are also maintained in an electronic format. As the Deputy may be aware, steps are being taken to maintain and improve indexes to the records of births, deaths and marriages, including the special project for the capture of the records of births, deaths and marriages and associated indexes in an electronic format which has been ongoing in Roscommon for some time. When this archival records project is completed, <Col N="1527" /> it will improve the efficiency, flexibility, access and management of the records and the associated indexes and will provide potential for the development of a range of services, which would not be possible in a system reliant on printed indexes. This project will benefit all customers of the registration service throughout the country, including persons who currently avail of the services of the reading room in the General Register Office.</P>
    <P>The General Register Office has taken a number of measures to improve its services, including the relocation to the public counter on the first floor in Joyce House in July 1999 to provide additional space in the public reading room. The refitting of the public reading room in the General Register Office is due to be completed in the next couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>The future development of the service will be considered in the context of the joint initiative being undertaken by my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to identify and implement the changes necessary to provide a modern and effective service based on the electronic recording of vital events.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Church of Latterday Saints has copies of indexes to some of the records of the General Register Office, which it obtained for religious purposes.</P>

      <P>As I advised the Deputy in my reply of 24 February, the need for a facility in Tralee is recognised by the Southern Health Board and it has included this project in its development plan for community hospitals. However, the board has indicated to my Department that the nature of the service to be provided by a community hospital in Tralee can only be determined after a range of other services relating to the care of older people are first put in place. These include assessment and rehabilitation units at Tralee General Hospital which are now in place; community support services such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy; a day hospital at Tralee General Hospital which is now in planning and the provision of a replacement community hospital at Dingle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The drug payment scheme is a community based scheme operated through community pharmacies. The rationale for this is to enable the community pharmacist to take responsibility for the total medicine therapy for patients and so promote the provision of total pharmaceutical care at community level. This facilitates the community pharmacist in reviewing the medicine therapy of the individual for whom the prescription is issued, including screening for any potential drug therapy problems such as therapeutic duplication and <Col N="1533" /> drug-drug interactions. Where patients are prescribed drugs at a hospital out-patients department it would be expected that these would normally be dispensed in a community pharmacy.</P>
      <P>Health boards were asked to notify hospitals at the introduction of the drug payment scheme of the arrangement for the supply of medicines through pharmacies with a community pharmacy contractor agreement. I am aware, however, that some hospitals were not notified pending the finalisation of some details in relation to the scheme. My Department will be asking health boards to ensure that all hospitals are now made aware of the situation.</P>

      <P>I have no function in the matter of fees charged by private nursing homes.</P>
      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, the health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care. However, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three rates of subvention payable, £70, £95, £120, in accordance with three levels of dependency, medium, high, maximum. The amount of funding allocated to supporting older people in private nursing homes has been significantly increased by this Government in recent years. For example, more than £5 million in additional funding has been allocated in the current year to provide for an increase in the number of people in receipt of subventions, their higher levels of dependency, resulting in more people receiving the higher rates of subventions, and the change in the regulations whereby the ability of <Col N="1534" /> adult sons and-or daughters over 21 years of age to contribute is no longer taken into account. The amount made available for the scheme this year is £38.4 million.</P>
    <P>My priority is to ensure that health boards have adequate resources to meet increasing demands.  The question of increasing the rates of subvention will be kept under review in light of the availability of funding and competing priorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Benzodiazepines are controlled drugs, tranquillisers, which are only available on prescription from medical practitioners. They are prescribed to help people cope with the distress caused by insomnia, anxiety, panic, epilepsy, muscle spasms and pre-surgical stress. I am aware that concerns have been raised about the inappropriate prescribing of these drugs to opiate misusers by a small number of general practitioners.</P>
      <P>As part of an external review of drug services for the Eastern Health Board, which was carried out in 1999, an analysis was made over a four month period of urine tests in five of the board's drug treatment clinics. This analysis showed that over that period 65% of the clients attending the clinics tested positive for benzodiazepines.</P>
      <P>The Misuse of Drugs (Supervision of Prescription and Supply of Methadone) Regulations, 1998, had a major impact on limiting the availability of methadone on the illicit market. The situation regarding benzodiazepines is, however, not as clear-cut as for methadone. Even in health board treatment clinics benzodiazepines may be legitimately prescribed to drug misusers, so there is an issue around determining clinical guidelines for management of drug misusers and appropriate dosages of various medications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's officials have written to all general practitioners on a number of occasions <Col N="1537" /> concerning the need for them to exercise caution when prescribing controlled drugs, including benzodiazepines. In the most recent letter, 30 August 1999, from my Department's chief medical officer to all general practitioners, he advised doctors to contact health board GP co-ordinators on best clinical practice in relation to the treatment of opiate misusers, and he gave contact names and phone numbers where assistance could be obtained. Under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984, of course, I have the authority to curtail or prohibit the prescribing or supply of controlled drugs by medical practitioners or pharmacists, where a need for such curtailment or prohibition is indicated.</P>
    <P>My Department is in the process of establishing a committee to examine benzodiazepine prescribing which will make recommendations on how misuse of these drugs can be reduced or eliminated.</P>

      <P>Decisions in relation to the allocation of funding for new developments in services for persons with disabilities, including those with autism, are a matter for individual health boards and are taken in line with the priorities which have been identified for each region through the established planning and consultative structures. This applies to both revenue and capital funding for new service developments. All of the capital funding available to my Department to support the development of services for persons with autism and those with an intellectual disability in 2000 has been notified to the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the property in Myshall, the relevant health board would be the South Eastern <Col N="1539" /> Health Board. The Minister understands from that board that no approach has been made by the society to the board concerning a proposed development for persons with autism in Myshall. While it is noted that the society has been interested in this property since January 2000, consideration of a proposal requiring funding at the level requested by it at this stage in the planning process for 2000 will pose particular difficulties for the board as the regional priorities for development have been largely determined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 357 and 360 together.</P>
      <P>The drug payment scheme, with a threshold of £42 per month per individual or family, was introduced on 1 July 1999 and replaced the drug cost subsidisation scheme, DCSS, and drug refund scheme, DRS. The primary aim of the scheme is to bring about important improvements over the previous schemes and the scheme is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
      <P>A common list of reimbursable items was introduced for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme to ensure equity in relation to the products reimbursed by the State under both schemes. The introduction of the common medicines list ensures equity between the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. This common list is subject to ongoing review and amendment as new products become available and additions and deletions are notified on a monthly basis. The list of reimbursable food items to which persons registered under the drug payment scheme are entitled is in line with those items available to medical card holders and includes breads, bread mixes, flours and pizza bases. It is considered that the range of such items available under State reimbursement schemes provides a reasonable choice and persons requiring items which are not reimbursable would be expected to meet the full cost of such items. There are no plans to include other coeliac foods in the common list.</P>
      <P>People who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the local health board has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person' s medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>

      <P>With regard to national roads, the National Roads Authority has overall statutory responsibility for the planning and supervision of works for the construction and maintenance of these roads. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government appoints the members of the authority, performs certain broad policy, financial, and quasi-judicial functions such as the approval of motorway schemes and road developments which are the subject of environmental impact statements, and sources the payment of block grants to the authority.</P>
      <P>However, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has no function in relation to the day-to-day administration and management of the work programme for national roads or in relation to the allocation of funds for individual projects. Accordingly, any submissions which may be received from local authorities in relation to national roads are directed to the NRA which has overall responsibility as outlined above.</P>
      <P>In relation to non-national roads, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is responsible for the allocation and payment each year of non-national road grants to local authorities which supplement own resources expenditure by them in discharging their function of maintaining and improving the non-national road network. Non-national road grants embrace a number of grant categories, both capital and current and include restoration maintenance and improvement grants, discretionary maintenance and improvement grants, block grants to urban authorities and specific improvement grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department seeks applications annually from all local authorities, including Kildare and Offaly County Councils, under the specific improvement grants scheme and also receives correspondence regularly from local authorities <Col N="1543" /> in relation to various aspects of the non-national roads programme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The correspondent suggests that, where incorrect maps or plans are submitted with a planning application and planning permission is granted on the basis of the maps or plans involved, the permission should be revoked automatically on receipt of a subsequent complaint. If incorrect maps and plans are submitted with a planning application, the planning authority has the power under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994, to request new maps or plans, once a permission is granted on the basis of particular maps or plans, the development must proceed in accordance with those maps or plans, otherwise, the permission is not valid and enforcement action may be taken against it. The Bill contains new rights for persons making complaints about non-compliance, strong new enforcement powers and severe penalties for breaches of the planning code. This should pro<Col N="1545" /> vide means of dealing with the correspondent's concerns.</P>

Block grant allocations to individual authorities are determined, as in previous years, on the basis of town size within various population bands. Variability in urban road grant allocations may of course arise from the requirements of specific road schemes which are assisted outside of the block grant programme.</P>

      <P>The disabled person's grants scheme is administered by local authorities in accordance with section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979, and statutory regulations made under that Act. It is, accordingly, a matter for the local authority to decide the level of grants in individual cases and the circumstances in which a grant may be paid. It is, of course, also a matter for the authority to ensure that there are no undue delays in the processing of applications for disabled person's grants.</P>
      <P>It is necessary for local authorities to assess applications to establish, in advance of approving funding, whether a particular applicant qualifies for assistance under the scheme and the amount of funding which can be approved. Any necessary costs incurred at that stage, if approved as part of the cost of the works, are eligible for grant assistance of up to 90%, subject to the overall grant limit, normally £14,000.</P>
      <P>In cases where an applicant faces a difficulty in meeting their portion of the total cost of the works involved, local authorities may assist through the provision of a house improvement loan.</P>
      <P>The Government, in partnership with the construction industry, has taken a number of steps to expand the capacity of the construction industry, including the house building sector. These include increasing the intake of apprentices into the building trades from 2,300 in 1993-94 to 5,600 in 1999-2000. In September 1999, the forum for the Construction Industry was asked to expedite a study of the capacity of the industry. The interim report of the Forum for the Construction Industry, Increasing the Capacity of the Construction Industry; was published in February. The broad thrust of the interim recommendations is being acted on and the forum's final report is due by the end of July.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should explain at the outset that the purpose of a performance bond is to provide the private or public sector client with a measure of financial protection from a third party &ndash; usually a bank or insurer &ndash; against any failure by the contractor to satisfactorily complete a project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Guidelines on bonding requirements for public sector clients are set out in paragraph 4.9 of Public Procurement &ndash; 1994 Edition, published by the Department of Finance-Government contracts <Col N="1553" /> committee. These guidelines indicate that performance bonds should not normally be required for main contracts below £200,000. The guidelines generally require performance bonds for main contracts in excess of £200,000.</P>
    <P>Performance bonds are normally for 25% of the value of the contract. However, the requirement for a bond, and the level of the cover required on individual projects, is at the discretion of the contracting authority, having regard to all factors concerning the project-contractor and the need to protect the financial interests of the authority. Where an authority decides to waive the normal bonding requirement, the retention sum withheld from the contractor &ndash; pending satisfactory completion of the project &ndash; is usually increased, with the agreement of the contractor.</P>
    <P>Paragraphs 5.8 and 5.9 of the report of the Strategic Review Committee on the Construction Industry &ndash; Building Our Future Together, 1997 &ndash; contained recommendations designed to ease performance bonding requirements. The Forum for the Construction Industry currently plan to arrange for implementation of these and other construction procurement recommendations with effect from 1 September 2000.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that the installation of indoor water and sanitary services is not excluded under the regulations governing the essential repairs grant scheme. The scheme is targeted at meeting the needs of elderly people living in unfit housing who would otherwise require rehousing by the local authority. The scheme enables basic repairs to be carried out to houses which cannot be made fit in all respects at a reasonable cost, so that they can continue to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation for the occupants. It is a matter for the local authority to assess the circumstances of each individual case and decide what works are necessary to prolong the useful life of the house for the occupants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1554" /> Significant improvements were made to the essential repairs grant scheme in the recent budget. The effective maximum grant was increased from £4,500 to £6,000, with effect from 2 December 1999. This should allow local authorities greater flexibility in relation to the type of works which may be carried out.</P>
    <P>My Department makes an annual allocation to each housing authority based on estimates of demand for the scheme provided by the authorities. Westmeath County Council's 2000 allocation for the payment of house purchase and improvement loans, disabled persons and essential repairs grants is £750,000, the amount requested by the county council. It is, of course, open to the authority to seek a higher allocation in the event of increased demand under any of these schemes.</P>

      <P>Under electoral law a presiding officer may of his own volition, or if so required by a personation agent, request any person applying for a ballot paper to satisfy him or her as to their identity by producing any one of a number of specified documents. Where a person fails to produce such a document or the presiding officer is not satisfied that the person is the person to whom the document relates, a ballot paper is not issued. Presiding officers have powers to direct a member of the Garda Síochána to arrest a person where they have reasonable cause to believe that personation is or has been committed and electoral law also provides for the offence of personation and appropriate penalties.

      <P>The scheme of thatching grants operated by my Department was introduced to assist in the renewal and repair of traditional thatched roofs. Last year I introduced significant improvements to the grant levels under the scheme. The basic maximum grant was increased from £2,400 to £3,000 and from £3,600 to £4,500 for houses on specified offshore islands. Grants are available to meet two thirds of the approved cost of works, subject to the maximum limits.</P>
      <P>I also introduced a new measure to assist lower income households, for whom the cost of maintaining a thatched roof imposes a particular burden. Householders with medical cards are eligible for thatching grants up to a maximum of £5,000 or £6,500 in the case of the specified offshore islands. In addition, in such cases the grant may cover up to 80% of the approved cost of the works subject to the maximum grant limits.</P>
      <P>There is no accurate data currently available to my Department regarding the number of thatched houses in Ireland or in Dublin. I currently have no proposals to further amend the terms and conditions of the scheme of thatching grants or to introduce further assistance for the repair and renewal of thatched roofs.</P>

      <P>Donegal County Council has been allocated over £15 million in central grants for non-national roads in 2000, an increase of some 44% on the initial 1997 allocation. During the same period, the discretionary maintenance grant to Donegal County Council has been increased by over 47% from £630,000 to £927,000, while the restoration maintenance grant has grown by 47% from £1.53 million, initial allocation, to £2.26 million.</P>
      <P>In addition, Donegal County Council will assign over £3 million from its own resources this year to non-national roads, making approximately £18 million available in total to the council for non-national road maintenance and improvement.

The educational qualification was maintained at leaving certificate level as this was considered to represent a suitable standard of general education. An exception was provided for persons with at least two years previous permanent and pensionable service in clerical officer or clerk-typist positions in local authorities or health boards. These people remain entitled to compete for local authority clerical officer positions irrespective of whether they have a leaving certificate. A further provision also exists for limited recruitment of clerical officers from among serving local authority employees with two years satisfactory <Col N="1558" /> experience without a need to satisfy the educational requirements.

Where a member or successive members of the tenant's family succeeded to the tenancy within 20 years of the commencement of the Act, the right to retain possession under the 1982 Act expires on 25 July 2002, subject to the tenancy lasting a minimum period of five years.</P>
      <P>My Department is examining the implications of the expiry of the protection afforded to successor tenants under the 1982 Act and any necessary decisions will be made well in advance of the expiry of the existing provisions. The outcome of the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector may have some implications for these tenancies.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 407 and 438 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To be entitled to an unemployment payment a person must satisfy the statutory conditions of being capable of, available for and genuinely seeking but unable to obtain suitable employ<Col N="1561" /> ment. Where a deciding officer decides that a person does not fulfil the conditions the claim is formally disallowed.</P>
    <P>From January 1999 to end March 2000 a total of 5,637 claims were disallowed on the grounds that the person in question failed to satisfy the statutory condition of genuinely seeking suitable employment. Of these 2,499 were claiming unemployment benefit and 3,138 were claiming unemployment assistance. In addition, 2,827 unemployment benefit claims and 6,098 unemployment assistance claims were disallowed on the grounds that the claimants were not available for employment. Details of disallowances for each month are set out in the following table. Figures are not maintained on a county by county basis as the geographical areas covered by social welfare local offices cut across county boundaries in many instances.</P>
    <P>Apart from those whose claims were disallowed for failure to fulfil the statutory conditions substantial numbers of persons withdrew their claims or ceased claiming following interview by my Department. These are not included in the figures quoted.</P>
    <P>If a person is dissatisfied with the deciding officer's decision he or she has a right of appeal to the social welfare appeals office. It is not possible to provide information on the outcome of appeals from the disallowances referred to. However, during 1999, 3,603 appeals relating to unemployment payments were received in that office. Of these, 1,865 related to unemployment assistance and 1,738 to unemployment benefit. These figures include persons disallowed for reasons other than the &ldquo;not genuinely seeking&rdquo; and &ldquo;not available&rdquo; conditions.</P>
    <P>Of the unemployment payment appeals dealt with by the appeals office during the period in question, 31% were decided wholly or partly in favour of the appellant and 69% were not successful.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, and to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and to carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance. It is also available to certain people with disabilities and people who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
      <P>An unrestricted free travel pass is issued to all visually impaired people under age 18 which enables them to travel during the normal restricted times. In addition, they are also issued with an unrestricted companion free travel pass that allows a person, aged 16 or over, to accompany the pass holder free of charge. Visually impaired people over 18 years who are attending a full-time long-term rehabilitative course recognised by this Department are also entitled to an unrestricted free travel pass. However, persons in open work situations are subject to the time restrictions of the pass.</P>
      <P>Time restrictions have been a feature of the free travel scheme since its inception on city bus services in Dublin, Cork and Limerick. There are no peak time travel restrictions on DART or suburban rail services provided by CIE and private transport operators in other parts of the country.</P>
      <P>The central issue in regard to time restrictions relates to capacity constraints. Time restrictions are in place because the transport companies concerned are under severe pressure from commuters travelling to and from work and school in the morning and evening.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 409, 411, 418, 433 and 435 together.</P>
      <P>Last December's social welfare budget package, which is the biggest ever social welfare budget allocation amounting to over £428 million on a full year basis, provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for a £4 a week increase in social welfare payments in general, including disability allowance. With an expected annual average inflation rate of 3% for 2000, this year's increases will be ahead of expected inflation, representing a real increase of 2.3% for recipients of disability allowance. In addition, special increases in the rates of qualified adult allowances are being provided as part of an overall strategy to increase this allowance to 70% of the main rate over the next three budgets. This means that the couple rate of disability allowance will increase by £7.80 a week, 6.7%, which represents a real increase of 3.6%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the process of aligning tax and social welfare changes by 2001, these increases are being paid four weeks earlier this year, from the <Col N="1564" /> beginning of May. This means that some 51,200 recipients of disability allowance will receive the increased rates of payment four weeks earlier than in previous years.</P>
    <P>In addition to the increases in the weekly rates of social welfare payments, last December's budget also provided for a number of other improvements for people with disabilities, including the payment of full-rate disability allowance to those in full-time residential care who are currently receiving a half-rate payment, which will result in an increase of £40.70 a week in such cases; and a 50% increase, from £50 to £75 a week, in the amount of income from rehabilitative employment which is disregarded for disability allowance purposes. This enhanced disregard has also been extended to those in rehabilitative self-employment.</P>
    <P>The submission made by the National Representative Council, NRC, which proposes increasing the disability allowance to £100 a week, raises two separate issues, namely, the adequacy of social welfare payment rates and the question of the additional costs associated with disability.</P>
    <P>With regard to the adequacy of social welfare rates, including the rate of disability allowance, it should be noted that the recently ratified Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides that over the next three years all rates of social welfare will be increased in real terms and substantial progress will be made towards a target of £100 a week for the lower rates of payment.</P>
    <P>The NRC has proposed that the rate of disability allowance be increased to £100 per week to compensate for the additional costs associated with disability. However, it should be noted that, in addressing the question of these additional costs, the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities distinguished between income maintenance needs and the additional costs associated with a disability. The commission recognised that people with disabilities incur additional costs regardless of whether they are in receipt of a social welfare payment or are in employment. It was for this reason they recommended that the additional costs associated with disability should be met through the introduction of a separate costs of disability payment to be administered by the Department of Health and Children and which would be paid regardless of the person's employment status.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains a commitment that the Departments of Health and Children, Social, Community and Family Affairs and Finance will set up and participate in a working group which will consult with the social partners to examine the feasibility of introducing a costs of disability payment.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the work of this group will be important in informing future policy in this area, and I look forward to receiving the results in due course.</P>

      <Quest>the measures he has taken since 1997 to improve the position of the elderly; his future proposals in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[12450/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The following sets out the substantial list of improvements which have been undertaken by this Government in order to significantly improve the position of older people.</P>
      <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium set a target old age pension rate of £100 by 2002. In last year's review of this Programme, the Government committed to the early achievement of the £100 commitment and, furthermore, extended it to all social welfare old age pensions by 2002. In addition, the review commits to increasing old age pensions in line with average industrial earnings over the lifetime of this Government. We are well on the way to achieving this with significant real increases in pensions rates over the last three budgets. In 1997 the maximum rate of the old age contributory pension at £78 per week equated to 28% of average industrial earnings. From this month the rate at £96.00 per week equates to over 30%.</P>
      <P>With the Social Welfare Act, 2000, the increases in the weekly payment have taken effect four weeks earlier than last year. Next year, I intend to bring forward this implementation date to coincide with the start of the tax year in early April 2001. I have also provided for a significant improvement in the structure of the rates band under the old age contributory and retirement pensions. From 5 May some 38,000 pensioners, who are on reduced rate old age contributory and retirement pensions, ranging from £81.90 to £86.60 per week have had their personal rate of pension increased to £94.10.</P>
      <P>In April 1999 I introduced a special old age contributory pension for self-employed people. This special pension is available to self employed people who were aged 56 or over in April 1988, and who have, at least, five years contributions paid since then. Payment is at a flat-rate of 50% of the standard maximum rate with equivalent increases for adult and child dependants.</P>
      <P>In this year's Social Welfare Act, I introduced a special pension targeted at people who had paid contributions prior to 1953 but failed to qualify for an old age contributory pension due to the operation of the yearly average test. This special pension is payable from this May, and is a flat rate pension, payable at 50% of the maximum personal rate, to any person who became insurably employed prior to 1953 and who, due to the yearly average rule, failed to qualify for pension or qualified for a pension at less than 50%, namely, £48 per week from May, of the standard maximum rate. To qualify, a person must have paid, at least, 260 contributions which may comprise all pre-53 contributions or a combination of pre and post-1953 insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1566" /> In November 1997, the minimum yearly average requirement for the old age contributory pension was reduced from 20 to ten. People with a yearly average of between ten to 14 contributions now receive a pension of 50% of the standard maximum rate, while those with a yearly average of between 15 to 19 receive payment at 75% of the standard maximum rate.</P>
    <P>I recognise that issues remain to be addressed in the area of homemakers. Therefore, I have asked my Department to review the existing arrangements for homemakers and bring forward proposals which I will consider in a budgetary context.</P>
    <P>A review of the free schemes was recently published by the policy institute, Trinity College, Dublin. The review put forward 12 priority proposals for consideration. I am pleased to say that I have already implemented, in budget 2000, two of these proposals as follows: provision for the extension of the free schemes to all people over 75 years of age regardless of their income or household composition, with effect from October 2000; provision for the extension of the free schemes to all people over 75 years of age regardless of their income or household composition, with effect from October 2000; free electricity allowance and free TV licence schemes to be extended to qualified carers, also with effect from October 2000.</P>
    <P>I also intend to move towards the establishment of a single household benefits scheme in future budgets. This will amalgamate the existing separate free schemes administered by my Department into a single household benefits scheme with a streamlined application process.</P>
    <P>From October 2000 new arrangements are to be introduced for the assessment of capital for non-contributory pensions. The first £10,000 of capital will be completely disregarded. Capital between £10,000 and £20,000 will be assessed on the basis of £1 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital; capital between £20,000 and £30,000 will be assessed on the basis of £2 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital, and capital above £30,000 will be assessed on the basis of £4 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital. These limits will be doubled in the case of a married couple. Also from October 2000, tapering of the qualified adult allowance is to be extended to recipients of the old age contributory and retirement pensions, to allow for an income range for a qualified adult of between £70 and £135.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of incapacity benefit from the United Kingdom. He applied for a fuel allowance under the national fuel scheme on 1 December 1999 but was refused this allowance as he did not satisfy the means condition.</P>
      <P>The national fuel scheme applies to persons in receipt of long-term social welfare, health board or certain social security payments from other jurisdictions who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. In order to be eligible, a person must be living alone or with persons who come within certain categories and must also satisfy a means test. The means condition currently applied is that any additional household income, over the relevant maximum pension rate, must not exceed £30 per week.</P>
      <P>At the time of his application the person concerned was in receipt of incapacity benefit from the UK of £102.41 per week sterling. Due to the exchange rate of the Irish punt against sterling the actual value of his UK payment in Irish punts was £124.88. As the corresponding maximum personal rate of an Irish invalidity pension was £75.20 weekly this meant that he exceeded the £30 income limit for receipt of fuel allowance. The movement in the exchange rate in the meantime has increased the value of his payment in Irish punt terms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 415, 416 and 425 together.</P>
      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week &ndash; £8 per week in smokeless zones &ndash; is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid-October to mid-April, regardless of the temperature. As a consequence, there may be a small number of occasions when the allowance is not paid even though temperatures are unseasonably low and equally, the allowance is paid at times when temperatures are above the seasonal norm.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the national fuel scheme increased by approximately 20% in the six years from £37.5 million in 1993 to £44.9 million in 1998. A sum of £46.4 million was provided in the Estimates for the scheme for the 1999-2000 fuel season which has just ended. The exact cost of the scheme is not available at this time.</P>
      <P>Based on the estimates for the fuel season just ended the cost of extending the fuel season for the full year would be an additional £46.4 million. To extend the duration of the scheme to include the months of May and June would cost an additional £1.8 million per week amounting to an additional £16 million for the two months in question. An increase of this magnitude in the cost of the scheme could only be considered in a budgetary context. I have no plans at this time to extend the fuel season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the national fuel scheme operates for a fixed period, there is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs at any time of the year. This operates in addition to the national fuel scheme. Under the SWA scheme, a person <Col N="1569" /> who has exceptional heating costs due to ill health or infirmity may qualify for a heating supplement. This can be paid as a weekly supplement in addition to other social welfare payments. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the special consideration, if any, he has given to actors who, by the nature of their work, are unemployed from time to time, but are generally faced with the response from the Minister's officials that where a person cannot show that they are making serious efforts to find work, their unemployment benefit payment will be stopped, and that they may not restrict their job-seeking efforts to particular sectors where no work is currently available.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Social welfare legislation provides that a person must satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work in order to be entitled to unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance. In applying the legislation, deciding officers do not treat actors any differently from any other unemployment benefit or assistance claimant.</P>
      <P>Where a person is seeking work in his or her usual employment and there is a reasonable prospect of securing work of that nature, he or she would normally satisfy the conditions for receipt of payment. However, if there is no employment available within a specialised field within a reasonable period of time, the unemployed person would be expected to broaden his or her search so as to include other types of employment.</P>
      <P>After a period of unemployment, a person would be expected to accept any employment for which he or she is qualified. Where a person is dissatisfied with a decision made by a deciding officer he or she may appeal this decision to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 420 to 422 inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the students summer jobs scheme since its inception in 1993 has been to provide useful work experience and income support for less well off third level students who do not have access to unemployment payments during the summer. Its main focus is on providing students with an income and the scheme was not designed to fill all the community based jobs offered by sponsors.</P>
      <P>While the level of projects offered has remained high over the past number of years there has been a significant decline in the number of students taking part. This is due to the growth in availability of well paid summer jobs in the private sector and is a welcome trend. To qualify for participation on the scheme students must first establish an underlying entitlement to unemployment assistance by satisfying a means test. I do not propose to alter this requirement. To do so would change the whole nature of the scheme and would impact on the resources available to help those students who need it most.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of 23,237 students applied to take part in the scheme in 1997 of whom 15,833 actually worked and 4,622 did not qualify for a variety of reasons. In 1997 sponsors offered a total of 30,189 <Col N="1571" /> jobs. In 1998, 20,930 applications were received and 13,600 students worked, 4,326 applications were rejected and 31,552 jobs were offered by sponsors.</P>
    <P>Last year the number of students who applied had dropped to 15,833 and only 9,200 worked. The number of applications rejected was 3,414 and the number of jobs on offer had dropped to 23,473.</P>
    <P>With regard to the specific cases raised, the first named person was requested to supply documentary evidence of his parents income on 3 June 1999 but failed to do so. No application was received from the second named person.</P>

      <P>Certain legal issues regarding the extension of this contract have been raised with the EU Commission by an interested third party. I understand from the Commission that it has not yet completed its examination of the arguments advanced by the complainant and the observations which have been supplied by my Department. I expect that the Commission will complete this process in the reasonably near future. However, the precise timescale involved is a matter for the Commission.</P>
      <P>It would be entirely inappropriate for me at this stage to speculate about the outcome of the Commission's deliberations on this matter. Likewise, it would be inappropriate for me to enter into conjecture about the action, if any, which may be necessary once the Commission informs Ireland of its conclusions in this matter. However, I remain confident that this matter can be satisfactorily resolved.</P>
      <P>The Government is aware of the importance to An Post of the income derived from the payments contract with my Department. I remind the Deputies, however, that my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, expressed the Government's commitment to maintaining a post office network and to examining the possibility of providing additional services through this network in the future.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the continued sense of anger and annoyance among women who are being discriminated against in relation to pension and other rights under the social welfare code due to the fact that they were out of the workforce caring for children for many years prior to 1994; the proposals he has to alter the existing homemakers scheme to allow women who were out of the workforce before 1994 to become eligible for various social welfare benefits; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>From 6 April 1994, years spent out of the workforce caring either for children up to the age of six, increased to age 12 from 6 April 1995, or incapacitated people may be disregarded in calculating the person's yearly average number of contributions for old age contributory pension purposes. A maximum of 20 years may be disregarded in this way. Provision is also made for the award of credited contributions in the year in which a person commences or ceases to be a homemaker. In addition, earnings of up to £30 per week where a person is engaged in part-time employment outside the home are also permitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>pro-rata </i>pensions which I introduced in November 1997 and the new arrangements to take account of pre-1953 contributions, which came into effect this month, will be of benefit to many women who have gaps in their PRSI records due to working in the home. However, I recognise that issues remain to be addressed in <Col N="1582" /> this area and some time back I ordered a review of this issue. The review of the homemakers scheme will be undertaken as part of the ongoing review of eligibility conditions for contributory old age pensions. I have asked that proposals be brought forward which I will consider in a budgetary context.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a suggested, but highly unlikely and unsubstantiated, threat to the solvency of some pension schemes is accepted by his Department as a valid excuse for not granting a statutory right to the preservation and revaluation of pension benefits earned in respect of pre-1991 service for private sector occupational pension scheme early leavers; if he will quantify the hardship this decision has caused to those people who were compelled to join these schemes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 196 of 23 February last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Pensions Board considered this issue in their report on the National Pensions Policy Initiative in 1998. The board concluded that to extend the preservation of benefits requirements to all pre-1991 service could call into question the solvency of some occupational pension schemes and, therefore, recommended that preservation of benefits for pre-1991 service should be introduced by 1 January 2001, revaluation of such benefits by 1 January 2006 and that funding standards in respect of these should be fully met by <Col N="1583" /> 2011 &ndash; for employees leaving schemes after 1 January 2001.</P>
    <P>The Pensions Board's concern regarding the potential solvency implications of placing additional and unplanned costs on schemes is reflected in the recommendation that schemes be given ten years to achieve funding for these increased costs. I am satisfied that the Pensions Board took all relevant factors into account in arriving at its recommendation not to extend the preservation requirements to all pre-1991 service and, as I indicated in my earlier reply, I take the view that in arriving at its conclusion the board struck a fair balance between the rights of pension scheme members and potential solvency implications for schemes.</P>
    <P>I propose to give effect to the board's recommendations in this area in the new pensions Bill which I plan to publish this year.</P>

      <P>The Department's grants schemes concentrate on a wide range of support for local self-help groups, community development, welfare rights and information work. These grant schemes are aimed at developing people and their capacity to participate in society, rather than at the provision of services or at direct economic development or job creation initiatives.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the group concerned has applied for funding of £9,000 under the year 2000 scheme of grants to voluntary organisations towards the cost of leasing, furnishing and equipping a premises. All applications under this scheme are currently being processed by my regional office in Sligo.

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to introduce a pro rata price reduction system for PRSI contributors receiving dental treatment in view of the fact that those who return from abroad to commence work in their twenties are penalised because of their age and are expected to pay PRSI for years before they can avail of reduced dental rates; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>An underlying principle of the social insurance system is that, to establish entitlement to benefit, a person must have been insurably employed and paid appropriate PRSI contributions for a certain length of time. The PRSI contribution conditions relating to entitlement to treatment benefit &ndash; which includes den<Col N="1585" /> tal benefit &ndash; vary depending on the age of the insured person.</P>
      <P>Persons aged under 21 must have at least 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work in order to qualify while persons aged from 21 to 24 must have at least 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year, of which a minimum of 13 weeks must be paid contributions.</P>
      <P>In the case of persons aged from 25 to 65, the requirement is that they have at least 260 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year of which a minimum of 13 weeks must be paid contributions.</P>
      <P>The PRSI contribution conditions for treatment benefit are generally in line with those applying to other contributory benefit schemes. These conditions are necessary to ensure the continuing viability of the scheme while directing limited resources towards those in greatest need, including dependent spouses of insured workers. They also ensure a realistic relationship between entitlement to benefit and a continuing or recent attachment to the workforce through an active PRSI contribution record.</P>
      <P>If a person fails to qualify for treatment benefit based on his/her Irish PRSI record, there is provision under the EU regulations for taking into account periods of insurance or employment in all member states to which the regulations applies in order to determine an individual's entitlement to benefit. In order for such periods to be aggregated it is necessary that the person was last insured or employed in the State in which benefit is claimed. In Ireland's case this requires the payment of at least one employment &ndash; PRSI &ndash; contribution.</P>
      <P>As regards dental benefit, an examination and scale and polish is available free of charge to the qualified claimant. In the case of fillings and extractions, my Department pays 70% of the agreed fee in accordance with the scale of fees negotiated on behalf of the dentists operating the scheme and the claimant pays the balance. An agreed fee also applies in the case of dentures with the claimant and the Department each paying 50%. For other treatments the Department pays a fixed contribution towards the cost and the claimant is liable for the balance charged by the dentist.</P>
      <P>While I have no plans at present to change the contribution conditions or to introduce a revised scale of fees as suggested by the Deputy, the qualifying conditions of all schemes are kept under constant review.</P>

      <P>Widow's and widower's pensions under the occupational injuries benefit scheme are paid at a higher rate than other social welfare payments. For example, following the general £4 increase which came into effect last week, the weekly rate of widow's pension under the occupational injuries benefit scheme has been increased to £99.40. This is £18.30 a week higher than the equivalent rate of social insurance widow's pension which is paid to widows under 66 years of age and £10.30 a week higher than the widow's pension which is paid to widows aged 66 and over.</P>
      <P>The aim of the special increases which have been given to those aged 66 and over since 1998 is to make progress towards achieving the Government's priority for the attainment of a minimum rate of £100 a week for all social welfare old age pensioners by 2002.</P>
      <P>The rate of occupational injuries benefit widow's pension which is payable to widows aged 66 and over will continue to be included in the commitment to achieve a minimum rate of £100 a week for all social welfare old age pensioners by 2002.</P>
      <P>The question of the appropriate relationship between the levels of payments provided for under the occupational injuries benefit scheme and the other social welfare payments is one of the issues which is being addressed in the context of the expenditure review of the illness and disability payment schemes, which is currently being carried out. The findings of this review will guide future policy in this regard and I look forward to receiving the results in due course.</P>

      <P>As indicated in a reply to a similar question from the Deputy on 2 March 1999, while the funding of the many activities addressed under the Boyne Valley integrated development plan is a matter for the individual executive agencies concerned as part of their ongoing responsibilities, a sub-programme specifically associated with the plan is also being pursued by my Department. Work being undertaken as part of this sub-programme includes the development of a long-distance walk between Slane and Oldbridge and improved access and information at Bective Abbey, Slane and Loughcrew.</P>
      <P>From 1997 to date, payments totalling £560,000 have been made to Meath County Council to enable work on these projects to get under way. Further allocations will be made as work progresses.</P>
      <P>Overall, I believe that progress has been made in the implementation of the elements of the BVIDP being administered by my Department. In addition to the projects I detailed, work on Trim Castle will be complete in the very near future, as will work on the restoration of Grange Castle, a project which allows for the creation of a western gateway attraction to the Boyne Valley near Clonard.</P>
      <P>I am also delighted to report that work is proceeding apace on the development of the Battle of the Boyne site.

      <P>Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, is responsible for the management of Killarney National Park including Ross Castle and the demesne. In relation to refuse control, experience has shown that the more dustbins that are provided, especially at carparks, the greater the amount of rubbish which is deposited and which is strewn around a site. Accordingly, as a general principle dustbins are not provided in national parks but as part of their duties the caretakers at Ross Castle and at the Visitor Centre at Gearhameen, Black Valley, also known as Lord Brandon's cottage, gather up litter etc. as appropriate.</P>
      <P>I understand that refuse bins are provided by the trustees of Muckross House Ltd. for their own operations at the restaurant and craft shop beside Muckross House. One of the conditions of contract stipulates that the concessionaires of the tea-rooms at Dinis Cottage and Deenagh Lodge are responsible for rubbish disposal at these premises.</P>
      <P>Killarney Urban District Council is responsible for the three carparks at Ross Castle and I understand that bins are not provided at these locations.</P>

      <P>In November 1999, I requested the Heritage Council to carry out a review of the existing policy that prohibits sports shooting on State owned lands coming within my control. Such lands include national parks, nature reserves and other sites that are protected for wildlife conservation. I understand that the review will focus on shooting with rifles or shotguns, its main aims being to consider the implications of the current policy for the management of the land in relation to nature conservation, recreation and access, health and safety; to consider what issues need to be addressed in relation to hunting and the management of the land; and to report on international best practice in relation to hunting, conservation and the management of sites designated for nature conservation.</P>
      <P>I await its findings and recommendations. I fully endorse the sentiment expressed in the Killarney National Park management plan; that if any conflict arises between different objectives, nature conservation must be treated as the over-riding one.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 456 and 457 together.</P>
      <P>There is no internationally adopted mechanism for determining and expressing moneys expended on the arts as a percentage of GNP as the parameters of what constitutes the arts have not been properly delineated internationally.</P>
      <P>I understand that the statistics office of the European Union, EUROSTAT, is attempting to develop a framework for the systematic collection of cultural statistics to allow for meaningful comparisons across the European Union without the current barriers that inhibit such meaningful comparison.</P>
      <P>The Arts Council recently commissioned a study by the International Arts Bureau of levels of arts expenditure in selected countries and regions. In publishing this study, particular attention was drawn to certain inexactitudes in the methodology employed and the caveats on international comparisons.</P>
      <P>For this reason, as I stated in reply to a similar question on 12 April 2000, I do not wish to read too much into the position of Ireland in any international league table. The programme for Government &ndash;  An Action Plan for the Millennium &ndash; gives a clear and positive commitment to the development of the arts in Ireland and since my appointment as Minister I have secured dramatic increases in funding for the arts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 458 and 459 together.</P>
      <P>Licences are issued under sections 32 and 34 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, which enables the Irish Coursing Club and its affiliated clubs to net and earmark hares which are a protected species under the Wildlife Act, 1976. Conservation rangers carry out spot checks on coursing club meetings to ensure the terms and conditions attached to the licences are adhered to.</P>
      <P>Based on reports received from the conservation rangers in relation to spot checks carried out on coursing meetings in the 1998-99 coursing season, a meeting was held between representatives of Dúchas, the Heritage Service, and the Irish Coursing Club on 23 July 1999. The matters raised in the discussions were as follows.</P>
      <P>Possibility of hares being coursed more than once on the same day: Dúchas raised this in relation to reports received from conservation rangers on a number of club meets at Borris in Ossory, Rathdowney, Tubbercurry and Millstreet. While the Irish Coursing Club had advised by letter dated 11 May 1999 that hares had not been coursed more than once at these meets, the club undertook to draw the attention of all clubs to the terms of the licences which restricted the coursing of hares taken more than once on the same day. Dúchas would draw the attention of conservation rangers to the use by clubs of a divided paddock to avoid the coursing of hares more than once on the same day.</P>
      <P>Clare South: Dúchas had requested further information in relation to a report received that 14 hares had died from an unknown cause at this meet. The coursing club advised that it was believed that stormy weather conditions had played a part but they would investigate further to see if facilities, practices or procedures could be improved at the meet to reduce such risk.</P>
      <P>Release of hares: Dúchas advised the ICC that arising from a report received in relation to the East Donegal Coursing Club meet, a number of hares had been released outside the jurisdiction. Technically, this amounted to an export of hares which would require a licence under the Wildlife Act, 1976. The ICC noted the situation and undertook to inform clubs of the situation and to address any problems arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Refusal of access to Dúchas staff: Dúchas staff had been refused full access to a coursing meet held by the Kilcreevan/Ballymote club and had <Col N="1595" /> withdrawn from the meeting in January 1999. Dúchas considered this matter as extremely serious and sought assurances from the ICC that this incident did not reflect the policy of the control body. The ICC had acted swiftly to secure access for Dúchas staff on the day following the incident. The ICC advised that its policy was to fully co-operate with Dúchas, all clubs were advised to co-operate and most clubs welcomed and encouraged the attendance of Dúchas officials.</P>
    <P>Applications for licences under sections 32 and 34 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, were received from the Irish Coursing Club in respect of the 1999-2000 coursing season. Having considered the application and all relevant information in relation to the 1998-99 coursing season, I decided to grant the licences but to exclude the Kilcreevan/Ballymote club from the terms of those licences.</P>
    <P>The exclusion of the Kilcreevan/Ballymote club from the terms of the licences granted to the Irish Coursing Club on 30 August 1999 was the subject of an exchange of legal correspondence between Dúchas and club representatives, informal representations to Dúchas and representations on behalf of the club to my office. As a result of these representations, I met a deputation of representatives of the club, led by Deputy Matt Brennan and Deputy Ellis on 2 December 1999. At this meeting, I took the opportunity to outline the functions and responsibilities of both myself, as Minister, and Dúchas staff under the under the Wildlife Act, 1976. In particular, I pointed out the need for full co-operation between clubs and Dúchas staff. I also undertook at this meeting to review the matter.</P>
    <P>Following my meeting with the deputation, I received a letter dated 21 December 1999 from the chairman of the Kilcreevan/Ballymote coursing club. In reviewing my decision in this case, I was conscious of the fact that my earlier decision to exclude the club from the licences issued to the ICC imposed a sanction on all club members because of the actions of a small number of individuals. Also, in their letter of 21 December 1999, the club had acknowledged that the full co-operation required between the club and Dúchas staff had not been present at the meeting in January 1999 and gave a formal undertaking to ensure that the necessary co-operation would be forthcoming at any future meetings. On this basis, I decided to issue the necessary licences under sections 32 and 34 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, to the Irish Coursing Club, to facilitate the holding of the Kilcreevan/Ballymote fixture in January 2000.</P>

      <P>A programme of works for 2000 is, therefore, not available at present but the Deputy will be pleased to learn that Kildare County Council has initiated some preliminary works to prepare the way to open the demesne to the public.</P>
      <P>In addition to Fingal County Council formally accepting the conditions attached to the grant, it is essential, as indicated in replies to previous questions on the issue, that the legal formalities transferring ownership of the relevant portions of the demesne to Kildare County Council and Fingal County Council, be completed without delay in order to progress the matter.</P>

      <P>Two forms of sign languages are commonly in use in this country as media for communication within the deaf community. The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities received a broad range of submissions from the different disability organisations and from individuals, including proposals for the recognition of Irish sign language as the language of deaf citizens and for education to be provided to deaf children through Irish sign language. Arising from its deliberations, the commission made 402 separate recommendations, including proposals relating to the education of deaf children and access to further education options through sign language. In this regard, the Education Act, 1998, has made provision for support services in respect of students learning through Irish sign language or any other sign language, including interpreting services. There are no proposals either in the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities or in my Department to give recognition to Irish sign language as the official language of the deaf community.</P>

Court buildings are selected for refurbishment based on certain criteria, including condition of the building, office locations, buildings in daily use, number of court sittings, caseload, etc. In addition, the Courts Service is making arrangements for a maintenance programme for its building stock which will ensure that courthouse accommodation is kept up to standard.</P>

Plans are at an advanced stage for the refurbishment of other courthouses, such as Limerick Circuit Court, Castlebar, Longford, Ennis, phase 2, Cork Circuit Court, phase 2, and Boyle, and many other projects are at the early planning stages.</P>

    <P>I should also add that crime prevention advice and security locks were provided to many elderly <Col N="1599" /> people from community alert and neighbourhood watch schemes which participated in the &ldquo;Alarms for the Elderly&rdquo; scheme run under the auspices of the Department of Social, Family and Community Affairs.</P>
    <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that senior citizen complexes in urban areas are visited and patrolled by mobile, beat, community and crime prevention gardaí. Elderly people living alone or in isolated areas are visited regularly. Community alert groups and neighbourhood watch groups are being encouraged at every opportunity to identify the needs of the elderly in their locality.</P>
    <P>Crime prevention officers use local print and radio media to give advice on security matters in relation to property and personal safety. The elderly are also advised on the availability of grants in aid of the purchase of security systems, and the importance of depositing cash savings in financial institutions. In terms of investigating crimes against the elderly, each Garda region has traffic checkpoints and other measures in place to deal with issues that arise in relation to the victimisation of elderly citizens.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am assured by the Garda authorities that the initiatives directed at crimes against the elderly are the subject of ongoing review to ensure an effective response to this type of criminal activity.</P>

      <P>My Department has been allocated £250 million over the course of the national development plan to improve child care provision throughout the country. The objectives of this child care funding will be to increase the number of child care facilities and child care places available and to improve the quality of our child care services. The establishment of community playgroups is part of this policy.</P>
      <P>On 28 April 2000, I announced the availability of grants nationally for community based/not-for-profit child care organisations and small scale private child care providers. I will forward a set of application forms to the Deputy for his information and further application forms and information on the schemes announced are available from my Department's equal opportunities child care section. A lo-call service line has been installed to respond to inquiries from the public following the announcement of these grants. The range of grants available under my Department's equal opportunities child care programme will enable us to meet the objectives set out above.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1600" /> Community groups and not-for-profit organisations, which includes community playgroups, can now apply for grants to establish, expand or upgrade child care facilities. They can also apply for staffing grants for full-time and part-time qualified child care staff which will assist them in their long-term planning and development.</P>
    <P>The measures I announced on 28 April will make a real difference to the future of child care in Ireland by increasing the number of child care places and improving the quality of child care services. The funding being made available will support the establishment, maintenance and expansion of services over the coming years. The range of these measures will ensure that the supply of quality child care will be increased, particularly in disadvantaged areas, and that these facilities will benefit from staffing supports for qualified child care workers.</P>
    <P>Apart from the grants I recently announced, my Department is currently putting in place initiatives which will allow us to support the development of child care training, the enhancement of services for the national voluntary child care organisations, the development of local child care networks and innovative projects in child care. These further initiatives will be announced in due course.</P>
    <P>My Department has been given responsibility for co-ordinating child care service delivery over the course of the national development plan. This involves the establishment of national and local structures to advance child care service provision.</P>
    <P>The measures I have outlined will allow us to substantially increase the number of child care facilities and places available, while ensuring that child care funding is targeted in a co-ordinated fashion throughout the country.</P>

      <P>While there has always been productive liaison between my Department and carriers with a view to ensuring that they are fully aware of Irish immigration requirements, the increase in the number of persons entering the State illegally in recent years calls for the introduction of new measures specifically designed to tackle this phenomenon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill, 1999, which is currently awaiting Report Stage in the Dáil. The purpose of the Bill is to target the profiteer or professional trafficker in humans by creating an offence of trafficking in illegal immigrants and asylum seekers and providing a framework by which those engaging in such trafficking can be dealt with <Col N="1601" /> under the law. For an offence to be committed under the Bill assistance &ndash; for profit &ndash; must have been knowingly given to the illegal immigrant or asylum seeker to enter the State and the person facilitating the entry must have known or have had reasonable cause to believe that the person was an illegal immigrant or asylum seeker.</P>
    <P>The intention, therefore, is that the bona fide operations of carriers such as airlines, ferry companies or haulage operators would not come within the scope of this offence. However, where any operator decides to go beyond or abuse such bona fide operations and for profit intentionally assists illegal immigrants and asylum seekers to enter the State, then such activity may be punishable on indictment by this Bill, when enacted, by unlimited fines or up to ten years imprisonment or both.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the detention of vehicles suspected of being used for the purpose of committing or facilitating the commission of an offence of trafficking in illegal immigrants or asylum seekers. Where a person is convicted on indictment of such an offence the court may, in addition to any penalty it may impose, also order the forfeiture of the vehicle used for the commission or facilitating the commission of the offence.</P>
    <P>I am also examining the question of legislation to create a system, on the lines of schemes in operation in many countries throughout the world, whereby carriers will be expected to carry out rudimentary checks to ensure that passengers being boarded for carriage into the State from outside the common travel area are in possession of valid passports and, where necessary, visas. Such a scheme would involve co-operation between the Irish immigration authorities and carriers in assisting carriers to fulfil their obligations and penalties for non-fulfilment of those obligations. I intend to bring these proposals before Government as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Directorate for Asylum Support Services, which was established in November 1999 under the aegis of my Department, is responsible for accommodating and co-ordinating the provision of services to asylum seekers. This includes the provision of information concerning services and locations at which asylum seekers are accommodated. Under arrangements in place since 10 April, asylum seekers are being accommodated by the directorate at initial reception centres in Dublin for a period of one to two weeks for the purposes, <i>inter alia,</i> of needs assessment and information provision, before being resettled at other locations around the country.</P>
      <P>It is not clear why the Deputy refers to the Garda in the context of providing information, or who the Deputy has in mind in terms of who is seeking information. The provision of general information concerning services for asylum seekers is a matter for the directorate, which has a co-ordinating role, and not the Garda. The directorate has an information unit and staff attached to the unit are happy to answer inquiries from any person seeking information concerning services for asylum seekers. I should also add that it is the policy of the directorate to establish local support groups, which include directorate staff, in areas where asylum seekers are resettled and this helps to facilitate the provision of information on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of Garda manpower, that there are no plans for increased opening hours at Clogheen Garda station. I am also informed that there are already arrangements in place to cater for any person requiring Garda assistance at times when the Garda station is unmanned. The &ldquo;greenman&rdquo; facility and telephone call diversion system, both linked to the district headquarters at Cahir, come into operation at such times. Also, patrolling of the area is augmented by district patrol cars as the need arises.</P>
      <P>With regard to the provision of additional resources, it is the policy of the directorate to make contact with the relevant service providers, such as the health boards, prior to accommodating asylum seekers in a given locality. It is a matter for the agencies concerned to make an assessment, having regard to demand, whether services can be provided from within existing resources or require additional resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, the directorate is currently developing a policy document in relation to all aspects of reception of asylum seekers, including the development of regional and local structures to support policy and enhance the provision of services, including provision of information. It is envisaged that the policy document will be com<Col N="1604" /> pleted in the near future and I intend to bring proposals in this regard to Government shortly.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any undue delay on the part of my Department in the processing of the visa applications in question. Two of the four applications were approved within two weeks of their receipt. In respect of the other two applicants, their hosts in Ireland were asked to provide additional information relating to their commitments to their country of residence in order to enable a decision to be reached. As no additional information was received, my Department refused the latter applications because it had not been established, on the basis of the documentation supplied, that the applicants would observe the conditions of their visas.</P>

      <P>In the light of urgent accommodation requirements for asylum seekers and pending the construction of permanent accommodation, the Government, on 28 March 2000, approved my proposals for a mix of temporary accommodation to meet current projections in relation to the number of places required. Specifically, the Government has approved the provision of 4,000 places in prefabricated accommodation, 1,000 places in mobile homes and 1,000 places in flotels.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Directorate for Asylum Support Services, in consultation with the appropriate authorities, is continuing to examine the suitability of accommodation offered by proprietors of hotels, hostels, guesthouses and other privately owned properties throughout the country in response to media advertisements placed last autumn. It is anticipated that approximately 2,000 places can be made available in this way.</P>
      <P>Intensive efforts are being made to source suitable berthages for flotels. No decisions have yet been taken regarding locations.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware that I have increased Garda numbers in the past three years by 600 members and am on course to meet the Government target of a Garda strength of 12,000 by the year 2002. While I, as Minister, am responsible for providing additional Garda personnel, their detailed allocation to an individual area is a matter for the Garda authorities.</P>
      <P>I am informed, in this regard, that the allocation of Garda personnel and resources to an individual area is carried out with due regard for a number of factors in the various Garda districts throughout the country. The following factors have particular relevance in assisting with the efficient and equitable allocation of Garda personnel resources: population, geographical area, crimes reported per annum, number of road traffic accidents involving personal injury, number of stolen cars received and depreciation indicators. While the above factors have particular relevance in assisting with the efficient and equitable allocation of personnel, different Garda districts have differing attendant sources of the above variables and it is the overall balance of these, and not individual indicators taken in isolation, which prescribe the recommended allocation of available resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1610" /> The Garda authorities have informed me that the population of the geographic area policed by the Garda from the Carlow-Kildare division as set out in the 1996 census figures is 170,734. The current Garda personnel strength for the Carlow-Kildare division is 305, all ranks. This gives a population/garda ratio for Carlow/Kildare of 1:559.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have also informed me that the 1996 census contains the most recent population figures for the country and, as such, are the figures relied upon in calculating population to garda ratios. They have also informed me that local management is satisfied that the best possible Garda service is being provided in the Carlow/Kildare division with the current deployment of resources.</P>
    <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the situation will be kept under review and that when additional personnel next become available, the needs of Carlow/Kildare will be fully considered in the overall context of the needs of other Garda divisions throughout the country.</P>

      <P>The Directorate for Asylum Support Services, which was established in November 1999 under the aegis of my Department, is responsible for accommodating and co-ordinating the provision of services to asylum seekers.</P>
      <P>Under the system of direct provision in place since 10 April last, the directorate has been accommodating newly arrived asylum seekers in full-board accommodation. The directorate has entered into contracts with the proprietors of hotels, hostels and guesthouses for the provision of such accommodation. The Office of Public Works has also purchased and leased certain properties on behalf of the directorate for the provision of full-board accommodation to asylum seekers and has identified a number of public sector sites suitable for development under the accommodation programme for asylum seekers. It is a general function of the Office of Public Works to lease and purchase properties on behalf of the State. Where necessary, I have made orders under section 2 (2) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1993, which allows, for reasons of emergency, for exemption from the provisions of the Planning Acts.</P>

Every applicant for supplementary welfare allowance is subject to a means test.

      <P>My Department has been allocated £250 million over the course of the national development plan to improve child care provision throughout the country. The objectives of this funding will be to increase the number of child care facilities and child care places available and improve the quality of our child care services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 28 April 2000, I announced the availability of grants nationally for community based-not-for-profit child care organisations and small scale <Col N="1612" /> private child care providers. I will forward an application form and details to the Deputy and further application forms and information on the schemes announced are available from my Department's equal opportunities child care section. A lo-call service line has been installed to respond to inquiries from the public following the announcement of these grants.</P>
    <P>Community groups and not-for-profit organisations, as well as self-employed child care providers catering for not more than 20 children at any one time, can now apply for grants to establish, expand or upgrade child care facilities. Community groups and not-for-profit organisations can also apply for staffing grants for full-time and part-time qualified child care staff which will assist them in their long-term planning and development.</P>
    <P>The measures I recently announced will make a real difference to the future of child care in Ireland by increasing the number of child care places and improving the quality of child care services. The funding being made available will support the establishment, maintenance and expansion of services over the coming years. The range of these measures will ensure that the supply of quality child care will be increased, particularly in disadvantaged areas, and that these facilities will benefit from staffing supports for qualified child care workers.</P>
    <P>Apart from the grants I recently announced, my Department is currently putting in place initiatives which will allow us to support the development of child care training, the enhancement of services for the national voluntary child care organisations, the development of local child care networks and innovative projects in child care These further initiatives will be announced in due course.</P>
    <P>My Department has been given responsibility for co-ordinating child care service delivery over the course of the national development plan. This involves the establishment of national and local structures to advance child care service provision. The national co-ordinating child care committee will co-ordinate the delivery of child care funding under the national development plan and oversee the development of a child care infrastructure throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The co-ordinating structures also include county child care committees whose role will be identification of local &ldquo;black spots&rdquo; and priority objectives for the county in the provision of child care and to put forward proposals for alleviating the position, development of a local child care information strategy, development of quality statements and targets for the county, liaison with my Department and the national co-ordinating child care committee regarding local developments, development of local networks of child care providers and assessing needs and proposing initiatives specific to that county.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that the local structures will provide a means for effective planning and targeting of resources where they are most needed. <Col N="1613" /> Membership of the committee will comprise local child care representatives of the statutory and non-statutory sector.</P>
    <P>Officials from my Department's equal opportunities child care section recently gave a presentation to the chief executive officers from the county enterprise boards on the strategy for the development of child care provision over the life of the national development plan which I have set out above.</P>
    <P>In view of the above, it is not intended to establish any special funds or grants under the equal opportunities child care programme for administration by the county enterprise boards.</P>

However, the severe shortage of accommodation in all areas of the State, allied to the continuing increase in asylum applications, is giving rise to enormous difficulties in meeting the basic needs of asylum seekers.</P>

      <Quest>if the concerns raised at the public meeting (details supplied) in Dublin 7 regarding anti-social behaviour by a small minority of youths in the area and the need for the utilisation of greater Garda resources in the area will be fully responded to by the Garda authorities; the measures that will be taken; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that having identified and reviewed policing problems affecting Cabra west, a policing strategy has been drawn up and implemented. This two pronged strategy addresses the areas of law enforcement and Garda interaction with the public.</P>
      <P>With regard to law enforcement, I am informed that areas of high anti-social behaviour have been identified. These areas are now the subject of extra foot patrols and extra mobile patrols during peak times. With alcohol consumption identified as being a factor behind the majority of anti-social behaviour, licensed premises and off-licenses have been inspected and owners advised on the relevant legislation with regard to selling to the underage and the penalties for such breaches.</P>
      <P>I understand that the high visibility policing has resulted in favourable comments from the residents of Cabra west, and that a number of arrests have been made for public order offences and other crimes.</P>
      <P>The second prong of the Garda policing strategy is focused on Garda interaction with the public. I am informed that there is now a full-time community police garda unit attached to Cabra Garda station, with specific responsibility for Cabra west area. This has resulted in a greater positive interaction between the gardaí and residents of Cabra west, and it is intended to further develop relations with the community.</P>
      <P>To this end, the gardaí have been proactive in highlighting the community awareness about the drug problems. A drug awareness meeting was held in the Cabra sub-district. This was a public meeting that met with a favourable response from the community. It is hoped to hold a similar meeting targeting junior and leaving certificate students prior to the results being issued with a view to making them aware of the dangers of alcohol and drug consumption on celebrating exam results.</P>
      <P>Trips have been organised for local community groups to visit prisons, showing the reality of prison life. Community gardaí are involved in visiting the elderly, sports and social groups in the area. The local community gardaí are involved in the steering committee of the John Paul Park Project, a £3 million sports development to target at risk people, and they are also involved in initiatives in Dunard estate, such as the pony club and schools programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Garda resources in the area, I am informed by the Garda authorities that Cabra is policed by both Cabra and Mountjoy Garda stations. Some 73 gardaí of all ranks are stationed in Cabra, and 79 in Mountjoy. Four gardaí are <Col N="1616" /> assigned to the community policing unit in Cabra with responsibility for Cabra west. One garda from the community policing unit in Mountjoy is assigned full-time to the same area. I am assured by the Garda authorities that local management is keeping the manpower needs of the area under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Public discussion and commentary about the issue of the treatment of sex offenders frequently implies that there is only one form of rehabilitation programme in place for sex offenders in prisons and that it reaches a very limited number of prisoners annually. This is incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are actually four forms of direct therapeutic intervention available to sex offenders within the prison system at present. All four are aimed at enabling such offenders gain some measure of control over their personal tendencies towards offending behaviour. The first intervention method is individual counselling from my Department's psychology service and from the Probation and Welfare Service. This is a largely demand led service to individual prisoners who ask for help. The second intervention is a multi-disciplinary thinking skills group work programme which focuses on issues such as anger management, evasion of personal responsibility and relapse prevention. This programme is in place in Cork Prison and Arbour Hill Prison since <Col N="1620" /> 1998. The third intervention which tends to receive most media coverage is an extremely intensive offence focused group work programme which is available in Arbour Hill Prison and which is delivered by officers of the probation and welfare and psychology services of my Department. All convicted sex offenders, regardless of the institution in which they are held, are invited to apply for inclusion in this programme. The fourth intervention which perhaps deserves greater acknowledgement involves the psychiatric service which provides extensive support to prisoners in this category. This is done on a sessional basis, and a call-out basis as well as in response to particular individual crises.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Director General of the Prisons Service to ensure that the treatment of sex offenders throughout the prison system is given priority attention. A working group chaired by the Director General and comprising representatives of all the relevant agencies and prison disciplines is currently overseeing the introduction of a number of interventions for sex offenders in the Curragh.</P>
    <P>The first step being taken involves the expansion of generic therapeutic services in the Curragh. The Probation and Welfare Service and the psychology service of the Department are recruiting extra staff at present and it is intended that the Curragh will have priority in the allocation of resources. A member of the psychology service and a probation officer have already been assigned to duties in the Curragh. They will be joined in their work with offenders at the Curragh by further members of their services as the roll out of support services for sex offenders at the prison continues.</P>
    <P>The sequence which will be followed at the Curragh will be as follows: analysis of response by individual prisoners and staff to circular from Governor as to their willingness to participate in the new programme; training of local staff in all disciplines and services in thinking skills programme is ongoing; delivery of first modules of thinking skills programme, late summer 2000 and roll-out of intensive sex offenders treatment programme later in the year 2000 drawing particularly on successful offender participants in the thinking skills programme at the Curragh.</P>
    <P>The thinking skills course referred to above was introduced in Arbour Hill and Cork Prisons early in 1998. It is designed to target a range of offenders including sex offenders, particularly with a view to motivating the latter group to engage in the most intensive programmes. The course is run by multi-disciplinary teams, including prison officers, probation and welfare staff and teaching staff under the guidance of my Department's psychology service. The skills taught in this programme include general strategies for recognising problems, analysing them and considering non-criminal alternatives, how to consider the consequences of their behaviour &ndash; to think before they act, how to go beyond their <Col N="1621" /> own view of the world and consider the thoughts and feelings of other people and how to develop the ability to control their own behaviour and avoid acting impulsively. This programme is considered by the Director General and his advisers to be the preferred first line of approach to rehabilitating sex offenders in custody as in many cases it builds up their frequently low personal motivation to address offending behaviour in depth.</P>
    <P>When the intensive sex offenders treatment programme is introduced in the Curragh during the current year it will be operated by the Probation and Welfare Service and psychology service in the same mode as the current Arbour Hill programme.</P>
    <P>I have also been advised by the Director General that he has deputed a senior member of his transition team at Prison Governor level and another colleague to investigate the possibility of extending the range of multi-disciplinary group work programmes with sex offenders here based on successful interventions which have been developed in prisons in Scotland and England in recent years. This study is not expected to be completed until early next year.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the interventions I have described are beneficial and appropriate. The ultimate objective for the Prisons Service is to develop and put in place a wider range of rehabilitation programmes for sex offenders than are currently available, to ensure they operate on independently accredited selection, training and service methods and that they reach every sex offender in custody who is willing to participate at some level in their personal rehabilitation and relapse prevention. The latter point about willingness by prisoners convicted of sex offences to co-operate in personal rehabilitation programmes is significant because it is the experience in many prison jurisdictions including Ireland that a significant percentage of prisoners decline the opportunity to partake in this work. Compulsion is not a realistic or indeed legal option in such cases.</P>
    <P>A major review of the effectiveness of the intensive Arbour Hill sex offender programme is currently under way between the psychology service of this Department and the department of psychology, University College, Dublin.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to self-employed child care providers. My Department has been allocated £250 million over the course of the national development plan to improve child care provision throughout the country. The objectives of this funding will be to increase the number of child care facilities and child care places available and to improve the quality of our child care services while seeking to ensure that existing child care services are not displaced by the introduction of new measures in the child care area.</P>
      <P>On 28 April 2000, I announced the availability of grants nationally for child care providers including self-employed child care providers. Application forms and information on the schemes announced are available from my Department's equal opportunities child care section. The types of funding available are capital grants to establish, renovate or upgrade child care facilities for child care facilities for community based/not-for-profit groups or organisations including a community based/not-for-profit consortium of private-business interests and local community groups; capital grants to build, renovate or upgrade child care facilities for self-employed child care providers catering for not more than 20 children at any one time and staffing grants to support staffing costs for community based-not-for-profit groups or a consortium of local community groups and private-business interests.</P>
      <P>Eligible projects must be directly related to the development and provision of child care facilities and must be sustainable. Under EU regulations, a project will be deemed ineligible if work commences before the applicant is notified of my decision on the individual application.</P>
      <P>Each individual application will be assessed by Area Development Management Limited and an appraisal committee. The appraisal committee will then refer the application to my office for a final decision.</P>
      <P>With regard to the level of funding available to self-employed child care providers, applicants must have secured a minimum private financial contribution of 35% of the cost of the project and the grant size will be up to a maximum of £40,000.</P>
      <P>I believe that the measures which I have outlined above will make a real difference to the future of child care in Ireland by increasing the number of child care places and improving the quality of child care services. The funding being made available will support the establishment, maintenance and expansion of services over the coming years, particularly in disadvantaged areas.</P>

      <P>While the school referred to by the Deputy has been in receipt of grant assistance under this scheme for the past two years, the rate of the grant this year has increased from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 527 and 533 together.</P>
      <P>The funding levels to which the Deputies refer reflect the different models of service involved in catering for children in dedicated special facilities and catering for children in integrated settings in mainstream classes.</P>
      <P>The start-up grant paid in the case of newly established special classes reflects the need to provide the basic materials and equipment required for the operation of such classes. The role of the resource teacher is to support special needs children in existing ordinary classes which will already have access to a significant amount of materials and equipment which will be accessible to the special needs child and the resource teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1632" /> Capitation funding is intended to contribute to the general operating costs of schools. It is not intended to meet the special equipment requirements of children with special needs. All children attending special schools and special classes attached to ordinary schools attract a special rate of capitation funding. The rate of £263 to which the Deputies refer is paid in respect of children attending special facilities for children with a mild general learning disability. All special facilities operate at significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios and the higher capitation rates paid in respect of children attending such facilities are intended to ensure that the standard operating costs which apply equally to such classes can be met notwithstanding the smaller number of children involved.</P>
    <P>A separate funding allocation is available to meet special equipment needs arising in relation to children with disabilities, whether in special schools, special classes or in integrated settings. In the current year, a sum of £845,000 is available for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Under the IT 2000 programme, each ordinary primary school has been allocated a basic grant of £2,000, together with a grant of £5 per pupil. Each special school has received a basic grant of £3,000 together with a grant of £20 per pupil. In addition, a sum of £500,000 has been made available in the current year to meet special equipment needs of individual special needs children, whether in special schools or special classes or in integrated settings.</P>
    <P>Also, as part of the IT 2000 programme, arrangements are currently being made for the payment of an information technology grant of £700 to each resource teacher to facilitate the purchase of relevant hardware and-or software items.</P>
    <P>I will continue to monitor the above arrangements to ensure that adequate funding is made available to support schools in catering for children with special needs.  </P>

      <P>I have set the tackling of educational disadvantage as a priority and will be bringing forward proposals for a major initiative to address the needs of pupils who are encountering educational disadvantage in the primary system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a first step in this process, the educational research centre recently issued a comprehensive questionnaire to all primary schools, including the <Col N="1633" /> school to which the Deputy refers. The responses from schools, which are now being assessed by the Educational Research Centre, will allow for an accurate identification of levels of disadvantage in every school, including the school in question.</P>
    <P>Based on the levels of need identified, my objective is to introduce a range of significant and specifically targeted interventions which will ensure that disadvantaged children will receive the support they require to enable them to succeed in the education system. The interventions in question will take the form of extra teacher support or extra funding, or both, depending on the nature and level of need identified.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the needs of the school to which he refers will be fully considered as part of this process.</P>

      <P>This case is the subject of ongoing correspondence between my Department and the parents.</P>
      <P>The approach of my Department is that it is the responsibility of each individual secondary school to ensure that appropriate school based measures are put in place through which pupils, parents and the school can deal with difficulties which might arise. Where parents are concerned about their children's educational needs, they are advised to bring their concerns to the attention of the school principal in the first instance. If the matter cannot be resolved at that level, the assistance of the board of management should be requested. Where the matter remains unresolved, and a pupil continues to experience difficulty in school, my Department may approach the school authorities, seeking their observations on the matter, at the request of the parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The young persons concerned in this case previously attended secondary schools, which are privately owned and managed institutions. My Department does not have the power to compel a school to take any specific action or to compel a secondary school to release records held on individual pupils other than those specified in The Rules and Programmes for Secondary Schools, 1999/00. These specified records consist of the pupil details provided by parents when enrolling their children, along with details of the <Col N="1634" /> subjects and programmes undertaken by the pupil while in the school. As this is the case my Department can only attempt to resolve a problem, or to obtain school records of a pupil other than those specified in The Rules and Programmes for Secondary Schools, 1999/00, through a process of negotiation and persuasion.</P>
    <P>Following the original correspondence from the parents, my Department communicated with the parents and requested specific permission to seek the observations of the respective school management authorities on the parents' correspondence. Following recent receipt of this permission, my Department is now in the process of referring the parents' correspondence to the school authorities and will attempt to resolve the difficulties arising between the parents and the schools.</P>
    <P>The parents of these young people have been advised that the national educational psychological service, NEPS, can be accessed through the school that their children currently attend. The advice of NEPS is usually sought where a pupil is experiencing difficulty in school and where the school and parents agree to seek the advice and recommendations of an educational psychologist on how to best meet the pupil's educational needs.</P>

      <P>Enrolment in second level schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of individual schools and my Department does not interfere in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking second level places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
      <P>The national educational psychological service &ndash; NEPS &ndash; is available to all post primary schools recognised by my Department. NEPS can advise on the management of any difficulties that pupils might experience and which may present problems in a school setting. Where appropriate, it can also advise on any educational supports which might be required to ensure that a pupil's time in school is as productive and positive as possible.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the circumstances concerning the pre-school referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The Early Start pre-school programme was introduced in 1994. It is currently in operation on a pilot basis in 40 primary schools catering for a maximum of 1,680 children and focuses on areas of particular disadvantage.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the White Paper on Early Childhood Education &ndash; Ready to Learn &ndash; sets out a blueprint for the development of the sector. The White Paper will build on existing provision and assist providers to raise quality of provision. Support will continue to be made available for a range of existing initiatives, including Early Start. In addition, the State may become involved in further direct provision in certain instances, where the educational needs of the White Paper priority groups &ndash; disadvantaged children or children with special needs are not being met by existing State-funded services.</P>
      <P>Initial planning for implementation of the recommendations made in the White Paper is currently under way in my Department. My officials are currently in discussion with parties involved in the early childhood education area with a view to implementing the White Paper proposals and establishing the necessary structures. This process will be concluded shortly.</P>
      <P>Detailed planning concerning White Paper proposals will be undertaken once these structures are in place and the consultation process completed. In advance of this detailed planning, it is not possible to determine the nature and extent of support for early childhood education to be made available in specific areas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 541 and 542 together.</P>
      <P>Children with Down's Syndrome have access to a range of special education services. The precise nature of the response provided is determined by the level of need involved in each individual case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some situations, particularly where the condition is mild in nature, the child's parents may wish that he/she attend an ordinary school on a fully integrated basis. As a result of a Government decision of October 1998, all children with special needs within the primary system, including children with Down's Syndrome, now have an automatic entitlement to the support they require to enable them to gain maximum benefit from the education system. The support in question may take the form of extra resource teacher support or child care support, or both, depending on the particular needs involved. Already, as a result of <Col N="1639" /> this development, the number of resource teachers deployed in the primary system has increased from 104 to 329. The number of special needs assistants helping such children has increased from 295 to 937. Further such resources will continue to be allocated as required by special needs children.</P>
    <P>In some situations, the needs of the child can be such that placement in a special school or a special class attached to an ordinary school may be the most appropriate response. My Department provides a range of such facilities all of which operate at significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios and receive special increased levels of capitation funding.</P>
    <P>The need to provide 1:1 tuition would only arise in exceptional cases involving very serious levels of special need. All such cases are dealt with on an individual basis.</P>

    <P>(Dr. Woods): It is the policy of my Department that Traveller children be educated in age-appropriate classes in an integrated setting. There is a range of supports in place to assist the education of Traveller pupils: my Department employs a national education officer for Travellers; sanction is granted for the appointment of a resource teacher for Travellers in primary schools where a minimum of 14 Travellers is enrolled. Where this obtains, enhanced capitation grants are paid in respect of Traveller children; the rate for Traveller pupils under 12 years of age is £171. The rate is £372 in the case of those aged 12 years and over. There are at present 430 resource teachers for Travellers serving 388 primary schools. Since 1998, my Department has made funding available under the IT2000 initiative to facilitate the provision of computer equipment to primary schools with a special class for pupils with special needs or the service of a resource teacher for Travellers. Each school receives a once-off grant of £1500 plus £20 per special needs pupil or per Traveller pupil. A nationwide service is provided by 30 visiting teachers for Travellers, who provide advice and support for schools and for Traveller families.</P>

      <P>To date, my Department has sanctioned the appointment of 556 full-time special needs assistant posts and eight part-time posts to special schools. A further 430 full-time special needs assistant posts and 230 part-time posts have been sanctioned to support children with special needs in special classes attached to mainstream schools or attending mainstream schools on a fully integrated basis.</P>

    <P>The support of special needs assistants is made available across the spectrum of special needs. The level of support provided is based on the nature and level of the special need involved. The special education review committee made specific recommendations regarding the level of special needs assistant support which should be made available in respect of 11 different categories of special need. My Department seeks to ensure that its response is in line with the committee's recommendations. With this in mind, my Department is currently examining the level of special needs assistant support in place in all schools catering <Col N="1643" /> for children with special needs to ensure that the recommended levels of support are made available in all such cases.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September of the previous year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is drawn up each year following discussions with the managerial authorities and the INTO.</P>
      <P>The enrolment in Dunboyne national school declined from 457 in September 1998 to 448 in September 1999. The number of pupils required to retain the 16 mainstream class teacher for the 2000-01 school year is 450. Accordingly, the school will lose the 16 mainstream class teacher at the end of the current school year.</P>
      <P>If the school authorities are confident that the enrolment of the school on 30 September 2000 will exceed 478 pupils they may apply to the primary payments branch of my Department for the allocation of a teaching post under &ldquo;developing school&rdquo; criteria.</P>
      <P>The criteria required for attaining &ldquo;developing school&rdquo; status are outlined in circular 15/99 which my Department issued to all schools last year.</P>

      <P>The child in question is enrolled in the special class dedicated to children with autism at St. Peter's Boys national school, Greenhills, Dublin 12. This class can cater for a maximum of six children and has the services of a teacher and a special needs assistant.</P>
      <P>In November 1998, the Government announced its formal recognition of the distinct educational needs of certain children with autism. Arising from this development, special dedicated provision is now made available for such children at a pupil teacher ratio of 6:1. Each special class also has the support of a special needs assistant. To date, more than 50 special classes have been established to provide dedicated educational support for children with autism and my Department is currently pursuing the establishment of additional special classes in a number of locations throughout the country.</P>
      <P>In some cases, parents of children with special needs, including autism, may wish their children to attend school on a fully integrated basis. Arising from a Government decision of October 1998 all such children within the primary system now have an entitlement to an automatic response to their needs. The response may take the form of extra teacher or extra child care support, or both, depending on the needs of the individual child. Already, as a result of this decision, the number of resource teachers in the primary system has increased from 104 to 329 and the number of child care assistants has grown from 295 to 937.</P>
      <P>In the particular case of children with autism, there is also a need for additional support services such as speech and language therapy and occupational therapy. These services are provided on an outreach basis through the relevant health authorities. My Department works in close co-operation with the health authorities in arranging to have these services put in place.</P>

If a pensioner has died during the month, pension is payable only for the part of the month up to the date of death. Before issuing this balance to the estate of the deceased, my Department must establish as far as possible who is properly entitled to receive payment. Where probate of will or letters of administration are available, payment of the balance is made to the executor or administrator on production of the relevant document to my Department. In other cases the balance due to the estate is paid on receipt by my Department of a duly completed declaration made before a peace commissioner.</P>

      <P>As stated in my reply to Question No. 256 on 19 April 2000, as a matter of general policy new primary schools are co-educational. This reflects the fact that the promotion of co-education is current Government policy and has been Government policy since the early 1980s.</P>
      <P>Given developments whereby parents are exercising choices for their children's education in terms of gaelscoileanna, denominational and multi-denominational schools, there are obvious economies of scale in providing co-educational rather than separate single-sex schools. However, this is not the overriding factor but rather that co-educating children of both sexes together is in keeping with the concept of equality between the sexes and provides a better basis for developing co-operative but equal roles for men and women in adult life.</P>

      <P>An amount of £5 million was provided in the 1999 budget to provide grants to schools that set up and run after school child care services. My Department is currently formulating details of a scheme for an after schools support service in consultation with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, which has also been allocated £5 million to support community based groups to develop after school child care services in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that my Department's scheme will be confined to schools in disadvantaged areas. In the case of the primary sector, schools will be selected on the basis of criteria being developed by the Educational Research Centre for the new more targeted child centred programme being introduced following a survey of all primary schools. The grant to each school would cover the cost of a co-ordinator and other personnel and would include other operating costs such as insurance, heating and lighting. It is envisaged that this scheme will be operational in the schools selected by September next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has also provided £2.3 million this year for child care to support access of par<Col N="1648" /> ticipants to Youthreach, Traveller Training Centre programmes for early school leavers and the vocational training opportunities scheme for the unemployed. The funds are allocated to the vocational education committees for direct provision of crèches, purchase of places on existing commercial or community crèches and for the payment of childminders subject to compliance with tax and registration requirements under the Child Care Acts.</P>
    <P>A total of £74 million has been provided in the national development plan for the implementation of the proposals in the White Paper on Early Childhood Education &ndash; Ready to Learn.</P>
    <P>Initial planning for implementation of the recommendations made in the White Paper is currently under way in my Department. Key principles underpinning the White Paper are that implementation will be undertaken on a phased basis and that progress will be achieved through a process of consultation with interested parties.</P>

      <P>In the case of academic scholarships, fees and maintenance grants are paid by the host country. In the case of summer scholarships financial assistance is also provided by the host country. It generally covers the cost of the course and a small subsistence grant.</P>
      <P>These offers are advertised, on behalf of my Department, by the Government Information Services and are also circulated to all universities and other third level institutions by my Department.

      <P>Unfortunately, and despite further extensive searches within my Department, it has not been possible to locate the missing cassette recording. Due to the fact that it is not possible to state at which stage of the process the cassette was mislaid, it is not possible to definitively state how many people were involved in handling the cassette. However, a maximum of three people would have been involved and these three people cannot now find any trace of the missing recording. I also confirm that it is just one cassette that is missing and that this cassette would have included the recording of two oral examinations.</P>
      <P>While at this stage it is unlikely that the cassette will be located, I again state that the fact that the tape has not been located does not in any way invalidate the results of the examination. The marks that were awarded by the examiner were on the basis of the candidate's performance on the occasion of the oral examination and not on a later listening to the cassette recording. My Department's offer to make an inspector available to meet with the person in question to offer advice on the oral Irish examination, and to make the examiner's notes in relation to the October examination available, continues to stand. No response to this offer has yet been received by my Department.</P>

      <P>The measure the Deputy is referring to is contained in the Education (Welfare) Bill, which is currently before this House. This Bill will provide for a new structure for the regulation of school attendance, including, <i>inter alia</i>, the establishment of a national educational welfare board and a nationwide service of educational welfare officers.</P>
      <P>The basis for the measures referred to by the Deputy is my concern to protect the educational welfare of the children of the State. In situations where children are frequently missing school, for whatever reason, it is clear that there may be a danger to their educational welfare. The Education (Welfare) Bill, therefore, contains a mechanism to ensure that principals will report the fact that a child has missed the prescribed number of school days to the local educational welfare officer. The educational welfare officer will then assess the reasons as to why the child has missed school and consider whether the educational welfare of the child may be at risk. In situations where there is no such danger, for example, due to a once-off illness, no further action may be necessary. However, in other situations, this mechanism will act as an early warning indicator, to allow both the school and the National Educational Welfare Board to intervene to assist and support the child to protect that child's right to education.</P>
      <P>In relation to the specific number of days chosen, 15, I have listened carefully to the views put forward, both at the recent Committee Stage discussion on this Bill and indeed more generally from concerned groups. I am considering this matter further for the Report Stage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Schools in Westmeath have recently received details from the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland &ndash; RPII &ndash; of the outcome of a survey of radon gas in the buildings.</P>
      <P>This survey of all primary and post-primary schools was undertaken by the RPII at the request of my Department following indications of a problem with radon.</P>
      <P>The results of the first phase of the three year national survey relating to 685 schools in counties Carlow, Cavan, Kildare, Kilkenny, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow have been issued to the schools concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1659" /> These results indicated that none of the rooms tested in 511 schools had a radon concentration above the reference level set of 200 &ndash; Bq/m3 &ndash; above which remedial action is advised.</P>
    <P>Of the remaining 174 schools the RPII advised that 13 schools, showing the highest level of radon, none of which were in Westmeath, require attention as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>My Department has appointed a consultant to undertake this work. Mitigation programmes for five of these schools have been prepared by the consultant, contracts placed and the necessary works almost completed. The remaining eight schools have been inspected by the consultant and appropriate mitigation programmes are expected in my Department shortly.</P>
    <P>The consultant will then consider and advise on the most suitable mitigation programme for the remaining less-affected schools. Priority will be given to the areas of greatest need. In the absence of the advice of the consultant I cannot say at this juncture when the appropriate action will be taken in schools in Westmeath.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to specify the likely cost of the overall radon mitigation programme for schools in Westmeath but I am pleased to say that the full cost of the programme will be borne by my Department.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I recently announced improvements in this scheme which entail all schools with 100 pupils or more receiving annual grant assistance from this Department at the rate of £40 per pupil, £20 in respect of secretarial assistance and £20 in respect of caretaking assistance. My Department recently issued these grants to 1,295 qualifying schools. Of the 1,295 qualifying schools, 1,105 were paid at the rate of £40 per pupil. The other 190 schools were paid at the rate of £20 per pupil as these schools were already in receipt of funding towards either secretarial or caretaking services under the Department's existing 1978-79 schemes.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that with effect from September of this year, I will be extending the scheme to all primary schools. In addition I will be setting a minimum grant of £2,400 which will be payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1660" /> The improvements outlined above mean that with effect from September 2000 all primary schools will be receiving an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999, has increased this year to approximately £12.2 million and will further increase in 2001 to approximately £16.8 million.</P>

      <P>Pupils with autism, including those with Asperger's Syndrome, have impairment in the area of social skills. This impairment is manifested by their inability to understand the behaviour of other people and to relate to them accordingly. The aim of social skills training with children who have Asperger's Syndrome is to improve their understanding of other people's, and their own, non-verbal behaviour, so that they are enabled to interpret the meaning of social situations. Pupils also need to be equipped with the correct responses to certain social situations.</P>
      <P>Specific skills such as greeting people, conversation skills, making eye contact, having appropriate posture, gestures, facial expression among others need to be agreed and taught in social situations, in school and at home. Training in social skills is a matter for co-operative effort between parents and schools and forms part of the programme to be followed in school and at home with children who have Asperger's Syndrome.</P>
      <P>I have recently announced the establishment of a task force on autism to examine models of provision and to make recommendations to me within three months.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy's question relates to the statutory definition of a mature student, for the purpose of the scheme, as being a person of not less than 23 years of age.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the higher education grants scheme, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</P>
      <P>When assessing the means of students other than mature students, the Acts specify that the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not a mature student.</P>
      <P>The other student support schemes have similar provisions in relation to the means assessment of students. I have previously indicated that it is recognised that these provisions can give rise to difficulties in individual cases and that my Department is examining the issues involved. This examination is still under way and it will be concluded as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The position is that the person in question gave service as a teacher in Ireland in the 1960s and has also given service as a teacher in Australia. Her service in Ireland from September 1961 to 1 July 1962 is non-pensionable as it was given in a substitute capacity. Her service in Ireland from 2 July 1962 to 2 September 1962 and 2 September 1963 to 26 August 1969 was given as a member of a religious order in schools that were funded under the capitation system and in which the members of the religious order were not paid personal salary. This service was not pensionable when given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of changes negotiated at the conciliation council for teachers in recent years, service given on the approved staff of capitation schools may be reckoned for pension purposes in full in the case of any teacher who is employed in pensionable service on or after 1 February 1996. A contribution of 6% of pay at retirement is payable in the case of service given from 1 July 1968 <Col N="1668" /> when the national teachers' superannuation scheme became a contributory scheme.</P>
    <P>The service between 1962 and 1969 may be reckoned only if the person referred to by the Deputy returns to teaching in Ireland in a temporary or permanent capacity before reaching compulsory retirement age, that is, before 31 August 2009. Any pensionable service given on return would be aggregated with the service from 2 July 1962 on ultimate retirement.</P>
    <P>There are no reciprocal arrangements at present between Ireland and Australia for the transfer of occupational pension rights.</P>

      <P>My Department is not aware that pupils from the Kill area are experiencing any particular difficulty in obtaining second level places in the Naas or Rathcoole centres. I can further confirm that my Department has not received any application from County Kildare VEC for the provision of a second level school in Kill village.</P>
      <P>The general situation in relation to the centres in question is that, following a recent evaluation of post-primary school requirements for the Naas area, building projects were approved for all three schools in the centre. Two of these projects will provide additional permanent accommodation, at Meánscoil Iognáid Rís and St. Mary's College. The third involves the refurbishment of St. Patrick's vocational school, which currently has in excess of 160 vacant pupil places.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Rathcoole centre, a building project was carried out in 1994 to increase pupil capacity to 825 pupil places. This capacity compares with a current enrolment of 769 pupils.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, the indications are that there is sufficient second level school accommodation in the general area to meet the current demand. However, the area will continue to be closely monitored by my Department to ensure that any emerging additional requirements are addressed as expeditiously as possible.</P>

      <P>The national policy advisory board of the national educational psychological service &ndash; NEPS &ndash; has been set up to advise me on the development of that service. The board will be advising me on possible strategies to meet the current need for psychological support in schools, taking account of evidence of disadvantage, incidence of special needs and the level of access to other psychological services. In the interest of equity, it is proposed that new psychologists will be distributed on a <i>pro rata</i> basis among the regions, until each has reached its target number, which will be determined by the evidence of need. During the development phase of NEPS, the needs of all schools, including those in north County Kildare, will be considered by the board when assigning new psychologists to schools. Under the Government's plans it is envisaged that all schools will have access to the psychological service by the end of 2004.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a scheme, introduced in 1978, for the employment of school secretaries under which it meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. While the salary is funded by my Department, it is the board of management of each individual school which is the actual employing authority. This scheme was superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
      <P>On 1 April 2000 there were still 216 secretaries employed under this earlier scheme. Of these 216 secretaries, 74 are employed on a sharing basis between two or more schools. Accordingly, there are 142 primary schools which have the services of a full-time secretary. The posts were allocated to these schools on the basis of a teaching staff of 18 or more in respect of a full time post or shared between schools with a minimum of 23 teachers.</P>
      <P>The pay scales of the secretaries employed under this scheme are linked to comparable positions in local authorities and are set out in the table below. The rates listed are effective from 1 April, 2000.</P>

    <P>As I mentioned at the outset since 1992, my Department has provided assistance to schools in respect of secretarial services in the form of additional <i>per capita grants</i>. The rate of grant is currently £20 per pupil. With effect from January of <Col N="1671" /> this year, all primary schools with 100 or more pupils have become eligible for a grant towards secretarial services under this scheme. I am also pleased to inform the Deputy that with effect from September of this year, I will be extending the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I will be setting a minimum grant of £2,400 which will be payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less.</P>
    <P>The improvements outlined above mean that <Col N="1672" /> with effect from September 2000 all primary schools will be receiving an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999, has increased this year to approximately £12.2 million and will further increase in 2001 to approximately £16.8 million.</P>
