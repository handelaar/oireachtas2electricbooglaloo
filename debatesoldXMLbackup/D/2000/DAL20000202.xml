    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 43, Equal Status Bill, 1999 &ndash; Report and Final Stages (resumed); No. 1, Planning and Development Bill, 1999 [Seanad] &ndash; Second Stage, to be taken not later than immediately following the announcement of matters on the Adjournment under Standing Order 21 and the order shall not resume thereafter. It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the opening speech of the Minister or Minister of State and the speeches of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party on the Second Stage of No. 1 shall not exceed one hour in each case. Private Members' Business shall be No. 94, motion re health services (resumed).</P>

      <P>Is the proposal for dealing with No. 1 agreed to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a problem agreeing to this proposal, given that the Taoiseach has declined to make a statement about his involvement since December in dealings with Deputy Foley and his position on the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter was ruled out of order yesterday. Nothing has changed, therefore, I am again ruling it out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed nothing has changed. The Taoiseach has not made a statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows he is out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that, therefore, I do not want to continue out of order. I wish to indicate to the House that I am agreeing to this proposal, but under protest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>While the rest of the nation is agog at what has been revealed in Dublin Castle, is it in order, while agreeing to the Order of Business, to ask whether the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, <Col N="926" /> particularly the Taoiseach, will at any stage prior to the conclusion of the report of the tribunal make a statement in this House about his transactions with Deputy Foley on this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>What is before the House is the proposal for dealing with No. 1. It is not in order to introduce any other matter while considering that proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Chair will advise or assist me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the Chair's duty to advise or assist the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying it is the duty of the Chair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with No. 1, I am sure many Members wish to know whether it is in order for a Member to make a statement, even if he is the Taoiseach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is out of order. He cannot circumvent the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make a submission on a point of order. I do not wish to get into conflict with the Ceann Comhairle. The House functions by agreement of the Opposition. If we were to adopt an obstructive tactic in regard to all Government business, the Government would not be able to do its business. What we want from the Government at this stage is for the Taoiseach to explain his personal dealings in the matter. I do not wish to take this issue any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have ruled the matter out of order. There is a proposal before the House and I will now put the question. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 1 agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not continue with what I have already said. However, I hope the Taoiseach has heard what I said. He should understand that in the interests of the good functioning of this House he should do what the Opposition wants in this matter. When will the Dáil discuss the report of the sub-committee of the Committee of Public Accounts, of which Deputy Foley was a member? On the Standards in Public Office Bill which the former Minister for the Marine, Deputy Woods, promised would be available&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is attempting to circumvent the ruling of the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking about promised legislation. I am aware the Chair is trying to help me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="927" />
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am, and the Deputy should listen to the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree the Chair is going out of his way to help me to complete my sentences and so on, but perhaps he would allow me to put the question. In all good humour, this is probably the best way to proceed. I assure the Chair I will ask a question which is in order if he will allow me to do so. I assure the Chair my question is completely in order. The former Minister for the Marine, Deputy Woods, promised the Standards in Public Office Bill would be available in the summer or autumn of 1999. We are now told that it is not available. When will it be available in view of its relevance to current controversies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first matter, I understand arrangements are being made to discuss the report of the Committee of Public Accounts on the DIRT issue during February. On the Standards in Public Office Bill, because consultation between the various committees of the House was requested, the legislation was delayed for almost nine months. The heads of the Bill were cleared last September and the legislation is due in early summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, is it the Taoiseach's intention at any stage to make a statement on his conversation with Deputy Foley prior to Christmas?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Chair to reflect on this. I have asked a question which has numerous precedents about if or when the Taoiseach&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am imploring you, Sir. This question is on the lips of everyone in the country. It is a farce if I am not allowed to ask the question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Aviation Regulation Bill, which will be dealt with by the Department of Public Enterprise, is in many ways a matter of life <Col N="928" /> and death. I understand the Bill will not address competency training or aviation standards with regard to ground handling. Will the Ceann Comhairle bring to the attention of the Government the huge problem that will arise if the Bill does not deal with ground handling?</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the serious position in the Defence Forces at present due to the contents of the leaked White Paper on Defence? Is he aware that the Minister for Defence's insulting remarks yesterday about the Defence Forces has made a bad situation worse?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to seek the Ceann Comhairle's guidance on a procedural matter. It is normal practice on the Order of Business for leaders of parties to seek Government time to debate various issues. It is also normal practice for the Ceann Comhairle to suggest at that stage that matters should be referred to the Whips to ensure time is made available for them. An issue has been raised by the party leaders for the second consecutive day. They have asked that time be made available to debate it and to allow the Taoiseach to make a statement. This is normal practice and there is plenty of precedent for it. However, on this occasion, the Ceann Comhairle has said that it is out of order. Why is a new precedent being set where party leaders cannot ask on the Order of Business that Government time be made available to debate a particular issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is always told it is a matter for the Whips. It is still a matter for the Whips. The Whips do not have to wait for the Chair to direct matters to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>A little bit of controlled disorderly remarks makes for order. That is the truth of the matter. That is the way it works. The Chair should not take too restrictive a view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>In such situations, regularly the Ceann Comhairle says that the Whips will deal with the matter and come back to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I need the Ceann Comhairle's assistance. Last week the Taoiseach changed some Ministers around and he appointed the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, as the Minister for Health and Children and we all hope he will do a better job than the previous incumbent. When the Minister, Deputy Martin, left the Department of Education and Science, some people could not reach high enough on the hyperbole scale in saying how wonderful he was. I wish to seek the Chair's help. Last week 115 questions were tabled to the Minister for Education and Science and 51 questions were not answered except to state that there was an industrial dispute.</P>

      <P>In page 9, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) The Minister shall not later than five years after the commencement of this section review the operation of this Act to assess whether there is a need to add to the discriminatory grounds specified in <i>subsection (2)</i>.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="939" /> We had quite a full discussion on this earlier. The intention of this amendment is to ensure that after the two year review there would be a five year review which would specifically assess whether there was a need to add to the grounds in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already given a fairly clear indication that the grounds will be reviewed after two years, at which stage we can judge whether a further review is necessary. I tabled the amendment to ensure continuous review, which is important in this area of legislation. We have seen, since the introduction of the Bill, how critical it is to include issues concerning refugees and asylum seekers, for example, in this type of legislation. That has become even more apparent in the past few months. I wanted to ensure there would be continuous review but I take the points made by the Minister in his original response. Will he reassure the House that the grounds will be reviewed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure Deputy Fitzgerald that the intention is that after a period of two years there will be a review in accordance with section 3(4) of the Act. This will examine the grounds to assess the need for additional discriminatory grounds. There is a similar requirement in the Employment Equality Act which was passed last year. The possibility of a further review after that two year review can be considered when the two year review is completed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
      <P>In page 10, line 4, before &ldquo;an&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;except for the purposes of <i>subsection (2)</i>,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment and amendment No. 34, which was tabled by Deputy Fitzgerald, are of similar intent, which is to ensure that educational establishments will not be able to refuse a person with a disability his or her lawful entitlement to an appropriate education on the basis that the cost would be more than &ldquo;nominal&rdquo;, which is the wording used in this Bill and the Employment Equality Act. We do not agree with the use of the phrase &ldquo;a cost other than a nominal cost&rdquo; but, unfortunately, our specific amendments on that matter have been ruled out of order because they would involve a cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to educational establishments. As there is already a constitutional right to education, the references to &ldquo;a cost other than a nominal cost&rdquo; should not be used in <Col N="940" /> relation to educational establishments. In other words, we want it clearly stated that a person with a disability is entitled to an education in this State. The definition of &ldquo;educational establishment&rdquo; includes all establishments up to third level. Under the Constitution, a person with a disability is clearly entitled to an education. There have been a number of court cases in this regard, one of which is ongoing.</P>
    <P>This is a very important measure, particularly in light of a report published before Christmas called &ldquo;Towards Equal Citizenship&rdquo;, which monitored the implementation of the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. I was horrified to read the Department of Finance has rejected proposals for social and health rights for people with disabilities. That is another issue and does not relate to educational establishments; however, it is a clear indication of a real resistance to the rights of people with disabilities being properly enshrined in legislation. We want to ensure their right to an education is not in any way diluted by the cost to an educational establishment. The phrase &ldquo;a cost other than a nominal cost&rdquo; is written into this Bill. This is a very important amendment and we feel very strongly about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Our previous discussion on this amendment illustrates the real gap in protection for the disabled. If the Minister does not accept this amendment there will be no statutory onus on private institutions which receive large amounts of money from the State to make provision in their establishments for young people with special disabilities. They might do so themselves, but it appears the State is not going to oblige them to do so in its equal status legislation. Effectively, there is no statutory protection for anyone with a disability attending a private school. There is no guarantee that the facilities and resources that might be needed will be put in place. That was implied by our previous discussion on this.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister to address this. Does he accept we are relying on the goodwill and ethos of such schools? Of course, it is to be hoped that most private schools will respond and take every necessary step. However, it seems a shame they are not included in this equal status legislation to ensure that happens. I understand this arises out of the advice on the constitutional position. However, it seems strange there is no obligation on a school receiving large amounts of money from the State to take the necessary action to provide reasonable accommodation for the needs of people with disabilities. I would like some reassurance from the Minister about how people in this situation will be protected if this amendment is not accepted. Will he clarify the interaction between this Bill and the Education Act, in terms of access to education for all our citizens? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I inserted section 4(5) on Committee Stage to lay to rest any uncertainty <Col N="941" /> about the relationship between the nominal cost threshold in this Bill and the provisions of the Education Act, 1998. As I explained then, the provisions of the Equal Status Bill were developed in close consultation with the Department of Education and Science and do not in any way dilute the provisions of the Education Act, 1998, dealing with disabilities, to which Deputy Fitzgerald referred. However, to allay fears which had arisen, I inserted section 4(5) which ensures the equal status legislation cannot be interpreted as being prejudicial to the provisions of the Education Act.</P>
      <P>I cannot see what purpose is served by the Deputies' amendments. Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment would render the Bill constitutionally vulnerable since it would put an open-ended obligation on educational establishments, most of which are privately owned, to make reasonable accommodation for the needs of people with disabilities, irrespective of the cost involved or the extent of State subvention.</P>
      <P>Section 7(2)(a) of the Education Act gives the Minister for Education and Science certain functions in relation to funding, including the funding of support services for students who have a disability. Section 9(a) requires schools to use their available resources to ensure that the educational needs of all students, including those with a disability, are identified and provided for.</P>
      <P>Section 15(2)(g) requires a board of management to use the resources provided to the school from moneys provided by the Oireachtas to make reasonable provisions and accommodation for students with a disability or other special education needs, including, where necessary, alteration of buildings and provision of appropriate equipment.</P>
      <P>It will be noted that section 15(2)(g) of the Education Act, which was framed to take account of the Supreme Court finding on the Employment Equality Bill, 1996, states that the reasonable provision and accommodation for students with disabilities is to be done from resources provided to the school from moneys provided by the Oireachtas. It thus avoids any implication that school authorities must use their own resources for this purpose. The wording of the Equal Status Bill is thus consistent with the requirements of the Education Act, 1998, and does not dilute it in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem I still have is that there is no obligation, as far as I can tell, on the school to apply for or seek resources from the State to facilitate the education of a person with a disability. If I have a child with a disability, live in a particular area and want my child to go to the local school, what obligation is there on the local school to take my child? What obligation is there on that school to apply to the Department of Education and Science for the relevant funding which might be needed because of the specific disability my child might have? I am still not clear that the educational rights of a child with a dis<Col N="942" /> ability are protected under this or the education legislation.</P>
      <P>This equal status legislation is supposed to protect the rights of the relevant groups, one of which is obviously people with a disability. I still do not believe there is an obligation to ensure the rights of that child to an education are protected. Will the Minister clarify the issue I raise? It is very important issue, particularly in the light of the type of responses we have got recently as regards the rights of people with disabilities. For example, the disabilities Bill which was to be published this year will not be published until 2001. I mention also the response to the report to which I referred earlier in the debate.</P>
      <P>We need a guarantee that the right of a person with a disability to an appropriate education is vindicated. We also need to ensure that educational establishments cannot simply say that maybe the person has a right but that they do not have to fulfil that right. It is a real fear that we may appear to be giving people rights but, in fact, we are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not a large gap and a contradiction between what the Education Act states &ndash; I accept it states that there is an obligation on schools to look after the needs of those with a disability &ndash; and bringing in equal status legislation which does not address all schools? The Minister gave an example in a previous debate on this Bill. He said a privately owned third level college, which is not well off, would have great difficulty providing the facilities required and reasonable accommodation for the disabled. The Minister said that could drive colleges to the wall.</P>
      <P>Surely as a Government and State, we should lay down in statute minimum criteria which ensure access to private third level colleges or private schools for the disabled. Even if it is contained in the Education Act, should we not, when we introduce equal status legislation &ndash; one of the groups it is specifically meant to address is the disabled &ndash; reinforce that in this legislation? If we cannot do that in our legislation, do we not have a very serious problem? </P>
      <P>From a constitutional point of view, we cannot even say to a private third level college, which will deal with young people and which young people will want to attend, that it must provide accommodation for disabled students and that that is part of the type of service we expect it to provide in Ireland in the 21st century. It illustrates the point Deputy O'Sullivan has often made that we need this constitutional amendment on disability if we cannot, in equal status legislation, lay down minimum and reasonable standards for those with a disability who would attend educational establishments which happen to be private.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Fitzgerald have made a reasonable case but what they are saying is what was, in the final <Col N="943" /> analysis, considered by the Supreme Court when it discussed the Employment Equality Bill. I indicated to this House on a number of occasions that the Employment Equality Bill was considered in its entirety by the Supreme Court but that the Equal Status Bill was not.</P>
      <P>There was a similar provision regarding reasonable accommodation in the Equal Status Bill to that in the Employment Equality Bill. The position is that the Supreme Court, as we know, held the reasonable accommodation provision in the Employment Equality Bill to be unconstitutional having regard to the right to private property under the 1937 Constitution. It followed that the reasonable accommodation provision, which was included in the Equal Status Bill, must be unconstitutional as well. In those circumstances, there was an obligation on the Government to amend the Equal Status Bill to ensure, in so far as we could, that the legislation was within constitutional parameters. There is no doubt that if it had been left as it was, it would have been outside the constitutional parameters because the Supreme Court had decided so in the Employment Equality Bill case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those circumstances, the legislation was amended. I do not believe we serve any purpose by confusing the right to an education on the one hand with the issue of reasonable accommodation or nominal cost accommodation on the other. <Col N="944" /> Under our legislation every person has the right to an education and it is the function and duty of the State to provide that education. The issue of what type of accommodation should be provided is one which was circumscribed in the context of the Employment Equality Bill by the Supreme Court and this legislation follows that path. I do not believe we had any other choice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I refer to the fact that education is a constitutional right, so it is different from other services in that regard. As regards my amendment No. 30, which was disallowed, I would reject the exact wording which is used and say that the question of nominal cost is wording which I would prefer not to see in the legislation. Specifically where it relates to education there is a difference. We should ensure that nominal cost aspect of the legislation does not deprive a person with a disability of educational opportunities in an area which is close to their home. There are important aspects as regards the life of a person with a disability. For example, travelling a distance may not be as much of an obstacle for a person who does not have a disability. It is important we push the boat out as far as we can, despite the constitutional constraints, by ensuring that this legislation is as strong as possible as regards the rights of people with a disability. This amendment would strengthen those rights without being challenged constitutionally.</P>

      <P>5.&ndash;&ldquo;A public authority shall within 6 months from the passing of this Act submit to the Authority a scheme which shall show how the public authority proposes to fulfil the duties imposed by this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I proposed this amendment on Committee Stage and there was some discussion on the matter. I accept some of the points made by the Minister but I still believe that this would constitute a proactive measure to ensure that public authorities would adopt a positive stance with regard to this legislation and would make the effort at an early stage to set out how they would implement the provisions of the Equal Status Bill. On Committee Stage the Minister suggested that the term &ldquo;public authority&rdquo; might be difficult to define and that it might be difficult to decide which authorities would be included under such a definition. I accept this point but it is not an insurmountable obstacle. The positive aspects of this measure would be that there would not be any lethargy on the part of bodies to ensure that they think about this legislation and do their best to ensure that it operates within their organisations. Health and safety, anti-bullying measures and working time applies more to the employment equality legislation. In all of these matters, some bodies are slower than others in implementing the laws. In many places, for example, health and safety regu<Col N="947" /> lations or other measures like that are not really considered at all until somebody draws attention to it. The purpose of this amendment is to encourage bodies to be proactive rather than wait until somebody tells them they have to implement this legislation.</P>

      <P>I am not convinced of the benefits of this amendment. As I explained on Committee Stage, this Bill covers nine grounds with many exemptions across diverse areas of service provision both in the private and public sectors. It is not clear why this obligation should apply only to public authorities, or why a scheme submitted only six months after the passing of the Act, irrespective of when it is commenced, could contain useful material on the practical application of the Act as opposed to broad aspirational statements. In any event, Departments and other public bodies are committed through customer service plans to equality of opportunity. There are also extensive functions given to the authority relating to codes of practice and equality reviews. These functions, and in particular the authority's power to conduct equality reviews of bodies with more than 50 staff, have the potential to prompt practical anti-discrimination policies and measures in public authorities. Furthermore, there is not a comparable requirement on public bodies in matters to which the Equality Employment Act, 1998, applies.</P>

      <P>I remind the Minister that when we had the hearings on this Bill in committee, quite a number of groups recommended that this sort of positive action, and positive encouragement should be built into the legislation. It was hoped to encourage the spirit as well as the letter of the law and that people would get moving on it very quickly. It was seen as a good incentive to have this in the legislation. It would mean that within a very short period we would have something meaningful for people. In that spirit, it is a good amendment and it would give credibility to the legislation if one had this obligation on authorities. I realise it is yet another obligation on them but equally this is the sort of measure we should consider more and more when proposing legislation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 36:</P>
      <P>In page 10, to delete lines 34 and 35.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates mainly to insurance and it proposes to delete &ldquo;actuarial or statistical data obtained from a source on which it is reasonable to rely,&rdquo;. We had some debate on Committee Stage about this. I would like to ensure that insurance companies do not have a free hand in terms of deciding what data is reasonably sourced and what is not, on which they make decisions relating to how they treat their customers. This is a valid point because the insurance company may decide that something is reasonable in terms of data, but it may not be reliable at all. It has been pointed out before that some of this actuarial and statistical data is not accurate and that therefore it should not be in the legislation as something that insurance companies can use, in effect, to make it more difficult for their customers to obtain insurance at a reasonable cost.</P>

      <P>As I explained on Committee Stage, it is not the function of the Equal Status Bill to radically change the way in which the insurance industry operates. This amendment would fundamentally alter the way in which the financial services industry operates underwriting insurance, extending loans and so on. Insurance companies discriminate on various grounds based on actuarial or statistical data and they are allowed to do so in other jurisdictions. The Equal Status Bill will provide protection because the insurance companies and so on would have to justify the different treatments by demonstrating that they are based on reasonably reliable data whereas, at present, insurance companies do not have to provide such justification. To alleviate any worries that Deputy O'Sullivan might have, I advise her that the commissioner will decide what is reasonable in this context.</P>

      <P>If the Minister does not accept the amendment, will he clarify a matter relating to the insurance companies? He referred to reasonably reliable data &ndash; who will that be presented to, and how often will it be presented? In what way will that operate? I presume it means that there will be greater transparency in why insurance companies set certain rates, whether it is for women drivers or male drivers. That is a very welcome provision for everyone.</P>

      <P>To reply to Deputy Fitzgerald's question, the position would be that a complaint would be made in the usual way, and then <Col N="949" /> it would be a matter for the director to decide whether the data being applied were reasonable. The complaint would be upheld if it was deemed that they were not reasonable. This will be determined in a very open, transparent and fair manner. I assure Deputies Fitzgerald and O'Sullivan that the provisions of this legislation will have a beneficial effect from the moment the Bill becomes operational and that this much is certain. That is as practical an example as one can give of how effective it will be.</P>

      <P>In page 10, line 38, before &ldquo;and&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;but does not include information gathered from genetic testing,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I pointed out on Committee Stage that this amendment was proposed for the previous Equal Status Bill proposed by Deputy Jim McDaid, who would have more professional knowledge than many of us concerning genetic testing. In part of the Minister's reply, he stated that Irish insurance companies have yet to decide their stance on genetic testing. It is a matter of concern. Results of genetic tests should not play a part in terms of insurance companies making decisions with regard to their clients or their prospective clients. Will the Minister again consider the points I made on Committee Stage, which I have repeated on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the use of genetic data for insurance purposes is a sensitive issue. This is a new and developing field. While I recognise there are concerns about the issue of genetic testing, the Equal Status Bill is not the appropriate vehicle to resolve these issues. Since I am not the supervisory authority for the insurance industry, it is not my function to establish standards for the use of genetic data for insurance purposes. I understand the Irish Insurance Federation is currently reviewing the issue with a view to establishing best practice taking account of developments in other countries. <Col N="950" /> A code of practice is being finalised on the use of genetic tests in life assurance.</P>
      <P>As far as the Equal Status Bill is concerned, material obtained from genetic testing falls to be treated with other data which insurance companies can use to justify different treatment. It has to be data on which it is reasonable to rely and the difference of treatment has to be reasonable, having regard to the data or other relevant factors. The Equal Status Bill, therefore, cuts down on the opportunity to discriminate. I would also point out that insurance contracts require the disclosure of all material facts for the application, whether the insurance company asks for it or not. An insurance company could hardly be prevented from taking into account a genetic test which indicated an increased risk. I cannot, therefore, accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a new issue which is not covered by legislation. We will have to introduce legislation on it. I referred to the transparency of insurance companies &ndash; it is likely that someone will face increased charges, whether with a health insurer or insurance company because information on a genetic test they have taken has been made available. It would be hard to expect the information to be withheld from an insurance company &ndash; they will have access to it. From the citizens' point of view, public awareness is important. Information should be given by insurance companies so that people in this position know they are protected by this Bill if they feel data is being used in an inappropriate way. It is possible such information could be used inappropriately by an insurance company and the person involved could suffer discrimination as a result.</P>
      <P>This is cutting edge technology and new facets are constantly emerging. There are implications in terms of contact with insurance companies and ensuring the provisions of this Bill are publicised so the public is aware it is protected on this issue which is not really covered by legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage the Minister said insurance contracts required the disclosure of all material information, whether or not the insurance company require it on the application form. Perhaps this issue should be debated fully in another forum. There are serious concerns about exactly what one must disclose to an insurance company and what is relevant. These issues cannot be appropriately addressed today but I put down these amendments to ensure public debate.</P>

    <P>This amendment proposes to ensure that religious bodies are not given a <i>carte blanche</i><Col N="951" /> exemption from the provisions of this Bill. My amendment suggests the inclusion of &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; which was in the original Bill and provided that exemptions on religious denominational grounds would be excluded from this part of the Bill.

      <P>For reasons I gave on Committee Stage, I cannot accept this amendment. It would allow the Director of Equality Investigations or the courts to decide whether something provided for a religious purpose is reasonable. This would be tantamount to State interference with the freedom of religious denominations which would be constitutionally suspect. The director could, of course, decide whether something is being provided for a religious purpose but once that has been established it cannot be a matter for the director to decide that the terms in which it is being provided are unreasonable.</P>

      <P>No, because I can see my argument has not made a great impression on the Minister.

      <P>This issue was debated in relation to several areas on Committee Stage. The Minister indicated there would be no interference with community rating imposed on health insurers.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's concern in ensuring the Bill is not detrimental to community rating. I do not consider, however, that such an amendment is necessary. Section 7 of the Health Insurance Act, 1994, provides that premiums payable under health insurance contracts cannot be varied by reference to the age, sex or sexual orientation or the suffering or prospective suffering of a person from a chronic disease, illness or other medical condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="952" /> The prohibition on age discrimination contained in section 7 of the Health Insurance Act, 1994, will not be affected by section 5(2)(e) of the Bill. Although the Bill exempts certain differences of treatment of insurance from being regarded as discrimination under that legislation, it does not sanction age discrimination in private health insurance and contravention of the Health Insurance Act, 1994. The Equal Status Bill does not confer any new rights on insurers and, therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Since Committee Stage I have had an opportunity to consider this amendment in consultation with the Department of the Environment and Local Government. I am advised that the local authorities and approved voluntary housing organisations, as social housing landlords, require flexibility in allocating dwellings to ensure purpose built and designed and designated dwellings, for example, elderly persons dwellings, dwellings purpose built or modified to facilitate disabled occupants, accommodation for members of the travelling community, etc., continue to be used for their original purpose and to ensure an appropriate social mix in housing estates.</P>
      <P>There are circumstances where flexibility is required, family size being one such circumstance, because statutory schemes of letting priorities afford additional priority to larger families on the basis of family status. In order to promote an appropriate social mix, local authorities and voluntary bodies have to ensure there is a spread of different family types in a particular estate and it would not be reasonable to allocate supported or purpose built elderly person's accommodation to families.</P>
      <P>If this amendment was adopted, it could result in housing estates being tenanted without regard for the wider social consequences. Housing authorities have been subjected to criticism in the past that inflexible letting practices resulted in concentrations of disadvantaged families in particular estates. Providing for a social mix may not be considered necessary as part of the wording of Deputy Fitzgerald's amendment. It is very important, however, for the quality of life of tenants and in the context of other, wider social implications.</P>
      <P>The local authorities are not without checks and balances to ensure they deal fairly with people. Administrative decisions made by the authorities in the allocation of housing are subject to the investigation by the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman's guide to standards of best practice provides that dealing impartially with people includes avoiding bias because of a person's colour, sex, marital status, ethnic origin, culture, language, religion, sexual orientation, attitude, reputation or because of who or what they know. It also provides that dealing impartially with people includes ensuring services provided in a scheme of priorities for the allocation of social housing are open and transparent.</P>

I said I would look sympathetically at this on Report Stage. Persons who are granted refugee status here are entitled to the same rights to education, health, housing, etc., as Irish citizens. Section 3 of the Refugee Act, 1996, although not yet in force, states this. It is administrative practice. By virtue of my amendment, the exemptions for differences of treatment for EU nationals at section 7(3)(d) of the Equal Status Bill and section 12(7) of the Employment Equality Act are without prejudice to section (3) of the Refugee Act.

Until such time as they are appointed, it is not possible to implement the Refugee Act, 1996, in its entirety.

      <P>I accept that the Minister has moved and I welcome that. I would like him to make it clear, although he cannot give a guarantee that this section of the Refugee Act will be in force by the time the Equal Status Bill becomes law, that refugees will not be treated differently or charged more by educational establishments or other institutions. We must be sure that will be in the Refugee Act when implemented and that such institutions will not be able to use this clause. Will the Minister assure us that refugees will not be charged higher fees? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment seeks to delete lines 33 to 39. I am trying to safeguard the rights not just of refugees but all non-EU nationals who may be <Col N="956" /> charged higher fees simply because they are non-EU nationals. I would like the Minister to address that issue as it is discriminatory and unfair.</P>

      <P>People who achieve refugee status in this jurisdiction are not discriminated against either administratively or by legislation. That will be reinforced when the Refugee Act, 1996, is implemented, though that is not to say there is any prejudice against refugees now. To my knowledge, there is not any such prejudice. We are dealing with people who have achieved refugee status. There are no circumstances under which I could open the borders of either the State or educational or other institutions to any person who arrives in the State. It cannot happen. That is a Utopian aspiration. I know that may not find favour in some quarters but most pragmatists will accept that is the position. There is little I can do to explain it other than to say it is not something that could be countenanced because we could not afford it. We neither have the space nor the resources. People who acquire refugee status will receive the same rights, services and so on as citizens. To suggest that it is unfair that those who do not achieve such status and are non-nationals do not receive the same services as refugees or citizens is fanciful. I believe my view is shared by the vast majority of those in this jurisdiction. However, I wish to emphasise that those who achieve refugee status will have the same rights as everyone else.</P>

      <P>I do not understand why the Minister is driven on every occasion to repeat this speech on open door policy, suggesting that everyone is in favour of it when what we are trying to do is build in protections for those who receive refugee status and guarantee that they will not be discriminated against. The Minister will agree that there is probably as much an educational issue as a legislative one in this section. I thank him for the move he has made. It is important that information is given and that there is this protection. It is also important that the provisions apply to those who have acquired refugee status. As far as the issues we are discussing under this Bill are concerned, we want to send out a loud and clear message that those granted refugee status should not be treated any differently from Irish citizens.</P>

      <P>In page 14, to delete lines 14 to 18.</P>
      <P>This brings us back to the question of educational establishments and students with disabilities. We discussed some of the points on an earlier amendment but this provision is more offensive. The subsection states:</P>
      <P>(b) to the extent that compliance with any of its provisions in relation to a student with a disability would, by virtue of the disability, make impossible, or have a seriously detrimental effect on, the provision by an educational establishment of its services to other students.</P>
      <P>This was not in the Equal Status Bill, 1997. It means that an educational establishment does not have to provide for a student with a disability if it considers it might have a seriously detrimental effect on the educational provision for other students. This would be open to abuse by such establishments. They could say they could not accommodate students in a wheelchair or those with hearing difficulties and so on because of the effect it would have on other students. I do not believe an educational establishment should have that power. I accept there is some justification for &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; but &ldquo;seriously detrimental effect&rdquo; could be widely abused. There are sufficient safeguards for educational establishments with regard to how open their doors are to students with disabilities. Every possible effort should be made to ensure such students have access to educational establishments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment follows on <Col N="958" /> from that on education. It is clear that the interpretation means it is still a case of property before people's rights. I argued on Committee Stage that some objective criteria should be built into the Bill in terms of when a school should assess the level of impact on meeting the needs of a disabled person. The language used in the Bill is not tight enough. It would be better to include the phrase &ldquo;objective criteria&rdquo;. That would encourage schools which exclude someone because they feel their disability would have a major impact on the school to give more reasons for their decision. It is not acceptable that schools should be allowed to do this.</P>
      <P>To go back to my earlier point, the Dáil should lay down standards for schools to provide for the needs of people with disabilities. This should be provided for to a stronger degree than is provided for in the Education Bill. This should also be covered by the equal status legislation. A lot of public money is going into private institutions, yet there is no onus on them to fully meet the needs of the disabled. Why should this requirement not be included in the equal status legislation? Perhaps the Minister would take a chance in terms of the Supreme Court and give a wider interpretation of the matter. I appreciate that one does not want to delay the passage of the Bill but it seems extraordinary that the Dáil cannot pass legislation which will provide that institutions and schools, including private schools, must accommodate those who are disabled. It should be made very clear that this must be done.</P>
      <P>There is a lot of protection built into the legislation. The Minister said previously he did not think schools would do this lightly. Parents have experienced cases where schools have felt that because children had a particular disability, whether autism, a behavioural disorder or some type of hyperactivity, they could not cope with them in the school. This may be the case if extra resources are not in place. If stronger legislation was in place, there would be an onus on the schools to consider the resources they would need to incorporate people with disabilities. This would strengthen the legislation. However, I appreciate that a constitutional issue might arise, but I believe by any reasonable test this House should be able to lay down statutory standards which should apply in all circumstances in relation to disability. We should not legislate for this sort of exclusion. The school will have to show evidence to the director that there is a basis under section 7(4) for its decision not to admit students. However, it would be better if there was a positive atmosphere from the beginning and if there was a statutory obligation on schools to provide for disabled pupils whatever facilities are necessary without the limitation provided for in the legislation relating to cost and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained in some detail on Committee Stage the reasons underlying the wording of section 7(4)(b). It provides that educational establishments are not obliged to admit students with a disability if so doing would make it impossible or would have a seriously detrimental effect on the provision of their services to other students. This exemption was included fol<Col N="959" /> lowing legal advice about the open-ended nature of the obligations under the 1997 Bill, which could negate other pupils' constitutional right to education. There is a balance to be struck in this regard. I stress that the wording of this subsection was formulated in consultation with the Department of Education and Science and involves a strict test.</P>
      <P>I envisage that section 7(4)(b) will not be availed of lightly. The exclusion of a person by a school on foot of this provision must meet a very strict test, namely, that the person's disability must make impossible or have a seriously detrimental effect on the school's provision of its services to other students. What we have in mind is a child whose disability is such that his or her admission would seriously disrupt or negate the education of other pupils. It is not intended to cover cases where it would inconvenience the school to have a pupil with a disability nor are the perceptions or attitudes of other pupils or their parents relevant. The criteria are extremely strict and the exemption can be invoked only in limited circumstances. Where a school has availed of this provision, it will be open to the person to seek redress under the Equal Status Act by submitting the case to the Director of Equality Investigations. The school will have to provide satisfactory evidence to the director that there is a basis under section 7(4) for its decision not to admit the student. In other words, where an educational establishment seeks to avail of such an exemption, it will be a matter for that establishment, not the complainant, to show that the exemption applies. Since the school will have to persuade the Director of Equality Investigations that it meets the test in section 7(4)(b), I do not regard it as necessary to qualify this section by reference to &ldquo;objective criteria&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I wish to make it clear that I am not balancing the right of a person, to use Deputy Fitzgerald's words, against the rights of property. It is a question of trying to balance the rights of one individual with the rights of other individuals. The Deputy will accept that if the student concerned, when admitted to the school, negated the educational position of other students, it would be reasonable in those circumstances for the school to be in a position to refuse admission. It will be accepted that if the person's disability makes it impossible or would have a seriously detrimental effect on the school's provision of its services to other students arising out of the admission, it would be reasonable in such circumstances for the school to refuse to accommodate the child. I stress that the test is very strict. It will be a matter for the school to establish that the criteria are met and not, for example, a matter for the complainant to establish. I am satisfied, having discussed the matter at various levels, that the legislation is as tight as possible in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier there was a vote on an amendment which, if passed would have been held to be unconstitutional for the simple reason that it was held to be unconstitutional previously. If I were to proceed with the legislation without taking into account the rights of all the other pupils in the <Col N="960" /> class concerned, the probability is that my seeking to ensure that a child is accommodated by the school, despite the fact that the child concerned would make it impossible for the other children to get a proper education or would have a seriously detrimental effect on their education, would result in the Supreme Court ultimately holding that the legislation is unconstitutional. I sympathise with the Deputies in terms of these difficult cases. I also deeply sympathise with parents who find themselves in that situation. However, I have tried to tighten the legislation as much as possible to ensure that a child is not excluded unless the reasons are cogent, while at the same time trying to ensure other pupils in the class do not have their education seriously undermined or negated.</P>

      <P>There has been some modification to Standing Orders in relation to Report Stage debates in recent times. Members who move an amendment can effectively speak three times, initially when the amendment is moved, a short contribution of two minutes and then to conclude the debate.

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to spell out clearly the intention in the legislation because this could be read in a variety of ways. I take the Minister's point about the rights of other pupils to education and their not being unduly disrupted because of the needs of one child. However, what does the Minister suggest a school should do if it is not accessible to a child in a wheelchair? If the lack of ramps is used as grounds to exclude a child and various changes would be necessary to enable the child to attend, does the Minister consider that, under the Bill as it stands, the school would be able to make a case for excluding the child?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister is constrained by the Constitution, but the parents of children with disabilities always have to fight for their rights and take cases. People believed, following the court cases which parents won and the subsequent Education Act, that the fighting was over and that their rights would be provided for in legislation. However, every time we discuss legislation which is supposed to give rights to people with disabilities, we are constrained by the Constitution to the extent that people have to fight every step of the way. The more I consider the Bill, the more I see a need to amend the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To what extent does the Education Act affect the Bill, which will be the primary legislation in terms of the rights of people with disabilities to an appropriate education? As I said on Committee Stage, when a child applies to attend a school and is turned down, he or she must then take a case to the equality director. If another school turns down that child, the same process will apply. Such children have to go around in circles to find schools <Col N="961" /> to accommodate their needs. They could have lost a year's education by the time their cases have been heard and they find a school which decides the rights of other pupils will not be significantly interfered with because a person with a disability is receiving an education.</P>
    <P>Is there any way such children can be protected from the need to fight every time for their basic right to an education? It appears this will happen despite the best will in the world and the Minister's point that it is up to the educational establishment to prove the rights of other students would not be safeguarded. It appears, unlike other children, a child with a disability cannot automatically go to a school and receive an education, which is his or her right. What are the Minister's views on this aspect?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the questions raised impinge on the Education Act which comes within the remit of the Minister for Education and Science. It must be made clear that a child with a serious disability might, for example, be reasonably accommodated in a particular class of a particular school, but not in another class. He or she could be accommodated in one school but not in another, depending on the type of services provided. The Education Act deals with the fundamental right of a child to be educated.</P>
      <P>I accept, in respect of a child with a grave disability, it can be difficult to ensure he or she finds an appropriate place. However, the thrust of the Bill is to make the path much easier for people with disabilities, irrespective of the gravity of their disabilities. Although I accept they are interlinked, we must not confuse the issue of the right to an education with the concept of reasonable accommodation. It would be accepted that a State run school should have a ramp for wheelchairs. However, if it was a privately run school, it would also be reasonable to expect it to have a ramp provided it had the funding to build one. This relates to the funding provided by the Department of Education and Science for the provision of facilities for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>I explained that the Supreme Court in its wisdom decided the reasonable accommodation provision under the Employment Equality Bill was unconstitutional and that, in those circumstances, while it did not consider this matter specifically, the same provision in the Equal Status Bill was, as a logical consequence, also unconstitutional. It must be clear that there is then a difficulty about this matter. It is not the intention of this legislation to enshrine in our law a position where educational establishments will be able, for frivolous reasons, to refuse an education to a child with a disability. That is not the case. The grounds are strictly set out and they are stringent and tight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Depending on the educational establishment one attends, there is a probability that what might be seriously detrimental or negate the educational opportunities of other children in one school might not apply in another school or even in different classes in the same school. It depends <Col N="962" /> on the type of services available within the class or classes or the school or schools. This is apparent.</P>
    <P>The right to an education is fundamental and I am trying to ensure, in so far as it is possible, that pupils with disabilities will not be discriminated against. This must be clear. However, there are constitutional constraints in relation to how far I can go. I stress that the objective of this legislation is to try to ensure, in so far as we reasonably can, that people with disabilities will obtain an education and that provision will be made for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the constraints on the Minister and that he is trying to safeguard the right to an education of people with disabilities in so far as he can do so. However, in practice, the person with a disability will have to find an appropriate place of education. In fighting for his or her constitutional right, such a person may lose a year's education. The inclusion of the section will make it more difficult for students with disabilities to access their rights.</P>
      <P>The right of schools to provide an appropriate education to different types of students is already covered in legislation on education. There are various examples in practice. The inclusion of this section creates an unnecessary obstacle to students with disabilities and I intend to press the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Acting Chairman. Deputy O'Sullivan is being unduly pessimistic. The Education Act provides that a child is entitled to an education and that educational establishments should make provision for children with disabilities subject to the availability of finance. This measure greatly strengthens the position of disabled children. It does so because it obliges the educational establishment concerned to accept the child unless to do so would make it impossible or seriously detrimental for other children to receive an adequate education. That provision does not exist in Irish law at present. What we are doing is removing the possibility of people being discriminated against on frivolous grounds by inserting strict criteria into the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is a very severely handicapped child whose parents wish him or her to obtain an education, it must be clear to everybody that the probability is that it would not be possible, for example, in many instances for the local national school to give that child an adequate education without seriously disrupting or making it impossible for the other children to get an education. It might well be the case that there would be other educational establishments which might cater more specifically for that child and the child <Col N="963" /> would obviously be accepted. If, on the other hand, the handicap was mild the probability is that children would not be adversely affected to the extent that their education opportunities would be negated or that there would be serious detrimental consequences for their education. In those circumstances the child would be admitted.</P>
    <P>I am trying to balance the rights of all children <Col N="964" /> in as equal a fashion as possible. It would be wrong to suggest this legislation seeks to hinder a disabled child from getting an education. Far from it. We are removing fundamental obstacles so far as we can.</P>

      <P>I wish to formally announce for the information of the Dáil that, having informed the President that Dáil Éireann had approved my nomination of Deputy Frank Fahey to be a member of the Government, the President on Thursday, 27 January 2000, appointed him accordingly. On 27 January 2000, I assigned the Department of Foreign Affairs to Deputy Brian Cowen, the Department of Health and Children to Deputy Micheál Martin, the Department of Education and Science to Deputy Michael Woods, and the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources to Deputy Frank Fahey.</P>
      <P>I accepted the resignation of Deputy Chris Flood as a Minister of State on Wednesday, 26 January 2000. Yesterday, the Government appointed Deputy Eoin Ryan as Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, with special responsibility for local development. He will also be responsible for the national drugs strategy team. Deputy Mary Hanafin has been appointed Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and the Department of Education and Science, with special responsibility for children.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>In my statement of 16 December last, which I have circulated with my reply, I detailed the arrangements proposed for inquiring into the Dublin, Monaghan and Dundalk bombings. The outgoing Chief Justice has agreed to conduct an examination and assessment of all aspects of the bombings and their sequel. The terms of reference remain to be defined precisely following consultations, including with the former Chief Justice and the relevant groups of relatives. The legal advisers of the Justice for the Forgotten group met officials of my Department on Monday. The precise terms of reference for the inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings will be settled very shortly.</P>
      <P>The former Chief Justice commenced his examination on Monday, 31 January. The duration of the examination will clearly be related to the amount of material to be reviewed. However, the Government envisages, and believes it would be very desirable, particularly from the standpoint of the relatives concerned, that the former Chief Justice's report should be available for consideration by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights when it recommences its activity after the summer break in September. We will await the former Chief Justice's assessment of the volume of the task and his proposals as regards the timing for the completion of the report.</P>
      <P>The former Chief Justice will conduct his examination in offices in Government Buildings. He has requested that he be provided with research and other staff, and arrangements are being made in that regard. However, the former Chief Justice has indicated that he will not be able to give a precise estimate of the resources he will need to carry out his work until he assesses the volume of his task.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for responding to the suggestion I first made on the floor of this House, and for the way in which he examined the idea and decided it had some merit. I thank him also for having brought it to completion. Notwithstanding that &ndash; and I do not want to be ungracious in any way &ndash; would the Taoiseach not agree with me that there is a necessity, after such a long period of time, for clarity to be provided by the former Chief Justice at the earliest possible opportunity? We need to know when a detailed examination can take place, when he will complete his initial analysis of what is required, including resources, and when the relatives of the victims of the bombings will have a definitive timetable by which the former Chief Justice should submit a report. I put it to the Taoiseach that it would be both a discipline and a requirement that the former Chief Justice would have set for him, by the Taoiseach, a specific timetable for a definitive report, although not necessarily the final report. Otherwise, credibility and support for this process will be seriously undermined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that the suggestion for this inquiry was put on the floor of the House by Deputy Quinn, and was supported by everybody as one of the ways of moving forward. I acknowledge also that when the various groups sought advice and an assessment from the House, Opposition leaders and other individuals supported them moving forward. I have acknowledged that in the letters that were sent.</P>
      <P>Having got to this stage I am very anxious that we now move on. I cannot tie the hands of the former Chief Justice, but I acknowledge that he started work on Monday morning, at the first available moment. He intends to give the matter a great deal of time and hopes to make an assessment, on the terms that have been mentioned by Deputy Quinn, as quickly as possible. He is anxious to be able to make an assessment for his own arrangements as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, he does. He is going to go at this as near to full-time as possible, to see it through. I think he can make that interim assessment fairly quickly. Without ignoring the job he has at hand, I just do not know how much information, including files and other data, he has to go through. During the Christmas period, the then Chief Justice was kind enough to have discussions with me &ndash; on 21 December 1999 and a few days after that &ndash; giving an indication of what he required. That allowed my Department officials to prepare as much of it for him during January, so that he could commence his work last Monday. There was also a meeting with the legal representatives so they could finalise the terms of reference, which I am confident will happen in the next few days. As I said in my reply &ndash; and <Col N="968" /> to put on the record as a benchmark &ndash; it would be good if we could have the report for the summer session, if that proves feasible and I hope it does, so that the committee could start dealing with it in September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>We all accept that the process outlined by the Taoiseach is a reasonable compromise. We hope it will result in the questions that have remained unanswered for so long, being answered. Like Deputy Quinn, I was simply concerned, as were the relatives, about the timescale, but the Taoiseach has answered that question. Can he say, for example, while there are no formal terms of reference for the inquiry available as yet, when will the actual terms of reference be ready? I hope the entire process will be completed in time for the committee to consider it in September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That would certainly be the hope. Although I cannot tie the hands of the former Chief Justice, I hope he can do it. I think he would like to achieve that, for personal reasons, as I said earlier. The meeting on Monday concerning the terms of reference was successful, although they will have to be finalised. Broadly, however, they are working around the idea of undertaking a thorough examination involving fact finding and assessment of all aspects of the Dublin, Monaghan and Dundalk bombings. This will include the facts, circumstances, cause and perpetrators of the bombings; the nature, adequacy and extent of the Garda investigations; the adequacy of co-operation with and from relevant authorities in Northern Ireland; the adequacy of the scientific analysis of forensic evidence; and the reasons no prosecution took place, including if the investigations were impeded and, if so, by whom and to what extent. There have been other suggestions also. The meeting the other day examined broadening them, but that is their gist.</P>

        <b>:</b> There were other bombs in Dublin in 1972, namely, in Sackville Place, where people died. Is it envisaged that the Sackville Place bombs will be included in the scope of the Hamilton inquiry? The victims' relatives feel very aggrieved that they rank in the realms of the forgotten. Given that the two incidents happened within a relatively short period in 1972 and 1974, the perpetrators are still at large and we still do not know the source and the cause of the bombs, will the 1972 incidents be included in the scope of the terms of reference of the Hamilton inquiry?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the initiative on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings came to light, a number of other cases have been brought to my attention by Members and by people who wrote to me. These cases were not pursued with any great vigour over the past quarter of a century. I understand why they are being raised now, given the amount of talk about these matters in the <Col N="969" /> media and the House. I do not have a closed mind about including them. However, I am anxious for attention and resources to be focused on establishing the truth in the cases which have been the basis of such active representation and controversy, and for the former Chief Justice to be able to concentrate on reporting within a reasonable timescale. He might come across files on these matters in the course of his examination of documents, and we are considering that. However, to return to Deputy Quinn's point, if every point were to be included at this stage, this process would not work.</P>

        <b>:</b> Will the Taoiseach give serious consideration to this in view of the fact that the two incidents could be connected, in that the same perpetrators could have carried out the 1972 and 1974 bombs? Given the proximity of time and the possibility of the two incidents being related, will this be included in the scope of the inquiry, as distinct from the other incidents mentioned by the Taoiseach which occurred over a 25 year period?</P>

      <P>I join with other Members in wishing well the former Chief Justice, Mr. Hamilton, in his quest for the truth. The Taoiseach referred to the staffing and other resources that will be made available to the former Chief Justice. Will he ensure the appropriate Oireachtas committee will also be capable of the task? Will he clarify that his indispensable Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, is conducting a review of the operation, staffing and physical space available to Oireachtas committees&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;which are not functioning in a manner befitting our democracy? What legislative changes does the Taoiseach propose to introduce to allow the Oireachtas committee deal with this matter in a transparent way, with particular reference to making available to the committee the appropriate Garda files?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is envisaged that the report or reports that will be presented to the Government through me will be directed to a joint committee, which will take it from there. The Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunity of Witnesses) Act, 1997, enables the Oireachtas to deal with it, so it does not require any new powers. The Act enables it to send for a person's papers and records. It is envisaged that its powers would be invoked, including when the committee considers in public session the follow-up to the report of the former Chief Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other aspect brought to my notice is that, due to the separation of powers, the Government cannot determine the outcome, <Col N="970" /> which is a matter for the Oireachtas. However, on behalf of the Government, I have given assurances to the Justice for the Forgotten group that we will use our best endeavours to deal with this on the basis of the Act, with the co-operation of the Opposition parties. Whatever resources are necessary for that review will be made available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the many allegations over the years of cover-ups in relation to these matters &ndash; although I do not know what interest Departments and successive Governments on this side of the Border would have in a cover-up &ndash; does the Taoiseach agree it is very necessary that every possible shred of information, such as reports, available to the Government, Government agencies, the Garda and so on is made available to the inquiry?</P>
      <P>There is clearly a connection north of the Border in relation to these matters. What facilities could be made available to the inquiry to ascertain and follow up events north of the Border? In particular, have representations been made to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland seeking his co-operation and that of the various authorities north of the Border?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the question is, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. I indicated that was our intention in my statement on 19 December. I am assured the former Chief Justice will have full access to all the relevant files and papers in Departments and the Garda Síochána. The Government will direct all members of the public service and the Garda Síochána to extend their full co-operation to him. I have already written to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform asking him to put that in place.</P>
      <P>The answer to the second question is also, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. I indicated at Christmas that I had written to the Minister for Foreign Affairs asking him to put the British authorities on notice of our wish and expectation of co-operation from the Secretary of State and his officials, together with the likelihood that there might be more specific requests for their co-operation as the examination develops. As I have said here before, I have regularly raised this with the British Prime Minister.</P>

      <P>Has there been any response to that request for co-operation and information?

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to a question by Deputy Flanagan, the Taoiseach referred to the Government's inability to give assurances in regard to the work of committees because of what he described as the separation of powers. In view of his legal advice that the Government's power does not extend to committees in this way, does he consider that, as recommended by the Committee of Public Accounts, the Oireachtas Vote should be separate from the Government Votes? Does he agree that, in light of his advice about the separation of powers, the determination of the amount of resources required by the Oireachtas to do its work ought to be taken out of the hands of the Government and placed in the hands of the Oireachtas as a whole? Will the Taoiseach reflect on that matter, in view of the obviously quite important legal advice he received about the inability of the Government to influence committees? If the Government is in a position to deny committees money, it is in practice able to influence those committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government and the committee system have been separate since the foundation of our parliamentary system. As regards the Committee of Public Accounts, that was always the advice and it dates back to the 1940s. It has not changed. The proposal on the separation of the Vote is one I remember we discussed 18 years ago when the Deputy, as leader of the House, was dealing with Opposition reform. Now there is a recommendation from the committee on the issue of the Vote being separated and that matter is being looked at.</P>

    <P>To what extent will the Justice for the Forgotten group be involved in the terms of reference following the establishment of the inquiry? Will it be consulted further? To what extent will it be consulted on the detail of the terms of reference? Following the question put by Deputy Currie, are there any means, whether under the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference or legislation, whereby information can be insisted on if it is not <Col N="972" /> forthcoming or are we entirely dependent on the willingness of the British authorities to co-operate voluntarily? Is that the extent of our request? Is there any provision to acquire information other than simply requesting it?</P>

      <P>As I already stated, the Justice for the Forgotten group and its legal representatives have been fully involved in the terms of reference going back to the period before the agreement was reached on 18 December and also in the subsequent discussions up to the time the former Chief Justice took up this position to undertake this task. There was a further meeting on Monday. It is being fully and comprehensively informed.</P>
      <P>There are no powers and I expect the British Government and, through it, the Northern Ireland authorities to co-operate on this matter and to use whatever powers they have to try to get to the source of some of this information which might be within the arms of their security or departmental areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I would initially like to clarify my role in relation to the National Archives Act, 1986, and in particular in relation to the transfer and withholding of files due for transfer from my Department to the National Archives. Such powers as are specifically conferred upon me as Taoiseach by the Act are contained in section 8(11) and section 11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="973" /> Section 8(11) allows me to prescribe by order a particular named class or classes of records which are to be withheld under section 8(4). This provision is designed simply to save the laborious task of individually certifying all records of a particular class where each and every one is required to be withheld for identical reasons. The decision to actually withhold the files is made by the designated officer as defined in section 8 of the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 11 allows me to direct that records which have been withheld under section 8(4) be released for public inspection. I have not exercised this power to date. Any other powers conferred on me under the Act were transferred to the Minister responsible for arts and culture by the Arts and Culture (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order, 1993.</P>
    <P>The total number of files or part files of my Department which have been withheld under section 8(4) of the National Archives Act is 573. As these files are generally of a sensitive or personal nature, it would not be possible to list these without indicating the contents. The decisions to withhold those files are subject to review every five years under section 8(6) of the Act.</P>
    <P>The number of files, including file parts, relating to 1969 which were passed to the National Archives in 1999 amounted to 112 files. An earlier transfer of 969 files covering a span of dates from 1965 to 1969 took place in February 1996. In total, therefore, almost 1,100 files covering the period 1965 to 1969 were transferred, the vast majority of which were made available for public inspection. Only 40 of these files or file parts were withheld under section 8(4) of the National Archives Act. The overwhelming reason for files being withheld were for reasons of privacy and confidentiality.</P>
    <P>Under the Archives Act, the National Archives and the National Archives Advisory Council are two separate bodies. It is the National Archives that receives records from Departments and makes them available for public inspection. The statutory role of the National Archives Advisory Council is to advise the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands on all matters affecting archives and their use by the public and includes any matters relating to the National Archives.</P>
    <P>Therefore, while officials in my Department liaise on a regular basis with staff of the National Archives, including the director, who regularly attends meetings of the council, there has been no direct contact between my Department and the National Archives Advisory Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach, at any stage before a final decision was made, have direct personal discussions with the designated officer? The 573 files which were withheld under section 8(4) are divided as either falling generally within the category of a sensitive or personal nature. While clearly we would not wish to intrude into files of a personal nature, will the Taoiseach elaborate <Col N="974" /> on what &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; means? Does he believe the operation of the system, since he is one of the few Taoisigh who have had an opportunity to exercise it, requires amendment?</P>

      <P>The answer to the first question is no. I have not had discussions or involvement with or influence on the designated officer. The view taken in the Department is that because of the normal interest &ndash; I discussed this with people in the Department who deal with the queries which are usually of a historic and research nature &ndash; as much as possible should be given rather than trying to find reasons to hold onto files. That is a proactive view in terms of making records available. On that basis, most of the files held are personal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 to 19, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I met each of the pillars in early December to hear, at first hand, their priorities and concerns, particularly in the context of the negotiations on a successor to Partnership 2000. The negotiations are proceeding intensively at present. While it would be inappropriate to go into detail at this stage, all sides are continuing to work hard to reach an agreement and it is my hope that we will be in a position to reach a successful conclusion soon. Given that possibility, it would not be feasible to seek to widen representation at this stage. However, all the major issues and concerns facing Irish society will feature in any new agreement and, therefore, it will be as inclusive as possible of all interests and perspectives.</P>
      <P>The final NESC strategy indicates very clearly the potential breadth and depth of a new agreement and certainly the Government is committed to the strategy as the general underpinning framework. I might make the general point that the strategy represents a compromise view between all NESC members on a huge variety of issues and concerns. As such, I am somewhat reluctant to comment on any specific view. However, as a principle, the Government is positively disposed to making Irish society, including the policy and decision-making processes, as open and transparent as possible. Much progress has been made in recent years but, no doubt, there will always be scope for further improvement.</P>
      <P>Regarding representation by the farming pillar, I can confirm that the Irish Farmers Association continues to play a full and active role. On participation by the United Farmers Association, I am satisfied that farming interests are adequately represented at present, but obviously I would not like to prejudge, at this stage, representation in the context of any future agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask a number of questions. If the Government accepted the NESC strategy prior to the formulation of the budget, why did the components of the taxation package contained in the budget fly so flagrantly in the face of that strategy? I accept that any replies the Taoiseach might give will be constricted by the ongoing negotiations. However, in view of the careful leaking, through Government sources, of a £1.5 billion tax package additional to the concessions announced so far in the serial budget which began its passage on 1 December, do I understand that the stability programme which commits the Government to three years of forward financing and expenditure, including current account expenditure, into the year 2002 will be subsequently revised with the authorities in Brussels? Will such a revision require an upward adjustment of what is the lowest level of current account expenditure of any OECD country, namely, 25% of GNP?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>None of the Deputy's supplementary questions relates to those to which I replied initially and I do not propose to answer them. I already dealt with the issue of the NESC strategy. The fundamental principles of the NESC strategy have been used in my discussions with the social partners. The totality of the agreement &ndash; we cannot be sure when it will be finalised &ndash; will reflect those principles. Changing our representations to ECOFIN is a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the partnership agreement will lead to changes in the Finance Bill, specifically in respect of taxation measures which were announced in this Chamber on budget day, and given that the budget gives effect, overall, to expenditure programmes as required under economic and monetary union, is the Taoiseach aware that there might be implications in terms of changing the stability programme, including our commitment to a figure of 25% in respect of current expenditure in the next three years? Will there be any impact in this area?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to Question No. 9 is no, not at this stage of these negotiations, but if, as in the past, there are groups which believe they are not represented, they are entitled to put forward their views. However, the issues the group to which the question refers have raised have been comprehensively dealt with in the final package and deliberations on them accounted for a large part of the discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that those who do unpaid work in the home are not represented directly by any organisation engaged in the partnership discussions? While they are not unique in that regard &ndash; many other organisations are not represented in the discussions &ndash; they are unique in the sense that the Government explicitly stated in its response to criticism of aspects of the budget that issues affecting spouses working in the home would be considered further by the social partners. In that regard, is there a requirement to make some special arrangement to consider the views of this group in the context of any agreement that is being reached? I pose this question in light of the fact that the Government went out of its way to find an escape route from the controversy surrounding the budget by stating that the social partners would consider the matter. It should be noted that those affected are not social partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always the case that some of the groups involved in the social partnership negotiations may not directly represent the views of a particular sector of society and it would be impossible to represent every sector. However, the trade union movement and those involved in the community and social pillar, such as the National Women's Council and others, have put forward a good case for the people to whom the Deputy refers. In this instance, because of debates and discussions about child care and related issues, such as people working in the home, these matters were addressed more comprehensively than heretofore. The agreement, which will be put to union members and society in general for consideration when the process is complete, will clearly reflect these views.</P>
      <P>New groups have emerged during negotiations on every partnership agreement since 1987. We do not rule any of them out of our deliberations because that would be wrong.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Does the Taoiseach agree that, as a result of the talks between the Government, employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, what is being recommended for low paid workers is an insult and adds to the injury of the low pay exploitation from which they already suffer? Does he believe it is fair that a worker who will be earning £4.40 per hour on 1 April will receive an increase of an additional 30p per hour by July 2001 as a result of national wage legislation? Almost 22p out of that 30p will be accounted for from the increase the employers have to give to all workers, approximately 5% or 6% per year, which will lead to an increase of 8p per hour or a miserable £3.12 per week on foot of the national minimum wage legislation. Is the Taoiseach ashamed of this treatment of low paid workers? Does he agree that an increase of approximately £500 per year provided for as a result of the negotiations to workers on low pay is sufficient when repayments on a mortgage for even the most modest house can amount to £1,000 per month?</P>

      <P>The FIS is now calculated on a net income basis. There have been a number of changes for low paid workers and there will be more. I am glad we finally have a minimum wage. The Deputy presented the plight of those on low pay and all Members wish to see improvements in this area. However, 160,000 of these people are nowhere near £4.70 or £4.40 at this stage. One cannot start from the higher base because they are not at that figure, regardless of how low the <Col N="980" /> figure is. We must continue to assist these people through the tax system, social partnership, the welfare system and the helpful changes to FIS. Things will not always be rosy in the garden but we have to continue to improve the circumstances of these people and this agreement will do so.</P>

      <P>What impact will the agreement have on the rate of inflation, given that the Irish rate is twice the euro zone average and by far the highest of any member of the euro?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are inflationary difficulties in the economy which we must monitor closely. We know the reason for some of the increase, but some of it is also related to public and private sector wages. The agreement will not change that position to any great extent and I would be more concerned by the lack of an agreement. Figures released today indicate what would happen if there was no centralised agreement. Agreements would have to be reached on a business by business, employer by employer and union by union basis, giving rise to far greater inflationary pressures. Price stability has been, is and must continue to be a key element of fiscal control. I regard the upward trend in inflation as very serious and it continues to be a concern.</P>

      <P>There are some such signs and I could give many examples. One could look at tender prices in many areas such as the construction industry. We have gone the full circle from a position where, five years ago, contractors were losing a substantial amount of money on contracts to stay in business. However, they are now lodging tender prices which seem excessive and, in some cases, they do not appear too concerned about whether they win the contract. This practice is driving up costs.</P>
      <P>Members who are also members of local authorities have regularly raised with me the tender prices being received for public projects by all local authorities. This is a sign of over-heating in the economy and there are other such signs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The comments reported to have been made by the appeals authority in question do not accord with the facts. Applicants for asylum are given every opportunity to present their cases. They have access to free legal advice and assistance at all stages of the asylum determination process up to and including applications for temporary leave to remain.</P>
      <P>The Refugee Legal Service, which commenced operations on 22 February 1999 from the Refugee Applications Centre, Lower Mount Street, is an independent, comprehensive legal service to assist asylum seekers in all aspects of the Irish asylum procedure. As an additional safeguard, the Minister established an independent monitoring committee to ensure a quality refugee legal service is provided. However, in many cases, applicants do not avail of this legal service until the appeals stage.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that, in many appeal cases, information presented to the independent appeals authority has differed from that given at the initial interview. This additional information invariably has a bearing on the applicant's case for refugee status and, if it had been presented initially, the need for an appeal may not have arisen. Instances such as this help to give rise to a mistaken perception that the initial interview process is somehow unfair and flawed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's aim, and that of the Government, is to provide a fair and effective system for dealing with asylum applications while continuing to meet our international obligations and maintaining our humanitarian approach to those in need of protection. Since taking up office, the Minister has put in place fair and effective procedures for processing asylum applications following consultations with the UNHCR and NGOs. These procedures are in line with our international obligations and in the spirit of the <Col N="983" /> Refugee Act, 1996. The UNHCR has stated that, overall, the procedural arrangements promote a balanced administrative process pending the entry into force of the Refugee Act. All staff working in the asylum division, including my Department's reception and interviewing personnel, have completed appropriate training courses and have received on the job training and experience of interviews and assessments. The training programmes were agreed with the UNHCR and delivered by a combination of the Department's own experienced personnel, UNHCR training specialists and the UNHCR's full-time official here.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i> The Minister has also provided additional staff, free legal aid and put in place independent appeals mechanisms. That the appeals authority in question was free to make public his views on the asylum process, and his subsequent reappointment as an appeals authority, clearly indicates the independence of the appeals authorities.</P>
    <P>The unprecedented number of asylum applications in the latter half of 1999 inevitably placed intense pressure on the asylum services in the State. However, the Minister has taken a number of steps to deal with this increasing number. These include the allocation of additional staff resources and increasing the number of appeals authorities. The Minister has also brought forward amendments to the Refugee Act, 1996, to make it workable and it is his intention to implement it in full very shortly. Applications have been invited for the post of Refugee Applications Commissioner and the competition for the position of chairperson of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal will commence in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>The Minister's ultimate aim and that of the Government is to establish a cohesive framework within which asylum seekers will have their applications processed speedily and fairly in accordance with best international practice and to integrate those persons granted refugee status fully into Irish society.</P>

Is the Minister of State not alarmed, embarrassed or ashamed that somebody with 14 year's experience as a barrister, appointed by the Minister of State and her Government as an independent adjudicator, who heard in the region of 400 cases in 18 months, and who should know the <Col N="984" /> system inside out, was forced to resign because the system is a shambles?</P>

In the face of an unprecedented threat by the entire Legal Aid Board of defamation proceedings on foot of the remarks made by Mr. <i>Finlay, The Irish Times</i> had to issue a public apology. Not all cases are appealed and of the cases appealed, 64% are refused by the appeals authority which suggests that the first instance decisions are reasonable. An analysis of the appeals heard by all appeals authorities indicated that the overall refusal rate was 64%. It is interesting to note that the refusal rate of the appeals authority in question was several percentage points above this, at 73%. When one examines the statistics, it should be recognised that an appeals procedure is needed and that the comments made by Mr. Finlay were strongly and publicly rejected by other appeals authorities.</P>

Did the Minister of State, the Minister or anybody at Government level, in the light of his comments, make any contact with him to find out the problems that existed? Does the Minister of State accept that more than two thirds of the 511 immigrants granted refugee status last year were granted it on appeal, having been turned down at initial stage? Does she agree there is a fundamental flaw running through the system from the beginning to the end?</P>

      <P>There would be no point in having an appeals system if no applicants were successful in appealing their cases. People can introduce new information at appeal stage and, as I stated earlier, if this information was made available at the outset appeals might not be necessary. Applicants are given every opportunity to present their cases and they are given free legal advice which they often take up at appeal stage. On average the 64% of cases appealed produced the same results as at the initial stages. Additional staff were employed to deal with the huge numbers involved. Since this Government came to office, 144 extra staff have been employed and another 120 staff will be taken on. We believe there is a reasonably good system in place, bearing in mind that the numbers keep changing and that every effort is being made to catch up on the backlog by next July. Other changes came into effect and greater numbers arrived. The comments made by Mr. Finlay were strongly and publicly rejected.</P>

      <P>I am advised that the person in question was arrested under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act, 1939, on 27 July 1999 and was subsequently charged with offences under the Firearms Act, 1964. She first appeared before the Special Criminal Court on 30 July 1999. On 11 January 2000 the Special Criminal Court was informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions had decided not to proceed with the prosecution.</P>
      <P>In September, 1999 the DPP received an unsigned letter alleging that irregularities had occurred during the detention of the person concerned in Garda custody. The Director, in turn, referred the letter to the Garda Commissioner who, notwithstanding the fact that no complaint of any kind had been received from either the person in question or her solicitor, appointed a senior Garda officer to investigate the allegations. That investigation is continuing and I am informed by the Garda authorities that it is anticipated that the investigation will be completed in the near future. Clearly, it would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment on this aspect of the matter pending the completion of the investigation. Bearing in mind some misleading public comments that were made, the decision not to proceed with the charges in this case was not linked to the contents of the anonymous letter. That decision was made by the Director of Public Prosecutions on the basis of the Garda investigation into the importation of firearms.</P>

There have been serious failings in this regard in other cases, such as the Nora Wall case, in recent times. Does the Minister of State accept there is a particular onus on her and on the Minister to ensure there is transparency and accountability in relation to prosecutions? Does she further accept that there is a distinction between the decision of the DPP not to initiate a prosecution and the cancellation of a prosecution already initiated which would merit some degree of explanation? We have heard for the first time that the cancellation of <Col N="986" /> the prosecution was not determined by the actual letter received. How does the Minister of State know that because, under the law, she is no more entitled than I am to know the reasons for the cancellations of prosecutions?</P>

        <b>:</b> Does the Minister of State accept that six murders in the first month of the millennium is totally unacceptable and significantly above average? If this trend continues for the year, there will be a record number of gangland killings. Does she accept that in the wake of the 11 gangland killings in Dublin last year, something needs to be done? Does she accept there is a huge criminal sub-culture in Dublin and much of it is drug-related which leads to drug <Col N="988" /> feuds? Guns are readily available and the main actors have no hesitation in abducting, shooting and dumping their victims, or gunning them down in their pubs or cars.

      <P>According to the Garda there is not any evidence that firearms are more freely available than previously. As the Deputy will appreciate, while the term &ldquo;gangland killing&rdquo; is widely used by the media, it does not correspond to the manner in which the Garda Siochána classify crime. The Garda authorities have indicated that organised criminal gangs may have been involved in a number of these murders. I assure the Deputy that the Minister is prepared to consider the introduction of any additional legislative measures, if so requested by gardaí, to tackle this type of serious crime.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about statistics &ndash; I am informed by the Garda authorities that in 1997 and 1998, the last years for which Garda statistics were published, 38 murders were recorded and 34 were detected in each year. The number of murders recorded in the past two years is lower than the number recorded in 1996 and 1995 which was 43 and 42, respectively. The detection rate has also improved. In 1995, 43 were recorded and 32 detected and in 1998, 38 murders were recorded and 34 detected. While it is of no consolation to the families of those who have died in violent circumstances, the House will be interested to know that the national murder rate for 1998 is approximately 1.05 per 100,000 of the population, which is among the lowest in Europe.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that this matter is currently the subject of an internal Garda investigation. If disciplinary proceedings are warranted, as the Deputy is probably aware, the Garda Commissioner is vested, under legislation, with the general direction and control of An Garda Siochána, including matters of discipline which are governed by the Garda Siochána discipline regulations. I also understand that the Director of Public Prosecutions has directed that the dismissal of the court proceedings be made the subject of a case stated and that this course of action is being followed.</P>
      <P>I hope the Deputy will appreciate that it is not the practice of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law reform to comment on individual Garda investigations save in the most exceptional of circumstances. Due to operational reasons great care must be taken not to prejudice the outcome of any ongoing Garda investigation or subsequent prosecution. The Minister will, however, ask the Garda Commissioner to advise him of the outcome of the internal Garda investigation to which I referred.</P>

        <b>:</b> Is the Minister of State aware that this case has given rise to considerable public concern and suspicion? This is an alleged assault after a court case in which a garda sergeant was found guilty of perverting the course of justice and received a nine month suspended sentence. Is the Minister aware that the photographer in question, who works for the <i>Irish Independent</i>, was verbally abused, had his camera smashed in his face and his front teeth broken? The summons was issued only days before the expiry of the six month period for its serving. A <Col N="990" /> garda allegedly made several attempts to serve the summons without getting any reply. The summons was re-issued, the garda became ill again and by the time the summons was finally served on the individual in question, it was too late and the case was thrown out of court. Why was the issue of the original summons delayed by six months? Why was the summons not put in the hands of another member of the Garda Síochána when one garda quite obviously had problems with his health?</P>

I am not in a position to give a definitive answer to this because the matters are outside our direct control but I assure the House that there will be no avoidable delay in finalising the internal Garda investigation.

      <P>A Council decision is required before Europol can enter into negotiations with third states and international organisations on the exchange of information. The format of a draft decision had been drawn up and was to be submitted for adoption by the Council at the meeting of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers on 2 December 1999.

The Council of Ministers should also seek to develop such an agency to co-operate with the US and Asian drugs enforcement agencies on a region to region basis so regional controls can be put in <Col N="991" /> place.

      <P>The purpose of the decision is to allow Europol to enter negotiations with certain countries and international organisations to exchange information. The objective of Europol is to facilitate the fight against organised crime by obtaining, analysing and exchanging information. Clearly, information from third countries could be of benefit in combating crime that affects the European Union.</P>
      <P>Any decision will require the negotiations to address the type of information to be exchanged, the purpose for which it can be used, data protection issues, confidentiality and secondment of liaison officers. Information from third countries could be of benefit in combating crime in the European Union.</P>

      <P>Before Europol can exchange information with third countries certain conditions must be met. The Council decision must be adopted, Europol must satisfy itself that the country which is party to the negotiation has adequate data protection laws, a draft agreement must be drawn up, the joint supervisory body must be satisfied that any draft agreement meets data protection requirements and then a second Council decision is required to allow the adoption of the draft agreement. Certainly the suggestion put forward by the Deputy will be considered by us and will be brought forward at the next meeting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Illegal immigration to Ireland is most often associated with the abuse of the asylum system, which is being encouraged by internationally organised criminal elements who engage in widespread trafficking in human beings across European boundaries. A number of measures have been or are in the process of being introduced, or are under consideration with a view to dealing with this problem.</P>
      <P>Under the Aliens Order (No. 3), 1997, immigration officers have the power to carry out checks on persons arriving in the State from elsewhere in the common travel area and to refuse such persons leave to land on the same grounds as apply to persons arriving from outside the common travel area. These checks are selective to avoid interfering with the freedom of movement enjoyed by all Irish and UK citizens.</P>
      <P>The Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill, currently before the House, criminalises the activities of traffickers. The Minister also plans to introduce fingerprinting of asylum seekers to deter multiple applications and facilitate the identification of persons who have already applied for asylum in other EU states. Other measures being considered include the introduction of carriers' liability, under which carriers bringing inappropriately documented persons to Ireland would be penalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary to be mindful of the difficulties involved in dealing with illegal immigration. People who genuinely qualify for refugee status may, and frequently do, arrive here together with those whose primary purpose is to enter the State for economic reasons. As often as not, there is no way of knowing, without making the necessary inquiries, whose application for refugee status is genuine and whose is not. Given the difficulties which inevitably arise in checking information provided about the circumstances prevailing in the applicant's claimed country of origin and information which may be in the possession of other jurisdictions visited by the applicant, the process of assessment and inquiry inevitably takes time, no matter how efficient the application processing system might be. Short cut approaches would clearly be inconsistent with the <Col N="993" /> requirement that we follow due process and respect the rights of each individual, regardless of whether his or her claim is genuine.</P>
    <P>Ireland, together with all other countries which are signatories to the Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees, is obliged to consider each and every claim for asylum made by non-nationals arriving here in accordance with internationally accepted norms and procedures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Illegal immigrants do a great disservice to genuine asylum seekers. They screw up the whole system. There should be a mechanism in place to see that the genuine asylum seekers are granted asylum and that economic migrants who come from countries which have no political, religious or ethnic persecution are not even accepted into the State never mind have their applications processed.</P>
      <P>Of the illegal immigrants entering the State, over 80% are entering through Northern Ireland, not Rosslare or the other ports which are so highly publicised. We must do something quickly. There should be a treaty with these countries, many of which are applicants for membership of the European Union, to ensure these people are re-admitted to their own countries rather than allowed to stay here when they clearly have no hope of getting political asylum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Persons arriving in Ireland from Northern Ireland and the UK, including those who arrive through the various mechanisms referred to by the Deputy, are subject to <i>ad hoc</i> checks only. While many people undoubtedly take advantage of this, the Minister would be reluctant to make these checks systematic having regard to the enormous benefits of the common travel area provided for Irish and UK nationals. He is not convinced that asking the Garda Commissioner to devote resources to this type of border control would be either efficient or effective having regard to the very large number of possible crossing points and the disruption that could result for genuine travellers. Abuse of the common travel area is better addressed, on balance, by other measures and initiatives, such as the Illegal Trafficking Bill, currently at Committee Stage, and the planned introduction of fingerprinting of asylum seekers. These should assist in identifying persons who seek to abuse the system without imposing unreasonable restrictions on the genuine traveller.</P>

These are asylum applications. Deputy Higgins spoke about asylum seekers on the one hand and illegal immigrants on the other. We all know that a huge number of illegal immigrants are applying for asylum. With regard to Deputy Deasy's question, I am certain that consultations take place. There is important information in the Council of Europe and I will make sure that officials in my Department are in regular contact with it.</P>

The errors that led to the events referred to by Deputy Higgins have been dealt with in detail in the report of the Director of Public Prosecutions.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>This is not a new issue, it has been around for some years, having been considered and reported on, as Deputies will know, by the Law Reform Commission in 1994. I accept it is an important and complex issue which requires careful consideration and extensive consultation in advance of any decision on the introduction of legislation. The Law Reform Commission considered that the issue has considerable implications for the administration of justice in general.</P>
      <P>The Courts Service, which was established by the Minister on 9 November 1999 has responsibility under the Courts Service Act, 1998, to manage the courts and provide information on the courts system to the public. I understand from the Courts Service that the televising of court cases is a matter which will be reviewed by the service in due course. Any such review will include full consultation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Judiciary, members of the legal profession, court users and other interested bodies. The Minister will look carefully at the recommendations in this area.</P>
      <P>As regards broadcasting tribunal proceedings, the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 to 1998, are silent on the matter of televising or broadcasting proceedings of a tribunal. While the likelihood is that an amendment of those Acts would be required to permit televising or broadcasting of proceedings, it may be that such provision could be made in the instrument or order appointing the tribunal without the need for legislation. It is, of course, a matter for this House and the Seanad to resolve that it is expedient that a tribunal of inquiry is established in each case and to agree the terms of reference of any tribunal. The question as to whether the televising or broadcasting of a particular tribunal should be provided for would arise in any event in the context of the passing of such a resolution.</P>
      <P>While tribunals are not courts, the application of the Acts of 1921 to 1998 to a tribunal give a tribunal certain powers, rights and privileges that are vested in the High Court for evidential purposes. Given those circumstances, it may be that debate on the televising or broadcasting of proceedings before a tribunal would have to take into account the considerations that would also arise in the context of examination of the question of broadcasting or televising of court proceedings. As I mentioned earlier, the Courts Service review of this issue will include full consultation with the various interested bodies and the Minister will consider carefully recommendations which they may bring forward in this area.</P>

        <b>:</b> I thank the Minister of State for her reply. In view of the fact that the Constitution states that justice must be administered in public and in light of the recent suggestions by Mr. Justice Paul Carney that court proceedings should be televised and the fact that <Col N="998" /> technological advances are such that it should be possible to do so without a great deal of difficulty, who will make the final decision, will it be the Government, the Judiciary or the Courts Service?</P>

      <P>As I stated in my reply, because of the many implications of this development, there will be a lot of consultations with all those concerned, despite the Law Reform Commission report on the matter, before a decision can be reached. We should await the Courts Service's review and consideration of the process. It will consult not just the Judiciary but members of the legal profession, courts users and others concerned and it is important that the Minister considers the recommendations before a decision is taken.</P>

      <P>Arising from her reply, I wish to ask the Minister of State three brief questions. First, will the televising of court proceedings require legislation, second, does the Minister of State agree with the assertion of Mr. Justice Paul Carney of the High Court that a strong argument could be made for the televising of court cases and, third, what is the opinion of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on this matter? The personal opinion of the Minister is important rather than leave it to an agency established to run the affairs of the courts.</P>

      <P>On the opinion of the Minister and the need for legislation, Article 34.1 of the Constitution states: &ldquo;Justice shall be administered in courts established by law by judges appointed in the manner provided by this Constitution, and, save in such special and limited cases as may be prescribed by law, shall be administered in public.&rdquo;  The Minister is not reticent in his views when introducing legislation in this area. However, before we begin to talk about introducing legislation, we need to decide what we are legislating for. In addition to whether the legislation will prove necessary, it is a topic which will need considerable debate both in this House and elsewhere. As I said in my reply, the Minister will consider carefully any proposals put to him in this regard.</P>

This is a complaint made by people who attend court hearings, including families of victims and so on. These people cannot hear what is happening and perhaps the Minister of State would convey that message to the appropriate authority. The Deputy asked about tribunals. My personal opinion is that the tribunals currently taking place should be broadcast.

      <P>As I stated, the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 to 1998, are silent on the televising or broadcasting of the proceedings of tribunals. While tribunals are not courts, the application of the Acts of 1921 to 1998 to a tribunal give it certain powers, rights and privileges which are vested in the High Court for evidential purposes. Given those circumstances, it may be that the debate on the televising or broadcasting of proceedings before a tribunal would have to take into account the considerations that would also arise in the context of the examination of the broadcasting or televising of court proceedings. The Courts Service's review of this issue will include full consultation with various interested bodies&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that during the last quarter of 1999 there were 48 armed robberies and that the amount of money taken was in the region of £470,000. I am also informed that 37 persons were arrested in respect of these offences and that over £12,000 was recovered. I am further informed that the comparable figures for 2000 to date indicate that there were 34 armed robberies and that approximately £110,000 was taken. I understand that 28 people were arrested in respect of these crimes and that almost £13,000 was recovered. These statistics are provisional and may be subject to change.</P>
      <P>Over the longer term, however, the available statistics indicate a strong and sustained decrease in armed crime in recent years. The level of armed crime in 1998 was approximately 40% of the 1995 value. The statistics also show that the detection rate over those five years has risen from 28% in 1995 to 40% in 1998. The Minister is concerned about armed crime, but the most recent statistics available indicate that current levels are still well below those of 1995 or 1996. The Minister is concerned with the recent increase in armed crime and has raised the matter with the Garda Commissioner.</P>

    <Title>Planning and Development Bill, 1999  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Planning and Development Bill, 1999, represents the most fundamental reform of planning in Ireland since the enactment of the 1963 Planning Act. The Bill is the outcome of a two year review of Irish planning law which I initiated on coming into office. It has been accepted that the Bill represents a genuine effort to reform and update our planning laws in a fundamental way. It is the result of a great deal of work in my Department and has been greatly assisted by views received from all quarters.</P>
      <P>The Bill is timely and could not be more relevant to the issues of the day. It will assist in the implementation of the National Development Plan 2000-2006, the most ambitious plan we have ever had for the development of this country. Crucially, it also makes a radical contribution to increasing the supply of social and affordable housing. Therefore the enactment of this Bill is a priority for the Government and for me. I am sure we can count on the co-operation of the whole House in ensuring the Bill is dealt with thoroughly and expeditiously as in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as introducing fundamental reforms, the Bill consolidates in one enactment nine Acts and five sets of environmental impact assessment regulations. It has 245 sections and six schedules in almost 220 pages. When considering the Bill, it should be seen as an integrated package of pro<Col N="1004" /> posals which strikes a balance that is right for its time.</P>
    <P>The Bill was dealt with in great detail in the Seanad. While it contains a huge amount of detail I do not propose to repeat my Second Stage speech in the Seanad where I elaborated on the principles on which the Bill is based. We will have a detailed consideration of Part V on Committee Stage, as in the Seanad. The explanatory and financial memorandum indicates where new provisions have been introduced into the planning code and where old ones have been re-stated. Almost all provisions of the existing planning code have been subject to some revision.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House has been much improved during its passage through the Seanad. I put forward a substantial number of amendments taking into account the many excellent submissions I received as well as the further consideration given to the Bill in my Department and in the Office of the Attorney General. I also took on board many of the Opposition amendments. The three regional seminars which I convened after publication of the Bill also gave rise to many useful suggestions. These seminars were attended by a wide range of interests and I thank everyone who attended for their constructive comments on the Bill. A supplementary memorandum circulated to Deputies also highlights the major changes introduced to the Bill in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>If there is one observation I might make about the debate on the Bill in the Seanad it is that many of the non-Government amendments tabled related to technical and procedural matters which are much more suited to regulations than to primary legislation. It is important in an area such as planning law that primary legislation lays down the policies and principles of the code together with a comprehensive legal framework, but that day to day administrative matters are left to regulations. This gives us the flexibility to adapt to changes and to new situations as they arise. It should be noted that many of the more substantial provisions in the planning regulations have been incorporated into the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that because of recent court judgments, where there is a reference in the Bill to regulations, there is an onus on us to state what policy we want to achieve in the regulations. This has been imposed as a result of a court decision and we have done that in all cases in the Bill itself.</P>
    <P>Despite having made improvements in the Seanad, we may be able to further improve the Bill in this House and I look forward to a constructive debate. I have received further submissions since the Bill commenced its passage through the Seanad and having considered these submissions I will bring forward further amendments on Committee Stage to improve the Bill. I will have some further amendments to further minimise delays in infrastructure projects. In the Seanad I undertook to consider measures on the control of quarries and I also said I would bring in anti-avoidance measures related to the housing <Col N="1005" /> provisions. I intend to examine positively any amendments put down by the Opposition. We had a positive experience in the Seanad in that the debate teased out a number of matters and we were able to amend the Bill.</P>
    <P>When I commenced my review of planning law, I said the planning system of the 21st century must be strategic in approach, be imbued with an ethos of sustainable development and deliver a performance of the highest quality.</P>
    <P>In relation to a strategic approach, for the first time the Bill introduces a structured hierarchy of plans from the broad national picture down to the local development level. The local authority development plan retains its status as the anchor of our planning system. However, it will be informed by regional planning guidelines which will provide a long-term strategic framework at the regional level. These guidelines and development plans will be placed in the context of a national spatial strategy which my Department has now begun to prepare as part of the Government's policies for balanced regional development set out in the national development plan. The Bill already allows for national spatial plans to be taken into consideration in the planning system and I intend to strengthen further the references in the Bill to national spatial planning.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for statutory local area plans which will bridge the gap between the broad objectives of the development plan and actual development proposals. Local area plans will enable communities to get involved in improving and developing their own immediate areas and to ensure the necessary ancillary facilities are planned in new developments.</P>
    <P>Turning to my second principle, the concept of sustainable development has been woven into the fabric of the Bill. On first glance it can be seen that the &ldquo;proper planning and development&rdquo; of an area has been replaced as the Bill's touchstone by &ldquo;proper planning and sustainable development&rdquo;. It goes deeper than a change in terminology &ndash; the principle of sustainable development has been fully integrated into the Bill.</P>
    <P>For example, the development objectives to be contained in development plans reflect modern environmental concerns. Environmental assessment of regional planning guidelines, development plans and local area plans is provided for. These provisions are also intended to meet the requirements of the proposed European Union directive on strategic environment assessment which is nearing completion in Brussels. The interface between pollution control licensing and planning control has been revised to allow a more holistic approach to be adopted in considering development with requires IPC licences. Power has also been taken to bring large scale afforestation and peat extraction within the planning system where necessary and there are new measures to protect the landscape.</P>
    <P>I measc na rudaí eile go léir tugtar aitheantas sa Bhille seo don Ghaeltacht agus do chultúr na Gaeltachta sa chóras pleanála. Phléamar an cheist <Col N="1006" /> seo go mion sa tSeanad agus neartaíomar an Bille go mór ina thaobh seo. Beidh dualgas an údaráis áitiúla feasta an Ghaeilge mar theanga phobail sa Ghaeltacht a thabhairt san áireamh agus a chur chun cinn sa mhéid is gur féidir sin a dhéanamh sa chóras pleanála.</P>
    <P>The question arose in the Seanad of giving a concrete definition of sustainable development in the Bill. I gave a good deal of thought to this but felt in the end that it was such a dynamic and all embracing concept, and one which will evolve over time, that any legal definition would tend to restrict and stifle it. Infusing the concept through the Bill, as we have done, gives effect to it in a holistic and comprehensive way.</P>
    <P>My third principle was to ensure that the planning system delivers a quality service. I am seeking quality development plans, quality and timely decisions, an accessible and transparent planning service and proper enforcement; and the Bill makes many changes to ensure that these can be delivered.</P>
    <P>The local authority remains the key decision making body in planning control. To strengthen this position, the Bill establishes for the first time in Irish planning law, statutory recognition for any submissions or observations which members of the public make to a local authority regarding planning applications. This is an important new right. In turn, the Bill provides that the right of appeal to An Bord Pleanála will only be available to those third parties who showed an interest in the initial application. The position regarding the right of appeal for third parties will still remain the most liberal in the European Union.</P>
    <P>The Bill places an emphasis on timely decision making and tightens up a number of time limits under current law. The statutory recognition given to pre-planning discussion in the Bill should also aid the decision making process.</P>
    <P>Strategic development zones are being introduced to provide greater certainty in planning for development which is of strategic importance to the national economy, especially where we have to compete for internationally mobile investment.</P>
    <P>The national development plan has provided for further huge investment in infrastructure and the Bill will have a vital role in delivering that infrastructure on schedule. The responsibility for approving compulsory purchase of land, local authority EIA projects and road schemes is being transferred from the Minister to An Bord Pleanála. Procedural deadlines have been introduced to ensure that the process happens within a set time frame. The board will have an objective to deal with CPOs and EIAs within 18 weeks, the same period which applies to planning appeals. The board has shown in the past that it can meet this strict objective when it has the resources to meet the demand placed on it. I am confident the board will perform its new tasks equally well. The transfer of functions underlines the role of the Minister for Environment and Local Government as policy maker, while leaving decisions on individual projects to an independent expert body. <Col N="1007" /> This is a sensible division of functions and is in line with the strategic management initiative.</P>
    <P>As is the case for any law, if people are to respect the planning laws they must be assured that they will be enforced. The Bill introduces major reforms to the enforcement code. It has been simplified and strengthened. Local authorities will be obliged to respond to people's genuine concerns and the Bill deals once and for all with the long-standing problems of unfinished estates.</P>
    <P>Part V &ndash; housing supply &ndash; introduces a major new dimension to planning legislation and contains the most radical and probably the most contentious provisions of the Bill. Given the time constraints I will not be able to go into individual provisions in great detail, but I refer Members to my Second Stage speech in Seanad Éireann, which I am sure they have read in great detail.</P>
    <P>The provision of adequate housing for all members of society has been a major issue of public policy for Governments of all shades since the State gained its independence. It has further been a traditional aim of Government to facilitate people in buying their own homes where this is possible. This has had a beneficial stabilising effect on society, and home ownership is an aspiration which the vast majority of people hold dearly. The Government will continue to support that aspiration, but the State also has a responsibility to assist those who cannot afford to house themselves and this has been done through the provision of local authority or other social housing. Part V is designed to underpin these two planks of the housing policy.</P>
    <P>The reasons for the price increases and the effects they have had on the market, and in particular on first-time buyers, have been discussed many times and I do not intend to rehearse them again now. Suffice it to say that the Government is determined to ensure that all our people can attain their aspiration of owning their own homes. The present trends in house prices are, in the long run, profoundly damaging to social cohesion and future economic well being. They are no less damaging to the construction industry which builds the houses and the people who work in it. They will be reflected in wage demands from these workers who see the very houses they are building being priced out of their reach.</P>
    <P>The question which must be asked is how can housing on affordable terms be delivered to low or mid income households unless land costs are kept down. The Government considers that the provisions of Part V provide the answer. For many, housing will remain as unaffordable as ever if prices must to include exorbitant site costs such as those which currently prevail in many areas. Yet the high value of this land derives from the action of the local authority in zoning it and partly, if not fully, funding infrastructure services.</P>
    <P>With regard to social housing, Part V is vital in ensuring that local authorities have access to a supply of development land for their own housing <Col N="1008" /> programmes, without binding the taxpayer to paying high prices for land the value of which arises in large measure from the actions of the local authority in zoning and servicing the land. This provision is critical if we are to deliver on the greatly expanded £6 billion programme of social and affordable housing contained in the national development plan.</P>
    <P>The plan will lead to an additional 35,000 local authority units, an increase in the voluntary housing sector provision of houses from 500 a year to 4,000 a year and an increase to 2,000 units per year under the current local authority affordable housing and shared ownership schemes. Without Part V, the Government will get a much lower return for the tax payer's investment, local authorities will find it more difficult to obtain land and we will not have the badly needed housing as quickly.</P>
    <P>If we really want to promote the development of more socially integrated and more inclusive communities, we must reflect on the housing policies. Part V will do that by ensuring that in future private developments will make provision for social and/or affordable housing in an integrated way. I hope the days of building vast tracts of one-class housing estates are gone because we can all see the problems, inefficiencies and fractured communities that type of thing created in the past.</P>
    <P>In providing the 500,000 homes required over the next ten years, the planning system should be able to prevent the creation of any more addresses which damage one's prospects of a job or deny one the opportunity to participate fully in society in accordance with one's talents and aspirations.</P>
    <P>I am anxious, as I said in the Seanad, to ensure that Part V will have effect at the earliest possible date. Local authorities would share that interest and I have asked them to make a start right away on preparing the groundwork for their housing strategies. In order to assist in this, shortly I will be sending to authorities detailed draft guidelines on the implementation of Part V.</P>
    <P>The proposals in Part V are designed to meet a clearly identified concern of public policy and the common good. The Government believes the measures are well targeted and clearly defined and will have regard to the prevailing and anticipated housing situation in any area. I assure the House and the public that the measures are proportionate and relevant to the issues being tackled. The Bill has been prepared having regard to the constitutional principles of fairness, equality and proportionality. The detailed nature of the proposals in Part V is quite deliberate and is necessary to meet the constitutional imperative that the intention of the Legislature be spelled out precisely.</P>
    <P>I readily acknowledge that the new functions being given to local authorities and An Bord Pleanála and the greater demands of the Bill in regard to some existing functions will require the allocation of greater resources and the ongoing <Col N="1009" /> development of planning skills. If a good planning system is seen as an essential guarantor of our future quality of life &ndash; I think it is &ndash; there would be general acceptance that these resources should be provided. I am committed to providing the necessary resources and my record in this respect speaks for itself. I have also been in contact with UCD, which has the only planning school in the country, about the increased need for professional planning staff.</P>
    <P>Tugann an Bille seo uirlis éifeactach dúinn chun córas pleanála níos fearr a chur i bhfeidhm sa tír seo: córas pleanála a ligfidh don fhorbairt atá riachtanach dul ar aghaidh go tapaidh, ach i gcónaí i slí a chosnaíonn ár dtimpeallacht agus ár n-oidhreacht. Dá bhrí sin, molaim go láidir an Bille seo don Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Minister that, for the same reasons as him, I also want the Bill dealt with expeditiously. However, the Bill is important enough to require careful consideration, both on Second and Committee Stages. Without wishing to imply any criticism, I hope the Minister will listen carefully to what is said on Second Stage and that when we come to Committee Stage there will be the possibility of a meeting of minds about a number of areas where the Bill needs reinforcement. The Minister has already indicated some of those areas.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister, without hesitation, on having organised a series of seminars on the provisions of the Bill. Clearly, the Bill will be very important not only for members of local authorities but also for the many people involved in the planning process. The decision to hold those seminars was an important one. The Minister knows as well as I do &ndash; I am sure he has received the same feedback &ndash; that those who attended them found them very useful. Even if the seminars gave people reasons to disagree with the Minister, they were a worthwhile exercise and I commend everybody who was involved in organising them.</P>
      <P>In general, the more I think about this Bill the more I believe my first reaction to it was correct, that it will be a dead letter unless and until local authorities are given the funding and personnel resources required to implement its provisions. I will go into that point in more detail later.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides no democratic reform of the planning system. I intend to table amendments to make the system more open, more responsive to public needs and more amenable to properly exercised political influence by the elected members of local authorities. After all, they are elected by the people to do a job for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The housing provisions in Part V are unworkable and any attempt to implement them as they stand will drive up house prices further, not only in the upper end of the market but also in what are called affordable houses. We need adequate resources for local authorities to build houses for rental and for purchase, and to make sites available at reasonable prices. As things stand, An <Col N="1010" /> Bord Pleanála simply cannot cope with the current volume of appeals. It needs further strengthening because the job that was done some time ago has demonstrated itself to be inadequate. I will oppose the imposition of charges on community groups that wish to involve themselves in the planning process in the public interest, and I will also oppose the proposals in the Bill to limit their right of appeal. The Environmental Protection Agency, the duties of which are very important to the planning process, is seriously under-resourced. It has now become a part of the planning problem and that must be rectified.</P>
    <P>The Bill's provisions on the content and objectives of development plans are incomplete. They can be strengthened by making mandatory the provisions in the Bill that are currently optional. The Government's failure to produce a spatial strategy will rob the Bill's provisions of much of their potential effect for at least the next two years. I suppose it is an accident, but a slightly ironic one, that we should have received on our desks within the last few days a further statement from the Minister about the spatial strategy at a time when we are beginning to consider the Bill's provisions.</P>
    <P>The aims of this Bill will not be achieved unless local authorities are given the necessary resources. All over the country decisions on planning applications are being delayed because local authorities simply do not have the necessary staff or in many cases the necessary expertise to deal with applications within the statutory timeframe. Simple applications to build houses are systematically long-fingered in local authorities.</P>
    <P>Every Member has received visits from planning applicants who, at 8 p.m. on a Friday night &ndash; the final day on which the local authority could act &ndash; have received a note requesting further information. Very often the note requests further information that has already been supplied. That is unacceptable. To discover, as we do from time to time, that the communication from the local authority is delivered to the wrong person is even worse. I am not the only public representative who has come across such cases. The country is populated by large numbers of people with names like Murphy and Byrne. It is not uncommon to have large numbers of people with the same surname in townlands and parishes, but it is utterly unacceptable that planning authorities, at the last moment, send communications at the dead of night to the wrong James Byrne seeking more information about his application for planning permission. They are doing this systematically.</P>
    <P>Everybody now accepts that it takes at least two months to get a reaction from a planning authority to a simple application for planning permission to build a house. Applications for industrial activities are held up because planning staff do not have the skills necessary to process them. The delays that are now being experienced are not only due to the current boom conditions. Even if the levels of applications were lower, the technical nature of some applications would <Col N="1011" /> stretch the capacities of planners. Applications will continue to be held up for as long as local authorities are short on skills and staff.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that we have only one third level institution producing graduates with the requisite skills. There is an immense problem there. Graduates of that course are quickly snapped up by private enterprise which pays them larger salaries than local authorities. There is another third level institution in Northern Ireland which produces graduates with the relevant skills, but they are also snapped up. There is a case for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to get together with the Minister for Education and Science to see what can be done to meet these needs. One thing is sure, these delays and shortages are not occasioned only by the current boom. We are, thank God, becoming more conscious of what is needed to protect our environment. We are gradually getting used to the idea of sustainable development. As that becomes a reality and as those concerns increasingly become part of our consciousness, the consideration we give to the way we develop housing, industrial activity and commercial activity and how we assess applications will continue to become more complex and demanding. Our reactions to this must become much more refined. We will need great reinforcement of the skill levels available in local authorities to deal with that, even if levels of activity in the sector begin to decrease. That problem must be dealt with. It is an area where manpower planning could again become fashionable and useful.</P>
    <P>The Minister will remember when, not so many years ago, our third level institutions began to provide courses in environmental studies. Looking back on them now, there was a rather naive concept of what constituted environmental studies. That has begun to change. However, because the matter has become more complex, multi-faceted and demanding, some institutions have withdrawn from that area of study and the burden on the remaining ones has become greater. It will continue to be a matter of concern for public policy that the people in our system who must deal with this are, on the whole, less skilled than those employed by applicants and developers to make their cases. That inequality has serious dangers for the quality of public policy and the pursuit of a policy of sustainable development. I encourage the Minister and his Government colleagues to address that issue urgently with our third level institutions.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to improve the enforcement of planning decisions. I was very pleased to see that part of this Bill is devoted entirely to the question of enforcement. We need to reinforce legislation to deal with abuses of the planning laws, but effective action requires staff resources which local authorities currently lack. It is worthwhile illustrating how bad the situation is. To my knowledge, which I admit might be incomplete, there <Col N="1012" /> has been only one case where a developer who built houses without planning permission was required, as he can be by law, to demolish them. I probably should not mention the area, but the case occurred some years ago in the mid-west. The Minister will be delighted to hear I am not laying the responsibility at his feet as it is the responsibility of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Most Members will have encountered cases of unauthorised development where local authorities have been maddeningly reluctant to take action under the legislation they have to back them up. How often have we heard local authority officials say they know something is illegal and that they can take the developer to court, but that it would cost them too much to do so? They do not want to undertake the costs of a possible High Court action because they might have to eventually give permission for retention or for a structure similar to the one built without authorisation. That is utterly unacceptable. I am sure almost every Member can point to at least one or two cases of unauthorised developments in his or her constituency.</P>
    <P>Some people feel they are so immune from the provisions of the law that they do not even bother to apply for permission to retain. They think that if they can get away with it for long enough, no one will upset the apple cart by requiring them to demolish the offending structure. As a rule, I like to see the law being applied in a fair, just and even-handed way. However, I am tempted to say to local authority officials in some cases that they should take exemplary action to bring the full weight of even the existing law, which provides for this, to bear on such people to make it clear they must remove the offending structure, to get court orders to apply penalties every day the structure remains in place and to make it clear that no application for planning permission or retention will be countenanced on the site in question.</P>
    <P>Lawyers will probably tell me that is going too far. However, that kind of savagery is needed in a few cases to make the point that the law must be respected. In every case in which planning law is flouted in this way, someone else's rights are being infringed. I am glad there has been a reorganisation and reinforcement of the provisions in this Bill and I hope the resources are provided to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated in his speech that he felt we now have an answer to the problem of unfinished housing estates that cannot be taken in charge. I do not share his rosy view of the provisions in this Bill. I agree they substantially improve the situation. However, they will not sort out the problem forever because we still have the problem of builders losing one legal personality and acquiring another. The only way to deal with that is to ensure that during the course of construction we can have conditions applied and penalties for non-compliance that will be so painful that people will not be tempted to flout the law. <Col N="1013" /> That is the only way we can ensure such practices are stopped.</P>
    <P>It is an advance in the Bill to say it will not be a defence in an action against an unauthorised development to say that an application has been made for permission to retain. However, we need to go further than that. It is my experience and that of many Members that the kind of bonds required from house builders in particular to guarantee their performance in accordance with the conditions of planning permission are derisory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In the vast majority of cases the bond required from someone building 30 or 40 houses would not represent the profit on two of them. It is worth people's while to run that risk and ignore the provisions. They are making such large profits that they feel any penalty applied will be negligible. However, it is not negligible to the people who have to live for years with the results of that in housing estates with uncompleted road surfaces, lights not installed, drainage not properly catered for and other problems. The Bill needs improvement in that regard and I hope the Minister will be open to amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>However, we must find a way of dealing with the many housing estates around the country which are unfinished and will not come within the scope of the Bill, but where the residents are still suffering the effects of this high-handed, cavalier attitude on the part of builders. I am not saying by a long shot that every housing developer is guilty of this but a sufficient number of them have done this for it to be a real problem. Again, I would think there is hardly a Member of this House who does not have this problem somewhere in his or her constituency or, indeed, have a problem which has existed for many years.</P>
      <P>That is not to say anything about housing estates which have not yet been taken over by the local authority because the local authority has not got its act together. That is a different day's work. I hope that when we get to Committee Stage we can look at these provisions on enforcement, reinforce them a bit further, if possible, and find a way to deal with the problem which exists in estates which have been left unfinished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill includes recent new legislation on the protection of our architectural heritage, legislation we went through with some care and which got wide support in the Oireachtas. That legislation also imposes new tasks and obligations on local authorities. I support the legislation on which I think we had a very worthwhile debate. The Minister did not accept all our amendments but we had a reasonable meeting of minds on most of it. I am conscious of the fact that much of what that legislation requires local authorities to do will be new to those local authorities. It will require them to take action of a kind of which, so <Col N="1014" /> far, most of them at best have very limited experience. Here again, the effective implementation of this Bill cannot be secured unless local authorities have the necessary personnel and skills.</P>
    <P>One would be amazed by the odd things which can happen. I came across a case recently, which will probably fall within the provisions of this new scheme &ndash; I recognise the Minister already has the scheme up and running &ndash; where it was necessary to carry out extensive repairs to the roof of a house which was over 200 years old. Part of the problem was that over the passage of time, some of the slates had become badly eroded. Yet the local authority planners, who felt they had a job to do under the legislation, wanted the owner of this house to put back in place the old slates which had given rise to the problem in the first place.</P>
    <P>That is not really what the Bill set out to do. If it is to do anything, it is to make sure the fabric of these structures is protected. If the protection which is on them at the moment and which has been since they were built is no longer adequate for the job, there is no way out of it but to replace it. That kind of problem is only one of many which arise from the fact that local authorities now have to venture into a new area and take on responsibilities which perhaps we might have believed they always had but which have now become explicit since this legislation has been in place. It is legislation which I fully support and I hope will have the intended effect.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons and a great many others, we need to look again at staffing levels in local authorities. I know the Minister told local authorities some time ago that they could recruit new planning staff. The problem has been partly one of supply and partly because some local authorities have not got their act together to go about recruiting people. I am not making a plea to give the local authorities <i>carte blanche</i> in recruit new staff &ndash; far from it &ndash; but they need more qualified staff. There is, however, more to it than that. The administrative systems of many of our local authorities are antiquated, excessively bureaucratic and downright inimical to communication, both internal and external. The productivity of many of our local authorities could be significantly enhanced by the simple adoption of modern management systems. Modernisation of management systems, of course, will not be enough to provide the range of skills now required in local authorities. We have to deal with the supply of qualified people.</P>
    <P>There is a point here of which we have to be conscious. It is high time we realised that we cannot continue to legislate for new tasks for local authorities and impose new obligations on them without also looking at the resources we give them for implementation. For as long as we continue willy-nilly to add new functions to local authorities without a corresponding provision of resources, we are multiplying levels of inefficiency and are adding to the frustrations of <Col N="1015" /> elected members, staff and, most of all, the public.</P>
    <P>The Minister made some comments on that in his speech. He wants to ensure the planning system delivers a quality system. We all agree with that, but there is much more to delivering a quality planning system than simply passing legislation. It needs the resources to make it stick and to give us a quality planning system which can implement our ambitions to bring about what we have described or accepted as the notion of sustainable development. Even if, as the Minister said, it has not proved possible yet to decide what sustainable development is, it is a bit like the person who never saw an elephant &ndash; he said I do not know what an elephant is, but I can tell you everything it is not. I do not know what sustainable development is, but we have a fair idea of what it is not.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been shaped in the very restrictive mould of the current management system in local authorities. That system is utterly undemocratic, bureaucratic, opaque and inefficient. Last Monday night's contributor to the RTE Radio 1 series of Thomas Davis lectures on 100 years of local government in Ireland pointed out that Ireland is unique in Europe in having effected no fundamental change in its local government system throughout the 20th century. I have been in this House for nearly 20 years and have listened to talk about local government reform in all that time, and local government today does not look very different from what it was when I was first elected in 1981.</P>
    <P>There has been no fundamental change, no rebalancing of powers and no access of democracy to the system. There have been cosmetic changes. I know I am criticising friends and colleagues on this side of the House when I say that no Government in the past 20 years has really grasped any of the important features of local government reform because no Government throughout the 20th century has ever accepted the fundamental premise that if we are going to reform local government, responsibility for action at local level must be put in the hands of people who are elected at local level to act on behalf of the people. What we have done gradually since 1922 is erode the democratic features of local government.</P>
    <P>The Minister may tell me that the local government Bill which we expect to see sometime this month, I hope, might be a more appropriate context to deal with this, but this is very intimately connected with the planning system. There are members of local authorities whose only real connection with the planning system is that it is the body of elected members who decide on the development plan and on various aspects of that plan. Although if one is an elected local authority member these days, one has to be very sure one has a good case if one wants to go for a variation of a development plan. The media have not distinguished themselves in their understanding of <Col N="1016" /> the reasons it is sometimes necessary to have a variation of a plan. The context and connotations of that have become very negative. That is the only connection elected local authority members have with planning.</P>
    <P>I accept that in the normal course of human relations, people develop systems to allow them, perhaps, to have an influence on planning decisions. However, that is very much <i>sub rosa</i> and it is not the way we should proceed with this business. People will be people, they will do their best for those whom they represent and will expect great things from those who represent them.</P>
    <P>It is utterly bizarre that every five years we go to the trouble of electing people to local authorities and informing them that they will have one opportunity to have an impact in the area of planning, namely, when the development plan is adopted. Given that we have agreed to hold local elections every five years, that will happen once in the lifetime of every council. Thereafter, the only opportunity to change matters will be in the form of a variation of the development plan with all the nonsense that attends any proposal to introduce such a variation. I do not believe that is what we are seeking to achieve in terms of local democracy.</P>
    <P>The Bill adheres strictly, in every particular, to the old, undemocratic model to which I refer. I hope we will be able to find ways to rectify matters on Committee Stage. I cannot see the logic of electing people every five years, to notionally run the affairs of their local authority area, and then manacling or spancelling them and not allowing them to have any real say on how development plans are implemented. A development plan may be prescriptive but it is aspirational and a great deal depends on the way in which it is implemented. The manner of implementation of a development plan is almost more important than its structure because it translates the plan's aspirations into a living reality for the environment of those it affects. It is totally undemocratic to elect people to a system which does not give them any say in terms of the method of implementation.</P>
    <P>We urgently need a fundamental shift in the balance of power between the elected members of local authorities and the managers we employ to implement agreed policies. If I may again stray from the content of the Bill, I invite the Minister to consider that when he is preparing the local government Bill which I understand is to include a proposal for the direct election of chairpersons and mayors. If that fad, with which I do not agree, proceeds, the first thing that will take place will be a ferocious row between the elected chairperson or mayor and the county or city manager. There will be a turf war between them regarding which of them retains responsibility for operating services, making decisions, etc. In many instances, where will be a Mexican stand-off. If such arguments are resolved by the Government intervening and passing legislation to give powers to <Col N="1017" /> directly elected chairpersons or mayors, that would be grossly unfair on the other elected members of authorities. If powers are to be transferred away from the management system, they should be conferred on the entire body of elected members of an authority and not on to any one individual.</P>
    <P>Part V is cutely entitled &ldquo;Housing Supply&rdquo;. The casual reader would think the Government is intent on taking action to make more houses available. As it stands, that part of the Bill is doomed to failure. The Minister informs us that the proposed measures are designed to ensure an adequate supply of affordable housing. However, the provisions cannot do that. If these measures are implemented, the result will be to increase the price of houses on that part of the land not earmarked for &ldquo;affordable housing&rdquo;. I could use a more emotive word than &ldquo;earmarked&rdquo; but I will not do so. That, in turn, will push more prospective house buyers into the category seeking affordable housing and this will increase the pressure of demand for it and push up the price of such housing.</P>
    <P>A fundamental flaw in this part of the Bill is that it does not contain anything which will increase the total supply of land being made available for housing. If that does not happen, house prices will not be reduced. The problem we face at present is that not enough land is being made available to build houses. There are many ways of dealing with that, but this is not one of them. As it stands, this measure will not increase the supply of land for housing. It will not increase the amount of land that will be serviced and it cannot do anything to reduce the price of housing because it does nothing about the overall supply of land.</P>
    <P>Until we take action in this area, house prices will continue to rise. We will be faced with the sad spectacle of members of the Government patting themselves on the back because the rate of increase in house prices is declining. They are getting away with this, to some extent. We have become so punch drunk from seeing house prices rise, we think things are improving if the rate of increase falls from 20% to 15% or 16%. They are not improving, they are getting worse &ndash; albeit a little more slowly than before. Any young couple seeking to buy a house will confirm this. Any attempt to persuade people that things are getting better is futile. The measures in the Bill, because they do nothing to increase the supply of land available for housing, will not help resolve the housing problem.</P>
    <P>There are many other ways to deal with this problem. For example, local authorities could be given adequate resources to acquire additional land to build houses for rental, to be sold at reasonable prices or to make sites available to people to build their houses. That is an option the Minister does not seem to have considered. He <Col N="1018" /> informed us that there are 40,000 households currently in need of local authority housing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. We have proposed that local authorities should be given funding so that they could build 10,000 per annum for rental or for sale. At that rate, if further new people did not come on to the housing list, it would take us four years to deal with the backlog. However, we know that more people come on to the housing list every year. We are also aware that, each year, more people resort to asking local authorities to find housing for them because the rate of increase in house prices is outstripping people's incomes. People who, until a number of years ago, could have reasonably expected to purchase a house, can no longer find houses they can afford and are forced to apply to local authorities for houses for rental, for share purchase or for purchase.</P>
      <P>There are very few parts of the country where local authorities can make sites available to people to build their own houses. That is where the real problem lies and the measures in the Bill will not solve that problem. There may be other ways of dealing with this issue. I agree with the Minister's concern that we should try, as far as is possible, to get away from the kind of social stratification we have seen in housing developments in the past which has been totally divisive and corrosive within the communities which live in what is now called social housing, and between those communities and their neighbours. Like the Minister, I hope that the days of urban sprawl are firmly behind us, even though we still have to deal with the intractable problems which exist. However, I hope we will not add to those problems.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister considered legislating so that local authorities will have the power to require that a proportion of houses built in a given area will be social or affordable housing? That would be an unpopular measure but we will have to implement it if we are serious about getting away from the kind of social stratification which is characteristic of our housing developments. This measure needs to be considered. Has the Minister considered including a provision that made a price comparison part of the operational definition by providing, for example, that 20% of houses in a given development are sold at, let us suppose, 80% of the average price of the whole development? This would create substantial price differences between houses in the same development which might meet the kind of objective we are discussing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Minister considered legislation to deal with the problem which An Bord Pleanála seems to have found with an attempt to impose this kind of condition? There was an application for a development in Dublin city centre in which Dublin Corporation included a planning condition that, I think, 20% of the space was to be made available for social housing. An Bord Pleanála <Col N="1019" /> rejected that condition on the grounds that it could not apply in law because its meaning could not be grasped.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>There was more to it than that, Deputy. It was more the case that there was no provision in law to allow for that condition. The kind of measures referred to by the Deputy will be permissible and we can tease them out a little further on Committee Stage under Part V. I do not disagree with the Deputy's approach to this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that, because my answer to An Bord Pleanála is that it has a legitimate case for its decision but it is up to legislators to make sure that this issue is sufficiently specified so that it can be an operational and binding condition of a planning permission. We need to do so and more. We should adopt these measures, get away from the nonsense of Part V of the Bill and take a more determined approach to design and density as a means of providing comfortable, good quality, healthy, community-friendly housing in ways which compare with solutions achieved in cities all over Europe. Cities and towns do not have to sprawl in the way they do at present. We do not have to replicate the desolate, urban wastelands we see all around us. We can provide social and affordable housing in ways that do not subsequently require the energies of local communities to be directed into countering the ills that are forced on them by bad planning but could liberate those energies for more constructive and life-enhancing purposes.</P>
      <P>I agree with the requirement in the Bill that local authorities should develop a housing strategy but I invite the Minister to reflect on how this is articulated. He is grappling with a fairly difficult problem but has he any guidance to offer local authorities in deciding how they pitch their assessment of the need for social housing in any given area? In the case of a county such as Kildare, one could state that the local authority should look at its housing needs for the next five years as part of its development plan, form an opinion as to what proportion of the land available for housing should be made available for social housing, and act accordingly. However, it is clear that the Minister has in mind the fact that needs will vary from one part of the county to another. Where does one draw the line? Does one draw it at electoral area level, district electoral division level, parish level or townland level? What does one do in the case of towns? There is nothing obvious about the solution set out by the Minister and we need to be more explicit about the objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a danger in the Minister's proposal that arises partly from the lack of definition and partly from the method he has chosen. There will be a clear temptation for people lucky enough to be in the category of those not looking for social or affordable housing. These people will now <Col N="1020" /> look at the areas in which they want to buy a house and many of them, however much we may disagree with them socially, will decide that they do not want to buy a house in a local authority area that is likely to have a fairly high proportion of social housing. Such people will look somewhere else. In practical terms this will mean, for example, that many people will buy a house in County Wicklow or County Kildare rather than in south Dublin. Many people will decide not to buy a house in Fingal but will go to County Meath or County Louth. This is not the Minister's intention as he does not want to put in place a measure which will artificially and unnecessarily add to the pressure of over-spill which surrounding counties are experiencing due to the expansion of Dublin. Neither does he want to add to the problems being experienced in the county area around Cork city or in parts of Counties Limerick and Clare. The Minister needs to think again about how these provisions are put together because they could have effects which he does not want to bring about.</P>
    <P>Complaints about planning delays are common, particularly from the business community. These complaints are justified as local authorities take too long to process applications and An Bord Pleanála takes too long to process appeals. Recent measures strengthening An Bord Pleanála have proved inadequate to deal with the needs. We are getting a bad reputation as a country where industrial and infrastructural projects are subject to substantial delays. From contacts with business people, it seems that the situation is getting worse.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced the Bill's proposals concerning An Bord Pleanála are adequate. I am sure that it is wrong to lay responsibility for delays in the process with individuals and groups who use the rights of third party objection and appeal contained in legislation. Planning decisions affect the environment which we all share and are, therefore, matters of public interest. Even if one is building a house in the middle of the countryside one is affecting someone else's amenity and rights. Planning decisions are always legitimate matters of public interest. Therefore, it is entirely legitimate to allow means of expressing interests other than those of the parties most directly involved in planning decisions. This means that we must maintain the rights of third party objection and appeal. A planning permission is a valuable thing to have and I have no difficulty with the proposition that parties who have an immediate commercial or economic interest in a planning application or decision should pay a fee for participation in the process. People who are affected by that, either in the sense of gaining commercially or economically from it, or of being adversely affected economically or commercially by it, can legitimately be asked to make a contribution by way of a fee because nothing happens without a cost being incurred and processing planning applications and appeals costs money. There is evidence that <Col N="1021" /> interested parties have, in a number of cases, given financial inducements to others, either to make objections or appeals, or to withdraw an objection or an appeal. That appears to be done as part of a tactical plan to achieve a particular result. That practice is to be deplored and we should stamp it out. I see nothing in this Bill to deal with it and we will return to it on Committee Stage because it is a big enough problem to be of substantial concern.</P>
    <P>I reject the proposition inherent in the provisions of this Bill, that groups presenting or representing a community interest in planning matters, an economically unquantifiable interest, should have to pay for that right. The fees provisions will not be a deterrent to objections or to appeals motivated by commercial or economic interests. They would, however, be a serious deterrent to public interest objections or appeals. I am sure the Minister has received the same kinds of observations as I have on this matter. I am sure he was told about a protest meeting to take place next week by groups which feel they are affected in this way. They will be expressing a legitimate point of view.</P>
    <P>I will therefore propose amendments to safeguard the right of public interest objections and appeals. I will do so certain in the knowledge that excessive delays encountered in the system do not arise from these objections or appeals, but from the failure of the system, at local authority level and at the level of An Bord Pleanála, to operate effectively within the time limits set out in statute. That is essentially a problem of resources, and it will not be solved by expedients which would restrict the expression of legitimate public interests. If the local authorities made decisions on planning applications within the time limits laid down and if An Bord Pleanála made decisions on appeals within the time limits laid down, the question of third party rights would not constitute any problem and the involvement of community groups within those time frameworks would not add anything to the time taken to deal with these issues.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows as well as I do that it is entirely possible, and happens all the time, for an application for planning permission to be entirely acceptable to all the people in the neighbouring area but in granting permission a local or planning authority can add in conditions which substantially change the nature of the application, or change aspects of it in ways that would give rise to concern among neighbours. The provisions of this Bill would mean that if those people found the original application to be satisfactory, but found a condition applied by the planning authority in granting its planning permission to be the cause of a problem for them, they would no longer have the right of appeal to An Bord Pleanála. This is not fair to any of the interests involved whether they are economic or commercial and especially not if they are acting in the public interest. That right should be protected and pro<Col N="1022" /> moted and I will propose amendments on Committee Stage to do that.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred in his speech to the business of pre-planning consultation. I am glad he is conscious of the value of pre-planning consultation but I want to be sure of one thing, to which we will return on Committee Stage, which is that any pre-planning consultation will be fully transparent and accessible to the elected members of local authorities and to members of the public who have an interest, on any basis, in the issue being discussed. I do not think the Minister disagrees with me. We should make specific provision in this Bill for pre-planning consultation to be transparent and accessible in that way.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the provisions of Part IX relating to strategic development zones, a concept for which Fine Gael has argued for some time. That does not mean we will not examine these provisions very carefully on Committee Stage, because we are all concerned about ensuring that, in defining a strategic development zone and the kinds of activities that will take place there, we do not reduce the protection for the environment and inadvertently cause a new environmental problem.</P>
    <P>The provisions on environmental impact assessment will also require very careful consideration. This is very largely a restatement and a gathering together of provisions already there. It is very useful that they will be articulated in a more coherent and systematic way. That is valuable in itself. I hope that step alone will help to avoid some of the problems we have seen. There is a tendency on the part of some people to argue that environmental impact statements are an obstacle to what they regard as efficient and expeditious planning. It has been my observation that in most cases where there is an argument about environmental impact assessments, that there has been some deficiency in drawing up the environmental impact assessment in the first place. I have rarely found a case where one could sustain the argument that an objection based on a reference to the EIA has been, in any sense, a frivolous objection. I have seen far too many cases where the environmental impact assessment presented has been deficient.</P>
    <P>Part XIII contains a number of provisions dealing with amenities. If they are properly applied, they could add substantially to the quality of life and the environment, none of which will happen without resources. I advise the Minister and local authorities, if any of them are listening, that those provisions on amenities will be seized upon, quite correctly, by residents' associations and public interest groups, and they will insist that these provisions be implemented. These provisions are attractive and will offer new ways of recognising the value to the community of protecting the environment but we must make sure the local authorities take them seriously and that they have the resources to implement them.</P>
    <P>Part XIV contains provisions which the Minister has not explained. There is a proposal to <Col N="1023" /> transfer certain powers of the Minister relating to the compulsory acquisition of land by local authorities to An Bord Pleanála. It is also proposed to transfer certain functions of the Minister relating to road schemes or proposed road developments to the board. An Bord Pleanála is currently failing dismally to deliver its decisions within the statutory time limits. These are not the circumstances in which to assign extra functions to it. The Minister has not explained why he wants to do this. He did refer to this as a piece of administrative tidying-up. I am not happy with this provision. There were very good reasons for handing over the decision of planning appeals to An Bord Pleanála in 1975 and they are still valid. I am not convinced that those same reasons apply in the case of the powers which the Minister is now proposing to transfer.</P>
    <P>As a general rule, members of local authorities want an interlocutor in these matters, which are the subject of these two proposals, with whom they can debate and discuss an issue. They had that, by and large, in Ministers for the Environment. I am not being gratuitous in saying they have that in the present Minister who is a good communicator. They do not have that in An Bord Pleanála because that is not the way it is structured. An Bord Pleanála is not structured to discuss matters but to decide them within its own circle. It was made that way for a reason.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I wish to mention, in passing because there is not enough time, the Environmental Protection Agency. It is under-staffed, under-funded and under-resourced. If we are serious about sustainable development we must significantly increase the resources of the EPA. The EPA does not have the same breadth of functions, which my colleague Deputy Shatter, who initiated this legislation, intended. We got a watered down version of what we set out to put in place &ndash; even that has not been properly resourced or funded. The people who work in the EPA deserve to be commended for doing as much as they do within such a straitjacket.</P>
    <P>I will have an opportunity to deal with the detailed provisions of the Bill on Committee Stage. I find it utterly bizarre that we are considering this legislation and embarking on the implementation of a national development plan without a national spatial strategy. The Minister told us it will take two years to put this strategy in place. The fact that we will not have this strategy for another two years means that the measures we are proposing to take in this Bill and the national development plan will take place in a vacuum. This will rob them of some of their effects and subsequent development will be prejudiced by the absence of that strategy. I ask the Minister to look again at his relaxed approach to the spatial strategy and to speed it up. It would be a pity to vitiate the operation of improved planning law by not having the proper framework for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Planning and Development Bill is really two Bills in one, it is a planning Bill and a housing Bill. Part V of this Bill which deals with social and affordable housing is really separate legislation which is wrapped in the Planning Bill. It has a separate set of definitions and its own distinct subject matter.</P>
      <P>When the Bill was published last autumn, the Labour Party suggested that Part V should be processed through the Oireachtas as a separate housing Bill. We argued that the urgency of the housing crisis required a speedier passage for the housing provisions than would be possible if it remained part of a much larger Bill which would necessarily have to progress at a slower pace through the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Labour Party in the Seanad presented a Private Members' Bill which demonstrated how this could be done. The Planning Bill, and Part V, as the housing Bill, could have progressed through both Houses in parallel. Had that been done we probably would have completed our consideration of this legislation and the measures which are intended to relieve the housing crisis would now be in place. Taking the planning and housing provisions separately would also have allowed for a more focused debate on both aspects of this legislation. As it is, it is necessary to respond to this two-dimensional Bill by effectively making two speeches, one on housing and one on planning.</P>
      <P>This Bill has received a generally welcome response in the media, for which the Minister's press and public relations staff are to be richly congratulated &ndash; richly is the appropriate adjective because I note that in a reply to a parliamentary question this week the cost of the Minister's press and public relations in 1999 amounted to £571,238 of taxpayers' money. They are well paid but they did a good job. Their success on the publication of the Bill is a case study of how a well-handled PR strategy can dupe a lazy media and misinform the public. This Bill was published on Wednesday, 25 August. The day before its publication the Minister issued a lengthy press release in which he modestly described his Bill as &ldquo;radical and reforming&rdquo; and in which he, understandably, put a favourable Government spin on its contents. Virtually every section of the media, that evening and the next morning, faithfully regurgitated the ministerial propaganda as fact, commented positively and some even editorialised effusively on a Bill which they could not have read because it had not yet been published. The public has a right to know.</P>

      <P>It has a right to expect that those whose job is to inform will at least read legislation before praising it, especially when it concerns a subject fundamental to the future of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will decide what this country will look like as it progresses through the first half of the <Col N="1025" /> new century. The 1963 Act, which up to now has been the principal legislation, gave us the planning laws which allowed for the major urban and suburban developments around our towns and cities and the industrialisation which has occurred in the past four decades and the physical infrastructure which has supported our economic activity. It even gave us the processes, some of which are now under investigation by the Flood tribunal in Dublin Castle.</P>
    <P>The 1963 Act has, for good and ill, made this country what it is today, physically and, to a large extent, socially. The Planning and Development Bill will also determine what the physical appearance and conditions of this State will be in 30 or 40 years' time. The Act was introduced at a time of transition. This Bill is also being introduced at a time of transition. In 1963 this was a poor and economically underdeveloped country taking its first tentative steps towards industrialisation and largescale inward investment. We are now a prosperous, economically successful State set to exploit the new opportunities of the information age. In 1963 this was a predominantly rural country for which urbanisation was a way of the future. We are now an urban society for whom the challenges of managing the environmental, social, economic and transport consequences of 40 years of rapid urban and suburban growth are a priority.</P>
    <P>In 1963 the challenge was to halt the haemorrhage of emigration and address the decline in population. Today the challenge is how to manage immigration as others see in this country the land of opportunity which earlier generations saw in Britain, America and Australia. Expectations are that the population of this country will grow quite rapidly. Forty years ago, we took our green environment for granted and yearned for economic success. We now take our prosperity for granted and worry about the future of our environment and the protection of our heritage.</P>
    <P>The Planning Act, 1963 set the framework for the building of modern Ireland. Its successes and failures are intertwined in the advantages and disadvantages around us, economic prosperity, modernity, plurality and confidence, the inadequacy of our infrastructure, the social problems of poorly planned housing and displaced communities, the traffic congestion and the degradation of the environment. It is for the historians to assess the contribution, good and bad, which the Planning Act, 1963, made to the country we now inherit. It is for us, as legislators contemplating a new planning and development Bill which will overtake the 1963 Act, to learn from the past and to plan for the future. The major lesson to learn from the 1963 Act is that the Bill will shape Ireland well into the new century. It is not enough to see it, as the Minister does, as a question of amending existing planning laws and setting a statutory basis for new planning practices, some of which are already in train, while patching on some new planning terminology concepts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1026" /> A new planning and development Bill should challenge our vision. What kind of Ireland do we want to build? How will this country look in 40 years time? What are the new needs of the people and how do we physically plan for them? Society in Ireland has entered a new phase. The global changes which are influencing the economy, communications and lifestyles are setting new challenges for the way in which we use space and relate to the environment. The Internet, digital television, increased prosperity, more work, cheaper but more pressurised travel, the individualisation and atomisation of society, the decline of neighbourhood and community are all creating an entirely new context for what was traditionally physical planning.</P>
    <P>Traditional physical planning is becoming redundant to the needs of the new Ireland. The traditional engineering and geometric approach to physical planning will have to give way to a more integrated system for harmonising the physical with the social and environmental. Site lights, building lights, road widths, plot ratios and zonings are no longer considerations which have the same relevance to the needs of today and tomorrow. How long must we spend in traffic getting to and from work? Who will care for the children and where? How safe is our neighbourhood? Where are the facilities for recreational and social activity? Can we work from home? If we can, perhaps we could live outside the city.</P>
    <P>There are essentially personal questions but there are also wider issues which affect us all. How much damage can the environment sustain from continued increased development? How do we stop polluting the atmosphere and contributing to climate change? What do we do about the increasing mountain of waste? How do we make sure the water is fit to drink and the air clean to breathe? How do we build a society which is fair and safe? How, with our new found wealth, do we eliminate poverty? How does physical planning contribute to all of this?</P>
    <P>These are the challenges which must be addressed by a new planning and development Bill. Sadly, this Bill falls far short of setting out a blue print for the Ireland of the 21st century. It fails because it has not located planning in its wider social, economic and environmental context. The Bill confines its understanding of planning to the purely physical. There is no effort made to integrate physical planning with wider social, economic and environmental objectives. The Bill is based on the industrial age concept that we live here, work there, play somewhere else and travel by car between them all. The new direction will be to integrate these functions of living, to bring work, living and leisure closer together, to take the hassle and danger from travel and to improve the quality of life.</P>
    <P>Integration is missing from this Bill. The word only appears as an adjective in relation to pollution licences. There is no sense that this Bill envisages the integration of physical planning, building and development with transport. This <Col N="1027" /> Bill is about building houses, factories and shopping centres and transport is still someone else's problem.</P>
    <P>The concept of sustainability, which is capable of embracing the wider context for planning, is, we are told, one of the principles underpinning the Bill. The word &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; peppers every page of the Bill like a &ldquo;God bless you&rdquo; or a Minister's handshake at a funeral. It is never defined or explained, however, and therefore has no meaning.</P>
    <P>What is this Bill intended to do? It is intended to consolidate the nine existing Acts, five European directives and the various planning regulations introduced over the years. That is welcome and will make the legislative package more user-friendly. An updating of the planning laws is welcome as far as mere adjustment of existing planning legislation is capable at all of responding to the needs of the new Ireland, giving legislative backing to new practices such as regional planning guidelines and local area plans. The Bill, however, is merely a tidying up exercise for practices which are already under way.</P>
    <P>The introduction of some new planning concepts, such as strategic development zones, landscape conservation areas, and the licensing of fun fairs and concerts, are positive moves and are welcome, although we should defer final approval until they have been examined closely on Committee Stage. Does the Bill go beyond these limited tasks? Does it anticipate the way in which the country and society is likely to evolve over the next 40 years, during which time it will form the basis of planning law? I am afraid not.</P>
    <P>The best description of the purpose of this Bill is contained in an article by Mr. Ciaran Ryan, head of planning in the CIF, which was published in the October 1999 issue of <i>Construction</i> magazine:</P>
    <P>Fundamental to the review was delivering a more efficient and effective system, which would take account of public participation. The need to ensure that sustainable development would be at the centre of future planning and development was also a significant feature.</P>
    <P>This summary gives us the clear result of the priorities race which led to the presentation of this Bill. The clear winner is the need for faster planning permission, or, as the CIF puts it, &ldquo;a more efficient and effective system&rdquo;. Public participation finishes in a placed position while sustainable development comes in only as an also ran.</P>
    <P>No one would argue with the notion that the planning system should be efficient and effective but the biggest handicap to the effectiveness of the planning system now derives not from legislation but from lack of resources. The Irish Planning Institute and the Royal Town Planning Institute stated that action, timeliness and customer service can only be responded to effectively by a core professional planning com<Col N="1028" /> plement double the present level, at least 750 professionally qualified planners.</P>
    <P>At present there are just over 300 professional planners employed by planning authorities. Some of them are being attracted out of public service by the more lucrative awards of the private sector. They are not being replaced because the output of professional planners from the education system runs at about 30 per year and is not sufficient to meet present needs. Some planning authorities have no professional planners at all. Meanwhile, the volume and complexity of work required of planning departments continues to grow. The number of planning applications has increased exponentially, reflecting the growth in economic and construction activity. The complexity of assessments has been intensified with requirements for environmental impact studies, compliance with regional planning guidelines, various departmental and EU directives and an increased public awareness and concern about the environment.</P>
    <P>This Bill will add to the workload of planning authorities without any provision being made to increase resources. Enforcement is already the Cinderella of the planning process. Many planning authorities are currently ignoring their obligations to enforce planning permissions and their conditions because their staffs are preoccupied with the increasing volume of applications. The Bill places a new obligation on authorities to respond to public information about breaches of the planning code and the Bill reinforces the new responsibilities on planning authorities to police the protection of our architectural heritage.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduces on a statutory basis the concept of pre-planning consultation, a statutory obligation to make local area plans and new pre-draft procedures for the making of development plans. All these new provisions are welcome but they will be unworkable unless the staff and resources of planning authorities are significantly increased.</P>
    <P>The Royal Institute of Architects in Ireland has suggested the lifting of age bars to recruitment and the easing of retirement ages to keep and attract suitable and qualified personnel into the planning service. I suggest the Minister should discuss &ndash; I am pleased to note he is in discussions with University College Dublin &ndash; the possibility of introducing a one year course to educate a core of professional planning staff that could be drawn from professions and occupations where there is already a considerable body of knowledge and experience of the planning system and where personnel could become good, professional planners with a relatively short formal course.</P>
    <P>The issue of limited resources and staff shortages applies not only to the speed but also the quality of planning decisions. By and large, and especially now given the increased volume of applications, decisions on individual planning applications are effectively made by the individual planner who has considerable power. Sometimes decisions can <Col N="1029" /> be inconsistent not only between one authority and another but even between planners within the same authority. There is need for a revised process for the consideration of individual planning applications. On Committee Stage I will table amendments to provide for a new, more open and accountable system for considering such applications.</P>
    <P>Planning is public business and the Minister claims to be improving public participation through this Bill. Unfortunately, he is not doing anything of the kind. This Bill seriously erodes the rights of the public in relation to the planning process. For the first time, the citizen is to be charged a fee for the right to submit an opinion, comment or suggestion to the local council about a planning application. The size of the fee is not mentioned in the Bill but the undenied speculation is that it will be approximately £20. From now on, therefore, every time a person writes to a planning authority he or she will have to enclose £20. This proposal is anti-democratic and unjust. The planning process is a public one, not a private service for sale. The whole planning edifice is based on the concept of public participation from the way in which we make development plans to the requirement on planning applicants to publicly advertise their applications and place site notices for individual applications, all of which is intended to invite public comment and participation. To charge a fee for this is to discourage such participation and the injustice of this fee is that it will discourage and discriminate mainly against those who can ill afford to part with £20. The Labour Party will vigorously oppose the introduction of this fee. I call on the Minister to withdraw this proposal and if he does not I give notice that if the Bill progresses through the House the Labour Party will fight for the deletion of this unjust fee at every opportunity.</P>
    <P>The assault on public rights is not confined to the fee. It is proposed to confine the right to appeal to An Bord Pleanála to the applicant and to those who have paid the £20 fee to the local authority for the right to make a written comment. This takes no account of cases where a potential appellant may have missed the original application or where conditions made by the local planning authority as distinct from the application itself may give rise to the appeal. The right to seek a judicial review is now to be limited and confined to those who are described as having a &ldquo;substantial interest&rdquo; in the development. This presumably means substantial as in property or money. Again, the process is skewed in favour of the better off.</P>
    <P>An aspect of public rights that has received surprisingly little attention up to now relates to the erosion of the role of elected members of local authorities. In the new procedures for the preparation of draft development plans the elected councillors will have the right only to make recommendations to the manager. In the consideration of the draft plan the councillor will no <Col N="1030" /> longer be supplied with copies of the submissions and observations made by the public but only with a summary of these submissions prepared by the manager who will submit them to the council with what is called the manager's response.</P>
    <P>Utterly unreasonable and unworkable time limits are being introduced for the council's consideration of plans. In the development plan, for example, a process that can take up to two years, the elected members of the council, whose function it is to decide the plan and who are directly accountable to the public, are being given only eight weeks to make their decision, an impossible time limit in larger authorities where many complex issues of zoning and land use have to be decided in the context of development plans.</P>
    <P>Other time limits are also being imposed on councillors in other sections of the Bill. Some of these are as little as one week and various penalties can be imposed where these limits are not met. The manager, for example, is being given the right to make the plan without the approval of the council and in certain circumstances the council can be removed from office by the Minister and replaced by a commissioner. These provisions have the most profound implications for local democracy. They reduce elected councils to mere rubber stamps. They are giving a top down planning code at a time when the public demand is for greater involvement. The top down nature of this Bill is underwritten by the various sections that allow the Minister to make directives on planning practices, guidelines, and so on and the requirement that exists in our planning laws, and repeated in this Bill, that planning authorities, including An Bord Pleanála, must have regard to the policy not just of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government but any Minister.</P>
    <P>There is a need for greater scope for public participation in the planning process. This can be achieved at each tier of the hierarchy of plans proposed in the Bill. The Minister appears to be proposing a four tier hierarchy of plans although he has made provision for only three of them. Apart from the development plan with which we are all familiar it is now proposed to have a national spatial strategy, regional guidelines and local area plans. The initiation of a national spatial strategy was announced by the Minister after publication of the Bill but no provision is made for it. The need for such a strategy was first proposed by the Labour Party Leader, Deputy Quinn, who pointed out that the next decade will be critical for infrastructural investment in Ireland and the same theme is reflected in the recent ESRI report on infrastructural investment.</P>
    <P>We need collectively to have a clear idea of how the country is to develop. Is the greater Dublin area to continue to grow, for example? Is the suburban catchment area of Dublin to be redefined by an arc stretching from Dundalk via Mullingar, Portlaoise and around to north Wexford? Are other centres to grow? How do we develop our smaller towns and villages? How is development in rural areas to be managed? What <Col N="1031" /> transport links are to be created? What sea ports and airports are to grow? How do we integrate planning, housing and transport? These are critical questions that should be considered openly and decided democratically. At present they are subjects for research papers by experts and private consideration by civil servants and the Government. The way in which the National Development Plan was decided in private by the Government without recourse to public debate is not how national spatial strategies or development plans should be developed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill needs to put in place a democratic procedure for considering the national spatial strategy. On Committee Stage I will propose a format that will give the House direct responsibility for making the spatial plan and I will propose a procedure for public consultation that will mirror at national level the kind of consultation that currently occurs at local level in relation to development plans.</P>
      <P>We need to clarify the status of regional planning guidelines. There is ambiguity about how they are to be made and their effect. That ambiguity is continued in this Bill. Existing planning law allows for the making of local area action plans. The Bill makes such plans mandatory for towns whose populations exceed 1,500. However, suburban areas are excluded from local area plans. I do not agree with this. I will table amendments in that regard on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>In many respects, the areas most in need of local area plans are those suburbs whose creation resulted from the planning mistakes made under the 1963 Act and which in many cases were built as large, soulless housing developments with little or no consideration for community and neighbourhood facilities. In that context, I will repropose the Private Members' Bill, the provisions of which were put to the House by Deputy Seán Ryan, in relation to the taking in charge of housing estates. I agree with Deputy Dukes that in many parts of the country there are still housing estates which have not been fully completed and have not been taken in charge by the developers.</P>
      <P>Local area planning should also include the integrated area plans for urban renewal and plans for rural development. No procedure appears to be provided in the Bill for the making of local area plans and the involvement of the public in that process. This needs to be addressed. To give real effect to the concept of local area planning, it is necessary to put in place structures of local government which correspond to the local area being planned. I hope when, if ever, the Minister publishes the long promised local government reform Bill this need for deeper and more localised local government structures will be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible in the time available to address every section of the Bill but no doubt <Col N="1032" /> there will be ample opportunity to do so on Committee Stage. There are a number of specific issues with which I would like to deal, one of which is exempted development and development by local and State authorities, to which Part XI will apply. Exempted development includes development carried out on behalf of, or in partnership with, the local authority. This could include a wide range of PPPs, which are likely to increase, or controversial developments such as the provision of waste facilities, dumps, incinerators, etc. Under the Bill, the development of such facilities, even by a private company acting on behalf of, or in partnership with, a local authority, will be considered exempted development and may not have to apply for planning permission. This opens up a whole new scope for exempted development and is something which needs to be addressed. We also need to address whether local or State authorities should have to apply for permission from some authority before proceeding with development.</P>
    <P>The concept of retention is repeated in the Bill. When the initial 1963 Act was passed, there was an arguable case for including a provision which allowed a person to apply for planning permission to retain a development which had already been built without planning permission. It could be argued that planning was new, that some people might be confused and that there was a benign view that as far as planning matters were concerned ignorance of the law was innocence. Almost 40 years later, there is no excuse for someone building first and applying for planning permission later. The time has come to abolish abolitions for planning permission to retain developments which were built without planning permission in the first place, except in very exceptional and limited circumstances. I will table an appropriate amendment in this regard on Committee Stage. The duration of development plans should be retained at five rather than six to coincide with the lifetime of elected councils. The objectives for development plans should include those set out in the First Schedule as mandatory. We will need to examine the provisions on rights of way. The Bill creates a new loophole which may have the effect of abolishing rights of way.</P>
    <P>Section 29 deals with the issue of policy directives. The Minister already made a passing reference to this when he said the state of law now is that directives and regulations cannot contain policy matters. An Bord Pleanála needs to be re-examined. The right of the Minister to appoint civil servants under section 89(4) should be discontinued. It is time to revisit the composition of the committee established to advise the Government on the appointment of the chair. There needs to be specific provision in the Bill in relation to a statement of reasons for decisions by An Bord Pleanála, particularly where the board departs from the inspector's report and specifically where the board departs from an inspector's report in the case of an oral hearing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1033" /> Strategic development zones will need to be critically examined on Committee Stage. In establishing strategic development zones, we need to be careful not to establish a vehicle for bypassing the planning process.</P>
    <P>I am curious about the transfer of some ministerial functions to An Bord Pleanála. As I understand it, the effect of the transfer of these functions will be to end the present practice whereby a public local inquiry has to be held into, for example, the making of a motorway scheme or a major road scheme. An Bord Pleanála, to whom this function will be transferred, will now decide at its own discretion whether to hold an oral hearing. If there is one lesson to be learned from the episode in the Glen of the Downs, it is that what we need in the planning of our major infrastructure is a greater degree of public involvement, consultation and information at an early stage of the process so that we do not end up with the arrival of construction workers as a controversy is blowing up. I fear what is being proposed by the transfer of functions from a politically accountable Minister to an appointed board will further distance decision-making on major infrastructural developments from the public and create more and more cases like the Glen of the Downs.</P>
    <P>The provision for the licensing of public events will need examination on Committee Stage, particularly to distinguish between the licensing of a major commercially sponsored rock concert and the need, if there is one, for the licensing of community fun fairs and events in public parks.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to delays in the planning process. This is something about which we are all concerned. I am, therefore, surprised the Minister did not take the opportunity in this Bill to introduce a more simplified planning application system for small planning applications like domestic extensions and such matters. These currently account for approximately 25% of all planning applications and are subjected to the same planning process as if they were a major housing or industrial development. It ought to be possible to devise a simpler way of dealing with many of those non-contentious developments. This should be considered on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>This is really two Bills in one. The area which probably receives most public attention relates to the housing provisions and I want to spend some time addressing this issue. It is probably too early to write this Government's epitaph. However, whenever it is written, it is likely to be that this is the Government which made owning a home a luxury. When the Government was elected in June 1997, the average price of a new house was £73,523. According to the Department's recent statistics up to the end of September, following two and a half years of this Government, the average price of a new house is £119,313, an increase of 62%. When the Government took office in June 1997, there were 27,427 households on local authority housing waiting lists. The number on council waiting lists at present is 50,715, <Col N="1034" /> almost 40,000 of whom specifically seek local authority housing. When the Government took office, there were approximately 2,500 people homeless. The figure is now double that and includes 1,000 children. The Labour Party's housing commission, which reported in May 1999, estimated that approximately 135,000 families were in need of housing in the State but could not afford to buy a house. This estimate has never been challenged and it may have considerably underestimated the full extent of the housing need.</P>
    <P>Housing is the biggest social and economic problem facing the country. Despite Ireland's economic success, many young couples cannot afford to buy a home of their own. Tenants in private rented accommodation are paying increasingly large rents, but they have little or no legal rights. Housing waiting lists are getting longer and homelessness is at an all time high. The Government's response to the housing crisis has been characterised by denial, delay and deficiency.</P>
    <P>At first, the Government refused to even acknowledge that there was a housing crisis. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, refused to state a year ago that there was a housing crisis. He also pointedly refused at that time to establish a housing commission to examine any aspect of the problem. Ministers insisted that housing was a market problem which could be resolved by increasing supply. In so far as any intervention was contemplated, it was only to rebalance the market as recommended in the Bacon report commissioned by the Government.</P>
    <P>It was only after the publication of the Labour Party's housing commission report in May 1999 that the Government belatedly considered a more interventionist approach. Unfortunately, the measures the Government has taken are much too disjointed and inadequate to make a real impact on the housing crisis.</P>

      <P>If the Bacon report was such a success, why has it not calmed the housing market? Why is it that house prices have increased by 50 percentage points since the first Bacon report was published? When the first report was released at the beginning of 1998, the index for private new house prices at that time was 176. The index in the most recent figures published by the Department is 226. This is an increase of 50 points. Over a period&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the building index?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give all the details. Over a period when inflation increased by only four points, significantly, the cost of building, as reported in the same statistics published by the Department, increased by only ten points. The Bacon initiatives have not worked and neither has the Government's policy which has relied exclusively on increasing housing supply. It is now at a point where it is probably stretching the construction industry. Last year's figures prove that housing output is now approximately 50,000 new houses a year. Housing output has increased but, at the same time, house prices have continued to increase.</P>
      <P>The problem is that the Government has not addressed the critical issue of the profiteering which is occurring in the building industry. For example, the Department's housing statistics show that in 1995 the index for house prices, the index for the cost of building, the consumer price index and average earnings were together. However, a gap of 93 points has opened up between the price of a house and the cost of building it. They were exactly the same in 1995.</P>

      <Col N="1036" /> Part V is the Government's legislative response to the housing crisis.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Like so much else the Government does, the image and the reality are different. We know that among the factors contributing to the housing crisis are the shortage of land for social and public authority housing, especially in larger urban areas, and the price of building land which is contributing enormously to escalating house prices. The Labour Party was the first to suggest that 20% of private residential development land should be reserved for social and public housing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>We called on the Government to introduce legislation to give effect to this and we were pleased that in the Bill as initiated the Minister appeared to have at least accepted the principle of our proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the Bill before the House tells a different story. First, as we pointed out when the Bill was published, the lead in time for the 20% provision is much too long. Assuming the Bill is enacted by Easter &ndash; in common with Deputy Dukes, I am happy to co-operate with the Minister in ensuring the legislation is processed quickly, provided that happens in a way which allows us to fully debate all its sections &ndash; and there is no legal challenge, it will be Easter 2001 before housing strategies are made by local authorities. It will take another six to nine months for development plans to be varied and this will be followed by another year or so for planning applications and agreements to be made between developers and local authorities. This will bring us to the end of 2002, or another three years, before the provision can have any effect. This is much too long given the scale and urgency of the housing crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is much too long. That is why we are not going to do it that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party pointed out that smart landowners will use the intervening time to obtain planning permissions to which the 20% condition will not apply and, therefore, they will be exempt from the Bill's provisions. In fairness, this loophole has been narrowed by amend<Col N="1037" /> ments made in the Seanad which limit the life of such planning permissions to the end of 2002 or two years after the granting of planning permission, whichever is the later. In many cases, this can extend the effective time limit up to the end of 2004. The narrowing of the loophole confirms what we said about the Bill as it stands, that the 20% provision will not kick in for at least three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Labour Party originally proposed the 20% set aside, we intended it as land to be made available for social and public authority housing. However, the Bill extends this to social and affordable housing and defines those eligible for such housing as not only those who are on council housing lists or who qualify for social housing schemes, but also those who cannot afford to take out mortgages to buy homes of their own. I have no difficulty with that <i>per se</i>. However, given the huge numbers on waiting lists applying for social housing and the wide spread of people who cannot afford to buy a home, the question arises as to whether 20% will be enough. The people who will now typically be applicants for affordable housing will be those who traditionally could afford to buy homes of their own, the classic case of the Garda married to the teacher. The problem that arises in the Bill is that the 20% is not a minimum, it is a maximum. Section 80(4)(c) states</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A housing strategy shall provide that as a general policy a specified percentage, not being more than 20 per cent, of the land zoned for residential use, or for a mixture of residential and other uses, shall be reserved under this <Col N="1038" /> Part for the provision of housing for the purposes of either or both <i>subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of paragraph (a).</i></P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Section 81 which deals with the inclusion of housing strategies and development plans reinforces the point that the 20% provision is a maximum. In section 81(1)<i>(c)</i> it is clear that the specific objectives in a development plan relating to social and affordable housing are subject to the 20% limit not being exceeded. In other words, the Bill puts a cap of 20% on the amount of land a local authority can zone for social and affordable housing. Never before has a Government sought to set a ceiling on the amount of land which could be zoned for housing for people who cannot afford to buy. There should be no cap, but at 20% the Bill will ironically make the housing crisis worse for those who have been squeezed out of the housing market while the Minister pretends he is doing something to help them.</P>
    <P>Dr. Tony Fahey of the ESRI has already pointed out that those in need of social or public housing have always accounted for about 25% of housing output. If one adds to that the category whose incomes are too high to qualify for council housing and too low to buy and who will now qualify for affordable housing, it is easy to calculate that a 20% cap is too little. In addition to capping the amount of land which will be available for social and affordable housing, the Minister is introducing what I call a &ldquo;snob&rdquo; clause, section 81(1)<i>(d)</i>, which will permit a local authority, to counteract undue segregation in housing between people of different social backgrounds, to exclude areas entirely from social housing provision. This concept of housing segregation is only ever raised in reference to social housing. We never hear about it when a developer is building a big scheme of expensive upmarket homes or luxury apartments. Why do our planning and housing laws see no social segregation in the rich housing themselves in dated private compounds but the Government considers social segregation has to be legislated for when it comes to social housing and that certain areas should not be considered for such housing?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Sections of the building industry have become exercised about Part V of the Bill. It is speculated that they may challenge its constitutionality in the courts. If so, they should take account of a number of matters. There is no constitutional entitlement to have land zoned for residential development. Zoning is a decision made by public authorities which enormously increases the value of land and creates a windfall <Col N="1039" /> gain for the owner which, in this country, has until now attracted little taxation. The decision by this Government over the last three budgets to reduce capital gains tax from 40% to 20% and to extend that reduction initially to residential land and now to all development land represents a further jackpot for developers and landowners. In addition, the taxpayer through the provision of infrastructure, water, drainage, roads and power, effectively subsidises the development of land.</P>
      <P>Developers and landowners have done well from the increases in house prices. House prices have now stretched to 93 percentage points ahead of the cost of building. The main beneficiaries of this windfall are some of the same builders and developers who are aggrieved over the 20% provision.</P>
      <P>Even if a constitutional challenge is taken to this provision and even if it is successful, which I doubt given the weight the Constitution attaches to the common good, the Government would have to seek to amend the Constitution to enable it acquire sufficient land for housing. People have to be housed. Increasing numbers of people can no longer afford to buy. Land is a key part of the solution. The problem of land shortage is particularly acute in Dublin and other major urban centres. Some argue there is not enough land zoned for housing but that is not the full picture. Part of the problem is that land which is already zoned for housing is in private speculative ownership and is not being released for development. In Dublin, 70% of housing land is owned by about ten developers. They will sit on the land until the price increases even further. Meanwhile they and their friends are demanding that more land should be zoned while tens of thousands of potential home owners cannot afford to buy a home of their own in this city.</P>
      <P>If the provisions of the Bill, providing for the 20% set-aside, are not sufficient to release the land which is required to house those in need of housing certainly in the major urban centres, land will have to be compulsorily purchased by local authorities to build houses. It is not acceptable that a small number of landowners and developers can squat on the largest portion of the residential housing landbank in this and other cities while so many are in need of housing. Young couples cannot afford to buy in this city and are scattered to the far ends of the commuter belt. They have to spend hours travelling to and from work each day and are being ripped apart from the communities and families in which they grew up. The Government will have to do much more than the Bill provides for to address the housing crisis. On Committee Stage I will make proposals aimed at strengthening the provisions of the Bill but I do not want to leave it at that in relation to the provision of housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need a much better provision in relation to social housing. The 35,000 houses promised in the National Development Plan over a period of seven years will not house even those on the cur<Col N="1040" /> rent housing list. We need legislation to protect tenants in private rented accommodation. We are unique in Europe in not having protection for tenants in private rented accommodation. Tenants face increases in rents for which there is no justification and the prospect of eviction. Legislation will have to be introduced to regulate the private rented sector.</P>
    <P>We also need legislation to give protection to home buyers against the shoddy product which is being produced by some house builders. A noticeable feature of the housing crisis while prices are increasing is that people are paying more for a poor quality product. We need legislation to license and regulate the building industry. It is remarkable that to sell vegetables in Moore Street one has to get a licence and a permit while to build a housing scheme or a large block of apartments on Moore Street one does not have to show any qualification. Anybody can set himself up as a builder. There is a need for regulation and licensing so that standards are improved and people do not end up paying increasingly huge prices for poor quality products.</P>
    <P>I am happy the Bill is before the House and I look forward to participating on Committee Stage. It is our purpose, as the Opposition, to address constructively what we see as the defects in the legislation and to attempt to improve and strengthen the Bill as it proceeds through the different Stages. I look forward to that in the weeks ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>There are not many people, irrespective of whether they are involved politically, who do not have an opinion on local government reform. Since 1979, when I was first elected to Kilkenny Corporation, I have heard successive Governments tell the public and the elected representatives at that level that there would be radical reform of local government. Every Government since 1979, however, failed miserably to deliver on that reform. In the Bill the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, puts down the challenge to every one of us to at least debate at length the issues in the Bill and the impact it will have on society in general and on the development of every county. However, until such time as the Bill is matched with an outline of how local government will be financed and how we can strengthen the role of the public representative within that structure, local government will not function the way it should.</P>
      <P>In spite of the increases introduced by the Government under the various sections of the Bill, local government is still not properly funded. There is a huge shortfall. In terms of power and the system of the county manager, local government is not working. In the past it functioned well but we are living in changing times. The public want the people they elect to take positive steps, make real decisions and do the job for which they were elected. That is not happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1041" /> With the county development plans, local authority members can sit around the table and argue about what they want to happen in their cities, towns or counties. They no sooner have a development plan in place when the officials dream up conditions they can attach to planning applications which almost nullify the input of the public representative. At a time when the Government and its predecessors have been trying to retain the population in rural areas and when farming is not going well, many people on the land want to sell sites to keep the farm alive or to keep a family member on the farm. They cannot sell to invest in the land because in my local authority there is a provision that a family member must be the first occupier of the house in question. This defeats the purpose of what the landowner is trying to achieve for his or her land or family. That is disgraceful.</P>
    <P>The staffing levels in local authorities have not changed dramatically. However, the number of applications to local authorities has increased dramatically and as a result I receive complaints almost on a daily basis from applicants who have gone through the process but at the last minute the local authority writes to them seeking further information, not because it wants the further information but simply because it does not have the time or the staff to deal with the applications. We had better take note of that because it is happening in every county.</P>
    <P>There is no longer a pre-planning query process. When I made a pre-planning query to a county bordering on my constituency, I was told it would be three months before the local authority could deal with it. That is a disgrace. It is an indication that the process within local government is breaking down and the individuals who make the applications to try to remain in their localities are suffering. These people do not turn to the county manager. They turn to the people they elected who do not have the power or influence to deal with the volume of queries emanating from the planning section.</P>
    <P>We are asking engineers, who plan extensions to roads and occasionally repair houses in urban areas, to deal with planning applications instead of planners, architects or people who are sensitive to the way areas should be developed. We are failing the system but we are not acknowledging it. If we were to acknowledge it, we would provide sufficient money to allow local government to employ the staff required to deal with the new developments in the planning process, and this is not a reflection on the Minister because he has done a substantial amount for local government.</P>
    <P>When planning permission, either for a large or small project, is granted, there is no mechanism within local authorities to police the attached conditions. If the application is substantial, I do not know how, with insufficient numbers of staff, the local authority can find the time or energy to deal with it. The local authority system is over worked and under staffed. We should be ashamed. We should provide for better planning <Col N="1042" /> even within the current system as it is evident some poor developments have emerged. At a time when so much money is available to local authorities for projects across the spectrum of local government, staff are leaving local government to join the private sector because they can earn more money and develop their careers further with better qualifications. The time has come in the overhaul of local government to ensure these people's salaries compare favourably with those in the private sector. The boot should be on the other foot. The local authorities should be able to attract the young dynamic planners and engineers to assist, through the planning process, in building a better country and to deal with planning applications.</P>
    <P>Increasingly referrals are made to Dúchas about conditions attached to planning applications. A planning application is made and for one reason or another &ndash; maybe it provides cover for those within the planning process &ndash; it is referred to Dúchas. I appreciate Dúchas has a role to play, but I wonder about the number of applications being sent to it. I also wonder about some of the conditions attached to the appointment of archaeologists. An archaeologist must be appointed when a single storey house is being built, even in a remote area miles from a heritage site. I find it absolutely extraordinary. There is no consistency whatsoever. In the five planning areas in Kilkenny &ndash; it is the same in every county &ndash; one will find different opinions from most of those involved. Some will give planning permission on the same site and some will not. That does not serve the planning system well. If we were running our affairs properly, there should be consistency right through the process. As public representatives we should have the authority to look at the role of public representatives. I know the Minister's heart is in this and I am appealing to him to ensure that sooner or later we will be given substantial powers to deal with the affairs of our counties. Until that happens we will not be able to deal with the programme of work that is before us or the social issues that local representatives now have to deal with.</P>
    <P>I compliment those who were elected in the last local elections. They have a huge number of meetings to attend on a daily basis, much more than I have ever seen in my 21 years in local government. I wonder how long they will continue. I notice that local authority meetings are becoming more like cross-examinations of officials because information is not forthcoming. New members have to go on a pilgrimage of extraction to get the information they require, and that is not good enough. Perhaps taking out the experienced members who served for so many years in one block was too much for the system. Perhaps if it had been staggered over a period of time it would have been much better.</P>
    <P>If anybody wanted to raise their popularity ratings in relation to the planning system, they would opt for the total reform of An Bord Pleanála. It comes down to inconsistency. I have seen <Col N="1043" /> reports by An Bord Pleanála where the local authority refused permission. Given that it refused permission, and it went through the system, it is reasonable to believe that it was given 110% scrutiny and that the engineers and others involved who wrote up the conditions did their job well. In referring it to An Bord Pleanála it would be reasonable to presume that the inspector would have drawn up a report and in this case went along with the decision of the local authority. Yet, one person within An Bord Pleanála wrote one single word on the application when everybody else said &ldquo;refuse&rdquo; and wrote pages about it &ndash; one single official wrote the word &ldquo;grant&rdquo;. I find that extraordinary. It is another inconsistency within the system. That was in relation to a major development in one county. In a single house development in another county, I saw almost exactly the same thing happen. It begs the question as to how An Bord Pleanála reaches its final decisions. Where is the consistency? Where is the school of thought in all this? There does not seem to be one.</P>
    <P>The general public becomes frustrated and annoyed and begins to believe in the brown bag. That is not good for local or national politics and the sooner we take that out the better. The only way we can do so is to restore the decision-making process in most of the system to the public representative and make that representative responsible for the action we take in our counties, because every four or five years we stand for election. The other side of the argument is to place the matter in the hands of the management and the bureaucracy, but there is no electoral process involved. Therefore, the way to deal with it is to have decisions taken by responsible public representatives who put themselves before the electorate for approval.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the submissions made on the Bill from the Irish Georgian Society and the National Heritage Council, which should also be listened to. I have seen the ancient walls of Kilkenny torn down. I have seen developers conducting a development and for some strange reason a driverless JCB moves in at night destroying half the city walls. They are allowed to do it and no action is taken against them. I have seen other historical sites destroyed, not just in my county, because of lack of interest or input from the current planning system. That will have to change because people are becoming more conscious of the need to protect our built heritage, including historic ditches and fields, as mentioned in the submissions from the Irish Georgian Society and the National Heritage Council. Perhaps the latter bodies should be part of an extended An Bord Pleanála because they are sensitive to and understand what goes on around them. One does not have to be a qualified person to participate, understand, have feelings for and know what is best for one's locality. Public representatives of long standing who listen to those <Col N="1044" /> around them quickly discover what is best for their locality.</P>
    <P>The move to make 20% of development land available for affordable housing is a step in the right direction. It will not deal, however, with some poor unfortunate people who will still find themselves on the housing lists and who will not be able to access a shared-ownership scheme or a loan. That is because they simply do not have the money and may be living alone. We find more and more of our elderly population living alone in their own homes. Local authorities with which I have worked have not established housing programmes that reach out to those people and ask how they can be helped. As a result, they almost become prisoners in their own homes, locked away and feeling forgotten in this modern world where everybody is becoming IT conscious. Such elderly people are not connected. There is a responsibility on the housing section of every local authority to visit elderly people who are living alone to see how they can be given better accommodation.</P>
    <P>Money was allocated by the Department of the Environment and Local Government to refurbish a scheme in Kilkenny which is mainly made up of elderly people on social welfare. In spite of that happening over nine months ago, the scheme still has not left the starting blocks. Those people are still suffering in inadequate housing at a time when the economy is booming. I urge the Minister to request every local authority for a full update not only of the housing needs within their areas or on what is being done, but also their plans for housing those on the list who have no money and sometimes no hope. I refer in particular to the elderly. There are also young couples who are trapped in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>I have yet to see a full debate at local authority level on this Bill, yet those are the people who are mainly concerned with it. Neither have I seen a debate on housing which is an area in crisis. Such debates have not taken place. We have not analysed our housing list. I can say, almost with certainty, that the Minister does not have before him an appeal from every local authority for certain funding to provide housing for those most in need. We should be proactive in this area and try to ensure that local authorities take on board the need to deal with those who are most in need on our housing lists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the new Minister and Minister of State on their appointments to the Department of Health and Children. I wish them well in their new duties. Members on this side of the House, particularly the Fine Gael Party, will put them under considerable pressure. I thank the Labour Party and Deputy McManus for tabling this motion and giving us an opportunity in their Private Members' time to discuss issues of great importance relating to the health service.</P>
      <P>It is a national scandal that at a time of unprecedented economic prosperity there is a sickness at the heart of our public health service. The Government promised to reduce public hospital waiting lists. However, approximately 38,000 people are awaiting essential in-patient hospital surgery and treatment, an increase of 30% since the Government took office two and a half years ago. The Government has failed to implement any targeted reforms of, or improvement in, our health service within specified time scales during its period in office. Its approach has been marked by fire brigade responses to various crises and piecemeal initiatives. On occasion, parish pump politics have taken precedence over any coherent strategic plans. The scandalous conduct of Deputy Cowen in his final days as Minister for Health and Children sadly illustrates this.</P>
      <P>The National Disease Surveillance Centre was established in Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital in November 1998. The NDSC is being developed as a centre of excellence for the surveillance, prevention and control of infectious diseases. In the 12 month period following its establishment, specialist trained staff to enable it fulfil its functions were head hunted and recruited. As part of the staffing process, in recent weeks the Department of Health and Children approved the recruitment of a microbiologist jointly by the NDSC and James Connolly Memorial Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NDSC was set up on an interim basis, pending the enactment of legislation to give it an independent statutory remit. It was proposed that its staff complement ultimately expand to 20 and that it have a permanent centre sited in Blanchardstown. Its work requires it to maintain close and frequent liaison with other national organisations such as the Royal College of Physicians, the Irish College of General Practitioners, the National Virus Reference Laboratory and with academic libraries and university departments. The NDSC has been requested by the Department of Health and Children to develop guidelines on issues such as anti-microbial resistance and viral haemorrhage disease and has been asked to review infectious disease legislation. The Scientific Advisory Committee, through its subcommittees, has more than 50 professionals who have given their time freely to develop these guidelines. Membership of the scientific advisory sub-committees by the professionals who voluntarily give of their time is dependent on these committees meeting in Dublin. All those head hunted and employed by the NDSC reside in <Col N="1047" /> Dublin and were recruited on the basis that it would be based in Dublin.</P>
    <P>One day prior to the appointment of Deputy Cowen as Minister for Foreign Affairs, the chairman of the board of the National Disease Surveillance Centre received a fax from the Department of Health and Children informing him that a decision had been made by the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, to transfer the centre to Tullamore Hospital. No public announcement was made of the Minister's decision and no explanation has been offered.</P>
    <P>It is clear that while the Government may lamely attempt to justify this action on the basis of its commitment to decentralisation, in the context of the agency concerned and the location to which it is being sent this is nothing more than parish pump politics at its worst. If the Government persists with implementing this proposal, it is likely that most, if not all, of the staff recruited to the NDSC over the past 12 months will seek other positions. A newly established national institution, with a remit of great importance in the context of the future workings of our health service, has been treated by the Government as little more than a parting political gift to his local town by a departing Minister, given to commemorate his time in the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of the Government's failure to put in place and properly promote a comprehensive 'flu vaccination programme this winter and last, patients with 'flu and respiratory viruses who required hospital admission have put our major acute hospitals under intolerable pressures. This year, like last year, patients who already had to wait too long for essential surgery had their already delayed surgery further postponed.</P>
    <P>In the midst of a deep economic recession in 1987, 20% of the beds in our acute hospitals were taken out of service. Despite the extraordinary up-turn in our economy, they have still not been restored. Even more astonishingly, during the lifetime of the present Government the overall number of acute hospital beds has been further reduced. At the beginning of 1997 there were 12,356 acute beds, by February 1999 these had been reduced to 12,292. In 1997 there were 9,030 public acute hospital beds; in December 1999, despite increased demands on our hospitals and the dramatic escalation in the waiting list, the number was reduced to 8,995.</P>
    <P>With our population increasing and people living longer, the proportion of elderly patients will continue to increase. Yet, to date, the Government has failed to put in place the essential additional nursing home and step-down facilities required to provide care for elderly patients who need to recuperate before going home but who do not require acute hospital facilities. Instead, the Minister for Health and Children has financially penalised various hospitals throughout the country for retaining elderly patients in need of <Col N="1048" /> care who live on their own and who lack the strength and well-being to return home.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Government to provide sufficient resources to our health services is directly responsible for escalating hospital waiting lists, insufficient acute hospital beds, closed beds, wards and theatres and a crisis management ethos permeating our public health service. It is also the reason for the inordinate delays that occur in the implementation of long awaited sectoral health strategies, such as the cancer strategy.</P>
    <P>As at 30 September last, there were 1,180 nursing posts vacant in our health service. Some 95% of the vacancies occurred in the Eastern Health Board area and voluntary hospitals, and the majority of these posts still remain vacant. As a consequence of these vacancies, hospitals with responsibility for national specialities, such as cardiac surgery, have been unable to meet targets prescribed in their service plan, operating theatres are either closed or under utilised and the waiting times for patients requiring essential surgery have substantially increased. As a consequence of these vacancies, nursing staff have been forced to work under intolerable pressures. The Government has failed abysmally to anticipate our nursing needs and to put in place policies to encourage and facilitate nurses with specialist qualifications obtaining or remaining in crucial nursing jobs within the Eastern Health Board area.</P>
    <P>Instead of putting patients first, the Minister for Health and Children has targeted patients and implemented policies to penalise the sick. Increases by the Government this month in the cost of private beds in public hospitals have guaranteed that private health insurance payments will increase by 9% again this year. No recognition is given by Government to the fact that the 42% of the population who pay private health insurance are also, through their taxes, entitled to free hospital care. If they relied solely on our public hospital system, our waiting lists would double and the health service would implode under the strain.</P>
    <P>Our health services require radical reform. Whether the necessary reform can be brought about by the introduction of a universal health insurance system is questionable. What is needed is less, not more, bureaucracy. In the area of health insurance, what is required is more, not less, competition. The core problem is not the public-private mix. It is the absence of public health service planning, a gross inability to use resources efficiently, a failure to put in place modern management techniques and information gathering systems and a lack of dynamism.</P>
    <P>Greater resources need to be allocated to primary care, health promotion and health prevention. The acute beds taken out of our public hospitals over a decade ago must be restored to the system. New imaginative initiatives are needed to ensure we have the number of specialist doctors and nurses required to cut our waiting lists in half. We must also reduce waiting times to <Col N="1049" /> ensure no person, either adult or child, need wait in excess of six months for essential in-patient hospital surgery or treatment, or wait in excess of three months for an assessment by a consultant after a GP referral. A new patients' charter which imposes a statutory duty on health boards to provide essential in-patient treatment within specified timeframes should be put in place. There is also a need to target resources for the provision of patient care and to put in place a more cost effective health administrative structure. Capital and current resources must also, on a planned basis, provide the essential nursing home and&mdash;</P>

Incidences of hundreds of patients having surgery dates postponed and prolonged must also end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Flynn, Batt O'Keeffe, Michael Kitt and Keaveney. I wish the Minister every success in his new portfolio and to thank the outgoing Minister, Deputy Cowen, for his courtesy and good work during his time in the Department of Health and Children. I note that any decentralisation to Tullamore or otherwise is described as parish pump politics but if it goes elsewhere there is not a word about it.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his speech last night outlined the very considerable advances which have and continue to be made in the development of our health services under this Government. These advances are being made because of good planning and the substantial increase in capital and revenue resources which are being committed by this Government to the development of acute hospitals and all other care programmes of the health services.</P>
      <P>Strategic initiatives in the acute hospital section in areas such as cardiovascular health, cardiac services, cancer services and waiting lists, to mention but a few, will properly steer our health services to meeting the needs of the population. We heard much last night and tonight about the various aspects of health but there was no mention of any real planning and there was no professional attempt at strategic planning as regards our health problems.</P>
      <P>In referring to our accident and emergency services, the Minister pointed out that a majority of persons presenting at accident and emergency departments who required admission to hospital were aged 65 years and over. I am aware that many of these had to wait, in some cases for considerable periods, before eventually were admitted. However, more casualty consultants are being appointed which will alleviate some of the problems. I share the Minister's concern at the distress and inconvenience which this has caused in recent weeks, not only to elderly patients but to all who presented at accident and emergency departments of acute hospitals. Much of this, as Members will know, was due to the 'flu at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to note that preparations to deal with an anticipated surge in activity at our accident and emergency departments began in March <Col N="1051" /> 1999 with an emphasis on the provision of additional sub-acute places for many of our older people who, having completed the acute phase of their illness, required a level of care more appropriate to their needs.</P>
    <P>This initiative in providing additional sub-acute places to relieve pressure on acute hospital beds does not stand alone. It complements an established programme of developing services for older people which has gained considerable momentum since this Government came into office.</P>
    <P>As Minister with responsibility for the development of services for older people, I would like to outline some of these developments. Excluding the nursing home subvention scheme, the amounts of additional revenue funding provided to services for older people by the previous Government in the years 1995, 1996 and 1997 were £2.1 million, £2.5 million and £3 million, respectively. In 1998, the additional amount provided by this Government was £7 million and in 1999, the figure was £16 million. This figure has risen to £27 million in 2000. When subvention is included, investment of additional revenue funding will total £35 million in 2000.</P>
    <P>While support of older people in the home is an important part of the Government's policy in relation to the care of older people, there will continue to be a need for residential nursing care when it is no longer possible for people to be looked after at home. The 1999 budget allocation for older people included a sum of £1.45 million which included funding for a new 50-bed community nursing unit at St. Clare's in Ballymun. In 1999, the full year costs of contracting an additional 65 nursing home beds was allocated to the Eastern Health Board, which helped to alleviate the pressure on acute hospital beds in the major general hospitals in Dublin.</P>
    <P>More than £7.7 million has been allocated in 2000 for the provision of additional community nursing units, day hospitals, day care centres and specialist services across the eight health board areas, from Carndonagh to Schull in County Cork. In 2000, an additional £7 million is being allocated to health boards to meet, <i>inter alia</i>, increased demand for nursing home subventions and the additional costs arising from increased dependency levels.</P>
    <P>In 1999, more than £3 million was earmarked for the further development of a combination of services which included specialist assessment units which play such an important part in the effective treatment and care of older people, together with improved staffing levels in a number of extended care and day care facilities, with a view to optimising the use of these facilities. More than £1 million has been allocated this year for the future improvement of staffing levels in a number of extended care and day care facilities.</P>
    <P>The benefits of having specialist-led services for older people attached to general hospitals are well documented and additional funding of <Col N="1052" /> £300,000 was allocated in 1999 to allow four additional physicians in medicine of older age to be recruited &ndash; two in Dublin and one each in Cork and Galway. This brought the total number of physicians in medicine of older age to 31.</P>
    <P>In 2000, additional geriatricians with support staff have been approved to supply specialist-led services in acute hospitals while psychiatry of old age services were also boosted, including the provision of £250,000 for the establishment of a unit for the elderly mentally infirm at Merlin Park Regional Hospital in Galway and a further £250,000 for a similar unit in Beaumont Hospital.</P>
    <P>The Government is also very much aware of the enormous contribution of family carers to looking after dependent older people and other people with disabilities in the home. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs took measures to improve assistance to carers through the carer's allowance. On the health side, £1 million was provided to help carers in 1999. This fund was used to provide support through the employment of liaison officers and nurses and the provision of respite breaks. An additional £1 million was also provided in 2000. This funding will be allocated through the health boards based on local needs.</P>
    <P>The important role played by home helps in the care of older people is widely recognised and there is growing demand for home help services to be better organised and developed. Some £2.3 million was provided between 1999 and 2000 to extend the scope of the service to cover more people and to provide more hours for existing clients.</P>
    <P>We are not only talking about the health services, we are putting our money where are mouth is. We are developing services right across the board, whether elderly, general hospital, psychiatric, paediatric, cardiovascular or cancer services. They run across the whole gamut of health care services.  We are expending much more money than the previous Government. In fact, the previous Government cut back in many areas, especially in the waiting list initiative. It is no wonder that some of the waiting lists have increased because we were starting from a poor base.</P>

I also thank the previous Minister, Deputy Cowen, for his contribution to the Department of Health and Children during the past two and a half years. That contribution was unequalled and unmatched by the previous Administration.</P>
      <P>It is incredible that Opposition Members have tabled a motion on the health issue, given their performance in that area when they were in Government.

      <P>The Government's recent record has been excellent. There has been a 4% increase in the number of patients using the health services. Under the acute hospital initiatives, we have introduced a cardiovascular health strategy at a cost of £150 million. In addition, £14 million has been spent on cardiac services since 1998.</P>
      <P>I welcome the national cancer strategy on which the Government has spent £34 million to date and which is extremely important to people living in the west. I am glad the Government has recognised the need for a regional balance in this regard, a fact ignored by previous Administrations. The national cancer strategy has improved the availability of cancer services throughout the country. Unfortunately, the Labour Party does not have any Members from the west. If it had a representative from the constituency of Mayo, its members would understand how difficult it is for a person who is obliged to seek cancer treatment in that part of the country&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn" hpid="Ms Cooper-Flynn Ms Cooper-Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to mention that £2 billion has been earmarked for health care under the national development plan. I should point out that the Government obtained Objective One status for the west, something to which the Labour Party was opposed. A sum of £2 billion has been set aside under the national development plan for essential improvements in health care. These improvements will take the form of upgraded infrastructure, new equipment for acute hospitals, upgraded facilities for intellectually and physically disabled people, upgraded health centres and new information technology.</P>
      <P>In the year 2000, the Government has allocated £38.7 million for people with intellectual disabilities. This investment has been widely welcomed by the various associated groups throughout the country who will benefit from it. The amount to which I refer is four times more than that allocated by the previous Government. In addition, £80 million is to be spent in the next three years in speeding up the process of putting in place the necessary infrastructure to support the new services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1055" /> There has been a great deal of discussion about waiting lists in recent weeks, months and years. Funding for the waiting list initiative in the year 2000 stands at three times more than what was provided by the previous Government in 1997. We are providing £23 million, our predecessors provided £8 million. The previous Administration actually reduced funding for the waiting list initiative between 1996 and 1997 from £12 million to £8 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>

      <P>However, listening to Opposition contributions in recent months, one would hardly believe that this happened. I also welcome the fact that the regional imbalance throughout the country has been addressed by the Government's investment in capital projects in Galway, Limerick, Cork, Tullamore and my hometown, Castlebar, where £25 million has been spent on phase two of Mayo General Hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In 2000 alone, total spending in the health service will breach the £4 billion barrier. It exceeded £3 billion for the first time in 1998 whereas under the previous Government it only reached £2.75 billion in 1997. If Members consider new service developments in the hospital sector they will see that £17 million was provided in 1997. Under the current Administration, the figure for this in 1998 was £44 million and it rose to £71 million in 1999. Obviously there will be a further increase this year.</P>
      <P>In terms of capital spending, a sum of £230 million will be made available this year for spending on health infrastructure. This compares with the £100 million provided on the last occasion the Members opposite were in Government. As Deputy Cooper-Flynn indicated, £2 billion will be provided between 2000 and 2006. This represents a trebling of the capital investment in the health sector.</P>
      <P>As the new Minister, Deputy Martin, and his predecessor, Deputy Cowen, indicated, the health services have an insatiable appetite. Everyone is pleased that health funding, particularly that provided for mental handicap services, has been ringfenced. This is the first occasion on which that has been done. When the Opposition was in Government, funding was not provided or ringfenced in that sector.</P>
      <P>In terms of the delivery of acute services in hospitals, we will be obliged to consider the provision of an effective and efficient service. We will also be obliged to consider funding and ensure that its provision is performance related. Money has been invested in waiting list initiatives over a protracted period. While there are now far more patients and the throughput in hospitals is far higher, the situation requires that we should consider the mean in terms of the procedures performed in the various disciplines. Why, for example, in the first nine months of last year did two consultants in one hospital perform more than 500 public operations? Why did five consultants in another hospital perform 700 such operations? Where lies the mean in those cases? Is there any relationship between the amount of money being provided in respect of the waiting list initiative and the number of procedures performed?</P>
      <P>If funding is to be provided for the waiting list initiative, we should ensure there is a major improvement in terms of the number of procedures carried out in each of the various disciplines. It would be an interesting exercise to discover if there is a correlation between hip replacements and cardiovascular operations because there is a major divergence in terms of performance in various hospitals. This matter must be tackled. I wish my colleague, Deputy Martin, every success in the Health portfolio. He was an excellent Minister for Education and Science and will bring many attributes to the Department of Health and Children where he will do an excellent job. This Fianna Fáil-led Government will continue to deal with people in the most caring way possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Martin and wish him the same success he enjoyed in the Department of Education and Science. I also congratulate the Government on the increased spending allocated for the health service which will exceed £4 billion this year. There has been much activity in the acute hospitals sector which has grown every year and many more people will benefit from these services in 2000. I welcome the fact that day-care services have grown by 12% in the past year, reflecting developments in modern medicine which allow more people to be treated on this basis.</P>
      <P>A major difficulty for hospitals is the disruption caused by the building of more theatres and wards, as is happening at University College Hospital, Galway. The Government is to be congratulated on these construction projects and the 12% increase in staffing levels on the 1997 figures when the last Government was in office. There are about 75,000 posts in the health service, including over 28,000 nursing posts. I am committed to the provision of services in the regions and the Government has attempted to address the regional imbalance by funding major capital developments in Galway, Limerick, Castlebar, Cork and Tullamore. These are important developments for the implementation of the cancer and cardiovascular strategies.</P>
      <P>The Government has delivered the phase one development at University College Hospital, Galway, and the expanded services will be up and running in 2000. The phase two development, costing over £70 million, has been put out to tender. I thank the former Minister, Deputy Cowen, and Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, for these developments which will lead to the provision of cardiac surgery, radiotherapy and MRI facilities in Galway. The provision of orthopaedic services in Castlebar will free up places in Galway as there is a long waiting list for hip replacement operations in the Western Health Board area.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision of £6 million for an extension to Portiuncula hospital, Ballinasloe, which is now completed. The Government also provided funding for the medical records section. I hope the negotiations taking place between the health board and the authorities at Portiuncula will conclude soon as it is important that health services in Ballinasloe are under the aegis of the health board as soon as possible. I pay tribute to the sisters for their work in Portiuncula hospital over the years.</P>
      <P>A sum of £405,000 has been made available for a new health centre in Ballinasloe and a total of £1.6 million will be spent to complete the work. Other outstanding issues are the urgent need for the provision of a welfare home in Ballinasloe, for which a site is now available, and the replacement of St. Brendan's hospital, Loughrea, by a more modern building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Step-down accommodation has been referred to in this debate and the Government has provided £2 million this year for measures which include such accommodation. The Bon Secours <Col N="1058" /> hospital, Tuam, which serves many people, particularly those from north Galway and south Mayo, could relieve overcrowding in Galway if beds were made available. Local doctors in the Tuam area are in favour of such a development and I hope negotiations will take place to ensure that these beds are made available.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's waiting list initiative which will receive three times more funding in 2000 than was made available by the previous Government in 1997. University College Hospital, Galway, has made great progress in reducing waiting lists and waiting times, particularly in the main specialities, and the Government will provide further funding for this initiative in 2000.</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister, Deputy Martin, well in his new portfolio. He did a tremendous job in the Department of Education and Science as accepted by those in all areas of education. The Minister will bring to the health portfolio the energy, enthusiasm and dedication which is his trademark. I also wish the new Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, the best in her new role and wish the former Minister, Deputy Cowen, success in the extremely important role he takes over from Deputy Andrews. Progress towards peace and stability on the island is paramount for all Ulster Deputies.</P>
      <P>Never before has so much money been allocated to the health service as is the case under this Administration. As the Minister reiterated last night, the Government is committed to ensuring that we have a health service which is responsive and effective in meeting the needs of our people. This objective cannot be achieved overnight and it is only through the provision of a range of programmes such as those already initiated and continuing to concentrate on policy development that we can tackle the structural difficulties which exist.</P>
      <P>The Minister cited statistics which prove the increased numbers of people receiving treatment. He also outlined the investment of £150 million in the cardiovascular health strategy; the £14 million investment since 1998 in cardiac services; the £34 million invested in the national cancer strategy; the establishment of the Medical Manpower Forum which has the vital job of reviewing key aspects of medical staffing in public hospitals with obvious implications for the quality of service the public can receive; and the implementation of a co-ordinated waiting list initiative. These developments acknowledge the difficulties that exist and show that action is being taken to address them. I commend the Government on these developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of waiting lists is not new and the recommendations of the review group are being followed in the short, medium and long-term. For those waiting heart and other vital operations, any delay is extremely traumatic. I would prefer if there was no waiting involved, but a strategy is in place and the Government has provided three <Col N="1059" /> times the funding made available by the previous Government in 1997 &ndash; £23 million in 2000 compared with £8 million in 1997.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the national development plan has earmarked £2 billion for health care, a trebling of capital investment in this area. This funding will have an impact on the acute hospital services infrastructure, the disabled, the elderly, the mentally ill and children in need of care and protection. The Minister will continue the development of services in Letterkenny which cut down on the massive amount of travel endured by patients and their families when they are most vulnerable. These people often have to return home because no beds are available in intensive care or in a ward.</P>
    <P>Simple measures could also be looked at to alleviate conditions for rural patients. At present there is a less than satisfactory co-ordination of services for patients from Donegal, for example, in that they are called for early morning appointments necessitating their leaving the county in the middle of the night. A little co-ordination would mean that patients from Dublin could be scheduled for early appointments and rural appointments could be set for a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>The Minister will appreciate the proximity of Derry and Belfast to the people of the north-west and that opportunities exist to work together in partnership for the mutual advantage of medical providers in Ulster. He will also take a keen interest in rural district hospitals, health centres and nursing units, and continue to support their upgrading for the provision of vital services and facilities. Such facilities are located at Carndonagh, Moville and Buncrana in County Donegal. When Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen opened many of the new facilities last year, and I extend an invitation to the new Minister to visit these facilities to see the excellent work being carried out and hear the plans for the future, such as those for a new Alzheimer's unit or whatever.</P>
    <P>The Ministers, Deputies Cowen and Martin, are aware of the needs of those who are intellectually or physically disabled. The Minister gave details of how the £38.7 million this year and £45.7 million next year will be spent in this area. On a parochial matter, I commend the tremendous work being carried out on facilities such as the James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Carndonagh. The hospital has many plans which it hopes to see addressed by the moneys made available through the national development plan and I will discuss these plans with the Minister at a future date.</P>
    <P>I reiterate my best wishes to the Minister and Ministers of State as they implement their policies with the substantial funding at their disposal. I welcome the funding made available. It is good that we have energetic, bright, intelligent people putting policies in place which will lead to a better quality health service. This will not take place overnight but we have made a good start under <Col N="1060" /> the policies introduced by Deputy Cowen and we enter the new millennium in a good state.</P>

      <P>I would like to share my time with Deputies Wall, Shortall, Howlin, O'Sullivan, Ryan, Crawford and Bradford.</P>
      <P>Every day I deal with queries or complaints and sometimes heartbreaking stories from constituents who are waiting in vain for a call from their hospital to tell them that they have reached the top of the waiting list. Some of them are angry, some of them are resigned but all of them are afraid and worried. They are worried that by the time their turn comes, it will be too late, or the pain will be unbearable or their quality of life will be useless. The mission statement of the Department of Health and Children includes, &ldquo;To protect, promote and restore the health and well-being of people by ensuring that health and personal social services are planned, managed and delivered to achieve measurable health and social gain&rdquo;. Judging from the concerns of my constituents, there is no reason to believe that these aspirations are being fulfilled. The planning, management and the delivery of the health services is certainly not available to a very large number of people in a way that achieves measurable health. Those people who are suffering most because of the inadequacy of the current services are, as always, supposed to have no voice &ndash; those who cannot afford to pay. They are placed at the end of a very long queue. Some of them never reach the top of the queue; they die before their turn comes. Last week I tried in vain to acquire an available bed for an elderly man who needs constant care, a man about whom all the professionals, including the public health nurse, social worker and his doctor, agreed should be in hospital but there is no bed available for him. This elderly man is not alone in his suffering. His wife, who is 83, is now his full-time minder. She is frail and frightened and has become a prisoner in her own home because she is afraid to leave her husband unattended even for a few minutes. This is not the health service and support that the elderly deserve. They worked all their lives, they paid their dues and made few demands on the services. Their expectation was that they would be assured of security and protection in their old age. Instead, they live in daily fear. Unless they have a medical card they are afraid to send for or to visit their GP because of the cost involved. They suffer on in silence, in fear and often in pain. They feel neglected and discarded by a society that shows no signs of caring or compassion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The elderly population is on the increase and as people live longer, more services are going to be needed to cater for them in a dignified and <Col N="1061" /> protective fashion but if the current provision and planning is an indicator, there are bleak days and years ahead for this sector of the community. It is predicted that between now and the year 2006, the number of people who will require constant care will increase by 80%. For those unfortunate people whose treatment is not considered urgent, waiting lists seem to be measured in decades now and not in months or years. Perhaps the elderly man who is waiting for a simple cataract operation and who can no longer go out, read the newspaper or watch television is supposed to be delighted to be told he will have to suffer only another nine months blindness and maybe then he will get a place on the list.</P>
    <P>Does &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; refer to the teenager with cerebral palsy who has waited five years for orthodontic treatment and is still waiting? He has not yet received an indication of when he will be seen by a consultant, an absolutely appalling situation for this boy and his family. There is a chronic lack of beds for people who have had strokes, heart attacks, neurological diseases and who are in need of physiotherapy, occupational or speech therapy and who would benefit from such services but these services are not available, only to those who can afford to pay.</P>
    <P>More than 300 people with cystic fibrosis are in need of physiotherapy and outreach nursing on an ongoing basis. This and many other such life threatening illnesses are propped up through voluntary organisations providing a service through their own fund raising activities. When such services are being denied to people in need, and in pain, the Taoiseach tells us that spending hundreds of millions of pounds on a new stadium for the city of Dublin is good for us. This is not the view of the constituent who phoned me last week to tell me that she thought the Taoiseach was behaving like a schoolboy with pocket money to spend, who found a new toy that was not very practical, certainly not needed but nice and colourful so he would spend his money on it anyway &ndash;  a nice, new, unnecessary stadium for Dublin that would take priority over the needs of those on the hospital waiting lists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise with the Minister the situation relating to the support groups for attention deficit hyperactive disorder and attention deficit disorder. The Minister was keenly aware of the problems relating to these conditions when he was Minister for Education and Science and he did work on this area. That is recognised by the relevant support groups. Now I ask that the Minister move the work he did while Minister for Education and Science on to the next phase. When pupils leaves school with these problems, they continue to suffer with this condition. I ask the Minister to put in place a proper support group for these particular conditions, which are currently a problem. I raised this with the Eastern Health Board and there are facilities being made available in Carmichael House for the support <Col N="1062" /> group and also I understand there will be a national forum on this.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that group includes members from the ADH and the ADHD groups and that, as soon as possible, he will put some support in place for them. Up to now, the Mary Farrells and Maeve Dalys of this world are using their own money to ensure that the relevant information available to them is being given to the people with children who suffer from these conditions. They are using their own facilities and money for telephone calls, faxes, etc. I ask the Minister in the short-term to ensure that this does not continue any longer and that after the efforts made to create the office in Carmichael House, the relevant groups can use it. It is recognised that when the Minister was in the Department of Education and Science he supported these groups, and we are now asking that as a matter of priority he would do the same as Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      <P>On the waiting lists in my constituency, major development is ongoing in Naas General Hospital but there is serious overcrowding concerning beds, etc. I tabled a question to the Minister recently on the use of the military hospital in the Curragh to alleviate that problem. The answer I received was that one of the problems concerned security. What could a sick person do to create a security problem? For many years I was trying to have the houses in Orchard Park sold. The Minister has now agreed to sell them. The reason given up to now was a problem relating to security. That is gone now. There is no problem with security in the houses in Orchard Park but now that security risk seems to have moved from those houses to the hospital, which seems now to be a security risk when one puts patients there. I ask the Minister to consult Deputy Michael Smith on this matter. The are not enough beds in Naas hospital. The situation there is unreal but 11 miles down the road there is a fully fitted out hospital which could be used in the short-term and certainly would be of benefit to all the people in Kildare. I have no doubt that if common sense prevails that hospital can be used. The Minister should forget the silly statements about security problems. I never heard anything as stupid as the suggestion of security problems relating to a military hospital with sick people.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to examine the case of the support groups and in the short-term using the Curragh Military Hospital to alleviate the overcrowding in Naas General Hospital.</P>

      <P>Like every other Member I find that complaints or representations about health matters constitute the single biggest issue of concern to my constituents. Not a day goes by when I do not receive half a dozen complaints about health issues. The public finds it incomprehensible that at a time when our economy is booming the health service is in crisis and particularly a public health care system which is approaching Third World standards, and getting worse. The <Col N="1063" /> public wants to know why, at a time when the Government coffers are bursting, so little attention has been given to ensuring a decent health care system for all our citizens. The Minister has probably discovered at this early stage that he has inherited a Department which is a shambles. His predecessor presided over a health care system which is a shambles. Ask any member of the public &ndash; it is the single biggest issue of concern to them. They cannot understand why there are Third World conditions in a First World economy.</P>
      <P>The most obvious area of the health service which needs urgent attention is the acute hospital sector where the waiting lists are growing continuously, and where the Government's earlier commitment on maximum waiting times seems to have been thrown out the window. People are waiting longer for necessary and sometimes urgent procedures. This has been affected by the lack of planning for services for the elderly. Two years ago the Eastern Health Board produced a fine report on planning services for the next ten years. It clearly set out the level of funding required to cater for our ageing population, in terms of nursing home care, community care and other necessary services. In the allocation of this year's budget, the Minister's predecessor ignored that report, as he did last year and only a fraction of the necessary funding was given to the Eastern Health Board. Planning is taking place at health board level but the principle of forward planning was not accepted by the Minister's predecessor &ndash; I hope the present Minister accepts it. Large numbers of acute hospital beds are being taken up by elderly patients who need appropriate care &ndash; nursing home care or step-down facilities. The Minister's predecessor failed to provide that.</P>
      <P>The same applies to services for children &ndash; the waiting lists are a disgrace. Children are being robbed of their childhood because of a lack of services. Many children need tonsillectomies and urgent attention for hearing, speech and chest problems. They are waiting two or three years for important operations and meanwhile their development is delayed because of the Government's inactivity. There is also a problem with children who should be in care &ndash; those who are most at risk and need urgent intervention by social workers to remove them from danger and put them in places of safety. There are 500 children awaiting the intervention of social workers &ndash; neglected children at risk of physical and sexual abuse. The Minister's predecessor presided over that totally unacceptable situation and allowed it to continue. I urge the Minister to take action on that.</P>
      <P>A whole range of community care services should be provided, particularly for the elderly. Home help services are inadequate. Services which are essential for civilised living have been neglected over the years. I urge the Minister to correct the serious mistakes made by his predecessor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the appointment of the Minister, Deputy Martin, to the Department of Health and Children. It is a Department about which I care a great deal, not only because it is, as other Deputies said, a huge concern to every constituent and citizen but because I had the privilege of working there for two years, as you did for several years, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. It is a most important ministry of State. I also welcome the appointment of the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, to the health team. They are both capable people who genuinely promise much in bringing a fresh air of change to a Department which desperately needs it. As any insider knows, morale in that Department has been dreadful in recent years.</P>
      <P>As I said privately to the Minister this morning, I am hugely disappointed he responded to the general expectation for change and a decent health service which we can now afford for every citizen, with a dreadful speech last night. This debate can be a set piece where this side of the House makes arguments followed by political rhetoric from the other or, if this Minister wants, it can be the start of something different where there is a recognition of the huge deficiencies evident to every man, woman and child dependent on our health services. If the acknowledgement of those deficiencies characterised the Minister's response and he mapped out a path to change, we would applaud him.</P>
      <P>We heard appalling rhetoric in the Minister's response last night &ndash; the typical material drafted by civil servants in response to a <i>pro forma</i> speech. Obviously, many script versions were provided for Government backbenchers to recite tonight. It is a dreadful start and I know the Minister is capable of better. I say that still having great expectations of the Minister. He can do better than this drivel &ndash; reciting the litany of success of his predecessor. He gave six examples of success in two and a half years of Government. There is not a single example which was not a follow through from initiatives taken by his predecessors who were not in office for as long. The cardiovascular health strategy was vaunted by many speakers &ndash; this is simply a subset of the national health strategy drafted when I was Minister. The national cancer strategy was initiated by Deputy Michael Noonan when he was Minister. The genesis of these was laid down. I initiated the waiting list initiative which was mentioned by virtually every speaker. Some £20 million was expended on the first waiting list initiative in 1994. We only arrived at that level of expenditure last year. The impact of that was a great deal less than was the impact of the first waiting list initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are major structural deficiencies in the Minister's Department, the administration of health services and particularly in the delivery of acute hospital services. The Minister can do something about it. However, he should approach it as one would approach alcoholism. The first step is to stop denying it  &ndash; recognise it and deal <Col N="1065" /> with it. A great deal can be done because the Minister has a wonderful Department with dedicated and able civil servants, forged in a crucible of crisis. However, he needs to be radical and to afford leadership. He needs to listen to the voices of the people and their representatives here. The Minister has made a poor start. On reflection, he may do better.</P>
    <P>The essence of the proposals put forward by the Labour Party is that they are not grounded in criticism. They are grounded in mapping out an alternative, sustainable way forward in a national health insurance system. This was spelled out by our spokesperson, Deputy McManus. I ask the Minister to listen to the proposals, to be open to them and be willing to change a system which is not delivering the quality service the people deserve.</P>
    <P>With regard to my home town of Wexford and its needs, I ask the Minister to take note. The geriatric facilities provided in Ely hospital when I was Minister were to be met by a development in Wexford General Hospital. A theatre suite, a day ward and a range of facilities, including a third surgeon were promised some years ago. I ask the Minister to provide these.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of gynaecology and obstetrics facilities is a major issue. The institute requires three consultants per hospital. Many of the smaller hospitals, including Wexford, and several others only have two. I ask the Minister to ensure that gynaecology and obstetrics is preserved in every general hospital. I am confident the Minister can do better, that he can make a tremendous mark in this Department. However, he should acknowledge the deficiencies and set about rectifying them. He should not follow in the path of his immediate predecessor.</P>

      <P>Last week my office celebrated because an 84 year old man, who had been waiting for a knee replacement operation for four and a half years, who lived alone in the country and who would have been in an institution if he had to wait a week or two longer, finally got his knee replaced. He is one example &ndash; there have been many others given during this debate &ndash; of what is wrong with our health service. Our waiting lists are growing at a time when there is extra funding. The Minister needs to ask why this is happening in our health service. Instead of listing separate issues, the Minister should examine the way money is spent in the Department of Health and Children. He must examine how it is allocated to see how we can improve the health services in a way which makes a difference for people such as this 84 year old man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While this man was on the waiting list, the Mid-Western Health Board, of which I am a member, adopted a positive plan for the care of the elderly and was involved in the ongoing waiting list initiative. At the same time, however, wards were closing. There was a shortage of funding for a new wing of the hospital. It had been allocated capital funding but <Col N="1066" /> there was no revenue funding to open both wards and theatres. Beds were closing so elective surgery could not take place. The waiting list continued to grow as a result. That illustrates the fundamental problems in the health service, problems which must be tackled in a systematic fashion, which must be analysed. In his speech the Minister indicated increased funding in health, but only 5.3% of GNP is spent on health services, one of the lowest figures in the EU and the OECD countries. It is not good enough.</P>
    <P>Why do we spend such a small amount of available funding on health? Why is it not enough? Increased demands are being placed on the health services. That is an issue that must be faced rather than saying that extra money is being spent so the fault must lie with the health boards or hospitals.</P>
    <P>In my experience as a member of a health board, one of the major cost factors is growing medical inflation in acute hospitals. Sophisticated treatments and drugs cause a natural increase in demand. Instead of turning our backs on that problem, it must be analysed. We must correspondingly fund the health boards and hospitals so they can deal with this because otherwise all the extra money goes to acute hospitals, not to other more cost-effective areas.</P>
    <P>It was stated in a newspaper that the Department of Finance has indicated that providing health and social services for the disabled would cost too much and for that reason the recommendations of the commission on disabilities should not be implemented. I would like the Minister to address that immediately. It is not acceptable in a civilised society.</P>

      <P>Yesterday afternoon I was telephoned at my office by a very angry and concerned constituent. She was ringing from the accident and emergency unit in Beaumont hospital to demand action on behalf of her husband and other sick people who had to wait more than 20 hours for admission to a ward. She informed me that the spouses, partners, children and other relatives of the ill had said they had enough and were threatening to hold a protest to get action. Eventually they decided to march through the hospital to the administrator's office to highlight the problem. This action was deemed necessary in a Dublin hospital yesterday. That is an utter disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agreed to visit the hospital. That was not the first time I had reason to visit a hospital in the greater Dublin area in recent times. When I arrived the scene resembled an episode of &ldquo;Emergency Ward 10&rdquo; in the aftermath of a major disaster. The department was full of people, with doctors and nurses running around. The centre and side aisles were filled with trolleys and chairs occupied by those who were ill and in pain. In the unit itself, people were lucky if there was a chair available for them. The people who had a chair had to sit in pain for 12 hours. Then <Col N="1067" /> they would be lucky if a trolley was available. In most cases they had to wait over 24 hours.</P>
    <P>Relatives and friends comforted their loved ones in the cubicles where they were being treated by doctors and nurses. As I spoke to some of the relatives, a constituent came to me and asked me to see her 87 year old mother. This woman, with her rosary beads in her hand and tears running down her cheek, put her hand on my arm and asked me to get her out of there. That was no solution for this elderly person who had reared her family, who in turn made a major contribution to the economy. I witnessed the doctors, nurses, administrative and general operative staff working in such stressful conditions that I asked myself if these people could be blamed for leaving the public service. Thankfully there are concerned, professional staff who are prepared to continue.</P>
    <P>The financial support necessary to ensure that people have access to proper health care must be put in place. It is up to the Minister to improve on the performance of his predecessor and provide the health care patients deserve. The Labour Party will pursue the Minister to ensure he delivers. Nothing less is acceptable to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Martin and the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, on their appointments. I have no doubt they will bring a fresh impetus to the beleaguered health service. I do not blame the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, for the condition of the service, I lay the blame entirely at the door of the previous Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen. The Minister should ensure that there will be nurses in the hospitals rather than administrators. In the Mater hospital 100 beds are lying idle. That cannot be allowed to continue. Waiting lists in the North Eastern Health Board region have increased by more than any other area in the State over the past two years.</P>
      <P>I was telephoned today on behalf of a 77 year old man who lives on his own. He was told by Monaghan General Hospital that if it had the equipment, the staff could carry out the operation which he requires. The hospital does not have the equipment and now he must join a waiting list. God only knows how long it will be before he receives his operation in Dublin. A person needing a blood pressure monitor was told last week that the earliest one would be available from Monaghan General Hospital would be 24 February. This trend cannot continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Monaghan General Hospital was voted £5 million by the health board with the support of the Department of Health and Children. The Minister's predecessor delivered the £500,000 his predecessor had already promised. That is all the hospital has received in two and a half years. How can I tell someone the Government has no funds when it agreed to the spending of £230 million on a sports stadium? That is all very well if the aged and handicapped are looked after first. I hope the <Col N="1068" /> Minister, who proved he had flair in his last Ministry, which we in Monaghan appreciated, will respond to the problems that exist and of which we will advise him.</P>

The Labour Party motion and some speakers referred to a number of issues as if they were the panacea, in theory, without giving any of the practice behind them, particularly the reference to universal insurance. There was no explanation of how it would work in practice or how much would be diverted from patient care towards bureaucracy and regulation.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to dramatically increasing resources and addressing structural weaknesses, to implementing the programme, cutting waiting lists and ensuring the medical professionals have resources, including the measures the Minister, Deputy Martin, whom I wish well, outlined in his address last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must acknowledge that in these changing times hospitals respond with a routine rapidity and flexibility that we could do with in other areas of the economy. The changes have resulted in 800,000 people being treated in in-patients each year, 700,000 in casualty and two million in <Col N="1069" /> out-patients. The hospitals are responding to changes in demography, litigation, technology and medical advances. The delivery of care is at the centre of our policy. The Government shares the concern of Deputies that public patients can access services when they need them. There is no point in having a major public service unless we can do that. Access to a quality service is our aim and we aim to deliver, but not through the cutbacks we evidenced under the previous Government.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Gilmore, raised the issue last night of St. Columcille's hospital, Loughlinstown. Like him, I am interested in the proposal before the Department for a major upgrading and development of services at the hospital. The new eastern region health authority will soon be taking responsibility for the planning and development of services in this area and across the eastern region. The findings of the chief executive will obviously inform decisions on the hospital. It is only because the Government has made a major increase in funding that we can even consider taking any action on this hospital.</P>
    <P>The issue of children and child abuse was raised, which is close to my heart. Where the tragedy of abuse existed it is an indictment of our society that ignored it, but it is a challenge to which the Government continues to respond positively.</P>
    <P>The Government's actions have ensured, and will ensure, that more people are being treated than ever before. We have an active, progressive and ambitious programme. I look forward to working with the Minister, Deputy Martin, and the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, and to playing a part in delivering that programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy McManus. This is not some kind of political beauty contest. We tabled this motion because we are working on the development of a health policy. We would not have wasted our time had the previous incumbent still been in office. We tabled it because we believed two former teachers, one a Minister for Education and Science, might be open to listen to the basic concept of equality. Both of them taught in schools. What would they think if the principal of a national school gave part of his time to all the pupils but, on a private basis, gave some of his extra time outside the school or in the same classroom to other pupils? What is wrong with our medical system is what is right with our educational system. It does not distinguish between pupils. What we are talking about is equality of access. The Minister's sad speech last night did not mention the word &ldquo;equality&rdquo;. We ran a computer check on it.</P>
      <P>If the Minister and the Minister of State want to engage in comparisons, when the rainbow coalition was formed we had a windfall current account surplus of £50 million in December 1994. Last December the Minister for Finance projected a current account surplus of £4,850 million. Comparisons can be odious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1070" /> This motion in the name of Deputy McManus is about fundamentally transforming our health system. The pictures painted by my colleagues and those in Fine Gael are to try to convey the message, of which the Minister and the Minister of State are aware, that the system is not working. It is not because the Government is not spending money on it or that it does not care. It is not because the beleaguered officials in what the Minister's predecessor referred to as Angola, the Department of Health and Children, do not care. If any group cares, it does because it is dealing with a system in crisis. We are not saying our national insurance based system is a panacea or that we have all the answers. We do not. We will publish a document in a few weeks outlining how it might work and will invite responses to it.</P>
    <P>Research has not shown the country that has the best medical health system. Most countries, however, have better systems than ours, and all of them cost money. We can keep putting money into health systems and still get a bad service, as is the case in the United States. In other countries such as Finland, Denmark or the Netherlands, most of which are combinations of insurance based systems, there is one fundamental value that was absent from the Minister's speech last night, that is equality. You can ask why we did not come up with this before. Dr. Noel Browne provided for equality of access in a mother and child scheme. I am happy to see that Cardinal Daly apologised publicly for the regard in which James Connolly was once held by the church. Perhaps it might extend that sense of forgiveness to Dr. Noel Browne. We must move on from the past.</P>
    <P>The two new Ministers, together with the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, are not responsible for the existing health services but they have responsibility for their development and improvement. What we are doing is providing an alternative model that will work better than the current system. I implore the Deputies, as two young Ministers, one recently appointed, to do better than the nonsense which the Minister read last night and the Minister of State read today. If that is what they are depending on to defend themselves as politicians at a time when we have a first world economy, the highest performing economy in the OECD and the lowest expenditure on health, perhaps Deputy O'Keeffe is right and Fianna Fáil has forgotten the values once held by its founder.</P>

      <P>I thank Members who participated in the debate. The Labour Party tabled this Private Members' motion because we believe that health is a key issue facing policymakers and any Government in power at the moment. Regardless of one's views, it is vital to have a serious in-depth debate about the issues and problems affecting the health system. I, too, share the deep disappointment other Deputies have expressed in relation to the paucity and poverty of thinking from the Government in this regard. In any <Col N="1071" /> socially developed country access to health care is a right, not a privilege, which is exercised on the basis of need, not on the ability to pay. That principle of social solidarity underpins health care systems within the European Union. It is accepted as a norm.</P>
      <P>The first time I heard of the idea of solidarity at the heart of health care was when I attended a European conference. I am sorry Deputy Cooper-Flynn is not present to hear what is meant when we talk about European standards and norms. In 1998 Commissioner Padraig Flynn stated, &ldquo;Our health systems are open to all citizens. We have introduced a range of health insurance schemes which make sure that access to health care is virtually universal. This distinguishes the western European model.&rdquo;  Not here; we do not do things in that way in Ireland. We have an insurance system which is anything but universal. We have a two-tier hospital system that militates against the poor, the vulnerable, the sick and the elderly, a system that is crying out for reform. We in the Labour Party are dedicated to bringing about that reform, despite the limits on our resources.</P>
      <P>In the present economic climate which offers unlimited possibilities for bringing about reform, it is only fair to expect that the Minister for Health and Children would seize the opportunity to make a mark by leaving a legacy which would be something to be remembered, particularly a Minister from the new generation. He is the heir apparent to the leadership of the biggest political party in the State. No wonder our expectations were heightened. Last night I listened with disbelief to the Minister's speech; I could not believe what I was hearing. What was so profoundly dispiriting about his speech was not that he was fully <i>au fait</i> with his brief &ndash; he is new to the job and is entitled to some latitude in that regard &ndash; but that he had nothing new to say. I thought initially it was the worst speech I have heard a Minister for Health make but I then realised it was pretty well the same speech the previous Minister for Health and Children had made in this House. If this is the best and brightest the Fianna Fáil Party can produce, Heaven help the health services. This was not always the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, was correct when he spoke about new Fianna Fáil being a party without values. If Donagh O'Malley had been Minister Martin, children would still be denied access to secondary education on the grounds of parental income. If Erskine Childers had been Minister Martin and taken the attitude he took last night, the poor would still be queueing outside the dispensary door. Those men were reformers; they were different men in different times, times that were hard and when the economic obstacles were enormous. Yet those men were able to break through. Those Ministers introduced reforms that had lasting impact and benefit, not just for the people of this country, but for the economy. The reason this country has <Col N="1072" /> been doing well is that we have an educated people which we did not have in the past. The lack of health services carries a cost. Sick people are not able to work, they need more medicines and people on waiting lists create a cost. Let us not forget that fact.</P>
    <P>When the Minister stood up I did not expect to hear a bright young man with a closed mind parroting what civil servants were telling him to say. He was very happy to defend health insurance and its benefits for some, but he was not willing, indeed he was decrying the idea of health insurance with its benefits for all. Fianna Fáil has changed. He quoted selectively from the OECD report which had other things to say about the health service. It states, &ldquo;The fact that better-off people who are likely to be privately insured did not experience such delays [this refers to the waiting lists] gave rise to concerns about the equity of the system.&rdquo; The OECD is concerned about the inequity in our health system. In an update the OECD pinpoints the dilemma of unresolved equity considerations. This point has been made repeatedly by the OECD and the new, fresh and bright young Minister is silent and has nothing to say on the matter.</P>
    <P>The Government motion is smug and self-congratulatory. It promotes the idea of the extra funding in health care to be remarkable in this economy. What is surreal about the motion is that it talks about the strategy on waiting lists. What have we got as a result of this extra money being channelled into the initiative on waiting lists? There are more people on waiting lists since the Government took up office. Things have got worse despite the extra money. The Minister who lectures GPs about being cost effective should spend 24 hours in the company of a GP and see how hard they work and what they provide for the State. He talks about administration costs for health insurance. The administration costs for the VHI is 6%. The Minister talks about cost effectiveness yet he has provided £20 million in one year, £12 million in another year and £23 million this year for the waiting list initiative. The Government has swelled the ranks of people waiting for procedures to which they are entitled and which they cannot access. If the Minister calls this cost effectiveness, he has a very different definition than I have.</P>
    <P>The sick and elderly in this society deserve better and the Labour Party wants to ensure they receive better as quickly as possible. The real tragedy, which was exposed last night, is that the Government does not recognise there is a crisis. It does not see what is happening in A &amp; E units. I commend Deputy Ryan for putting the point so well because sometimes Ministers tend to get disconnected from the real world. He brought to this House images of what is taking place daily in A &amp; E units, of people who are in pain and distress and who deserve better. These are the people who contributed to building this economy. There will be a cost involved; costs will always be involved in health care.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1073" /> However, this is not just about money, it is about leadership. Last night the message went out loud and clear that leadership will not come from the Government. There is no commitment, direction, thinking or intelligence being put into this problem. I say this to the Minister: if the Government will not do the job, we will, despite our limited resources. We will show leadership when it <Col N="1074" /> comes to providing thought, commitment and dedication. People who are sick are being deprived of the excellent health care to which they are entitled. We will provide leadership if the Minister will not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Pique should not have any part in dictating public policy yet it appears to be nothing more than personal pique on the part of the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, that has led him to refuse to agree to a request for a meeting from the Irish League of Credit Unions to discuss the report of the working group, established to consider the issue of taxation on credit union savings and dividends.</P>
      <P>I accept the issue of taxation of credit union savings is a complex matter on which there are a range of views and in respect of which there is a EU dimension. However, the issue I raise tonight is not about what should be done on taxation of credit union savings but about the right of the Irish League of Credit Unions, as the body representing more than 1.9 million members, citizens of the State, to put their views directly to the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Does anyone seriously believe the Minister would refuse to agree to meet the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, although the credit union movement has three times the number of members of the ICTU? Does anyone believe the Minister would say &lsquo;no' to the GAA, IBEC, the Irish Bankers' Federation or any similar body for more than a year? There are a few who would question the valuable role the Irish credit union movement has played in society. Present in virtually every town, village and parish, credit unions provide a positive vehicle to promote savings and are an important source of credit for those who are generally on low or middle incomes. Some 65% of members are in the D, E and F social groupings, in other words the bottom end of society.</P>
      <P>There are countless families throughout the country who have got money for the badly needed car, fees to send a child to college, home improvements or cash for an occasional holiday. There are many families who got a loan from a credit union who would have been shown the door by the bank or building society.</P>
      <P>The credit union movement depends on the efforts of 16,000 voluntary members. These are often the people who would be involved in the GAA, the local sports club, the trades union or the parish council. They are the very glue which holds society together. We owe a debt of gratitude to them. There is no excuse for a Minister for Finance who slams the door on their representative organisation.</P>
      <P>The origin of the Minister's boorish attitude to the credit union movement appears to lie in the Finance Bill, 1998, where he introduced certain proposals in regard to the taxation of savings which he believed were endorsed by the league but which were strongly resisted by the credit union members and which were subsequently dropped. Whatever the rights and wrongs involved in that episode, it does not provide any justification for the sort of ministerial sulk we have seen for more than a year from the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. It is time he stopped acting like a spoilt child, grew up, lived up to his responsibilities as a Minister and his obligations to the credit union members by acceding to their reasonable request for a meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will be aware that the latest Credit Union Act was brought into force in 1997. The Act consolidated all previous legislation regarding the registration and supervision of credit unions with provisions for the expansion of credit union services in the future. The Act will allow credit unions to provide within a proper regulatory framework, financial services currently provided by the main financial institutions.</P>
      <P>Since I became Minister for Finance in the summer of 1997, the Irish League of Credit Unions has made a number of representations both to me and to my Department. In December 1997, on foot of a request from the ILCU, I met its representatives to discuss the taxation treatment of credit unions. Arising from the league's representations at the meeting in December 1997, in the subsequent Finance Bill, 1998, published on 12 February 1998, I provided for the following measures: the continuation of the corporation tax exemption as requested by the league; the application of DIRT to credit union deposits at the special savings account rate, as requested by the league; and a requirement for credit unions to report members' dividends to Revenue in the same way as interest was reportable up to then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These proposals had substantially met the league's requests. However, these measures proved <Col N="1077" /> unacceptable to the league and to its individual members. Following discussions with the league in February 1998, I agreed to withdraw these proposals, except the corporation tax exemption. Furthermore, I agreed to exempt deposit interest from the existing reporting requirement.</P>
    <P>The present tax treatment of credit unions is therefore as follows: the surplus income or profits of credit unions are exempt from corporation tax; dividends and interest on credit union shares or deposits are liable to tax at the member's or depositor's marginal income tax rate &ndash; at present this rate can be zero, 24% or 46%; and there is no notification by credit unions to Revenue of dividends or interest paid to their members. However, the individual credit union member must report the income to Revenue as has always been the position under income tax law.</P>
    <P>I also agreed in February 1998 to establish a working group to examine the taxation of returns on members' savings. The terms of reference of the working group were to examine the taxation of returns on credit union savings bearing in mind the special and particular nature of the credit union movement, their contribution to society and the wider taxation issues involved.</P>
    <P>The report of the group was presented to me in October 1998. Early last year I made the report publicly available. The group, which comprised officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance, representatives of the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Registrar of Friendly Societies and an independent chairman, failed to agree on a set of findings. However, the chairman recommended that a certain amount of tax free savings for credit union members be allowed. The chairman's proposals were as follows: the first £375 of credit union members dividend income to be exempt from tax; any excess of dividends more than £375 up to £750 to be subject to 20% tax; where dividends are more than £750 the entire dividend to be taxed at 20%; all interest on deposits to be taxed at the 20% DIRT rate; and no reporting of dividends or interest by credit unions to Revenue.</P>
    <P>My Department and Revenue did not agree with this recommendation. The Department made it clear that a convincing case did not exist for exemption of savings returns from income tax and the role of the credit unions was amply recognised by their exemption from corporation tax.</P>
    <P>I am currently considering this report. As some commentators have mentioned also, given all that we have seen and heard on DIRT and tax evasion, it does not seem prudent to contemplate a new form of accounts on which the interest is neither liable to tax nor reported to Revenue. We had problems with tax exempt multiple accounts in the past and it does not seem wise to invite such problems again. In saying this, I accept entirely the bona fides of the credit union movement, which has made it clear that this is not something which it would wish to encourage or with which it would wish to be associated. My <Col N="1078" /> Department also pointed out to the working group that there were EU rules on the granting of particular tax treatment to certain bodies and that these rules also applied to credit unions.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware from media reports and also from replies that I have given to a written parliamentary question that the tax treatment of credit unions in Ireland is now being closely studied by the Competition Directorate of the European Commission. I understand the matter was referred to the Commission by organisations which are competitors of the credit unions and that the complaint alleges that the credit union movement has benefited from preferential tax treatment by virtue of its exemption from corporation tax and its exemption from DIRT. The complaint asserts that this treatment of credit unions in Irish taxation law is contrary to EU law. I understand the EU Commission is in the course of investigating this complaint. My Department has not been asked, thus far, by the Commission to provide observations on the subject matter of the complaint.</P>
    <P>If the existing taxation regime respecting credit unions and their depositors has triggered a complaint to the Commission, obviously any legislative initiative at this stage has the potential to aggravate the situation. This would not be of any service to the credit unions.</P>
    <P>I am also conscious of the external environment within which we must frame overall taxation arrangements. Deputies will have seen that in recent years the European Commission, using the legal basis given to it in the various treaties, has taken an increasingly interventionist line in taxation matters in member states. Ireland has had its fair share of cases before the Commission and the Commission has, in some instances, deemed that certain taxation arrangements in this jurisdiction amounted to unacceptable State aid. Whatever the credit union movement may think or say, we must comply with EU rules on this matter. There is nothing to be gained by ignoring this reality. Against this background, I consider that a meeting between the Irish League of Credit Unions and me at this stage would serve no real purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not give me any great pleasure to come in here to raise this issue which should not need to be raised in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I have great respect for my colleague from Mayo, the Minister for State, Deputy Moffatt, who is present, but am sorry the rising star from Cork, the Minister for good news and good photographs, is not present. If this involved good news and a good photograph, I am sure Deputy Martin would be here. Last night I listened to him from my office and my blood boiled when I heard him tell the House about the wonderful health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will tell the House about the health service in the Western Health Board area. A constituent of <Col N="1079" /> mine, mentally prepared for an operation which would cure him, came to the hospital on 4 October 1998, and was sent home. He returned to the hospital on 17 January 1999, and was sent home again. On 13 June 1999, he was sent home again. He received a letter from the health board which stated that his operation would take place on 27 June, but he was sent home again. On 27 July he was called again and told his operation would take place but he was sent home again. On 2 October 1999, I rang the health board and was told that the operation would definitely take place. I even received a letter, signed by a well paid official from the health board, telling me that the man would not be sent home again and wishing him well on his recovery from his operation. This is the year 2000, and I have received a further appointment for him on 19 February.</P>
    <P>We listened to the debate on the health service. We heard the Minister telling us about the wonderful health service. We have a great service if one has money. In that case, one will be called to any hospital for whatever operation is required, but that is not the case for medical card holders. This case concerns an elderly person who worked all his life and served the State well. The person is depending on an operation and when he is called for it he should be able to obtain it instead of getting bad news. Yesterday an answer to a parliamentary question stated that 10,021 bed nights were lost per month. The figure for Castlebar was 25 bednights and in Merlin Park it was 48. Many more people could be operated on if the service was being properly run by the Minister for Health and Children. If people within the service were doing the jobs they are paid to do I would not have this upset and distressed man at my constituency clinic, waiting for an operation yet having to return home without having had one on six different occasions. I do not want the Minister of State to say that it was on only three different occasions, because the figure of six has been confirmed by the person's doctor who was outraged. The same official who said it was three times wished the man well for a speedy recovery from his operation. It is time the Minister took on these health board officials and if they cannot do the job there are many others who will.</P>
    <P>I do not want this man back in my office on 19 February saying that he was sent home again. I want him to have his surgery instead of being mentally prepared for an operation and travelling from Castlebar to Galway, but having to return home that night without having been operated upon. The operation had better be done because if not, I will be up on my feet every single morning on the Order of Business to highlight the matter to the Minister for Health and Children and the Taoiseach. If this is the kind of service we have, God help the poor and weak who are on medical cards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ring for raising this matter on the Adjournment. The provision of hospital services in the Western Health Board area is a matter for that health board in the first instance. I have, however, made inquiries of the chief executive officer of the board about this case. I understand from the Western Health Board that the person in question is scheduled for admission, as has been said, on 19 February 2000. I further understand that the person was scheduled for admission on a number of previous occasions, five or six in total as the Deputy has said, and that the admissions were cancelled as a result of emergency admissions and bed availability problems. The board has expressed regret for the inconvenience and distress caused to this person as a result of the cancellations and has undertaken that every effort will be made to ensure that treatment will be provided on 19 February.</P>
      <P>As regards the pressures that may be experienced at University College Hospital, Galway, as a result of emergency admissions, I assure the Deputy of the Government's commitment to developing services and infrastructure at the hospital. As the Deputy will be aware, the Government is at present investing unprecedented resources in the transformation of acute hospital services in the west. The phase one development of UCHG, which expands the theatre and bed capacity of the hospital through the provision of four additional theatres and 50 additional beds, is now being commissioned. In addition, a further phase of development, at a projected cost of £70 million, is out to tender.</P>
      <P>Taken with the major capital development under construction at Mayo General Hospital, the works being planned for Roscommon County Hospital and the works under completion at Portiuncula Hospital, this will result in a major enhancement of the quality and range of acute hospital services available to patients in the west.</P>
      <P>On the broader issue that this case raises in relation to the scheduling of elective admissions, the Deputy will appreciate that the level of elective activity in the acute hospital system is planned by local management over a 12 month period having regard to anticipated levels of emergency admissions and the overall resources available. This forms a central part of the service planning process which is required of health boards under the Health (Amendment) Act, 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unpredictable nature of activity generated by emergency admissions means that cancellations of elective procedures are inevitable from time to time as the system tries to cope with unexpected peaks. As part of the service planning process, it is a matter for agencies to attempt to take account of these peaks and troughs when planning their elective activity levels over a 12 month period. It is important that cancellations of elective procedures are viewed in the context of overall levels of activity delivered in the acute hospital <Col N="1081" /> sector against agreed service plans for the 12 month period. In this context, it should be noted that the total number of discharges, both in-patient and day-patient, for all hospitals in the Western Health Board for the first nine months of 1999 was 54,164, which compares with a figure of 48,787 for the same period in 1998. In other words, the development of services in the region in 1999 meant that treatment was delivered to 11% or almost 6,000 more patients in that period.</P>
    <P>I appreciate fully that these statistics are cold comfort to individuals who have had unsatisfactory personal experiences at the hands of the hospital system, as the person in the case raised by the Deputy has clearly had. It is important to outline them, however, to provide an overall context. I hope the Deputy will appreciate the major efforts, which I have outlined, being made by the Government to improve acute hospital services in the west.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to report on the revised arrangement that has been made for the scheduling of treatment to the person in this case. I hope the operation goes ahead on 19 February.</P>

      <P>The legally unprotected nature of the Glen of the Downs has shown up many deficiencies, not only in legislation relating to the preservation of the environment, but also in the Government's thinking on environmental issues, sustainability, and biodiversity. The concerns expressed in the courts on this issue still have to be taken on board by Wicklow County Council. A presentation by an expert hydrogeologist to several Dáil Deputies and local councillors on 14 January was accompanied by a proposed work programme aimed at resolving &ldquo;apparent flaws and uncertainties in the proposed road design&rdquo;. This works document was deemed, by none other than Fianna Fáil Deputy, Dick Roche, as &ldquo;a clear and lucid one, worthy of detailed examination&rdquo;. I thank Deputy Roche for a great deal of what I am saying in this debate. He said it also contained proposals which &ldquo;seem to be modest, low cost, and capable of implementation without causing any further undue delays&rdquo;. Those are the words of the Minister of State's party colleague, Deputy Roche.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a written reply to me yesterday, the Minister stated that &ldquo;the High Court was satisfied that the issues relating to hydrology were properly addressed in the environmental impact assessment&rdquo;. That, however, was hydrology, the study of the movement of water on the surface, not hydrogeology which is the study of the movement of water underground through soils and rocks. Hydrogeology still has not been properly addressed, which is the reason I have sought this <Col N="1082" /> debate on the Adjournment. These environmental issues have not been resolved. Instead we have seen a midnight raid on the Glen of the Downs by more than 100 gardaí to counter a handful of protesters, and felling of trees with no clear boundaries set as to where the felling can begin and end. We have seen dangerous felling of trees with recognised safety guidelines, which require a clearing zone of at least twice the height of the trees, being flouted. One of the trees that was felled landed within three feet of a bystander. In addition, there was no hoist to assist in the safe removal of tree occupants.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that trees outside the area owned by Wicklow County Council in the Glen of the Downs, on Dúchas lands, have been felled in the past week? There are reliable eye witness accounts that chainsaws were taken to trees while people were still in them. Despite these destructive actions and the felling of the glen in part, there is still time to stop further environmental damage. I encourage the Minister to step in now to ensure that this damage is halted.</P>
    <P>At the end of the hydrogeologist's presentation, as reported by Deputy Roche, four recommendations were strongly made to Wicklow County Council. A systematic examination of the water table issues is needed, but this has not been carried out. He suggested the adoption of a low cost and rapid approach. The impact of its design for sub-surface drainage could be re-examined. An alternative approach could be considered to the proposals for a raised embankment at the northern end of the glen. The council could, for example, consider an alternative design for this section, perhaps a road constructed on an enraised structure which would not interfere with the groundwater. The fourth suggestion was to carry out further investigation of the impact of the proposed &ldquo;soil nailing&rdquo;, as it is called, on the west side of the glen and the geological composition of the slopes where this work is to be carried out.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to respond to these observations and to use her influence with Wicklow County Council to ensure the new owners of the nature reserve resolve these deficiencies noted by the hydrogeologist. Specifically, given the concerns that were expressed by expert witnesses in the High Court in March 1999, and that in the Minister's written reply to me on 1 February, she stated that Wicklow County Council &ldquo;would take account of all concerns raised&rdquo;, will the Minister provide the House with details of any submissions by Wicklow County Council to her Department that describe the results of scientific studies or site investigation works carried out since March last year to assess the concerns raised in the High Court, or any modifications or revisions to the proposed road design that take into account the concerns raised?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1083" /> I am grateful that, in the Minister's written reply to my question on 1 February, she assured the House her Department &ldquo;will continue to monitor the scheme during the construction phase and will liaise with Wicklow County Council to ensure construction impacts are minimised&rdquo;. Given this response, will she also give an assurance that her Department will seek advice and assistance in specialist groundwater matters in order to adequately assess and monitor the proposed construction and, hence, ensure that the long-term damage to the glen will be minimised?</P>

      <P>The existing route of the N11 between Kilmacanogue and the Glen of the Downs runs through the Glen of the Downs nature reserve. In 1990 it was proposed to widen this section of the road to accommodate a dual carriageway. The purpose of upgrading the road to a dual carriageway was to address safety concerns and to meet the needs not only of the local community but also of the private and commercial traffic between Dublin and Rosslare. The N11 forms part of Euroroute One and is an important part of the Government's strategy to address the problems associated with our geographical peripherality in relation to the rest of the European Union. Wicklow County Council reports that an average of 25,000 vehicles per day used the road in recent years and that this section of the N11 has a tragic history of over 100 accidents, resulting in the deaths of five people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Dúchas, the Heritage Service &ndash; the then National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works &ndash; was concerned at the potential impact of the proposed dual carriageway on the Glen of the Downs nature reserve. It informed the Department of the Environment and Local Government of its concerns as far back as 1991 and objected to the road scheme originally proposed by Wicklow County Council on the grounds that it did not take sufficient account of the conservation value of this important natural heritage site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary concerns related to the area of land required for the road, the number of trees <Col N="1084" /> to be felled and the impacts on the stream and the wet woodland on the eastern side of the nature reserve. The county council made several major adjustments to the road scheme. Initially, it proposed to realign the road to the west. National Parks and Wildlife officials objected to that particular alignment as it involved a significant incursion into the woodland on the western side of the glen. The county council then proposed a more central alignment. Following further consultation, the council agreed to reduce the width of the proposed road by several metres. This was effected by reducing the width of the median and hard shoulders.</P>
    <P>The consultation between National Parks and Wildlife officials and county council officials was substantial and detailed. Agreement on the road scheme was only reached after approximately four years of deliberation. The consultation served to fulfil the formal requirements of section 12 of the Wildlife Act, 1976. A full environmental impact assessment was carried out in accordance with regulations. The assessment was certified by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. Wicklow County Council also carried out extensive formal and informal public consultation in relation to the scheme.</P>
    <P>I am aware that submissions on hydrogeology were given in evidence to the High Court during a judicial review action concerning the proposed road widening scheme through the Glen of the Downs which was heard in 1999. Wicklow County Council assured the court that its road design scheme would take account of all concerns raised. The High Court was satisfied that the issues relating to hydrology were properly addressed in the environmental impact assessment. A permeable layer will be included in the road construction to ensure that groundwater flow is not impeded by the road. The High Court and Supreme Court have held that a valid environmental impact assessment has been carried out for the proposed road scheme. Dúchas will continue to monitor the scheme during the construction phase and will liaise with Wicklow County Council to ensure construction impacts on the glen are minimised.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that every effort has been made to mitigate the negative effects of the road scheme on the glen. In addition, substantial compensation measures are being undertaken. These compensation measures include the planting of 6,000 native oak seedlings in and around the current nature reserve. Some 0.85 hectares of land will be added to the nature reserve in return for the 0.68 hectares removed.</P>
    <P>In all, the impact of the road scheme on the glen is minimal. Some 87% of the improved road through the glen will be built over existing or former road surfaces. It is wild exaggeration to describe the scheme as leading to the destruction of the glen. It should be remembered that the wood has been bisected by a public road for cen<Col N="1085" /> turies. What we are seeing now is the widening of that road by a small degree. I suggest that those who are concerned about the road scheme will be very surprised when they see how small an area of the woodland is affected by the scheme. I remind the House that the road improvement scheme is being carried out in an effort to improve the safety of traffic flow on a road where five people have lost their lives and many other accidents have occurred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me raise this matter and the Minister, Deputy Woods, for being here to personally respond to the debate. I wish him well in his new portfolio, where I have no doubt that he will bring his considerable ministerial experience to bear. I hope he will be in a position to sanction the request for a new school for St. Colman's in Macroom.</P>
      <P>The current inadequate level of accommodation in this school is giving rise to considerable local concern for the board of management, the teaching staff, the principal and the parents' association. Fourth class in St. Colman's boys' national school, Macroom, is currently accommodated off the main campus, across the national primary road. That class of 30 pupils crosses that national primary road at least six times a day. That situation is totally unsatisfactory. The school is on a quite dangerous bend in the road going through the town, which poses serious difficulties for the safety of the pupils. The Department is paying for the additional rented accommodation which is costing £650 per month, 95% of which, I believe, is paid by the Department. Therefore, there is also a cost factor in the delay.</P>
      <P>St. Colman's boys' national school has a teaching principal and four class teachers. It has a resource teacher, a shared remedial teacher and another resource teacher dealing specifically with traveller children, who is shared with the convent national school in Macroom. An unusual, but not unique, situation exists in primary education in Macroom in that boys are accommodated for junior and senior infants and first class in the convent national school while St. Colman's accommodates second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to give an indication of enrolment figures, current and anticipated. In September 1999, 36 boys enrolled at the convent primary school. These pupils will move on to St. Colman's in due course. In September 1996, there were 96 pupils in St. Colman's boys national school. In September 1999, there were 134 pupils in the school and there are now 136. Fortunately, as in other areas, there is a building explosion in the town. In the urban council area in Macroom, 300 houses are under construction. A substantial part of the parish is outside the immediate urban boundary where there are probably as many <Col N="1086" /> houses again under construction. The enrolment figures are set to explode.</P>
    <P>What we need from the Department is immediate sanction to take account of this. It requires nothing less than a new school. We also have to consider the overall needs of primary education in the town given that at present boys in junior and senior infants and in first class are accommodated in the convent. What will be the long-term demands of primary education in the town? Will that situation continue or will all the boys be on one campus? Is the campus in the convent national school adequate to provide for enrolments as presently structured? Planning for the eventualities is something for which we look to the Department.</P>
    <P>I have been in contact with the teaching staff, in particular the principal, the board of management and the parents' association. There is unanimity that the position is totally inadequate. We are looking to the Department for the green light. Immediate sanction for a new school would probably only give us that accommodation in September next year. I appeal to the Minister to involve himself in this matter and to bring a long running saga to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>

      <P>The school management has applied to my Department for additional classroom and ancillary accommodation. A member of my Department's technical staff carried out an architectural assessment of the school building. Following this assessment, the board of management engaged the services of a full design team on the recommendation of the primary building unit of my Department. Sketch schemes prepared by the school's design team are currently being assessed in my Department.</P>
      <P>On completion of a full assessment of the school's requirements, my Department will be in a position to progress the matter as quickly as possible. I appreciate fully the concerns of the school authorities in this matter and I assure the House that it is the intention of my Department to provide adequate accommodation for the present and future needs of the school, which have been clearly set out by Deputy Creed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there is a very large number of school building projects on hand in my Department. Due to the priority which the <Col N="1087" /> Government has given to reversing the lack of investment in our primary schools in the past, the spending Estimates published show primary school building and renovation funding increasing by an unprecedented 186% from the 1997 budget allocation. In addition, we have reduced significantly the burden of fund-raising faced by schools and communities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1088" /> I assure the Deputy that the application by St. Colman's boys' national school will be dealt with as speedily as possible. He will appreciate that at this early stage, it is not possible to say the extent of the accommodation to be provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 to 39, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The results of the Information Society Commission's business community survey were published in December last. Overall, the results suggest that Irish businesses are making strong moves to embrace information and communication technology and are more engaged in e-business. While businesses now have a very positive attitude to e-commerce, actual levels are still relatively low. It is also apparent that small and medium enterprises, in particular, need to do <Col N="1094" /> more to keep up with technological changes in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>The main findings of the survey are that the vast majority of Irish businesses are now familiar with the terms and services relating to new technology; one third of Irish businesses have more than 75% of their employees using computers; internet access in the business community compares competitively with the UK, Germany, France, Italy, the USA, Canada and Japan; use of websites for on-line sales by Irish businesses is still relatively low; Irish businesses are more enthusiastic about the information society than their international counterparts; businesses are concerned about IT skills shortages but need to do more to provide training for their staff; and small and medium enterprises are more at risk of being left behind in the e-economy.</P>
    <P>Some of these findings have been confirmed by other studies carried out recently, including one by Andersen Consulting, entitled E-Ireland Takes Off.</P>
    <P>The findings relating to SMEs are a cause for concern. A range of awareness measures have been put in place, including a national awareness campaign for SMEs run by the commission with IBEC, which involves a series of seminars around the country with the objective of demonstrating the importance of e-commerce to SMEs. Enterprise Ireland has also enhanced the services it offers to SMEs in the e-commerce and information society area.</P>
    <P>As regards the provision of e-mail addresses for every citizen, the Deputy's question gives the impression that a decision to this effect has already been made. This is not the case. The Information Society Commission was asked to assess the possibility and merit of providing an e-mail address and internet access to every citizen.</P>
    <P>The commission established a sub-group to look into this matter. The work of that group led to publication of a discussion paper last November, the contents of which I have already outlined to the House. The paper set out a range of options regarding the possible provision of e-mail addresses for citizens. The commission is currently examining the many responses to its discussion paper with a view to preparing recommendations to Government on the question of IT access generally, including possible provision of e-mail for all.</P>
    <P>Turning to the fast-track to information technology initiative, the Information Society Commission has no direct involvement in this scheme, though it did welcome it in its most recent annual report, saying that it provides a model which can be applied to other sectors and other regions.</P>
    <P>The initiative aims to provide training and employment in the IT industry for 3,500 people in the Dublin area over three years. The scheme, aimed primarily at long-term unemployed, is being driven by the IT industry itself, who are assisting in a number of ways including the development of training curricula, providing internships, contributing to operating costs and, <Col N="1095" /> ultimately, providing jobs and career development paths for the trainees.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the House on 7 December, the National Centre for Partnership, established under Partnership 2000, has undertaken a significant amount of work in the past year.</P>
      <P>In December 1998, a training programme for the development of partnership in the public sector workplace was launched. The programme is called Working Together.</P>
      <P>The programme is designed to help managers, trade union representatives and employees to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to develop a partnership approach at the level of the workplace.</P>
      <P>The training programme is of use to trainers-facilitators who are working with partnership groups, especially with groups that are getting started. The programme is available without charge from the NCP through attendance at half-day briefings on the materials and their usage. To date approximately 100 organisations have attended these briefings.</P>
      <P>For the private sector, a 13 module joint partnership training programme together with a supporting 25 minute video was launched by me in Dublin Castle on the 14 July last. This programme was developed jointly by the NCP, IBEC and ICTU as a very substantial contribution to enterprise level partnership.</P>
      <P>A business plan, which has been approved by the board of the centre, for the joint delivery of this programme is being implemented at present. The business plan sets out clear parameters for joint delivery of this programme, together with a monitoring system to measure progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1098" /> The programme is still at a pilot stage and is co-ordinated by a steering committee comprising senior representatives from IBEC, ICTU and the NCP. This committee meets regularly to review progress against agreed objectives set out in the business plan. The steering committee reports progress to the liaison group and the board of the centre. There is a provision in the business plan for an independent evaluation to review the overall effectiveness of the public and in-company pilot phase of the programme.</P>
    <P>As I have previously mentioned, in addition to the ongoing work of the NCP, an evaluation of the progress made on partnership in both the public and private sectors and the associated role of the NCP is currently under way in my Department. It is expected that the consultants engaged to carry out this evaluation will submit their report soon. This will form a useful backdrop and context to assist the ongoing post P2000 discussions. The timescale for publication of the report and the manner of dissemination will be informed by this process.</P>

      <P>The National Millennium Committee was set up to advise the Government on projects for inclusion in its millennium programme. A fund of £30 million was allocated to this programme, covering the period 1999 and 2000. Following a national advertising campaign, more than 2,000 proposals have been submitted to the committee for consideration. In the past 12 months the committee has considered the proposals received and has made recommendations on projects to the Government on a regular basis. The recommendations of the committee reflect particular themes, for example, children, youth, and the elderly, the environment and the celebration of Christianity. In addition, the committee has also endeavoured to ensure a wide geographic spread of projects.</P>
      <P>To date the millennium committee has made recommendations on projects amounting to nearly £29 million. This figure includes £3 million for 193 locally based projects around the country under the millennium recognition awards, an initiative administered by Area Development Management Limited. It also includes £3 million for 1,959 millennium events awards, administered by local authorities. To date just over £6.4 million has been drawn down in respect of the millennium programme.</P>
      <P>The National Millennium Committee is supported by a small millennium office, the operational budget of which is included in the overall millennium fund.</P>
      <P>At this stage, millennium funding is virtually fully committed. The National Millennium Committee is now in the process of finalising consideration of outstanding projects with a view to allocating the remaining funds available. The committee is approaching this final task with due regard to ensuring a broad thematic and geographic spread, consistent with its previous recommendations to the Government.</P>

      <P>It is a basic concern of any Minister whose job it is to deal with the problem of public order to ensure that the evils of racism and the violence which has been associated with racism throughout the world are not allowed to take root. I recognise the importance of creating an environment which is positive towards and welcoming of refugees and have taken a number of steps to combat racism and intolerance in Irish society including the introduction of equality legislation and the establishment of the Equality Authority and the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations. This legislation will provide a catalyst for change and protect refugees from racism which can be caused by discrimination in a work and non-work environment.</P>
      <P>To maintain the momentum of the good work done during the European Year Against Racism, I established, in July 1998, the National Consultative Committee on Racism and lnterculturalism. This committee is a partnership of NGOs, State agencies, social partners and representatives of Government Departments. Its overall role is to act in a policy advisory role to Government to contribute to the overall development of public policy in relation to racism and interculturalism and to promote a more participative and intercultural society which is inclusive of persons such as refugees, travellers and minority ethnic groups in Ireland. The activities of the committee are funded by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>In November 1998 I established an interdepartmental working group to examine the best means of integrating recognised refugees and others granted permission to remain in this country. The report of the working group, which is due to be published shortly, places considerable emphasis on the importance of a tolerant inclusive society and contains a number of recommendations on how this can be achieved. Discussions have been taking place between my Department and the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism on the development of initiatives to inform public opinion and develop a tolerant inclusive society. In this regard, I will be bringing proposals to Government and further details will be announced in due course, following consideration by Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also mention that the Garda authorities have taken the initiative in combating racism. In April of last year the Garda authorities hosted an international conference, co-funded by my Department, entitled &ldquo;providing a police service in a developing multi-ethnic and multi-cultural Ireland&rdquo;. The Garda authorities are determined to learn from the experience of other countries in policing a multi-ethnic society. I am informed by the Garda authorities that a working group has been established to review all aspects of Garda training in this area and to develop best <Col N="1102" /> practices in the light of ongoing changes in the policing environment.</P>
    <P>A follow-up conference is planned for this year. Entitled Intercultural Ireland &ndash; Identifying the Policing Challenges, it will be co-hosted by the Garda Síochána, my Department and the EU Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The comments reported to have been made by the appeals authority in question do not accord with the facts.</P>
      <P>Applicants for asylum are given every opportunity to present their case. They have access to free legal advice and assistance at all stages of the asylum determination process up to and including applications for temporary leave to remain.</P>
      <P>The refugee legal service which commenced operations on the 22 February 1999 from the Refugee Applications Centre in Lower Mount Street is an independent, comprehensive legal service to assist asylum seekers in all aspects of the Irish asylum procedure. As an additional safeguard, I established an independent monitoring committee to ensure that a quality refugee legal service is provided. However, in many cases applicants do not avail of this legal service until the appeals stage.</P>
      <P>I am aware that, in many appeal cases, information presented to the independent appeals authorities has differed from that given at the initial interview. This additional information invariably has a bearing on the applicant's case for refugee status and, if it had been presented initially, the need for an appeal may not have arisen. Instances such as this help to give rise to a mistaken perception that the initial interview process is somehow unfair or flawed.</P>
      <P>My aim and that of the Government is to provide a fair and effective system for dealing with asylum applications while continuing to meet our international obligations and maintaining our humanitarian approach to those in need of protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since taking up office, I have put in place fair and effective procedures for processing asylum applications following consultations with the UNHCR and NGOs. These procedures are in line with our international obligations and in the spirit of the Refugee Act, 1996. The UNHCR has stated that, overall, the procedural arrangements promote a balanced administrative process pending the entry into force of the Refugee Act. All staff working in the asylum division, including my Department's reception and interviewing person<Col N="1103" /> nel, have completed appropriate training courses and have received &ldquo;on the job&rdquo; training and experience of interviews and assessments. The training programmes were agreed with UNHCR and delivered by a combination of my Department's own experienced personnel, UNHCR training specialists and the UNHCR's full time official here.</P>
    <P>I have also provided additional staff, free legal aid and put in place independent appeals mechanisms. The very fact that the appeals authority in question was free to make public his views on the asylum process, and his subsequent reappointment as an appeals authority, clearly indicates the independence of the appeals authorities.</P>
    <P>The unprecedented number of asylum applications in the latter half of 1999 inevitably placed intense pressure on the asylum services in the State. However, I have taken a number of steps to deal with this increasing number. These include the allocation of additional staff resources and increasing the number of appeals authorities. I have also brought forward amendments to the Refugee Act, 1996 to make that Act workable and it is my intention to implement it in full very shortly. Applications have been invited for the post of refugee applications commissioner and the competition for the position of chairperson of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal will commence in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>My ultimate aim and that of the Government is to establish a cohesive framework within which asylum seekers will have their applications processed speedily and fairly in accordance with best international practice and to integrate these persons granted refugee status fully into Irish society.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that the user base for cocaine has altered in Ireland during the past two-three years. Garda intelligence suggests that cocaine, which was previously used primarily by more &ldquo;affluent&rdquo; users, is now being used on a wider basis. The increase in the seizures of cocaine in recent years has strengthened the belief of the Garda that the Irish market for this drug has grown. In 1998 and 1999 the Garda seized 400kg of cocaine. However, the Garda also believe that a large percentage of the recent seizures of cocaine were destined for the UK and mainland Europe, and were seized while in transit.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="1104" /> The Garda authorities have assured the Minister that the trends associated with cocaine use are constantly reviewed so that effective measures can be deployed to stem the flow of this drug into Ireland.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Priority Question No. 53 today where I said that I am advised that the person in question was arrested under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act, 1939 on 27 July 1999 and was subsequently charged with offences under the Firearms Act, 1964. She first appeared before the Special Criminal Court on 30 July 1999. On 11 January 2000 the Special Criminal Court was informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions had decided not to proceed with the prosecution.</P>
      <P>In September 1999 the DPP received an unsigned letter alleging that irregularities had occurred during the detention of the person concerned in Garda custody. The director, in turn, referred the letter to the Garda Commissioner who, notwithstanding the fact that no complaint of any kind had been received from either the person in question or her solicitor, appointed a senior Garda officer to investigate the allegations. That investigation is continuing and I am informed by the Garda authorities that it is anticipated that the investigation will be completed in the near future. Clearly, it would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment on this aspect of the matter pending the completion of the investigation.</P>
      <P>It is important to make the point again that the decision not to proceed with charges in this case was not linked in any way to the contents of the anonymous letter. That decision was made by the Director of Public Prosecutions on the basis of the Garda investigation into the importation of firearms.</P>

      <P>There is no such thing as special category status in the Irish prison system. <Col N="1105" /> The persons referred to by the Deputy are part of the PIRA group of prisoners who transferred to Castlerea Prison last December.</P>
      <P>These prisoners are held in the part of Castlerea known locally as The Grove. The Grove consists of separate houses where inmates live in a domestic type environment distinct from the main prison but within the prison walls. The PIRA group of prisoners share The Grove with 17 non-subversive prisoners. Both groups have equal access to facilities and their regimes are identical.</P>
      <P>The Grove was purposely built in 1996 with a view to transferring some subversive prisoners from Portlaoise prison. However, the breakdown of the first IRA ceasefire saw this proposal shelved. The decision to transfer the PIRA group to Castlerea last December reflected ongoing advances in the peace process and signified the Government's commitment to the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>I can inform the House that the transfer of these prisoners to Castlerea has no early release implications whatsoever. The Government's position on these prisoners is that they are not covered by the early release provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>

      <P>The likelihood that an accused will interfere with witnesses or evidence is already recognised by our courts as a ground on which bail may be refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, I would point out that section 41 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1999 creates a statutory offence, punishable by up to ten years imprisonment, for a person to intimidate another person who is assisting in the investigation by the Garda Síochána of an offence, or is a witness or potential witness or a juror or potential juror in proceedings for an offence, or a member of his or her family, with the intention of causing the <Col N="1107" /> investigation or the course of justice to be obstructed, perverted or interfered with.</P>
    <P>I would suggest therefore that the Deputy or any other person who suspects that an incident of the type referred to in the Deputy's question has occurred should report the matter to the Garda Síochána for investigation.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Bail Act, 1997 was passed into law by the Oireachtas in May 1997. It gave effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution which provides for the refusal of bail in certain circumstances. Section 13 of the Bail Act provides that the Act, or any particular provision or provisions of it, will come into operation by order to be made by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I have informed the House in response to previous questions that the full implementation of the Bail Act is not yet possible because existing prison accommodation would not be able to deal with the additional demand. I have however indicated that I am keeping the matter under continuous review in the context of the major prison building programme which I have under way at present.</P>
    <P>As a result of the continuous review to which I have already referred the provisions of the Act have been implemented in part. Thus section 10 of the Act was brought into operation with effect from 2 June 1998. That section amends section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 with the aim of strengthening its provisions in relation to the imposition of consecutive sentences for offences committed while on bail.</P>
    <P>Sections 1 to 4 of the Act, which deal with the power of the court to refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence where such refusal is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person, were brought into operation with effect from 4 September 1998 in respect of persons appearing before the Special Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>As to the full implementation of the Act, I will continue to keep the matter under review with a view to bringing it into operation generally as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>It would not be possible, without expending a disproportionate amount of staff time, to ascertain exactly the extra hours worked by the top earner of overtime in 1998. This is due to the fact that overtime is paid at ascending rates depending on the number of hours worked in a pay week. However, the level of overtime earned in this case would equate roughly to about 40 hours extra per week.</P>
      <P>The average number of hours overtime worked weekly throughout the prison service in 1999 was about 31,900. This amounts to, on average, about ten hours per officer, per week.</P>
      <P>The capacity to earn high sums in overtime arises from the preference of local prisons management and staff to operate a voluntary overtime system. Certain staff continuously make themselves available for unpopular and unsocial shifts and this is accepted as it reduces the need to compel other officers to work overtime.</P>
      <P>That level of extra attendance is, however, not sustainable and is a matter of concern which is being addressed in a strategic way through the work of a dedicated staffing and operations review team, SORT.  This team is examining the staffing requirements at each institution and has produced eight reports to date. A detailed strategy for the implementation of the findings of these reports is being developed at present. The ultimate aim is to have an attendance system for the prison service which does not rely on overtime to meet its operational needs.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the information sought regarding the number of minors arrested during 1999 is not readily available. In addition, the Garda authorities point out that the distinction between arrests and persons being made amenable should be borne in mind i.e. not all arrests lead to a person being made amenable for an offence.</P>
      <P>However, juvenile offenders, i.e. persons under 18 years of age, made amenable for offences are reported to the Garda national juvenile office. This includes persons who are arrested and also those who are detected without arrest e.g. for no insurance or driving licence. For the year 1999 some 15,554 referrals for juvenile offenders were received at the national juvenile office.</P>
      <P>There are five special schools for young offenders operated under the aegis of the Department of Education and Science and certified variously as places of detention, industrial schools or reformatory schools under the provisions of the Children Act, 1908. The schools concerned are Trinity House School, Oberstown Boys' Centre and Oberstown Girls' Centre all of which are situated at Lusk, County Dublin; Finglas Children's Centre in Finglas, Dublin and St. Joseph's Special School, Clonmel, County Tipperary.</P>
      <P>In general, young offenders under 16 years of age on admission, may be referred to these schools by the courts for periods ranging from typically one month to a place of detention, one year to an industrial school and two years to a reformatory school. Details of the numbers of young offenders sentenced to detention in these special schools for 1999 are not readily available from the Department of Education and Science. However, the information will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it is available.</P>
      <P>Juveniles may also be sent to a prison or places of detention under the aegis of my Department, such as St. Patrick's Institution. The number of committals to these institutions in 1999 was 766. Each time a juvenile is committed, a record of that committal is created. Therefore, it is not possible to state from the above figures the number of times a particular juvenile was committed or the actual number of juveniles committed during the period in question.</P>
      <P>The following table is a provisional summary of the number of juveniles for whom, having been convicted or guilt having been established, reports were requested from the probation and welfare service during the year ended 31 December 1999.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the report from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drugs Addiction which found that Irish teenagers were twice as likely to have sampled heroin as most young Europeans; the additional steps, if any, he will take to protect young people from the heroin menace; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[2524/00]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The study, to which the Deputy refers, is the European School Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs, ESPAD, which was conducted in 1995 under the auspices of the Council of Europe's Pompidou Group. The survey was carried out in 26 European countries and <Col N="1111" /> involved approximately 2,000 young people in a cross-section of schools in each country. The Minister has been informed by the Minister for Health and Children that a further ESPAD survey was conducted during 1999 but that its findings are not expected to be made public until later this year.</P>
      <P>The 1999 extended annual report of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, EMCDDA, which refers to the 1995 ESPAD survey, illustrates that the lifetime prevalence use of heroin among those surveyed was 2.0% in Denmark, Italy and the United Kingdom as well as in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Minister would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that the issue of drugs misuse has always been high on this Government's agenda. The Government's approach to the problem of drug misuse has been, and remains, a two pronged approach with strong legislation supported by tough law enforcement measures on the one hand and a multi-agency integrated approach targeted at reducing the demand for drugs on the other.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, significant changes in Garda structures have taken place since the beginning of 1995. We now have dedicated Garda units to deal with elements of drug dealing and drug trafficking, money laundering, and the seizure of the proceeds from criminal activity. The Minister is sure that the Deputy will agree that the sterling work done by these units, and by other members of An Garda Síochána in tackling the blight of drug dealing and trafficking, is deserving of the highest praise. Their continuing efforts in tackling the supply of drugs and the organised criminal groups who are behind the trade in illegal drugs have yielded significant results over the past number of years.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have informed the Minister that from January 1998 to September 1999, drug seizures amounting to a notional street value in excess of £100 million were made. Garda operations, such as Dúchas, Cleanstreet and Mainstreet, to combat on-street drug dealing have also been extremely effective resulting in the seizure of illicit drugs with a notional street value in excess of £12 million and in over 15,700 arrests being made in the period January 1998 to September 1999. The Minister is sure that the Deputy will agree that these figures bear strong testimony to the effectiveness and commitment of the Garda in tackling the supply of drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Garda continues to do a commendable job in relation to the trade in illicit drugs, measures to reduce the demand for drugs, as being implemented under the national drugs strategy, are vital to ensuring that young people in particular are made aware of the danger of drugs and are given worthwhile and tangible alternatives to prevent them from falling into a cycle of drug misuse and crime. Both the Minister and his Department contribute fully to the development of the integrated policies which are <Col N="1112" /> being implemented under the national drugs strategy by being represented on the structures which have been established to co-ordinate this strategy. He is a member of the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and officials from the Department are represented on the interdepartmental group on the national drugs strategy and on the national drugs strategy team. Representation on each of the 14 local drugs task forces, which have been established in the areas where the heroin problem is most acute, includes an inspector from An Garda Síochána and the local probation and welfare service officer.</P>
    <P>This level of representation ensures that the Minister and the Department play a full role, along with the other agencies involved, in the ongoing development of the national drugs strategy.</P>
    <P>In addition to those measures under the national drugs strategy, the Minister has also given a high priority to ensuring that everything possible is done to deter young people at risk from becoming involved in crime. Since coming into office, he has increased the number of Garda youth diversion projects from 12 to 29, at an annual cost of well over £1 million. The Minister is sure that the Deputy will agree that the additional £16 million allocated under the national development plan for the expansion of the Garda youth diversion programme is clear proof of the Government's determination to ensure that the benefits of our national economic success are shared by all sections of the community and impact on the quality of life in all areas.</P>
    <P>The overall objective of this programme is to develop a number of projects in both urban and rural areas which will, through a combination of intervention and preventive actions, aim to divert young people from becoming involved in criminal activity and its consequences. The long-term objective is to enable the target group of ten-18 year olds to integrate into the labour force in a systematic manner and to prevent them from becoming unemployable. Each project targets a number of &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people and seeks to engage them in activities designed to achieve these objectives.</P>

      <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that the enforcement of the traffic legislation is <Col N="1113" /> being given a high priority by the Government and, of course, by the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>As the House may be aware the Garda national traffic bureau, which is headed by a chief superintendent is focusing on the ongoing Garda enforcement campaign i.e. Operation Lifesaver, which commenced on 14 July 1997, and is engaged in formulating enforcement strategies aimed at reducing road deaths, and serious injuries. Furthermore, the bureau regularly review their enforcement strategies in order to maximise their effect. Also, the Operation Lifesaver strategy has been endorsed in the Government's National Strategy on Road Safety which was launched in July 1998 and has set a target of reducing deaths and serious injury accidents by at least 20% on their 1997 level.</P>
      <P>In this regard the provisional total for the number of road deaths in 1999 was 413 compared to 458 in 1998, showing a decrease of 45 deaths on the 1998 total. However, while this reduction was a significant one it must be stressed that the numbers killed and injured on Irish roads is still unacceptably high by international standards.</P>
      <P>As a result of Operation Lifesaver the four offences of excessive speeding, drink driving, failure to wear seat belts and dangerous-careless driving have been identified as major factors in fatal and serious injury accidents and have been singled out for particular attention by the Garda in their enforcement policies. In 1999, for example, as part of the Operation Lifesaver campaign, the Garda launched intensive campaigns to target these issues, i.e. Operation Belt-up focusing on seat belt offences, Operation Check-up focusing on vehicle road worthiness issues and Operation Juggernaut focused on offences in relation to heavy goods vehicles. The following tabular statement which the House may find useful, summarises Garda activity in relation to the key offences since the commencement of Operation Lifesaver:</P>

    <P>I assure the Deputy and the House that high levels of enforcement are continuing into 2000. I understand that this includes high levels of patrolling, the use of checkpoints and speed checks in addition to extensive road safety campaigns using national and local radio stations and schools programmes which are designed to educate road users to exercise care on our roads.</P>
    <P>In relation to the issue of the fixed cameras, these cameras are at present operational on a pilot basis in the Louth-Meath division.

However, as we all know progress in reducing deaths and injuries from road accidents will only be achieved by a change in the mind-set of road users to one of greater compliance with the law.</P>

For example the continued success of the Criminal Assets Bureau which has the primary responsibility for targeting the illegal assets of persons engaged in criminal activity is proving very successful in the fight against organised crime. The bureau is regarded as a model operation, both nationally and internationally.</P>
    <P>Since its statutory inception in October 1996 and up to 31 December 1998, the bureau has obtained 25 interim orders under section 2 of the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996 on property to a value in excess of £6.1 million; 20 interlocutory orders under section 3 of the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996 on property to a value in excess of £4.5 million; the bureau demanded in excess of £19 million in the payment of tax and interest, from persons suspected of involvement in criminal activity; and social welfare determinations and savings amounted to in excess of £900,000.</P>
    <P>The Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation continues to be highly effective in the investigation of serious cases of commercial fraud, money laundering offences, and counterfeiting of currency. The money laundering investigation unit of the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation is actively involved in the recording, evaluation, analysis and investigation of disclosures relating to suspicious financial transactions received from bodies designated under national legislation.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that from January 1998 to September 1999, over 2,200 suspicious transaction reports, with a total value in excess of £200 million, were submitted to the money laundering investigation unit by the designated bodies.</P>
    <P>Representatives from both my Department and the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation participate in the money laundering steering committee which oversees the implementation of the money laundering provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.</P>
    <P>The Financial Action Task Force, FATF, the major international anti-money laundering organisation, adopted its second mutual evaluation report on Ireland's anti-money laundering provisions in February 1999. The FATF concluded that Ireland has put in place a comprehensive and very solid legislative scheme for combating money laundering, and in relation to certain measures, such as the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 and the Criminal Assets Bureau, has implemented an innovative legislative and administrative scheme which could provide a model for other countries.</P>
    <P>The Garda national drugs unit's primary focus is aimed towards the national and international aspects of drug trafficking and has had considerable success to date. During the period from January 1998 to September 1999 drug seizures amounting to a notional street value in excess of £100 million were made. In the period January 1998 to September 1999 Garda operations, <Col N="1116" /> namely Dúchas, Cleanstreet and Mainstreet, aimed at combating drug dealing at local level yielded seizures of illicit drugs with a notional street value in excess of £12 million and resulted in over 15,700 arrests.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the Garda authorities will continue to have my full support in their ongoing work in tackling illicit drugs.</P>
    <P>One of the problems facing all law enforcement agencies in their fight against organised crime is that these criminal organisations are now operating at international level and they are flexible enough in their operations to take advantage of any new opportunities that arise. That some of these criminal groups have the capability to operate at an international level poses new difficulties for law enforcement agencies. Accordingly, the response to organised crime must be an international response.</P>
    <P>In the context, Ireland participates fully in the fight against organised crime at both EU level and beyond.</P>
    <P>Following an initiative at the Dublin European Council an EU action plan to combat organised crime was prepared. The plan contained 30 recommendations and was adopted by the Amsterdam Council in June 1997.</P>
    <P>A multidisciplinary working group on organised crime was set up to oversee the implementation of the EU action plan. Officials from my Department, An Garda Síochána and Customs are fully involved in the work of the multidisciplinary group and are taking whatever steps are needed to improve international co-operation to deal with organised crime.</P>
    <P>The 1997 action plan is currently being evaluated and a report was submitted to the Helsinki European Council on the finalisation and evaluation of the action plan on organised crime. The Finnish Presidency produced a strategy paper on the prevention and control of organised crime into the new millennium which it is expected will be adopted during the Portuguese Presidency.</P>
    <P>This strategy paper builds upon the 1997-EU action plan to combat organised crime. It provides the framework for an integrated and multidisciplinary European strategy to prevent and control organised crime. The detailed recommendations which have been given the highest priority include those on money laundering; mutual evaluation process; fraud affecting the financial interests of the community; reversal of the onus of the burden of proof; asset sharing; and strengthening technical assistance and expertise to applicant countries.</P>
    <P>The proposed UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime is currently under discussion by an ad-hoc committee. Officials from my Department attend the meetings of this committee. The purpose of this convention is to promote co-operation, to prevent and combat transnational organised crime more effectively. It is hoped that the draft convention will be finalised in autumn 2000.</P>
    <P>International agencies such as Europol and <Col N="1117" /> Interpol have an important role to play in dealing with organised criminal organisations and the gardaí are in regular contact with these agencies through the Garda liaison officers posted to Europol and Interpol headquarters.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that dealing with the twin evils of drugs and organised crime will remain very high on my list of priorities as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>Garda clearances are provided in respect of applicants for certain public service appointments, to health boards in respect of full-time prospective employees in the health care area who would have substantial access to children or vulnerable persons and, on a pilot basis, for persons on a FÁS community employment project which involves regular unsupervised contact with children or other vulnerable persons. These clearance schemes are operating effectively.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will be aware from previous replies in this area that in 1999 the Garda Commissioner commenced a comprehensive review of Garda clearance arrangements. He established an internal working group to recommend improved clearance arrangements which would allow the Garda Síochána to respond effectively to the increasing number of requests to expand the system. Arising from the recommendations of the working group, the Garda Commissioner has approved the establishment of an implementation group which will report on the practical and resource implications of establishing a new centralised unit to deal with these matters.</P>
      <P>I do not consider it would be appropriate to disclose precise details in relation to the manner, in which data is recorded for use for clearance purposes. Equally, it is not practicable to give details of the numbers of personnel assigned to this work as, of its nature, most members of the force would, from time to time, be involved in inputting data which could be used in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the question of the gardaí having resumed providing clearance for persons seeking employment in the childcare area I can say that in the context of the areas described above, i.e. <Col N="1118" /> for health boards and the pilot FÁS project, the procedures have been in place since 1994 and mid-1999 respectively.</P>

      <P>The recommendations contained in the report of the interdepartmental committee on immigration, asylum and related issues of February 1998 were accepted by Government and I am pleased to report that significant progress has been made in relation to the implementation of these recommendations, including the allocation of adequate resources to deal quickly with new applications so as to bring about a speedy and effective system for dealing with new applications while cutting the backlog and the conclusion of readmission agreements with appropriate countries &ndash; a re-admission agreement with Romania is at an advanced stage and the final draft is currently under consideration by the Romanian Interior Ministry. Negotiations on a re-admission agreement with Bulgaria are also under way. The possibility of a re-admission agreement with Poland is also being pursued.</P>
      <P>The Refugee Law Comparative Study, commissioned by my Department has been completed and will be published shortly.</P>
      <P>Ireland has become an actively participating member of the intergovernmental consultations on asylum, refugee and migration policies in Europe, North America and Australia. The Intergovernmental Conference is a consultative process which was established in the mid-1980s. It is basically a group of like-minded states who come together to discuss in an informal and frank manner issues of interest and concern in the asylum and migration areas.</P>
      <P>Discussions in relation to Ireland's participation in the work of the International Organisation for Migration, IOM, are ongoing. The IOM assists in the orderly return of illegal immigrants &ndash; failed asylum applicants &ndash; to countries of origin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee also recommended that all appropriate assistance should be given to facilitate the integration into Irish society and of persons recognised as refugees or given leave to remain in the State on humanitarian grounds. In November 1998 I established an interdepartmental working group to examine the best means of integrating recognised refugees into society others granted permission to remain in this coun<Col N="1119" /> try. The report of the interdepartmental working group was submitted to me in December 1999 and I will be bringing proposals to Government on the development of a comprehensive strategy to facilitate the integration of refugees in Ireland, based on the recommendations contained in that report. Further details of these proposals will issue following consideration by Government and the report of the working group will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>With regard to the recommendation in relation to abuses of Irish citizenship law, the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill 1999 which, <i>inter alia</i>, abolishes post nuptial citizenship is currently before the Seanad. The recommendation in regard to the deliberate arrangement of births to non-national parents here now needs further consideration bearing in mind the agreement reached in the multi-party negotiations on 10 April 1998 and the subsequent amendment of the Constitution, article 2 of which now creates an entitlement and birthright for every person born in the island of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill, 1999, which criminalises trafficking in illegal immigrants, is currently before the Dáil. The penalisation of persons who employ illegals is under consideration. In addition, I am preparing an immigration and residence Bill which will deal with other recommendations of the committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, arising out of the buoyancy in the economy and the current high level of activity in the housing market, the number of dealings being lodged with, and the level of business being transacted by the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds has been increasing steadily for some years now and has been subject to unprecedented increases in recent years. The intake of property transactions by the Land Registry has increased from 91,060 in 1993 to 133,000 in 1999. At the end of 1999 there was an arrear of 86,074 applications despite the significant deficiencies that have generated by the registries which has led to an increase of 35% in the overall output of transactions completed by the registry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of this situation, the registrar found that an increasing amount of resources were <Col N="1120" /> being diverted to answering telephone inquiries about the arrear rather than dealing with cases. In this light the Land Registry management reluctantly decided, as an interim measure and subject to review at the end of March 2000, to restrict telephone inquiries to allow the staff of the registries to tackle the backlog of dealings and to register as many cases as possible. I would like to emphasise that this restriction applies only to telephone inquiries and does not affect the service provided to inquiries at the public counter of the offices of the Land Registry.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to take this opportunity to inform the Deputy that, following the case I made to the Department of Finance for the allocation of additional staff to the Land Registry, sanction has very recently been received to increase the core numbers of the staff of the Land Registry by 77.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the provision of additional staff, together with the implementation of the new title registration information system will in time, allow the Land Registry to offer a much improved level of delivery of services to customers.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a Government decision of 21 July 1999 approved the transfer of the Legal Aid Board's head office to Cahirciveen, County Kerry, and authorised the Office of Public Works to source an appropriate building for the board's use.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works placed an advertisement in the national and local press inviting proposals from owners of potentially suitable sites in the Cahirciveen area. As a consequence of this public advertisement, the Office of Public Works have identified a number of suitable sites for the relocated head office of the board and have recently made an offer in respect of one site. Developments are awaited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the staffing issue, an internal circular issued recently within the board seeking declarations of interest from staff in the move to Cahirciveen. I understand that a small number of staff has applied internally to participate and the board has now requested the Department of Finance to issue an interdepartmental circular seeking applicants from throughout the Civil Service, this is in line with the procedure followed in other decentralisation programmes. The number of <Col N="1121" /> new staff, if any, to be recruited will not become apparent until the latter stages of the recruitment process. However, I can assure the Deputy that both staff and the unions representing them are being kept fully informed of all developments in relation to the transfer.</P>
    <P>The proposed number of staff to be relocated to Cahirciveen is 39 but when account is taken of the staff at dual locations, the total number of staff working from the Cahirciveen base will be 42.</P>
    <P>As agreement has not yet been reached on the acquisition of a site for the head office of the board in Cahirciveen I am unable to determine the total cost of the proposed move.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the present level of staffing at the Criminal Assets Bureau is 45.</P>
      <P>Since its formation, and through the actions of its officers, the bureau has succeeded in tackling the problem of organised crime in accordance with its statutory remit as laid down in section 4 of the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau is regarded both nationally and internationally as a model operation. In this context a recent evaluation by the Financial Action Task Force, FATF, concluded that Ireland has put in place a comprehensive and very solid legislative scheme for combating money laundering, and in relation to certain measures, such as the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, and the Criminal Assets Bureau it has implemented an innovative legislative and administrative scheme which could provide a model for other countries.</P>
      <P>Since its formation in 1996, I am satisfied that adequate funding has been made available to the Criminal Assets Bureau to meet its requirements.</P>
      <P>However, the resource levels at the Criminal Assets Bureau are reviewed on an ongoing basis and I am informed by the Garda authorities that following the most recent review it is likely that additional resources will be allocated to the bureau in the near future.</P>
      <P>I would also like to remind the Deputy that the objective of tackling organised crime does not lie solely with the Criminal Assets Bureau, but also involves other national Garda units.</P>

      <P>I have indicated to the House on a number of occasions, by way of reply to parliamentary questions, the provisions in the law which apply to the problem of underage drinking. Chief among those provisions, contained in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988 are that it is an offence for any person under 18 years of age to purchase alcohol, or for someone else to purchase alcohol for any person under 18 years of age, whether in an on or off-licence, or to consume it in any place other than a private residence; it is an offence for a licence-holder to sell or deliver alcohol to a person under 18 years or to permit consumption of drink by, or the supply of drink to, such a person; intoxicating liquor in the possession of under-18s in any place other than a private residence may be seized by the gardaí; persons under 15 years are not allowed into the bar of a licensed premises unless accompanied by a parent or guardian; no person under 18 years is allowed in the part of licensed premises where an extension under a special exemption order is in force; and under-18s are not allowed on off-licensed premises unless accompanied by a parent or guardian.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána are given powers under the 1988 Act to demand names and addresses, seize intoxicating liquor, arrest without warrant and enter and inspect premises.</P>
      <P>In January 1999 I made regulations for a national voluntary age card scheme under section 40 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988. Those regulations came into effect on 19 April 1999. Any person who has attained 18 years of age is entitled to apply for an age card at his or her local Garda station. The scheme is intended as an additional deterrent against underage drinking.</P>
      <P>Following the Government's approval of my proposals for the drafting of an Intoxicating Liquor Bill, the Bill will contain provisions to strengthen the law further on underage drinking. It will do so through removal of the reasonable grounds defence in any proceedings against a licensee; closure of a licensed premises for a specified period, and; an increase in fines generally.</P>
      <P>The Bill will be published as soon as possible in this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The certain suggestion made by the Deputy for improvement in the law is not without difficulty. A licensee who is prepared to break the law in the first instance by selling or supplying alcohol to persons under 18 years of age might not feel compelled to comply with a law which would oblige him or her to advertise the fact that he or she is breaking the law. On that basis, the suggestion might not contribute to the efforts of the gardaí in this area. The code of law which will <Col N="1124" /> apply on enactment of the Bill should offer comprehensive and effective deterrents and sanctions in the area of underage drinking.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that contacts between An Garda Síochána and the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network are well established and that many problems have been resolved as a result of the liaison that has been ongoing for some years. This liaison is being developed on a continuing basis.</P>
      <P>Discussions have taken place between the gardaí and the network on the production of a leaflet on personal safety. The gardaí also have plans for a leaflet in relation to the reporting of homophobic attacks. This will outline different options for reporting homophobic crime as research has shown that reporting can be problematic for victims.</P>
      <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that the functionality of the new Garda IT system, PULSE, will facilitate the recording of reports of homophobic attacks and detailed analysis of the aggregate data collected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the training of Garda recruits, on 7 December 1999 the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network hosted a workshop for staff at the Garda Training College in Templemore. Fol<Col N="1125" /> lowing on from this initiative staff in the social studies section of the college, in conjunction with the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, are preparing a training package for student gardaí.

    <P>The Garda authorities have plans for another workshop in the near future and any necessary action will follow on from the outcomes. They are also considering the establishment of a national advisory group for policing gay and lesbian communities.</P>

      <P>The Parental Leave Act, 1998 which implements the Parental Leave Directive (96/34/EC, provides an individual and non-transferrable entitlement to both parents to 14 weeks unpaid leave from work to take care of young children. The entitlement applies to parents of children born or adopted on or after 3 June 1996.</P>
      <P>In developing the Parental Leave Bill, my Department examined the existing parental leave scheme in other countries, including EU member states. However, it is difficult to make comparisons with other member states because, in almost every respect, whether it be the upper age limit of the child, the pattern of leave available, or the issue of payment, there is much variation between member states.</P>
      <P>Following the Parental Leave Act coming into operation on 3 December 1998, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, formally lodged a complaint with the European Commission to the effect that Ireland had not correctly transposed the EU Directive on Parental Leave as it had restricted entitlement to such leave to parents of children born or adopted on or after 3 June 1996. This complaint is currently being investigated by the European Commission and we are awaiting a response from the commission on this matter. Accordingly, it would be premature to contemplate any amendment to the legislation at present.</P>
      <P>Section 28 of the Parental Leave Act, 1998 provides for a review of its operation after two years of its commencement. Such a review will involve consultation with representatives of employees and employers and will provide an opportunity to assess provisions of the Act in the light of experience of its operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has outlined before in the House the three essential components to the Government's &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; approach to crime: a clear and determined focus on tackling those who are engaged in crime; a determination that the law enforcement agencies will be properly equipped and resourced to deal with crime; and a commitment to address, and where possible to ameliorate, the causes of crime.</P>
      <P>The House will already be aware from previous debates that this Government and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, are particularly committed to ensuring that the best resources and equipment are available to the Garda Síochána. The Minister's record speaks for itself. For example, in the period since he has been in office, overall crime in the State has fallen by approximately 20%. Moreover, when he took up office the allocation provided in the 1997 Estimates for the Garda vote was a figure of £472 million. The provision in the Estimates for the year 2,000 is £671.6 million &ndash; an increase of 42% or just under £200 million.</P>
      <P>In concrete terms this means that since he has taken office the strength of the force has increased consistently starting from a base line of 10,800. The number of gardaí has now increased to 11,437 and is on target to reach the planned strength of 12,000 by the year 2002. During his term of office we have seen continued investment being made to equip the gardaí with the best of equipment and technology available. This has ranged from major IT investments to funding for a high speed patrol for policing inland waterways and for the purchase of a second helicopter to expand the capabilities of the air support unit.</P>
      <P>He is also conscious that any long-term anti-crime policy must engage local communities in co-operation with the Garda Síochána and this is why he established a National Crime Forum in 1998 and why he recently established the State's first ever National Crime Council to continue this open and innovative approach to crime policy development.</P>
      <P>Since taking office he has been totally committed to dealing with the twin threats of drugs and organised crime. In this context, he has adopted a twin pronged strategy of, on the one hand, strong legislation backed by tough law enforcement measures and, on the other, a commitment to a multi-agency partnership approach to dealing with the drugs problem.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau, since its statutory inception in October 1996 up to 31 December 1998 has frozen assets to the value of £10 million under the Proceeds of Crime Act, demanded in excess of £19 million in tax payments and saved almost £1 million in social welfare payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the targeting of particular criminal activity, the Deputy will be aware of the Criminal <Col N="1127" /> Justice Act, 1999. This is a flagship measure in the Minister's extensive programme of criminal law reform, and further proof of the Government's zero tolerance approach to crime &ndash; an approach which all the available evidence vindicates, not least for the unprecedented reductions in crime levels in recent years. An aggressive policy is being pursued by the Garda Síochána in obtaining evidence to bring drug traffickers before the courts. This has led to significant seizures of illegal drugs, the disruption of organised networks and the charging of major criminals.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Minister has always operated on the basis that there is a correlation between crime and social deprivation and that the drugs problem cannot be solved by law enforcement measures alone and the Minister has endeavoured to ensure that the Department and the Garda Síochána are among the main contributors to the development of multi-agency integrated policies to deal with the drugs problem at a national and local level. My Department and the Garda Síochána have enthusiastically supported and been actively involved along with other statutory agencies and the community and voluntary sector in the national drugs strategy team and the local drugs task forces which have contributed so much at local level.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not just focused on the enforcement side of dealing with the crime problem and I believe he has taken a balanced and comprehensive approach to tackling crime. Since coming into office he has placed increased emphasis on measures to reduce youth crime and he has invested significantly in preventive measures such as the Garda youth diversion projects. There were 12 in existence when the Minister took up office, there are now 29 and the Minister intends to expand the schemes further over the coming year. Some of these projects have been established with the assistance of European Social Fund moneys and the Minister is particularly pleased to have secured additional funding for my Department for crime prevention measures and youth services under the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Estimates recently published by the Government for the year 2000 show that for the first time ever spending in the justice area will exceed £l billion. As the Deputy will appreciate this level of investment is unprecedented and will pay dividends in the years to come in the fight against crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to respond on this matter because I believe a considerable degree of misunderstanding prevails in relation to the management of sex offenders in custody. The reality is that many sex offenders in custody are either unsuited or are unwilling to participate in intensive group programmes like the course at Arbour Hill referred to by the Deputy due to insufficient motivation, emotional immaturity or otherwise.</P>
      <P>All convicted sex offenders, regardless of the institution in which they are held, are invited to apply for inclusion in this Arbour Hill programme All applicants are interviewed by the programme delivery team to determine suitability. Where the number of suitable applicants exceeds the number of places available on the programme, priority is given to offenders whose release dates are closest.</P>
      <P>I have asked the Director General of the Irish Prisons Service to ensure that the treatment of sex offenders throughout the prison system is given priority attention. I have since been assured by him that this matter is being given personal attention by him. Given that there are more sex offenders in custody in the Curragh then any other prison &ndash; over 90 &ndash; except Arbour Hill, efforts are being concentrated there at present.</P>
      <P>Public discussion and commentary about this issue frequently implies there is only one form of rehabilitation programme in place for sex offenders in Irish prisons and that it reaches a very limited number of prisoners annually. This is incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are actually four forms of direct therapeutic intervention available to sex offenders within the Irish prison system at present. All four are aimed at enabling such offenders gain some measure of control over their personal tendencies towards offending behaviour. The first intervention method is individual counselling from my Department's psychology service and from the probation and welfare service. This is a largely demand led service to individual prisoners who ask for help. The second intervention is a multi-disciplinary thinking skills group work programme which focuses on issues such as anger management, evasion of personal responsibility and relapse prevention. This programme is in place in Cork Prison and Arbour Hill Prison since I998. The third programme which tends to receive most media coverage is an extremely intensive offence focused group work programme which is <Col N="1130" /> available in Arbour Hill Prison and which is delivered by officers of the probation and welfare and psychology services of my Department. The fourth intervention which perhaps deserves greater acknowledgement involves the psychiatric service which provides extensive support to prisoners in this category. This is done on a sessional basis, and an all-out basis as well as in response to particular individual crises. Of the 103 sex offenders released on completion of their sentences during 1998, 11 had completed the specialised sex offender group treatment programme in Arbour Hill Prison.</P>
    <P>Eighty sex offenders were released during 1999. Of these, five had completed the Arbour Hill group programme prior to their release. In addition many of those released would also have undergone individual counselling either from my Department's psychology service or the probation and welfare service. These would also have had access to the thinking skills programme which targets offending behaviour and relapse prevention and about which I will have a further word to say later in this reply. I am also advised that the prisoners who were released in the period in question included as well as those who participated in the intensive group programme referred to, prisoners who decided not to participate in this programme, prisoners who after professional assessment were deemed not to be suitable to participate in it or where it was determined that it was beyond their ability to participate in it.</P>
    <P>A working group chaired by the Prisons Service Director General and comprising representatives of all the relevant agencies and prison disciplines is currently overseeing the introduction of a number of interventions for sex offenders in the Curragh. Prisoners and staff at the Curragh have all now been notified of the inception of the new prisoner programmes there, one exclusively involving specialist staff as in the intensive Arbour Hill programme and the other programme on the same pattern as the thinking skills programmes in Cork and Arbour Hill which are delivered by multi-disciplinary teams including specially selected and trained prison officers.</P>
    <P>The first step being taken involves the expansion of generic therapeutic services in the Curragh. The probation and welfare service and the psychology service of the Department are recruiting extra staff at present and it is intended that the Curragh will have priority in the allocation of resources. Already a member of the psychology service has taken up an assignment to the Curragh in recent days. He will be joining a probation officer who has also been assigned to duties there in recent months. They will be joined in their work with offenders at the Curragh by further members of their services as the &ldquo;roll out&rdquo; of support services for sex offenders at the prison continues.</P>
    <P>The sequence which will be followed at the Curragh will be as follows; analysis of response by individual prisoners and staff to circular from Governor as to their willingness to participate in <Col N="1131" /> the new programme, February 2000; selection and training of local staff in all disciplines and services in thinking skills programme and selection of first prisoner participants, and; delivery of first modules of thinking skills programme, late summer 2000; roll-out of intensive sex offenders treatment programme later in the year 2000 drawing particularly on successful offender participants in the thinking skills programme at the Curragh.</P>
    <P>The thinking skills course referred to above was introduced in Arbour Hill and Cork prison early in 1998. It is designed to target a range of offenders including sex offenders, particularly with a view to motivating the latter group to engage in the most intensive programmes. The course is run by multi-disciplinary teams, including prison officers, probation and welfare staff and teaching staff under the guidance of my Department's psychology service. The skills taught in this programme include general strategies for recognising problems, analysing them and considering non-criminal alternatives, how to consider the consequences of their behaviour &ndash; to think before they act, how to go beyond their own view of the world and consider the thoughts and feelings of other people and how to develop the ability to control their own behaviour and avoid acting impulsively. This programme is considered by the director general and his advisers to be the preferred first line of approach to rehabilitating sex offenders in custody as in many cases it builds up their frequently low personal motivation to address offending behaviour in depth.</P>
    <P>When the intensive sex offenders treatment programme is introduced in the Curragh during the current year it will be operated by the probation and welfare service and psychology service in the same mode as the current Arbour Hill programme.</P>
    <P>I have also been advised by the director general that he has deputed a senior member of his transition team at prison governor level and another colleague to investigate the possibility of extending the range of multi-disciplinary group work programmes with sex offenders here based on successful interventions which have been developed in prisons in Scotland and England in recent years. This particular study is not expected to be completed until early next year.</P>
    <P>The ultimate objective for the Irish Prisons Service is to develop and put in place a wider range of rehabilitation programmes for sex offenders than are currently available, to ensure they operate on independently accredited selection, training and service methods and that they reach every sex offender in custody who is willing to participate at some level in their personal rehabilitation and relapse prevention. The latter point about willingness by prisoners convicted of sex offences to co-operate in personal rehabilitation programmes is significant because it is the experience in many prison jurisdictions including Ireland that <Col N="1132" /> a significant percentage of prisoners decline the opportunity to partake in this work. Compulsion is not a realistic or indeed legal option in such cases.</P>
    <P>Finally I would like to make it known that a major review of the effectiveness of the intensive Arbour Hill sex offender programme is currently under way between the psychology service of this Department and the Department of Psychology, University College, Dublin.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the monitoring of the 3% target level for the employment of people with disabilities in relation to the core Civil Service rests with the Department of Fin<Col N="1133" /> ance and, in this regard, I would refer the Deputy to the reply by the Minister for Finance to Questions Nos. 171, 180 and 184 of 1 February 2000.</P>
      <P>As regards public sector bodies and agencies under the aegis of the various Government Departments, responsibility for meeting the 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities rests with each Government Department and the individual public sector body or agency concerned. My Department is responsible for monitoring progress towards achieving this target in the public sector other than the Civil Service. To this end, a monitoring committee is working to support and advise in relation to the attainment of the target. The committee is chaired by my Department and is composed of representatives of each Department, of the social partners under Partnership 2000 and of the relevant interest groups.</P>
      <P>The percentage of people with disabilities employed in the public sector &ndash; other than the Civil Service &ndash; has increased from 1.49% in 1995, to 1.52% in 1997 and 1.7% in 1998. The latter figure represents 3,050 persons out of a total staff of 178,980.</P>
      <P>The monitoring committee has sought to advance progress through a survey of the position as at 31 December 1998; endorsing a model code of practice on the employment of people with disabilities as being suitable for adoption or modification by each public sector body or agency under the aegis of a Government Department. The code was launched, in September 1999, by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, for use in the local authority service; the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Mary Wallace, who has special responsibility for equality and disabilities issues, has written to each Government Minister requesting their active support in progressing the adoption of codes of practice in relation to the public sector bodies and agencies under the aegis of their own Department.</P>
      <P>Future work of the monitoring committee will include advising on the conduct of a survey to ascertain progress towards the attainment of the target since the last survey; and identifying reasons for the success by some bodies in achieving the 3% target, as well as the failure in other areas to do so.</P>
      <P>My Department will continue to monitor, support and advise public sector bodies and agencies in working to achieve the 3% target for employment of people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the lead role in the development of the Government's strategic response to tackling poverty is being taken by my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern.</P>
      <P>One of the principal aims of my Department, as outlined in its strategy statement, is to bring about a more equal society by outlawing discrimination and facilitating equality of opportunity, especially for certain groups which have experienced disadvantage.</P>
      <P>My Department ensures that poverty and inclusion issues are addressed in all relevant policy areas. The responsibilities of the Department range from social inclusion measures which are aimed at specific groups to initiatives which address gender inequality and diversity within society. For example, in the area of equality, my Department's work programme is focused on the specific categories of people who experienced social exclusion or poverty through discrimination in employment and in terms of access to goods, facilities and services. Another example is in the area of child care. The equal opportunities child care programme, which is under the aegis of my Department, is targeted particularly at parents in disadvantaged areas and those on low pay.</P>
      <P>My Department also has a number of innovative social inclusion measures in the area of crime prevention and the rehabilitation of offenders which form part of a co-ordinated initiative between the prisons' probation service and the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>The programme of Garda youth projects is a crime prevention measure and is aimed at young persons who, because of social exclusion, are at risk of becoming involved in criminal and anti-social behaviour leading to long-term exclusion.</P>
      <P>The probation and welfare social exclusion measure fosters a number of specialised and targeted programmes directed at persons coming to the attention of the justice system and-or the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social exclusion programme within the prison system aims to provide work, vocational training and related education on an individual <Col N="1135" /> programme basis to custodial prisoners to enable them access employment opportunities on release from prison.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to review the manner in which Garda crime statistics are compiled in view of the apparent contradiction between figures produced in the CSO's quarterly national household survey and official Garda figures and the high level of non-reporting reflected in the CSO figures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of the Central Statistics Office survey data which was comprehensive and unique. This is the first time that a nationwide survey of this scale was carried out by the Central Statistics Office and I hope that this would become a regular feature of the CSO work programme so that trends could be monitored over a period of time.</P>
      <P>The CSO drew attention to the fact that &ldquo;the survey results are not directly comparable with crime statistics published in the Garda Síochána annual report, as there are fundamental differences in sources, definitions and classification methodology&rdquo;. It is also worth noting that the CSO has highlighted that the survey data is subject to sampling variation and that some of the results should be interpreted with extreme caution. So, in simple terms we are not comparing like with like and this is always crucial when comparing any two data collection systems if conclusions are to be drawn.</P>
      <P>The main benefit of surveys such as these was to compare the trends which emerge from them over time. Unfortunately, there is little recent work to compare it with and there is no evidence therefore that under-reporting of crime, for example, is any higher now it was than at any other time. The logical conclusion is that if one in eight households experienced some level of crime in 1998 then the comparative figure for 1996 was probably one in six given that reported crime figures has shown a significant drop in that period.</P>
      <P>The House may be interested to know that in terms of international comparisons for surveys of this type Ireland compares favourably with similar countries for example the England, Canada and the Netherlands. Nevertheless, I would urge the public to report any crime which causes them concern to the Garda authorities.</P>
      <P>My Department is considering the implications of results of the CSO survey and I understand that the National Crime Council is also considering the results of the survey.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is well aware the problem of child begging is a complex one which requires a more broadly based response than the Garda Síochána alone can provide. While there were over 500 prosecutions for begging taken in 1998 I am sure we would all agree that the existing legislation which dates back to 1847 and 1908 is inadequate to protect children from this sort of manipulation and that the welfare of the children is the primary concern.</P>
      <P>I can inform the House that in relation to proposed legislation, however, section 247 of the Children Bill, 1999, which is at present before this House, proposes to update the provisions of the Children Act, 1908 and, in particular, to reverse the burden of proof so that if it is shown that a child was begging, a person charged with allowing the child to beg will be presumed to have allowed the child to beg unless the contrary is proved. This amendment of the 1908 Act provision, which gives effect to a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission in their report on vagrancy and related offences, will make it easier to enforce the legislation dealing with persons who send children out to beg. The proposed penalties are £250 for a first offence and £500 for second or subsequent offences.</P>
      <P>In 1997, the Irish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Children &ndash; ISPCC &ndash;  launched a new initiative called &ldquo;Leanbh&rdquo;, which put outreach workers on the street to identify young children at risk. This scheme works in close co-operation with the Garda, particularly in city centre stations like Pearse Street and Store Street. When the child is sighted begging, the outreach worker contacts the Garda by mobile phone who then respond and take the child into protective custody. The Leanbh initiative found that there were about 40 families consistently leaving children to beg on the streets of Dublin and that most of them were from a travelling background.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will appreciate that a multi-agency approach is needed to tackle this problem effectively. I understand that the Eastern Health Board is funding a number of voluntary agencies who work exclusively with the travelling community. The voluntary and statutory agencies involved with these families consider that the solution to the problem requires long-term targeted work with the families concerned, and that the fact of children begging is only one aspect of the <Col N="1138" /> family circumstances which should be addressed. I am glad to note that the Eastern Health Board reports that the Garda has always been most helpful in co-operating with the statutory social service agencies regarding children begging and is part of the network of services who liaise regularly in an effort to solve this problem.</P>
    <P>In June 1998, I established a committee to monitor and co-ordinate the implementation of the recommendations of the task force on the travelling community. The committee, which is chaired by my Department, is representative of traveller interests, each of the four pillars in Partnership 2000 and relevant Government Departments. The committee is currently working on the preparation of a progress report on the implementation of the recommendations of the task force for submission to Government later this year.</P>

      <P>The report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities endorsed the recommendations of the constitutional review group which recommended amending Article 40.1 of the Constitution to prohibit discrimination against persons on the grounds of status including that of disability. I understand that the constitutional review group expects to begin the process of dealing with the recommendations relating to the area of fundamental rights, in the near future and that the relevant amendment to Article 40.1 will be considered at that time.</P>
      <P>The constitutional review group also considered whether the proposed amendment to the article should also include a specific provision for affirmative action. It concluded that the objective of rectifying unfair disadvantage should continue to be legislatively authorised and pursued through Government policy. This approach is being pursued in relation to disability policy through the enactment by my colleague the Minister for Education and Science of the Education Act, 1998 in so far as it deals with the education of people with disabilities; the National Disability Act, 1999 which I will bring into operation in the coming months; and through the commitment to prepare a disabilities Bill, which is under consideration in my Department.</P>

      <P>Under the Immigration Act, 1999, among the categories of person in respect of whom a deportation order may be made is a person whose application for asylum has been rejected or a person whose application has been transferred to another state party to the Dublin Convention for examination. Section 3 of the Act sets out the procedures which, subject to the provisions of section 5  &ndash; prohibition of <i>refoulement</i>&ndash; of the Refugee Act, 1996, will apply in considering cases of this nature.</P>
      <P>In preparing the reply to this question, it has emerged that there may be some minor discrepancies in the figures provided for those cases transferred under the Dublin Convention which on preliminary examination appear to be mainly related to the categorisations used and, as I would not wish in any way to mislead the House, I am having all the figures re-checked and I will write to the Deputy giving the appropriate figures as soon as they are available.</P>

      <P>The National Minimum Wage Commission in its report of April 1998 recommended that &ldquo;the national minimum wage be measured against the median earnings of all employees&rdquo; as opposed to the earnings of employees in one sector, such as manufacturing industry. The commission was of the view that there was no great divergence between average earnings generally and manufacturing earnings. Therefore, the commission concluded that the national minimum wage should be measured against the median earnings of all employees as this better reflected the real level of earnings in the economy and not just the earnings in one sector.</P>
      <P>I share the concern expressed by the commission that the introduction of a national minimum wage should not lead to a decrease in employment. The recently published National Minimum Wage Bill, 2000, which gives effect to the Government's commitment to introduce a national minimum hourly rate of pay, aims to strike the right balance between the need to improve the earnings of employees subject to low pay and the need to protect employment and competitiveness.</P>

      <P>The avoidance of deadweight and displacement is critical towards the achievement of best value for the Exchequer's investment in enterprise development. I am not aware of any deterrent to the development of small industry in the boards' guidelines regarding deadweight.</P>
      <P>Just a year ago, I informed the 35 county enterprise boards that, in future, they should focus their efforts on the development of manufacturing and internationally traded services projects which, in time, will have the potential to develop into strong export-oriented entities. This strategy is predicated primarily on the potential of and the need for the enterprise boards to become the major upstream source of dynamic and fast growing projects for eventual handover to Enterprise Ireland.</P>
      <P>The soon to be published operational programmes for the Border, midlands and western region and the southern and eastern region will re-emphasise the need for greater selectivity by the boards in their financial interventions for mico-enterprise support, particularly against the background of virtually full employment and acute labour shortages.</P>

      <P>The review of the files in relation to the Tuskar Rock crash of 24 March 1968 is ongoing. Several meetings have taken place between Irish and British officials and between Irish officials and members of the families of the victims. A large amount of documentation has been examined and a report of the review is expected in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to make the report available to the public. Subject to any conclusions or recommendations the report may make, I shall then consider if any further action is warranted.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 123 together.</P>
      <P>I deplore the wholly unauthorised release of the draft of the White Paper on Defence to a newspaper. I understand that the military authorities have initiated an investigation into the circumstances in which confidential material relating to the White Paper was supplied to a number of newspapers.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Defence will be completed very shortly and I intend to bring forward my proposals immediately for consideration and approval by Government. Those proposals will address all aspects of the development of the Defence Forces including the overall defence policy framework, manpower, organisation, equipment and resourcing generally.</P>
      <P>Allowing for the normal consultative process at Government level and printing of the final text, I expect that the White Paper will be published in late February 2000. It would be premature for me to comment on any aspect of the White Paper in advance of a draft being considered by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overall, the White Paper presents a positive opportunity to map out a strategy for the development of the Defence Forces and Civil Defence over the next ten years. Significant new <Col N="1148" /> challenges are facing the Defence Forces and the White Paper will ensure that the Defence Forces are developed to face these challenges.</P>

If it is found that the annuity is excessive relative to the earning capacity of the farm and the family circumstances, it is intended to capitalise the arrears and to reduce the repayments to a more reasonable level which will result in an extension of the repayment period. On the other hand if it is found that there is no good reason for non-payment of annuities my Department will have to consider taking legal action in the matter.</P>

      <P>Quota will be allocated,<i> inter alia, </i>with reference to each applicants' livestock units.

      <P>As stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 245 of 26 January 2000, the person named claimed a total of 30.99 hectares on his 1999 area aid application. Following processing of his application an area of 30.24 hectares was determined. This represents a difference of 0.75 hectares or 2.48% between the area claimed and that determined.</P>
      <P>Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, no penalty is applied when the difference is less than 3%, the penalty is based on double the difference when it is between 3% and 20% and when the difference is over 20%, a 100% penalty must be applied.</P>
      <P>Therefore in this case no penalty is applied, leaving the area for payment purposes at 30.24 hectares.</P>

However, in accordance with clause 22 of the terms and conditions governing the scheme, headage payments cannot issue to a herdowner without a <Col N="1152" /> valid area aid application. The closing date for receipt of 1999 area aid applications was 23 April 1999. Applications received in the period 24 April 1999 to 18 May 1999 inclusive were subject to a penalty deduction of 1% of any aid payable for each working day that the application was late. Where applications were received on or after 19 May 1999 no aid was payable. The person named submitted his application on 31 May 1999 and accordingly a 100% penalty was applied to his entitlement under the 1999 cattle headage scheme.</P>
      <P>Applicants under the EU premia schemes may be paid on up to 15 livestock units without a valid area aid application.

      <P>The person named submitted five applications for special beef premium in 1999.</P>
      <P>Advance payments of 60% issued in respect of the first two applications on 13 December 1999. An advance payment in respect of the third application received on 29 October 1999 issued to the applicant on 17 January 2000.</P>
      <P>Payment will issue shortly in respect of the fourth application received on 18 November 1999.</P>
      <P>Payment on the final application can not yet issue as the application received on 16 December 1999 is still subject to the retention requirement of the scheme. In addition, 18 of the 23 animals submitted on this application were in excess of the 1999 ten month age category limit of 90 animals. Therefore, while these 18 animals will be deemed to have received the premium, no payment can issue, as the applicant will already have received payment for 90 animals in the ten month age category.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any recent incidences of illegally imported lambs or sheep. As a member of the European Union, Ireland is obliged to operate within the rules of the Single Market. This means that it is not possible to prohibit the free flow of trade in agricultural produce which is the subject of a common organisation of the market, from other member states.</P>
      <P>However, under EU legislation sheep coming from other member states must be accompanied by EU veterinary certification and be assigned to a particular holding/slaughterhouse. A separate certificate applies to each of three categories; i.e., sheep for breeding, sheep for fattening and sheep for slaughter. Details of each consignment of animals imported are required to be sent in advance to the local Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development office in the county of destination through the EU Animal Notification System (ANIMO).</P>
      <P>Where trade with Northern Ireland is concerned, these requirements have, by bilateral arrangement, been removed since 1992. Under this arrangement, sheep of Northern Ireland origin may move freely into the Republic and <i>vice versa</i>. No animal health certificates are required for such trade and no ANIMO notifications are sent.</P>
      <P>Finally, the question of VAT liability on the importation of sheep is a matter for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>Under EU Regulations the milk quota held by a farmer at 31 March 2000 must be taken into account for the purpose of calculating stocking density for the two livestock units per forage hectare limit on suckler cow and special beef premium payments for the year 2000, irrespective of what arrangement the farmer makes in relation to the quota for the 2000-2001 milk quota year. Farmers who, because of the inclusion of the milk quota at 31 <Col N="1154" /> March in their calculations, exceed the two livestock units per forage hectare limit will, nevertheless, be paid suckler cow and special beef premium up to the limit.</P>
      <P>The milk quota will not be taken into account in calculating stocking density for extensification premium purposes in the arrangements agreed in Agenda 2000. Only bovine animals actually on the holding, including dairy cows, ewes or hogget ewes entered for the ewe premium scheme and the forage area available to a farmer will be taken into account in calculating stocking density for extensification premium purposes.</P>

      <P>Payments under the rural environment protection scheme are area based. Where all or part of the eligible area comprises commonage land, the stocking densities on the commonage must comply with the provisions of the interim national framework plan. For farmers owning commonage land in counties Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway and Kerry, ewe numbers shall not exceed 70% of their 1998 quota. Reductions in ewe numbers on owned commonage in other counties shall be determined by the planner when drawing up a REPS plan.</P>
      <P>Compliance with the destocking provisions is mandatory for all new participants entering the scheme from 1 January 1999. Participants in the scheme prior to 1 January 1999 who wish to avail of the enhanced payment rates under SMA must take out a new five year contract to incorporate the SMA provisions into the agri-environment plan.</P>

      <P>The eligibility criteria for the allocation to producers of the additional 20.5 million gallons of milk quota negotiated under Agenda 2000 were indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 42 of 9 December 1999.</P>
      <P>Of this additional quota to be available for use from 1 April 2000, 15 million gallons will be allocated to active milk producers with quotas of less than 55,000 gallons who have demonstrated a commitment to dairying by filling their existing quota and acquiring additional quota. A further five million gallons will be allocated to younger dairy farmers who have shown similar commitment. It was necessary to set strict eligibility criteria for the allocation of the extra quota in order to maximise its effect. The scheme for the allocation of the 15 million gallons is being administered by the dairy co-operatives in accordance with criteria set by me. On the basis of the information available to my Department, the person named does not meet the eligibility criteria for these schemes and, therefore, is not entitled to an allocation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The overpayment in question arose as a result of the person named being paid on animals under the 1998 special beef premium scheme in excess of the permitted two livestock units per forage hectare limit. Under EU Regulations governing the special beef premium scheme, a stocking density limit of two livestock units per hectare applies based on the forage area declared on an applicant's area aid application. The person named declared 33.05 forage hectares on his 1998 area aid application and, therefore, was entitled to payment on a maximum of 66.10 reckonable livestock units.</P>
      <P>Reckonable livestock units consist of animals submitted by the applicant for special beef premium, suckler cow premium and ewe premium schemes together with notional livestock units derived from any milk quota held. The milk quota of the person named utilises the following livestock units: &ndash; 37,211 gallons divided by 897 gallons = 41.48 livestock units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This leaves a balance of 24.62 livestock units for premia payments. However, when the initial <Col N="1156" /> 1998 80% advance payment issued to the person named, he was paid special beef premium on animals in excess of his remaining livestock unit quota of 24.62. The amount paid in excess amounted to £1204.34, and represents the overpayment in question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>A Government decision of 19 July 1995 assigned <Col N="1157" /> primary responsibility for the prevention, detection, interception and seizure of illegal drugs intended to be smuggled or imported into the State to the Revenue Commissioners, customs service.</P>
      <P>The practical arrangements for the execution of this responsibility were agreed in a Memorandum of Understanding concerning the relationship between the customs and excise service of the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda Siochana, in respect of drugs law enforcement, and was signed on 12 January 1996 by the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda Commissioners. It was endorsed by the Ministers for Finance and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners, who have operational responsibility in this area have advised me that the position in relation to enforcement is as follows both generally and with regard to Dublin airport. In 1993 the Revenue Commissioners established the Customs National Drugs Team. This unit currently consists of 85 officers dedicated to the prevention, detection and seizure of drugs being smuggled into or out of the State. Most of the CNDT officers are deployed in the main ports and airports and others man the CNDT Maritime, Intelligence and Dog Units. CNDT officers are supported by the other Customs anti-smuggling staff also deployed at the ports and airports. The CNDT has seized drugs to a total value of £76 million during the past three years and has contributed to several major seizures by the Customs Services of other countries through the sharing of intelligence material and other practical co-operation.</P>
      <P>Four Customs officers work full time in the CNDT unit based in Dublin airport. They are backed up by 18 customs officers who are deployed in general anti-smuggling duties in the passenger terminal. The dedicated drugs unit at the airport also has responsibility for the detection of drugs in freight shipments where they also receive support from a further 33 Customs officers who work in this area.</P>
      <P>In the experience of CNDT, staff at Dublin airport the principal method of smuggling drugs through the airport is on the person or in the baggage of intra community travellers. Customs have powers to stop and search suspect passengers, however, in order to facilitate the large number of law abiding passengers, their powers are exercised based on profiling and risk analysis techniques. Customs have access to a wide international network of intelligence from overseas Customs services under the terms of Conventions and Agreements to which Ireland is a signatory. Intelligence provided through such channels greatly assists in targeting likely drugs traffickers.</P>
      <P>Since its establishment in 1993 the customs drugs unit at Dublin airport has had a high success rate in detecting drugs being smuggled into the State and in the past three years the value of seizures has totalled £6.6 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1158" /> The Dublin airport unit also services requests from the Criminal Assets Bureau and other Garda Units involved in drugs enforcement and other criminal investigations by tracking the movement of suspect travellers through the airport.</P>
    <P>Where persons suspected of smuggling drugs through Dublin airport are detected by Customs officers, the gardai at Santry Garda Station are advised and the suspects are generally detained under the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking Act), 1996.</P>
    <P>Last year, the board of the Revenue Commissioners established a review group to examine all aspects of the operation, organisation and equipping of the Customs National Drugs Team. The board will shortly consider the report of the review group including any recommendations relating to the CNDT Units at import points such as Dublin airport.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are seriously concerned about the outstanding tax liabilities in this case, not only because of the amount of tax involved &ndash; in excess of £180,000 even before outstanding returns are received &ndash; but also because the taxpayer has made no effort to deal with the arrears despite being given a number of opportunities by Revenue to do so. It is fair to point out that enforcement by way of attachment has only arisen because of the taxpayer's failure to discuss the matter with Revenue and agree a suitable arrangement to pay the liability.</P>
      <P>The commissioners have noted the family circumstances as set out in the Deputy's question.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I introduced significant changes to pension arrangements for the self-employed and Proprietary Directors in Finance Act, 1999. <Col N="1160" /> These new arrangements have proven to be very popular and have been widely welcomed by both beneficiaries and the industry.</P>
      <P>In brief, the new arrangements increased significantly the tax deductible amounts which the self-employed and proprietary directors can set aside each year to fund their retirement benefits. Depending on age and occupation amounts of up to 30% can now be set aside. Furthermore, I have introduced a greater degree of personal choice and flexibility in relation to drawing down these benefits. The old rule which forced pensioners to take out an annuity has been abolished for these categories. The self-employed and proprietary directors now have the option of choosing between purchasing an annuity or receiving the balance of the fund in cash &ndash; the amount received is of course taxable &ndash; or investing in an approved retirement fund. An ARF allows the individual control over how the pension fund is utilised during their retirement and also allows the individual to retain ownership of the fund and to pass on any balance remaining in the fund following their death.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have produced an excellent booklet which outlines these new pension arrangements. This booklet has been widely circulated and I have arranged for a copy of this booklet to be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The current tax system has a number of personal income tax allowance which are related to the care of incapacitated or disabled individuals. These are the incapacitated child allowance, the dependent relative allowance, the tax allowance for the employment of a carer, medical expenses relief and covenant relief.</P>
      <P>The incapacitated child allowance can be claimed by a parent-guardian for a child who is permanently incapacitated. Where more than one child is permanently incapacitated, an allowance may be claimed for each child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employment of a carer allowance: The allowance for employing a carer for an incapacitated person applies at the taxpayers marginal tax rate for expenses up to £8,500 per annum. Prior to 1999 this tax allowance was only available if a tax payer employed a carer to care for either the incapacitated tax payer or his or her incapacitated spouse. However, in the 1999 Finance Bill I introduced a major widening of the scope of this allowance. The allowance is now available to family <Col N="1161" /> members who employ a carer in respect of a totally incapacitated person. This means that a number of family members can now share the cost of employing a carer and share the allowances between them subject to the overall ceiling of £8,500 in any one year. In addition, carers can now be employed on an individual basis or through an agency.</P>
    <P>Medical expenses relief is available for un-reimbursed medical expenses and is of particular benefit to those with regular medical expenses and is available to those individuals who incur expense of more that £100 per annum or for families who incur expenses of more that £200 per annum provided these expenses are not reimbursed by any other agency, health board, insurance company, etc. There is no upper limit on what can be claimed and the relief is also available at the taxpayers marginal rate of tax. A taxpayer can claim medical expenses relief on behalf of himself/herself, his/her spouse and children and his/her dependent relatives.</P>
    <P>Income tax relief at the marginal rate is also available for those who covenant income to certain individuals. Unrestricted tax relief can be claimed on covenants in favour of permanently incapacitated minors other than from parents to their own minor incapacitated children. Unrestricted tax relief can be claimed on covenants in favour of permanently incapacitated adults.</P>
    <P>I announced on 8 December 1999 that the Government had decided to bring forward a £3,000 per annum tax allowance at the standard rate of tax in respect of those spouses of one income families who work at home caring for children, aged and the handicapped. Full details of this relief will be set out in the Finance Bill and the details will be widely publicised at that stage.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance has no function whatsoever in the determination of whether a person does or does not meet the strict medical criteria in order to qualify for the various concessions under the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme. In order to qualify for relief under the scheme, an applicant must meet the specified medical criteria and be in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer. Where the issue of such a certificate is refused, the person concerned may appeal that decision to the Disabled Drivers' Medical Board of Appeal, an independent board whose decision is final.</P>

      <P>The position is governed by EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. This requires that any increase in the individual threshold for goods and services must maintain the real value of that threshold. This issue was reviewed in the context of the 2000 budget and it was calculated that the real value of the services threshold would now be in the region of £22,000 and the goods threshold would now be in the region of £44,000.</P>
      <P>Ireland has the second highest registration threshold for goods and services in the EU and some member states have no registration threshold for goods or services and require all firms to register irrespective of their turnover.</P>
      <P>I am of the view that where there is a high registration threshold, this can cause difficulties for registered businesses where they have to compete with a larger number of unregistered businesses who do not reach the registration threshold. I have no plans therefore to make any changes to the existing registration thresholds.</P>

      <P>Following a detailed examination of the capital acquisitions tax regime, I announced a number of reforms in the Budget of 1 December. Amongs the most significant of the measures announced is the new family home relief. This relief exempts the transfer of a home from capital acquisitions tax on or after 1 December 1999 provided it is the principal private residence of the disponer and-or the recipient and the recipient has been living in the home for the three years prior to the transfer. It will also be a condition that the recipient does not have an interest in any other residential property. These conditions will be confirmed in the Finance Bill which is to be published later this month. The Finance Bill will also provide that the recipient must own and reside in the house for the six years after the transfer. This latter condition will not apply to recipients over 55 years of age and provision will also be made for those circumstances where the recipient is unable to comply with the residence requirements for reasons outside their control e.g. due to hospitalisation or work obligations. This residence condition is a change from the budget announcement where the condition was that the recipient does not dispose of the home for six years after the transfer.</P>
      <P>I am confident that these particular measures should remove the tax burden on the inheritance of the home for many people in the future.</P>
      <P>In other cases where payment of inheritance tax due would cause excessive hardship for the beneficiary, the Revenue Commissioners have power to postpone, remit or compound tax due. The policy adopted by the Revenue Commissioners in such cases is to postpone the tax, and in some cases to also waive the interest due. Under the powers available, the Revenue Commissioners may permit the payment of tax over a five year period, or have the tax secured for future collection by the registration of a judgment mortgage or other charge over the property taken as a benefit.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have published a statement of practice detailing the steps to be taken when postponement of tax is being sought. They have confirmed that there was no noticeable increase in the number of applications received for tax deferral during 1999.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 157 and 179 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons in the Eastern Health Board area, including Kildare, is the statutory responsibility of the Eastern Health Board. The health board has been experiencing difficulties in the provision of services in their regional orthodontic unit at St James's Hospital over the past few months. I understand from the board that these difficulties were caused by the consultant orthodontist's unilateral decision to withdraw from the provision of orthodontic assessments, orthodontic opinions and the commencement of orthodontic appliance therapy for new patients. The position was exacerbated by the withdrawal of consultant cover and the consultant orthodontist's refusal to provide guidance to dental clinicians regarding orthodontic procedures. Despite negotiations and discussions at the highest level, the consultant persistently refused to provide services as outlined above. I understand that the consultant orthodontist's actions led to her suspension from duty without pay with effect from 4 November 1999.</P>
      <P>At the request of the Eastern Health Board, my predecessor in office recently terminated the suspension of the consultant orthodontist in question. The Eastern Health Board is now in the process of arranging for her to return to work and is endeavouring to ensure that the orthodontic service will be running normally shortly.</P>

      <P>My Department's casemix programme collects information in relation to both hospital activity, and it's associated costs. Activity data is collected under the national HIPE programme which operates in 61 public hospitals at present. Costs data are collected under the specialty costs programme in 31 of those 61 hospitals.</P>
      <P>Casemix, which involves the monitoring and comparison of costs and activity between hospitals, classifies patients into discreet classes or groups, which share common clinical attributes and similar patterns of resource use. The system presently in use in Ireland categorises activity into 495 diagnosis related groups.</P>
      <P>Information in relation to private hospitals is not collected by my Department. Work on clearly identifying private patients in public hospitals is under way at present. It is hoped that a more complete and accurate dataset will be available when the 1999 data are reviewed.</P>
      <P>The HIPE programme collects and codes in-patient and day case activity data only, and this is coded under the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9), which allows data to be classified into approximately 12,000 diagnosis and 8,000 procedures.</P>
      <P>Production of data on 8,000 separate procedures would not be practicable. However, for the 694,071 cases treated as inpatients and day cases in 1998, the latest date for which audited data are available, in hospitals in which the HIPE programme operated, a total of 519,547 primary procedures were carried out.</P>
      <P>The classification of a procedure as being either major or minor is not dealt with under the present classification system. Neither does it classify patients as elective, but rather by their medical status on admission, for example, different types of emergency, transfers from other hospitals, etc.</P>
      <P>In 1998 the average length-of-stay was 6.75 days per in-patient case, and the average cost was £1,559 per case.</P>
      <P>The waiting time for elective admissions to hospitals is not collected by my Department, apart from waiting list initiative procedures. The number of consultants employed in all public hospitals, funded by my Department, was 1,328 wte's at 31 December 1998, and the number of NCHD's was 2,980.</P>

      <P>Hospital long-stay charges can be made under two sets of regulations. Charges can be made under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations, 1976, S.I. No. 180 of 1976 as amended by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations, 1987, S.I. No. 300 of 1987. These regulations enable charges to be made towards the cost of providing hospital in-patient services for persons with income who have been in receipt of such services for more than 30 days or for periods totalling more than 30 days within the previous 12 months. Medical card holders are exempt from these charges. In practice, however, persons in long-stay care do not usually hold medical cards as the hospital takes responsibility for all of the person's health needs. Persons with dependants are also exempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Charges can also be made under the Institutional Assistance Regulations, 1965, where the patient receives shelter and maintenance rather than treatment. These charges apply from the date of admission and are payable by all patients <Col N="1167" /> who are in receipt of incomes including medical card holders and persons with dependants.</P>
    <P>The over-riding consideration in applying long-stay charges is that persons with means who are in receipt of long-term care should make a contribution towards the cost of their maintenance. In deciding the amount to be contributed, health boards have regard to the person's individual circumstances. Allowance is made for any financial commitments the person may have and a reasonable amount is left to meet the person's personal needs. Charges may be waived if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, payment would cause undue hardship.</P>
    <P>The Health (In-Patient Charges) Regulations, 1987, S.I. No. 116 of 1987 as amended by the Health (In-Patient Charges) (Amendment) Regulations, 1999, S.I. No. 401 of 1999 allow for a statutory charge in respect of in-patient public hospital services. The charge is currently set at £26 in respect of each day during which a person is maintained, up to a maximum charge of £260 in any 12 month period. Medical card holders are exempt from these charges.</P>

      <P>The issue of the working hours of junior hospital doctors is being looked into by my Department and I hope it will be possible to progressively reduce them to a more acceptable level.</P>
      <P>The standard working week of non-consultant hospital doctors is 39 hours. However, as part of an agreement with the Irish Medical Organisation, NCHDs may be rostered for duty up to a maximum average of 65 hours per week. I should point out that NCHDs working hours include the standard working day, time spent on call and time spent working while on call. I do not dispute the fact that much of this time is actually spent working. NCHDs are the backbone of the hospital medical staffing structure and make a tremendous contribution to the provision of hospital care.</P>
      <P>The working hours of junior hospital doctors are currently the subject of discussion at European level in the context of proposals by the European Commission to bring junior doctors, and other groups excluded from the 1993 Working Time Directive within the scope of that directive.</P>
      <P>As part of our preparations for the implementation of a 48 hour working week for junior doctors, it has been agreed with the Irish Medical Organisation to undertake a study of hospital doctors' working hours. A firm of management consultants has just been appointed to conduct this study at eight hospitals. It is hoped to have a report from the consultants by the end of May. Hopefully this study will provide us with a sound factual basis for embarking on a progressive reduction of hospital doctors' working hours.</P>

Consistent with this policy is the provision of a comprehensive local obstetric service for women in each health board area.

      <P>The provision of health services to the populations of the islands in question off the Mayo coast is the statutory responsibility of the Western Health Board. The issue, therefore, of ensuring that the health needs of the communities involved are met is a matter for the board.</P>
      <P>The Western Health Board has informed me that the situation with regard to the provision of the services to the islands referred to by the Deputy is as follows.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Inisboffin</i>Inishboffin has a population of 150. There is a health centre on the island and one public health nurse is employed on Inisboffin. A chiropodist visits Inisboffin twice a year. Dental treatment and a full range of psychology services are provided in line with the rest of County Galway-Inisboffin lies within the Galway Community Care Area. Residents requiring ophthalmic services may attend at either Shantalla or Clifden health centres. Speech and language services are provided at Clifden health centre. The community welfare officer visits Inisboffin as required. The area medical officer visits Inisboffin every three years offering school vaccination programmes, developmental clinics and a school health screening service; the area medical officer also makes unscheduled visits as required. There are also weekly visits by a general practitioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Inisturk</i>Inisturk has a population of 83. While the board does not currently have a health centre located there, it has purchased a site in 1999 and is in the process of planning a centre. One public health nurse is resident on the island and is employed for 20 hours per week. A chiropodist visits Inisturk as requested by the public health nurse. Inisturk is visited on a yearly basis by a dentist and a dental surgery assistant and children are brought to the dental clinic at Louisburgh for <Col N="1192" /> treatment. Ophthalmic services are not available on the island at present as there are no suitable facilities but such services are available at Westport health centre. The area medical officer, accompanied by a headquarters public health nurse, visits Inisturk regularly for a week offering school vaccination programmes, developmental clinics and a school health screening service. In between visits by the team to the island, children requiring developmental assessments or examinations for allowances travel to the mainland. The area medical officer also visits the island to assess applications for disabled persons housing grants &ndash; but these are rare. There are also plans for the health board psychologist to visit Inisturk this summer. At present, transport is provided for use by the public health nurse and visiting health board personnel. Inisturk is also visited by a general practitioner for one day in every three week cycle.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Clare Island</i>Clare Island has a population of 136. There is a health centre and accommodation for the full time public health nurse. Transport is provided for the public health nurse and the general practitioner. The chiropodist attends annually and chiropody services are also provided at Westport health centre. An ophthalmologist visits annually providing a service for both adults and children. Clare Island is visited on a yearly basis by a dentist and a dental surgery assistant and children are brought to the dental clinic at Louisburgh for treatment. The psychologist has visited Clare Island and held appointments there over the last five years. The area medical officer, accompanied by a headquarters public health nurse, visits Inisturk regularly for a week offering school vaccination programmes, developmental clinics and a school health screening service. In between visits by the team to the island, children requiring developmental assessments or examinations for allowances travel to the mainland. There is a community welfare officer resident on the island providing a service there. The area medical officer also visits the island to assess applications for disabled persons housing grants &ndash; but these are rare. To avail of the speech and language therapy services, clients travel to Westport health centre. There are also weekly visits by a general practitioner.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Inishbiggle</i>Inishbiggle has a population of 48. There is no health centre on the island but services are provided at a local national school which also serves as a community centre. During 1999 the premises were renovated in conjunction with FÁS and the materials were supplied by the Western Health Board. Arrangements are in place for the provision of transport to visiting health board personnel. Public health nursing services are provided from the mainland by a qualified public health nurse. Dental, chiropody and ophthalmic services are provided at Achill Sound Health <Col N="1193" /> Centre and speech and language therapy is provided at Westport health centre. Children from Inishbiggle are usually seen for developmental assessment and other medical examinations in Ballycroy health centre. The area medical officer also travels to the island for the disabled person's housing grant applications. A general practitioner visits Inisbiggle once each fortnight.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing, the Western Health Board has also advised me that the following is the position with regard to the provision of other health services, generally, for the islands:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Environmental Health Services</i>A full service is provided for island populations although sometimes there are delays because of transport and weather conditions.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Physiotherapy Services</i>While no physiotherapy services are provided on the islands at present discussions are ongoing at local level with regard to addressing this issue.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Occupational Therapy Services</i>Visits are made to the islands as the need arises.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Work Services</i>When referrals to the social work department are received they are assessed in the same way as all other referrals and if a home visit is required that will be arranged.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Psychology Services</i>In general every effort is made to see island based clients in their nearest health centre i.e. on the island when possible and practicable.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that intellectually disabled children are entering residential care at an earlier age and causing an additional financial burden on the State; the plans, if any, he has to introduce additional finance for parents who care for their disabled children in their own home thereby reducing the demand for residential care; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[2804/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of my Department is to assist families to continue to care for their family member with an intellectual disability or autism at home for as long as possible. This would particularly apply in the case of young children. A broad range of services are provided by the health boards and specialist voluntary agencies to provide support for both children with intellectual disability and those with autism. These include early intervention, health related support services for children of schoolgoing age, vocational training, day services, residential, respite and home support services.</P>
      <P>There is no evidence of an increase in the number of children with intellectual disabilities being admitted to full time residential care. In 1974, 41.6% of all residents were aged 0 to 19 years. By 1996 this had decreased to 10.2%, reflecting the increased emphasis on providing support within their communities for these children. Comparative data in relation to age at the time of admission to residential care is not available.</P>
      <P>Significant additional funding has been allocated over the last number of years to enhance and expand the level of services available to persons with intellectual disability and those with autism and their families. However the Government recognised that there was a need to accelerate the pace at which the identified needs of this group were being met and is committed to meeting those needs within a defined timeframe of three years, starting with a major acceleration of investment &ndash; both capital and revenue &ndash;  this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional revenue funding being allocated in 2000 is designed to support the opening of additional services with an annual cost of £35 million. Because of the timeframe involved in <Col N="1195" /> bringing all of the new services planned for 2000 on stream, the actual cost of these services in 2000 will be £28 million. This funding is in addition to the £10.7 million already allocated to the services in 2000 to meet the full year costs of the 1999 developments and identified needs in existing services. This brings the total additional revenue funding provided in 2000 for the services to £38.7 million, increasing to £45.7 million on 1 January 2001.</P>
    <P>The additional revenue funding of £35 million will provide, at a minimum: 555 new residential places; 185 new respite places; 700 new day places; health related support services for persons with autism;  for the continuation of the programme to transfer persons with an intellectual disability from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements, and an additional specialist and other support services.</P>
    <P>This is the largest single new revenue investment ever made in the services and is further evidence of the Government's commitment to address the needs which have been identified for this population group.</P>
    <P>There is also a need for capital investment in the infrastructure required to support these services. Additional capital funding amounting to £80 million is being made available over the next three years to accelerate the process of putting in place the necessary infrastructure to support these services. A total of £30 million will be made available in 2000, £40 million in 2001 and the remaining £10 million in 2002. In accordance with normal practice, a revenue allocation commensurate with the capital investment in the services will also be made over this period.</P>
    <P>Around 80 new respite care places were provided for both adults and children with intellectual disability and autism in 1999, with a further 185 due to come on stream by January 2001. Mechanisms have been put in place to manage the emergency admissions to the residential services and this, together with the new residential places which are coming on stream, will facilitate more planned admissions to the services. This in turn will mean that existing respite facilities will also increasingly remain available for respite care and not become blocked by emergency admissions to the residential services.</P>
    <P>These developments, together with the provision of appropriate day and other support services will assist families to continue to care for their family member with intellectual disability or autism.</P>
    <P>With effect from 1 January 2000 the domiciliary care scheme has been extended to include eligible children under two years of age. The respite care grant, which has been increased to £300, is also being extended to all recipients of the domiciliary care allowance and will be paid in June 2000.</P>
    <P>Over the last two years, additional funding has also been specifically targeted to enhance the <Col N="1196" /> health related support services for children with autism. Additional funding amounting to around £5 million has been allocated since 1998 to enhance the level of early intervention, respite care and health related support services, including speech and language therapy, occupational and physiotherapy, psychological and social work support for children with autism and their families.</P>
    <P>The measures outlined above give concrete evidence of the Government's commitment to assisting persons with intellectual disability, those with autism and their families on an ongoing basis. My Department has no plans to introduce any other additional specific financial assistance for parents of children with intellectual disability at this time.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the locum system being put in place by many general practitioners to cover their clinics and patients when the general practitioner is on leave is causing many problems for those patients, particularly the patients who have no means of transport and are being asked to travel many miles to clinics due to the fact the locum is not prepared to travel to their homes; if this problem will be investigated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Health boards have responsibility for ensuring that GMS scheme doctors comply with the terms of their contracts in relation to all aspects of service delivery, including locum services. Doctors are contracted by the boards to provide a domiciliary service only where medically required and not on grounds of transport difficulty for the patient, except, of course, where that is relevant in a medical context. The same service considerations apply to locums.</P>
      <P>The health boards have advised that they are not aware of any difficulties of the type referred to by the Deputy in his question but if the Deputy has specific information or examples where a locum was not prepared to travel to a patient's home on grounds, other than medical ones, he should make such cases known to myself or my Department for investigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest supplement to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and my <Col N="1201" /> Department has no function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>Rent and mortgage interest supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the SWA basic weekly payment rate, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
      <P>SWA is subject to a means test and applicants are required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate towards their rentmortgage interest supplement.</P>
      <P>SWA is not ordinarily payable to people in fulltime employment. However, special arrangements were introduced some years ago to enable people making the transition from welfare to work to retain rent or mortgage interest supplement, subject to certain conditions.</P>
      <P>Under the rules of the community employment &ndash; CE &ndash; scheme participants are paid a set weekly wage which is generally greater than the equivalent social welfare payment for a person in similar household circumstances. In the case of people who were previously unemployed, this weekly wage is paid instead of unemployment assistance. In the case of lone parents, the weekly wage is paid in addition to the one-parent family payment &ndash; OFP &ndash; in recognition of the fact that lone parents need additional supports. These arrangements take into account the special needs and requirements of lone parents raising children and maintaining households on their own.</P>
      <P>In addition, CE participants may retain entitlement to their existing rent-mortgage interest supplements, subject to certain conditions. Participants must contribute a standard minimum contribution of £7.50 per week towards their accommodation costs, their gross household income must not exceed £250 per week and their rent-mortgage interest supplementation is subject to a maximum payment of £250 per month.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, a CE participant who was not in private rented accommodation prior to starting on a CE scheme can apply for a rent supplement and will be assessed under the CE conditions outlined above.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is aware that these arrangements are no longer fully adequate for some households, particularly for families with dependent children, given the large increases in housing costs in recent years. The conditions for retention of rent and mortgage interest supplements, including the income limits and the ceilings on the amounts payable, were reviewed in consultation with the social partners under Partnership 2000. Following those discussions, the Deputy will be aware that I announced substantial changes to the conditions for the retention of rent-mortgage interest supplement by participants in the employment programme schemes in the recent budget. These new measures, which are effective from 6 April 2000, will mean an <Col N="1202" /> improvement in the position of participants in all employment schemes, including the CE scheme.</P>
    <P>Specifically, family income supplement and back to work allowance payments will be disregarded for the purposes of the weekly £250 gross household income. In addition the £250 monthly rent supplement limit will be abolished with effect from 6 April 2000 and the supplement will be tapered out over four years. Some 75% of the previous rate entitlement will be paid in year one, 50% in year two, 25% in year three, and 25% in year four.</P>
    <P>Participants must continue to contribute a standard minimum contribution of £7.50 per week towards their accommodation costs.</P>
    <P>However, a CE participant who was not in private rented accommodation prior to starting on a CE scheme can apply for a rent supplement and will be assessed under normal SWA rules.</P>
    <P>These conditions apply to all schemes under the Government's employment programme. In the case of existing participants, the health boards will review their cases and the participant can choose to be assessed under either the existing arrangements or the new arrangements effective from 6 April next, whichever is more beneficial to them.</P>

      <P>The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one social welfare payment is payable to an individual.</P>
      <P>The review of the carer's allowance, which was published in October 1998, examined the issue of paying the carer's allowance in conjunction with another social welfare payment. As indicated, the practice of paying only one allowance is a feature, with very few exceptions, of all social welfare</P>
      <P>payments and is designed to ensure that limited resources are not used to make two income support payments to any one individual. The review concluded that this practice should continue. The review did however propose the introduction of a continual care payment in certain circumstances in recognition of the caring provided.</P>
      <P>Where a person in receipt of a social welfare payment, for example, a widow's pension applies for a carer's allowance, he or she will receive the higher payment and there is no loss of income.</P>
      <P>The review of the carer's allowance noted that there is an imbalance between the amount of expenditure on institutional care compared with the amount spent on community care. However,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1203" /> the evidence put forward in the review suggests that community care can be as costly, if not more costly, than institutional care where a proper and adequate range of services is provided. This is because the medical professionals involved are mainly dealing with people on a one-to-one basis, and it is also the case that many people who are being cared for at home also spend a certain amount of time in hospitals.</P>
    <P>Government policy is strongly in favour of supporting care in the community and enabling people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. However, the State cannot and would not wish to replace the personal support and care provided within the family and the community. Therefore, its primary role is to provide adequate support for carers and for those for whom they are caring, to enable them to remain in their own communities for as long as possible.</P>

      <P>Since the transfer of this site to the State, the heritage service of my Department has undertaken a programme of <Col N="1206" /> works there. These works include conservation of the High Cross, its removal to within the church, and structural works to the church which are now in progress to support a roof which will protect the cross from adverse weather conditions. In addition the church walls have been repaired, an archaeological excavation has been completed and an interpretative display of all-weather panels is in place.</P>
      <P>Discussions have taken place with Kildare County Council and a local landowner regarding the provision of a car park. I understand that the county council is pursuing this matter. I am satisfied that these measures will be adequate to ensure public access and enjoyment of the site and consequently I have no plans to provide any further facilities there.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the care and conservation of graveyards lies normally with local authorities or the relevant Church body. However, my Department does assist voluntary groups which are engaged on such projects by offering advice on how such schemes should proceed.</P>
      <P>Given the large number of such graveyards throughout the country the resources are not available to my Department to allow for funding of such projects. All resources at my disposal are fully committed to the conservation and maintenance of national monuments which are in State care. The Heritage Council, an independent statutory body, may provide assistance in this regard and applications should be made direct to that body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I presume that what the Deputy means by a &ldquo;company car&rdquo; is one where an old vehicle is bought by young people for as little as £50 to £100 with the intention of driving it untaxed and uninsured. In such cases, generally speaking, the driver is ineligible to hold a driving licence by reason of his or her age. I am informed by the Garda authorities that section 41 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, empowers them to detain a vehicle in circumstances such as I have outlined, specifically where: the driver has no licence or is ineligible to hold one by reason of age; the driver has no insurance; the vehicle is untaxed for more than three months.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that it is not possible to distinguish between company cars and lawfully registered vehicles seized under section 41 of the Road Traffic Act and where vehicles, including company cars, are not subsequently reclaimed by their owners they are disposed of by the Garda in accordance with the appropriate regulations. I am further informed by the Garda authorities that 2,861 vehicles were seized in the Dublin metropolitan area in 1999 under section 41 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994.</P>
      <P>In relation to storage facilities, the Garda has capacity for more than 700 vehicles at various locations within the Dublin metropolitan area. I wish to assure the Deputy that any request from the Garda authorities for additional storage facilities will, of course, be given full consideration by my Department.</P>

      <P>There are approximately 3,060 prison places available at present. Approximately 400 more will come on stream within the next ten weeks or so with the completion of remedial works at Cloverhill Prison. A further 631 places will become available over the follow<Col N="1208" /> ing 18 months at the following locations: midlands, 515; Castlerea, 50 and Limerick, 66.</P>
      <P>The cost of providing a prison place in our latest prison is approximately £91,000. The average cost of keeping an offender in custody is £53,400 per annum, 80% of which is made up of pay and overtime. The average cost in a new prison is likely to be significantly less due to greater use of technology and better design, both of which impact on the number of staff posts required daily.</P>

      <P>Section 8 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended in 1986, provides that a non-national can make a declaration in the manner prescribed by the Minister accepting Irish citizenship as post-nuptial citizenship, after three years of marriage to an Irish citizen, who is an Irish citizen otherwise than by naturalisation or by honorary citizenship, provided that the marriage is subsisting at the date of lodgement of the declaration and that the couple are living together as husband and wife.</P>
      <P>The procedure is that a declaration is made by the non-Irish spouse and an affidavit is sworn by the Irish spouse to the effect that the couple are living together as husband and wife and that their marriage is subsisting. Both affidavit and declaration are submitted along with the following documents: civil marriage certificate; long form birth certificates for both persons; divorce papers if applicable; Garda certificate of registration if applicable; two passport sized photographs of both spouses; and three proofs of residence.</P>
      <P>If the couple are residing in the State, the application is lodged with the citizenship division of my Department. If, however, the couple are resident outside the State, the application is made with the Department of Foreign Affairs, either through an Irish embassy or consulate abroad or, where there is no such representation, at the consular section of the Department in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The average time taken to process an application made in my Department is between six and nine months, which reflects the high volume of applications received. However, in respect of applications made abroad, the processing time is influenced by the speed with which the documents are forwarded by the Department of Foreign Affairs. From information received from that Department, I understand that, while there was a backlog of applications in a number of the embassies in the early months of 1999, this situation has improved greatly. Applications are now forwarded to Dublin within, on average, two months of receipt abroad.</P>

      <P>I understand that due to their complicated nature, applications under section 49, which require detailed examination of claims for registration as owners, can take some time to process. Accordingly, although it is not possible to estimate a precise completion date for the application concerned at this stage, I can say that the application is being mapped at present and will be completed without delay.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that as a result of the resolution passed by South Dublin County Council on 10 November 1999 representatives from the relevant agencies attended a meeting at the county manager's office on 19 November 1999. The Garda Síochána was represented by the two chief superintendents with management responsibilities in the county. At that meeting a draft action plan was formulated and it was agreed that a steering group and a working group would be established to co-ordinate the responses of the agencies tasked with responding to the problems identified in south County Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1213" /> On 15 December a further meeting was held. The Garda Síochána was represented by the Garda Commissioner, the assistant commissioner responsible for the Dublin metropolitan region, the divisional officers from DMR south and DMR west and the superintendent with responsibility for the Tallaght district. At this meeting it was decided that the divisional officer DMR south and the district officer Tallaght would represent the Garda Síochána on the two committees to be established in the immediate future and tasked with providing a co-ordinated response to problems identified in the south County Dublin area. Meetings of the working group and steering group are scheduled to take place this month.</P>
    <P>I am assured by the Garda authorities that the strategies currently in place to combat joyriding are reviewed periodically and changes to tactics are made where necessary to ensure continued effectiveness.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have recently written to South Dublin County Council and departmental officials have also been in contact with South Dublin County Council officials in relation to this matter.</P>

      <P>The Intoxicating Liquor Bill which is in the course of being drafted for publication in this session includes a scheme whereby the holders of restricted licences, i.e. six day, early closing, or six day and early closing licences, will be able to convert such licences to ordinary seven day licences subject to certain restrictions on their disposal. I can confirm that the scheme will have certain similarities with the 1960s scheme.</P>
      <P>A total of 102 such restricted licences were issued by the Revenue Commissioners in 1998, the latest year for which figures are available, of which 63 were six day licences.</P>

    <P>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue): As the Deputy will be aware, the law centre in Newbridge, County Kildare, was opened operationally on 27 January 1997.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Legal Aid Board that the total number of officials in the office is seven, comprising three solicitors, one law clerk and three clerical officers. I have been further informed by the Legal Aid Board that in 1999 the law centre received 300 applications for legal services and it offered appointments to 315 prospective clients. The waiting time for an appointment with a solicitor in the law centre on 31 December 1999 was 15 months, and on that date 270 persons were on the waiting list.</P>
    <P>The waiting times for an appointment at the law centre have reduced in the last few months from a figure of 22.5 months in May 1999 to a figure of 15 months on 31 December 1999.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that, in consultation with the Legal Aid Board, I continually monitor the position with regard to waiting lists at all law centres. I can also inform the Deputy that where waiting times, for whatever reasons, become excessive the position is examined by the board with a view to taking remedial action.</P>

      <P>All applicants who lodged a claim for asylum up to the end of March-April 1999 have at this time been afforded the opportunity of a substantive interview with some minor exceptions, and with the exception of those cases in respect of whom issues are outstanding under <Col N="1215" /> the Dublin Convention. Any decisions at first instance, outstanding for more than three months following interview, of which there are relatively few, will be notified to applicants by the end of February.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are currently being finalised to enable a greater use to be made of accelerated procedures, following the decision of the Government to further augment the staffing in this area to deal with cases speedily which are manifestly well-founded and manifestly unfounded. Manifestly well-founded cases will be identified at an early stage to ensure that a person who is likely to succeed in the asylum process gets the benefit of refugee status as soon as possible without being unnecessarily delayed in the recently enlarged backlog. Manifestly unfounded procedures will help to eliminate at an early stage applications which appear to have little or no relevance to the definition of a refugee in section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended. Applicants refused as manifestly unfounded have the opportunity to appeal to the independent appeals authorities with legal assistance for that purpose. All manifestly unfounded refusals are notified to the UNHCR which is entitled to submit comments to the appeals authority in each case.</P>
      <P>The current average period for an individual determination of an asylum claim averages from four to twelve months.</P>
      <P>The volume of appeals being lodged significantly exceeded the number which could be considered by the four appeals authorities which were in place. In this regard, I made arrangements to appoint a further three appeals authorities to create a wider panel to be available to address this demand and I am presently arranging to expand this panel further.</P>
      <P>The aim of my Department is to minimise the time taken from date of application to completion of the procedure in a refugee determination process which meets the highest EU and international standards. If additional resources are required to achieve this aim, I will seek those resources.</P>

      <P>Ireland does not operate a pre-entry application system for non-nationals. Statistics are not readily available on the number of non-nationals arriving from outside the common travel area who were granted leave to land <Col N="1216" /> in the past 12 months. The number of persons refused leave to land in 1999, including those persons refused leave to land having arrived from within the common travel area, was 3,456.</P>
      <P>The grounds upon which asylum applicants base their claim for asylum are varied and cover the full spectrum of the grounds stipulated in the Geneva Convention, namely, race; religion; membership of a particular social group; political opinion.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may wish to note that economic refugee is not a status conferred under international refugee law. Statistics are not maintained in a manner which would enable information to be compiled without involving a disproportionate amount of staff time in relation to the number of applicants who applied for refugee status for reasons of political opinion.</P>
      <P>The number of applications for refugee status during 1999 increased dramatically from 234 in January to 453 in June, 571 in July to 1,051 in October, 1,010 in November and 1,217 in December. Of the 7,724 applications received up to and including 31 December 1999 the numbers of those applications processed were as follows:</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Prisons Service has developed the following programmes to tackle drug misuse among the prison population: all committals to Mountjoy and St. Patrick's who misuse drugs are offered a 14 day detoxification programme; ongoing addiction counselling and education programmes; community based agencies visit prisons to provide support services and information, including individual counselling as required; each institution has a local committee providing education services for prisoners, including, <i>inter alia, </i>information on drug issues and the risks posed by communicable diseases; a detoxification and drug-free unit is in operation in Mountjoy and an intensive drug-free therapy programme co-ordinated by the probation and welfare service is in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1219" /> The Mountjoy treatment facility was opened in July 1996 at the prison's health care unit. This unit is the first of its kind in a prison environment in the State. It is modelled on hospital based units in the community and is aimed at weaning addicts off drugs by gradually reducing dosages of substitutes such as methadone. A detoxification and therapeutic counselling programme lasting six weeks is provided for offenders in groups of nine at any one time. Two hundred and fourteen inmates have successfully completed the programme in the drug treatment unit to date.</P>
    <P>A review of the first 12 months of the programme, July 1996 to July 1997, found that out of 88 prisoners accepted into the programme, 36 had returned to drug use one year later. When reviewed 18 months later, up to February 1999, a further 15 patients had relapsed, thus giving a total number of 51 prisoners out of 88 who had relapsed. Sixteen patients could not be followed up on but if those had also relapsed this would give us a 12 monthly relapse rate of 78%. This figure may appear high but is favourable when viewed in comparison to in-patient detoxification programmes internationally which have, on average, a 90% relapse rate. The fact is that the majority of addicts may become drug free and relapse several times before succeeding in becoming drug free for an extended period.</P>
    <P>The drug-free unit which is in operation at the training unit adjacent to Mountjoy Prison has accommodation for 96 offenders. This drug-free unit enables those prisoners who do not have a background of drug abuse and those who have demonstrated the desire to stop taking drugs to be detained in a drug-free and secure environment.</P>
    <P>I do recognise, however, that more needs to be done. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a second drug treatment programme will begin at the health care unit in Mountjoy in a matter of weeks. This will provide an additional nine treatment places at any one time. The emphasis will be on offering detoxification and intensive therapeutic counselling over six weeks to prisoners nearing release with a view to returning them drug free onto a structured drug treatment programme in the community.</P>
    <P>The action plan on drug misuse and drug treatment in the prison system which I approved last year provides a detailed strategy to raise the level of treatment for drug addicted offenders. This includes the expansion of detoxification facilities, more drug-free areas and the provision of methadone maintenance. The provision of addiction counselling support services is central to the plan.</P>
    <P>At my request the Director General of the Prisons Service recently established a national steering group for prison based drug treatment services with a view to implementing the action plan. The steering group comprises representatives from my Department, the Eastern Health Board, senior Prisons Service management and the probation and welfare service. The Director General <Col N="1220" /> has agreed to chair the steering group himself to signal the importance that is attached by the prison authorities and Government to this issue. The group has invited, via public advertisement in last week's newspapers, submissions from the general public as well as from special interest groups in relation to its review.</P>

    <P>The information sought by the Deputy in relation to the average sentence being served is not available. At present the compilation and analysis of statistics must be done manually pending the introduction of a £6 million information technology programme for the Prisons Service. This programme is well advanced and later this year I expect that a comprehensive prisoners records database will be deployed throughout the Prisons Service. This programme will address the lack of accessible information about prisoners, provide management with necessary information and enable the automation of many existing functions. Information will be more easily accessible once this new system is in operation.</P>

      <P>My Department has not identified a list of countries where there is persecution of persons for political beliefs, therefore the question of adhering to a list when deciding <Col N="1221" /> on the validity or otherwise of applications for asylum does not arise. However, where it is established that a well-founded fear of persecution, within the definition laid down in section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, exists in any country, applicants will be granted refugee status.</P>
      <P>Each application for asylum is considered on its merits, taking into consideration the information supplied by the applicant in his or her completed questionnaire, at interview and any submissions made by or on behalf of the applicant. Regard is also taken into account of the general situation in the country of origin as it pertains to the applicant's grounds for claiming asylum. For this purpose, my Department obtains information from, <i>inter alia</i>, the UNHCR, the Department of Foreign Affairs, Amnesty International reports, US State Department, Canadian boards of immigration and other EU member states as well as media and Internet sources. A research and documentation centre is available in the Refugee Applications Centre as a research facility for this Department and the legal representatives of asylum seekers. This documentation centre is administered by the refugee legal service in co-operation with the UNHCR.</P>
      <P>We are committed to processing applications for refugee status in accordance with our international obligations and domestic rules and procedures with a view to providing the best possible service for all applicants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>Indications are that there has been a general increase in business in the bed and breakfast sector over the past season. Both Town and Country Homes and Irish Farmhouse Holidays<b>, </b>two of the bed and breakfast sector representative bodies, report that their members generally had increased business in 1999, particularly at the back end of the year. Statistics from the survey of overseas travellers also show a small increase in the proportion of visitors using bed and breakfast-guesthouses for January to September 1999 compared to the corresponding period the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 9 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1957, Bord Fáilte is empowered to publish or cause to be published lists of tourism accommodation premises, including bed and breakfast operations which are not registered and are <Col N="1222" /> therefore not protected titles under the Tourist Traffic Acts. Consequently the system by which bed and breakfast accommodation is listed is a voluntary one and operators who do not wish to be listed by Bord Fáilte are not prohibited from carrying on their business. However, statutory requirements in areas such as taxation, planning, fire and safety and hygiene, apply to providers of tourist accommodation, whether listed or unlisted. At present, there are some 4,300 operations which are listed in accordance with the criteria set by Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>Operators, who are listed, experience a number of advantages such as access to official marketing through Bord Fáilte, the Gulliver reservations service and the tourist information office network. They may also participate at trade and consumer fairs, in advertising, in off-season promotions with tour operators, in trade education programmes, direct mail campaigns and publicity etc.</P>
    <P>I launched a new initiative during 1999 which was targeted primarily at the small listed accommodation provider under which Bord Fáilte is reviewing the branding and overseas marketing of the various groups in this category.</P>
    <P>Progress has already been achieved with trade and consumer market research being undertaken, and the development of a draft marketing plan. The plan highlighted those markets with the potential to best help achieve the objectives of increasing business overall, growth in off-peak business and a better performance in rural areas.</P>
    <P>A series of workshops was launched in November last to provide a forum in which bed and breakfast operators could focus on the need for them to play a more active role in promoting their own premises and their sector. These workshops are set to continue until at least April of this year. In addition, marketing seminars are being run to provide the industry associations with assistance and advice on more advanced marketing issues.</P>
    <P>I am confident that this initiative will considerably expand the range of assistance and advice offered to the sector, thereby making listing a more attractive proposition. Resources totalling £300,000 were set aside by Bord Fáilte to support this initiative in 1999, with a further £500,000 being allocated this year to consolidate the initiative and further expand it to other small accommodation providers.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, Bord Fáilte recently published new criteria for the bed and breakfast sector. The revised criteria were agreed with the main representative bodies of the sector, which are hopeful that the new criteria will encourage more operators to opt for listing.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for introducing changes in the rating system lies with my colleagues, the Ministers for Finance and the Environment and Local Government.</P>

      <P>My Department has received a copy of the report referred to by the Deputy, a socio-economic profile of Athy, County Kildare. I was asked to consider what action might be taken by my Department in relation to one of the key issues identified in the report, namely, the need for diversification of economic activity. The authors indicated that the targeting of tourism and sports related activities was envisaged in this regard. The report was examined by officials at my Department and a comprehensive response issued to its authors, the Athy investment, development and employment forum.</P>
      <P>This response referred to the range of funding and support schemes available, or which will become available this year, for both sports and tourism development throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I should point out, however, that any such development, in any part of the country, to be successful, must be led by and in partnership with local community and business interests.</P>
      <P>Under the sports capital programme, national lottery funding will be available to voluntary and community organisations to construct, refurbish, improve and equip high quality, well-designed and sustainable sports and recreational facilities. It is the primary vehicle for promoting the development of sports and recreational facilities. A copy of the application form for this programme was supplied to the forum.</P>
      <P>Additionally, the recently published national development plan has, as a core objective, the fostering of balanced regional development. This has a particular relevance to tourism, which will receive, through my Department's Vote, in excess of £350 million for tourism marketing, product development and training over the next seven years.</P>
      <P>The strategy for tourism product development under the plan will be based on the needs of areas, having regard to whether they are developed, developing or undeveloped.</P>
      <P>While details of the products eligible for support will not be available until the regional operational programmes are published, I have advised the forum that it should remain in contact with the regional tourism manager who will keep them informed about proposals for funding of tourism product development under the plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that problems have arisen in relation to situations of the kind raised by the Deputy. In the past, responsibility for the assessment of national school children rested with the health boards or with voluntary organisations under their aegis. Whilst real progress is being made in the recruitment of additional psychologists for the national educational psychological service, NEPS, agency, the agency will not be up to its full projected strength until the end of its five year development phase. This has led to a <Col N="1225" /> lacuna in the provision of assessments in some areas of the country.</P>
      <P>I am committed to the development of a quality educational psychological service that will adequately meet the needs of our children and young people. It is essential, therefore, that the expansion of NEPS should proceed in a phased and orderly way in order to allow time for newly appointed psychologists to have an adequate induction period before being assigned to their areas.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the year, therefore, my predecessor wrote to the then Minister for Health and Children, drawing his attention to the situation, and asking him to request the health boards to attempt to continue providing an assessment service during the development phase of NEPS. He readily agreed to do this and I know that he has written to the health boards about the matter.</P>
      <P>A management committee oversees the overall development of NEPS. This consists of officials from my Department, the Department of Health and Children and of the health boards. The management committee has also identified the issue raised by the Deputy as one that requires an early solution and is anxious to ensure that schools should be kept informed of the progress being made by NEPS as the service develops and will advise its officers accordingly. In addition, the committee is developing an action plan for co-ordination of the educational and clinical psychological services. The production of national guidelines will be followed by local discussions so that satisfactory arrangements for the provision of assessments can be made in each area.</P>

      <P>All second level schools in County <Col N="1230" /> Donegal have access to the national educational psychological service, NEPS, established by my Department last year. The management committee of NEPS is preparing a development plan for the phased expansion of the service to all schools. The priorities for expansion will be agreed by the management committee in consultation with local interests, including other providers of psychological services. Relevant data about each county, including County Donegal, is being collected by NEPS and this will be supplemented by local discussion.</P>
      <P>I am committed to the development of a quality educational psychological service that will adequately meet the needs of our children and young people. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission is currently in the process of recruiting additional psychologists for the national educational psychological service agency. The process is well advanced and my Department hopes to be in a position to make offers of appointment in the near future.</P>

      <P>The closing date for receipt of applications for the post-graduate course for primary teaching which is due to commence in February 2000 was extended by over two weeks. The decision to extend the closing date was made on the basis that, due to the intervention of the Christmas holiday period, all interested applicants may not have had an opportunity to apply for the course by the original closing date. The extension of the closing date was widely advertised.</P>
      <P>The information which my Department has received from the colleges of education is that just over 600 applicants were interviewed following the initial closing date. A total of approximately 160 additional applications have been received following the extended closing date.</P>
