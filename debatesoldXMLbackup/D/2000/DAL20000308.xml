      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with two different topics. I propose to deal with the two topics separately and I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notice to my office. In regard to the first topic, I received notice from Deputy Yates and I call on him to state the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to raise the urgent matters relating to the reason the Minister for Public Enterprise did not implement a Government decision to reappoint two executives of CIE as board directors by not writing to them and the former chairman, notifying them of their appointment since the Government decision at the Cabinet meeting in Cork; and if the Minister will make a personal statement explaining the disparity between her account in the Dáil yesterday and that of the former chairman as to when he submitted notification of his resignation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business shall be as follows: No. <i>a</i>15, Finance Bill, 2000, financial resolution; No. 40, Finance Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for <Col N="3" /> Report and Report and Final Stages. It is proposed that, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. and business shall be interrupted not later than 10.30 p.m.; No. <i>a</i>15 to be decided without debate; Report and Final Stages of No. 40 to be taken today, with the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, to be brought to a conclusion at 1 p.m. tomorrow by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Finance; and the Dáil, on its rising tomorrow, shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 21 March 2000. Private Members' Business shall be No. 61, Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) (Amendment) Bill, 1999 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed), to conclude at 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>There are four proposals to be put to the House. Is the proposal for the late sitting agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Before agreeing to that, this is International Women's Day, which celebrates the work women have done in Ireland, paid and unpaid, and it is regrettable, now that we have a woman Tánaiste, she is not in the House to take the Order of Business as is her responsibility, even though I understand she is in town. I am sorry she is not here and I wonder if the Minister can give an indication why the Tánaiste, who's responsibility it is to act for the Taoiseach in his absence, is not here this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>The leader of the Opposition is aware that the Taoiseach is out of the country and I understand that the Tánaiste will be departing today on a trade mission. The Deputy can be quite certain she will be looking after the nation's business on International Women's Day, which is an achievement for women in any event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>She is in town. There is always a concern about things being announced outside the House and the House not being treated with the respect it deserves. While I am very happy that Deputy Woods is here, and he does his job very well, he is not the Tánaiste, who is in Dublin and is acting on behalf of the Taoiseach. She has a responsibility to be here. I understand she had a press launch this morning which she said she arranged in terms of time to allow her to be here, but she is not present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation has been promised relating to administrative procedures. Will the Minister, who is acting for the Tánaiste, indicate <Col N="4" /> what happened the administrative procedures in terms of conveying the decision of the Government of 22 December to appoint members of the board of CIE, given that two and a half months later that decision had not been implemented or communicated to the people concerned? Where was the fall-down in the administrative procedures, or was this a deliberate political snub to the individuals concerned in the hope they would be embarrassed in terms of their board colleagues through their board appointment not being made known to them, with their status thereby being diminished?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, you ruled out of order the matter I raised under Standing Order 31. However, is it acceptable that Government decisions are not implemented by a line Minister as a result of childish and churlish breakdown of <Col N="5" /> relations between the chief executive of CIE and the Government? Government decisions should be implemented by line Ministers and not be subjected to petty and churlish petulance.</P>

      <P>Yesterday on the Order of the Business, I sought clarity from the Government in regard to two Bills &ndash; the immigration and residence Bill and the work permits Bill, which are to give effect to the Tánaiste's promise to provide permits to skilled workers. Last night I received a reply to a parliamentary question I tabled in regard to this matter. An asylum seeker in my constituency has been in Ireland for two years and is a trained carpenter.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 1 is in the names of Deputies McDowell, Noonan and Deenihan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>2.&ndash;Where a claimant proves for a year of assessment that income received by him or her consisted of dividends paid by a credit union within the meaning of the Credit Union Act, 1997, of an amount not greater than £750, the first £375 of such income shall be disregarded for the purposes of calculating his or her liability to income tax for that year of assessment.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with the taxation of credit <Col N="11" /> union dividends and savings. The Minister will know that, in effect, it is only partially amended in so far as the other amendments the Opposition sought to table were out of order.</P>
    <P>The amendment looks to introduce the regime which was the result of a working party report, now over a year old. We advanced this debate considerably during the course of the Finance Bill deliberations, not least by virtue of the Minister's comments on Committee Stage. I will examine those in a few moments but it is worth mentioning some of the cogent reasons for giving special status to credit unions and to the taxation of credit union savings. First and foremost, a dividend paid on a credit union share is not the same as a dividend paid on any other type of share because a share in a credit union is not the same as any other type of share. It is of fixed value; it does not go up or down according to the market. It does not allow for the possibility that somebody will make a profit on accumulating a significant number of shares over a period of time and dispose of them. A credit union is simply a different type of lending institution, a different type of company. It is largely staffed by volunteers, it is not for profit and it lends to a different type of person, perhaps not as different as it would have been ten or 15 years ago but still distinctively different from the lending profile of other financial institutions. As we know, the amount that can be lent or saved is capped by statute. There are cogent reasons, which this House has explored on a number of occasions, for treating credit unions and credit union savings in a distinctively different way from the savings in other financial institutions.</P>
    <P>The Minister advanced the argument somewhat during the course of Committee Stage and I want to focus on that. The Minister made it crystal clear that what he has been saying for the past 15 months or so is simply not true because he has told the House on countless occasions that he is considering the working group report. It is clear from his comments on Committee Stage that he is not considering the report of the working group but has rejected its proposals. Over the course of a half hour discussion on Committee Stage he presented a cogent argument against the proposals. For example, he said at one stage that if an exemption of £375 to £750 applied to a sum of £7,500 and £10,000 in each account, it would be a recipe for encouraging people to evade tax. He said we should have learned from what took place in the recent past and went on to say that if one is against tax evasion, one should not include in legislation provisions which would encourage this practice.</P>
    <P>When he made those comments the Minister was specifically addressing the primary recommendation of the working group report, namely, that the first £375 worth of dividends should be exempted from tax. It is clear, therefore, that the Minister, far from considering this, is actually describing the recommendations of the working <Col N="12" /> group as a recipe for tax evasion. He explicitly said that during the debate on Committee Stage. Two consequences clearly flow from that. We need to examine what happened during this famous meeting or non-meeting a few weeks ago between the Taoiseach and the representatives of the Irish League of Credit Unions because a fairly anodyne statement &ndash; the Minister would describe it as a balanced statement &ndash; was issued afterwards. It has become clear since Committee Stage that that statement was nothing more than weasel words.</P>
    <P>The second consequence is that the position of the Independents in this House is now very stark. They know the Minister's attitude. They know that nothing will be done on foot of the working group report for as long as this Minister remains Minister for Finance. I put it to those Members that they have a straightforward choice &ndash; either they keep their word given to the Irish League of Credit Unions to support the credit unions in attempting to get a change in the regime for taxation of dividends, or they do not. In fairness to him, Deputy Healy-Rae was led into a trap by a mechanism which he did not seem to appreciate entirely at the time, but the Deputy voted against this amendment on Committee Stage. He and his colleagues on the Independent benches will have a little more warning this time. They will know that if they vote against this amendment in half an hour's time or less, they do so in the clear knowledge that they are explicitly rejecting what the Irish League of Credit Unions has asked them to do. I ask them to think seriously about that.</P>
    <P>The amendment is in keeping with the report of the working group issued over a year ago and I ask the House to support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>We dealt with this matter in great detail on Committee Stage and, prior to that, we debated a Private Members' motion in the House but the information given by the Minister on Committee Stage has changed the debate somewhat. It is clear now that the Minister has no intention of implementing the recommendation made by the chairman of the working group that examined the taxation of credit unions. The furthest he will go is back to the position which was rejected previously when the 1998 Finance Bill was published. That was, as the House will recall, a proposal by the Minister to apply DIRT to credit unions without any exemptions for small deposits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is at variance with the public position taken by the Taoiseach at the recent meeting with the credit unions. The press statement which issued arising from that meeting indicated that this was still an open question, that the situation was being examined, that there were European considerations to be taken into account and that there were legal implications which the Attorney General was examining but that the policy position was still open and that, if anything, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste were tending towards the implementation of the report of the working <Col N="13" /> group chairman if they could get over difficulties in Europe and certain legal difficulties which might arise.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance's position is totally at variance with that. He does not have an open mind on this issue. He has taken up a strong anti-credit union position and a strong pro-bank and pro-building society position. He has, effectively, slammed the door on the credit union movement both literally and metaphorically.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that this amendment be pressed to a vote. I do not know what level of knowledge the four Independent Deputies who support the Government had when they voted against the Private Members' motion. Maybe they thought that simply to arrange a meeting with the credit union movement was the primary issue but, of course, it was not. The primary issue is that the Government should introduce a fair and equitable taxation system on interest on deposits and on dividends on shares in credit unions. That is the issue and this amendment takes the key proposal from the report of the chairman of the working group and puts it to everybody in the House to state their position.</P>
    <P>It is very disturbing that the Government is speaking with a number of voices on this issue. The Tánaiste's position is different from that of the rest of the Government and the Taoiseach's position is a fudged one where there is a pretence that he favours the credit union position, while his Minister for Finance is laying down the law in very categorical terms by saying there will be no change in the law along the lines proposed. The saga is very disappointing. It is a great pity when personal considerations are allowed to enter public debate. The bad feeling between the Minister for Finance and the credit union movement continues to fester. That is a very bad situation. A public policy should not be conducted in that fashion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a growing swell of frustration among the 536 or so credit unions. They are confused as to what the Government's position is following the meeting with the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste. The Minister might clarify that further.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated clearly on Committee Stage that he has to wait for the EU ruling before he can proceed any further on this question of credit union taxation. The word coming from the credit unions is that DG4 is positively disposed towards them and the philosophy behind them. Rather than discouraging credit unions across Europe, it is encouraging them. It would appear the UK Government has been actively promoting credit unions for that past two years, in particular. It is putting in place a number of supportive measures for its credit unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only a week since we discussed this matter on Committee Stage. Will the Minister advise the Dáil if there has been any contact with DG4 since as we may not get an opportunity again to discuss the issue of European policy on credit unions? <Col N="14" /> Will he confirm that the IMSA, for example, has responded to DG4 and that The Irish Bankers' Federation has raised further questions with it? These are important questions which need to be answered before we press this amendment to a vote.</P>
    <P>I appreciate Europe is taking more of an interest in our tax incentive measures but it has a different approach in the case of credit unions. One cannot lump credit union taxation in with seaside renewal schemes and other tax incentive schemes. When the Minister responded to the questions raised on Committee Stage, he was inclined to do that. He more or less said that the Commission is taking more notice of the various tax incentive schemes, whether in urban, rural or seaside areas, and he equated that with the interest it is showing in credit unions.</P>
    <P>I would say the interest in credit unions has come more from the complaints made rather than from EU policy. Judging from statements emanating from John Hume and others, it would seem DG4 is very much disposed towards credit unions. Will the Minister bring us up to date on his contact with Europe and the response from DG4 and explain its present position? Has any progress been made since last week? </P>

      <P>Deputy McDowell's amendment proposes to exempt from income tax the first £375 of dividend income on credit union shares where the total of such income is less than £750 in any year. In February 1998, I established a working group, chaired by Mr. Terence Larkin, to examine specifically the taxation of returns on credit union savings. After six meetings of the working group, it was not possible for the members to reach consensus. In the absence of an agreed position, the chairman made a number of recommendations, namely, that credit union surpluses should continue to be exempt from corporation tax, that 20% DIRT should apply to interest on all credit union deposits, that 20% DIRT should apply to all dividends from shares, except where the dividend in any year is £750 or less and, in such cases, only the first £375 would be exempt, and that there should be no reporting to Revenue of interest or dividends on credit union savings. Two of the group members did not support these recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are important issues to be decided arising out of this report, including issues of tax equity and Exchequer cost, particularly if any tax <Col N="15" /> relief given to credit union savers has to be extended to savers in other financial institutions. Deputies will also be aware that there is a very important EU dimension arising from complaints made to Brussels by the Irish Mortgage and Savings Association. The Irish Bankers' Federation also has a complaint with the Commission which I understand relates to the position of credit unions in respect of consumer credit legislation.</P>
    <P>On Thursday of the week before last, the Irish League of Credit Unions accepted the Government's position that complaints on taxation made to the European Commission must be resolved before any further moves are made in regard to the taxation of credit union savings income. Any change in the law at this point could aggravate the situation in regard to the investigation by the European Commission.</P>
    <P>The matter has been referred to the Attorney General for an opinion. The recommendations will be further examined in the light of whatever decision the EU Commission takes in relation to the complaints about existing tax law. I should emphasise that the Commission is not dealing with the current proposals of the Irish League of Credit Unions but rather with the treatment of credit unions under the existing law. It would not be unreasonable to assume that further concessions to the credit union movement would trigger complaints which would also have to be dealt with. For these reasons I cannot accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>We dealt with this matter at considerable length on Committee Stage. I dealt with a number of factors there which, although highlighted by me in previous contributions, have not been given as much attention as they should. I highlighted them in various replies to parliamentary questions and during a recent debate on a Private Members' motion.</P>
    <P>I wish to outline the position on proposals related to credit unions in the 1998 Finance Bill as initiated. Prior to meeting the Irish League of Credit Unions at its request in December 1997, I had no intention good, bad or indifferent of making any proposals related to credit unions, but having met representatives of the credit unions they requested that consideration be given to their proposals. When the Finance Bill, 1998, was published on 12 February 1998, I thought I had met their concerns, but immediately thereafter there was outcry against the various proposals and I withdrew them. The current position with regard to credit unions could not be more favourable. Deposit interest is not liable to DIRT, they do not have an obligation regarding the reportage of interest or dividends and they continue to be exempt from corporation tax.</P>
    <P>The proposals put forward by me in the 1998 Finance Bill, as initiated, included a proposal that deposit interest be liable to DIRT, which the credit unions had sought in the first instance, although the hue and cry immediately after the publication of the Finance Bill and in the media <Col N="16" /> the next day was that I intended to impose DIRT on depositors' interest and that I was attacking people with small savings, and various members of credit unions rose up in arms against that together with their political representatives and the media. The Irish League of Credit Unions had little time to point out that it had sought the imposition of DIRT on interest on deposit in credit union accounts. It was not my idea to impose it in the first place. Now the Irish League of Credit Unions is again seeking the imposition of DIRT on deposit interest and other considerations regarding dividends. The 1998 Finance Bill published in February 1998 continued the corporation tax exemption in respect of credit unions. I gave them what they wanted regarding DIRT on deposit interest, which caused all the hullabaloo afterwards. I said there could be reportage of dividends and interest. Up to that time, reportage of dividends was available to me, but I said there could be straight reportage of dividends.</P>
    <P>What the Irish League of Credit Unions wants and what the chairman of the working group put forward is these exemptions, which are encapsulated in the amendments tabled by Deputies McDowell, Noonan and Deenihan. In replying to various parliamentary questions on this matter, I referred to the EU aspect. That was before the recent complaint by the Irish Mortgage and Savings Association and the more recent complaint by The Irish Bankers' Federation in regard to the consumer directive. In the replies I gave I pointed out that a previous complaint was made to the European Commission on the existing position on the taxation of credit unions that pertains in Irish law.</P>
    <P>Our understanding of the EU decision in saying it is in order at present was that credit unions were exempt from corporation taxation. The complaint was that the corporation taxation exemption was illegal as it was contrary to EU rules. However, it ruled that it was in order to continue the current regime which gave corporation taxation exemption on surplus income because the flow of income out was fully taxable in the hands of the recipients. However, our understanding has always been, and it was pointed out in replies to parliamentary questions, that to have an exemption at both ends &ndash; that there would be no corporation tax on the surplus income of a credit union and at the same time create a category of exemption which would take out of the net 98 % of all depositors in credit unions &ndash; would run foul of the EU decision. That is what is being asked for by the Irish League of Credit Unions, to continue the corporation taxation exemption and at the same time create a category of exemption for credit union dividends that would effectively remove most depositors. A new complaint has now been made by the Irish Mortgage and Savings Association and this must be considered by the EU Commission, but it will consider the existing situation before we make any changes.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell is a reasonable person most <Col N="17" /> of the time, politics notwithstanding, but perhaps politics makes us all let on to be unreasonable and not face up to the facts for various political purposes. It would not be unreasonable to suggest that if the current situation triggered these complaints, adding to them will trigger further complaints and they will also run foul of EU rules. I emphasise that what has been decided upon by the EU Commission is the current position. If we were to add to that, that would also have to be put before the EU Commission. The current complaint is from the Irish Mortgage and Savings Association.</P>
    <P>When representatives of the Irish League of Credit Unions came to meet the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste a few weeks ago, it was pointed out to them that a further complaint had been received by the Commission from The Irish Bankers' Federation on a separate directive, the consumer directive. We heard recently that another complaint may be made to the Commission on the bankers directive. There are a number of complaints before the EU Commission.</P>
    <P>Representatives of the Irish League of Credit Unions at their meeting with the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste accepted that the EU dimension must be disposed of before any further matters can be considered. It was made clear in the statement by the spokesperson on behalf of the Irish League of Credit Unions following that meeting that it accepted that position. Furthermore, the statement by the Government following that meeting pointed out the Commission aspect in fairly great detail. That Government statement of 24 February indicated the Taoiseach had confirmed to me that the recommendations of the working group on the taxation of the returns on credit union savings would be further examined in light of whatever decision the EU Commission takes in the matter. It also pointed out that there are general equity aspects which would have to be considered at that stage, as well as the need to ensure the integrity of the tax system.</P>
    <P>I referred in some detail on Committee Stage to the difficulties multiple accounts have caused in the Irish taxation system in the past number of years. If anyone has any doubt about the difficulties caused by multiple accounts and tax evasion, they should check the report of the Committee of Public Accounts, which referred to this matter in some detail.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a matter with which Deputy McDowell may be conversant. It is one with which I am conversant given that I am a little older than he is and longer in a profession dealing with taxation. I will outline what happened regarding multiple accounts in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s before there was ever an inquiry by the Committee of Public Accounts. When an investigation is carried out into the affairs of a taxpayer who is found to be evading his or her tax, it is referred to in the trade as back duty investigation. In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s approximately 75% of back duty investigations resulted from the discovery of a deposit account which had not been <Col N="18" /> returned by a taxpayer. I do not have information from the Revenue in that regard but if one were to check the record I am sure that in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, the majority of back duty investigations arose initially from the Revenue discovering the existence of an account of deposit interest. I will outline how that arose. Up to the mid 1980s &ndash; my officials could quote the specific Finance Act &ndash; the first £70 of interest earned in a financial institution was not reported. It was actually tax free. Therefore, if it exceeded £70 a list of names was sent to a certain section of the Revenue Commissioners in Dublin. Sometimes taxpayers put about £500 in a multiplicity of accounts all over the country. They did not drive to all the bank branches, it was done for them. Let us put it no further than that. The interest was always kept below a certain amount so it would not exceed the £70 figure and the underlying £600, £700 or £1,000 of interest never came to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners. One could have £50,000, £60,000, £70,000, £80,000 or £90,000 spread all over the country in these accounts. One such case came to light recently when some taxpayer sued a bank for bad advice &ndash; not having advised him to avail of the tax amnesty. The case was heard in court and a decision was made on it.</P>
    <P>Sometimes the interest inadvertently slipped above the £70 figure and was returned on a list to the central headquarters of the Revenue Commissioners in Dublin. Lo and behold, the individual taxpayer would then receive a letter asking about a particular account. That often initiated a back duty investigation during the course of which most taxpayers would own up to the multiplicity of their accounts, even though perhaps only one account of 60 or 70 fell foul of the £70 interest limit.</P>
    <P>In one famous February budget, the Minister for Finance announced that the £70 interest limit was being reduced to £50. When 5 April came it meant that before people could move all these accounts again, or have them moved on their behalf, the interest had exceeded £50. A plethora of accounts came to light as a result. That has been my experience of having tax exemptions. This matter was also dealt with by the Committee of Public Accounts, although not in the same detail as I am providing for the House. As a tax practitioner who has dealt with many back duty investigations &ndash; and I am speaking for many people in my profession &ndash; I can tell Deputies that is what the £70 and £50 limits lead to.</P>
    <P>The Irish League of Credit Unions is advocating that the first £375 would be tax exempt. Taking a rate of 5% or 6%, that implies that a person could have up to £7,500. It is an open invitation to people to put their money in savings which will not come to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners. Let us be quite straight about this and let us stop fooling ourselves. The credit unions want to gain a competitive advantage over other financial institutions so that they would be the one group to be able to say, &ldquo;The first £375 here <Col N="19" /> will be tax exempt&rdquo;. Let us be dead honest about it. Even the credit union surveys show that people deposit their money in credit unions for more or less the same reasons that they deposit it in all other financial institutions, to get the best return. I can assure Deputies that the common bond is way down the list. If Deputies McDowell, Deenihan and Noonan do not know, I am telling them that if that occurs the credit unions will get a competitive advantage because people will automatically put their money there to get this tax exemption. We will be inviting people to evade tax. That is what will happen. It is a fact.</P>
    <P>That is what was referred to by the Taoiseach in his statement last week when he pointed out that there were general equity aspects which will have to be considered &ndash; that means all financial institutions &ndash; as well as ensuring the integrity of the tax system.</P>
    <P>Let me say something else, since we are being open and frank with each other this morning. I have never ceased to be amazed by the hypocrisy of the Irish political system over a long period of time, and the hypocrisy of politicians of all parties. I always put it down to the multi-seat constituency system of proportional representation. Since 1983, I have written much about the abolition of multi-seat constituencies which, I think, led to the worst of all possible worlds.</P>

      <P>It makes me laugh to see the hypocrisy of Deputies who speak in the House about the common bond and who play to their constituents back home for political gain while, at the same time, advocating what they know to be a system of tax evasion.</P>
      <P>Deputies pride themselves on knowing what their constituents want and journalists pride themselves on knowing what is going on. However, in one tiny town there were 14,200 bogus non-resident accounts, yet nobody seemed to know about them. I just do not believe it. Those accounts represent mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, aunts and uncles of actual, real, live people who attend TDs clinics and vote. They may have been brothers, sisters, uncles and aunts of public representatives as well, but nobody seemed to know anything about them.</P>
      <P>Nobody now wants to recognise the inevitability that what we are advocating here is a system of tax evasion. I do not mind Fine Gael because they are a bit like ourselves and move around the different stages. But the paragons of virtue who sit on the left wing of Leinster House and who preach from the high moral ground all the time, are in here advocating what they know is a system of tax evasion. It makes me want to do something which would not be appropriate on the floor of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I will need it. Listening to the Minister one would think that we already had a perfect system of taxing credit union dividends and deposits which gave a realistic take to the Revenue. The reality is that we do not. At the moment most people who earn dividends on credit union savings do not pay tax, simply because in many cases they do not know that tax is payable or because they are not geared to making tax returns. We are not dealing with a perfect situation. The Minister has not given me any information about the current take, but I would happily bet that if we were to introduce a scheme along the lines we are discussing we would probably increase the take from tax rather than reducing it.</P>
      <P>There is a central problem in what the Minister is saying and in what we have heard over the last few weeks. He used a crucial phrase, stating that what Members of the House and the Irish League of Credit Unions are arguing for is &ldquo;what they know to be a system of tax evasion&rdquo;. Is the Minister telling us that the Taoiseach sat down for over an hour a week ago to talk to the Irish League of Credit Unions about what he knows to be a system of tax evasion? If he does, he should say so clearly and explicitly. He should tell the Independent Deputies that they have been arguing for a system of tax evasion. He should tell the League of Credit Unions that he does not have the remotest intention of doing this. If he did so, we would have had a far more honest debate before now.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy McDowell. The Minister's entire speech is based on the premise that the system of taxation of credit unions, which he personally designed, is perfect. In fact, every person who lives in that real world the Minister reminded us of &ndash; where we all know what our aunts, uncles, brothers and sisters are doing &ndash; knows that very few people actually pay tax on their credit union dividends.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister designed a system in 1998 where there was no reporting. There is no cross-checking. Uniquely, there is a liability on credit union depositors to pay the marginal rate of tax, which in many cases is 46%. Everyone else pays at 24% or 20% if they have money elsewhere and that is unfair. The Minister matched that to a no reporting system, when he knows that the present system is a blueprint for tax evasion. One would think the Minister would have learnt something from the Committee of Public Accounts inquiry into DIRT. I foresee a situation where Deputies will be here saying: &ldquo;Why did nobody know this was going on throughout the late 1990s? Why did they not know that the tax obligations on depositors in credit unions was more honoured in the breach than in the observance? Why did they close their eyes to it? Why did the Minister of Finance pretend in the Dáil that something was happening which was perfect and that change would make it worse?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What exactly has been referred to the Attorney General? The Minister said a matter was referred to the Attorney General but on what exact point is he adjudicating? At some stage could the Minister tell us what procedures the Revenue has in place examining the 58 institutions which may owe DIRT? I understand random samples of accounts are being taken and that there is an attempt to assess full liability. What will happen then? Is it the intention to settle or to penalise and bring offenders to court?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan asked about the matter referred to the Attorney General. I will not read out the letter that was sent to the Attorney General but I can give the general thrust of it. We asked the Attorney General if there was an arguable legal case for the IMSA complaint under the treaty, what the procedure was in intervening with the Commission on processing that complaint, whether procedurally or in equity the Government could intervene in this case on either side, about the proposals in the report of the working group on taxation of credit <Col N="22" /> union members &ndash; having notified the Commission for pre-clearance, although they have no official standing &ndash; and if the exemption of credit union members on income tax dividends would prejudice the existing exemption of credit unions from corporation tax under EU rules. We also sent various documents to the Attorney General. I understand it is not appropriate to read back what was said by the Attorney General, but those are some of the specific questions.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan also asked about the Revenue Commissioners audit. There was an amendment on Committee Stage &ndash; I do not know if it is repeated &ndash; but the present position is that Revenue is investigating the 37 financial institutions. Revenue is in all of them at this stage and hopes to finish this phase by June or July with a view to reporting to the Committee of Public Accounts by autumn.</P>

      <P>We have had a useful discussion and I hope the Independent Deputies listened carefully to what the Minister will ask them to endorse. The Minister accused us and his own backbenchers of looking to give a favourable taxation regime to credit unions which, we ought to know, is akin to tax evasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the kernel of the argument. We are looking to give a competitive advantage to credit unions and if the working group report was implemented, they would be in a better position than other lending institutions. That is the point of the exercise and is based on a number of premises which, it seems clear, the Minister does not <Col N="23" /> accept. I will not go over them again, but they relate to the non-profit, voluntary nature of the credit unions. The Minister has gone further this morning in damaging the central case of the credit unions in claiming they are a different type of institution. If I were a member of any credit union, not only would I have no hope at all that the Minister intends to move on the working group report and the credit union campaign of the last year, but I would be very worried about <Col N="24" /> having my case in Europe defended by the Minister and the officials who take his direction.</P>
    <P>We have laboured long and hard on this point. I hope the Independent Deputies are listening, as the Minister is asking them to endorse a case fundamentally opposed to what most of them have been telling us they believe for the last three or four months.</P>

      <P>Over the last two Finance Bills the Minister has increased the exemption limits for persons over 65 years quite substantially. In his budget announcement he has increased the tax free maximum income to £15,000 for a couple, one of whom is over 65. The amendment in my name and that of Deputy Deenihan would increase this by a further £1,000 for a couple and a further £500 for a single person.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister outline the arrangements in place for marginal relief when persons exceed these limits? Has he any proposals to change the 40% rate of marginal relief. Since his general policy envisages reducing the standard rate of tax and the higher rate of tax, does he intend to reduce the 40% rate which applies when persons exceed these limits on the clawback provisions?</P>

      <P>The Bill as it stands proposes to increase the age exemption limits, that is, for a person aged 65 or over by £2,000 from £13,000 to £15,000 for a married couple and by £1,000 from £6,500 to £7,500 for single persons. The amendments in the names of Deputies Noonan and Deenihan seek an additional increase for a single person of £500 to £8,000 and £1,000 for a married couple to £16,000. The cost of this is estimated to cost £1.3 million in a full year on top of the £8.5 million for the change I am making. As mentioned on the Committee Stage debate on this amendment, the increase in the age exemption limits already provided for in the Bill represents a substantial increase of 15% on the current exemption limits and will remove approximately 10,000 elderly persons from the tax net. These increases are in keeping with this Government's commitment to reduce the tax burden on the elderly. Taking into account the increase I proposed this year I will have increased the exemption limits for the elderly by up to two-thirds, a very significant increase by any standard over the past three budgets. While one would like to do more, everything else being equal, I am satisfied the increases proposed in this Bill are equitable, fair and just in the circumstances. However, in accordance with the commitment in Partnership 2000 and reiterated in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness I will keep the income tax allowances and the exemptions for those aged 65 years and over under continual review with a view to further assisting the position of age. In the circumstances I must reject the amendment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan asked a further question about marginal relief. Marginal relief which is at the rate of 40% applies to those who are just above the exemption limits. Given that tax rates have been reduced he asked if I would be review it. I will review it in light of the circumstances prevailing. On account of the way the allowances and the tax credits have been increased in recent years the number of people now hit by marginal relief is much smaller than it was, say, three years ago. I can get the figures for the Deputy later. From the recesses of my memory around budget time, the figures have continued to decrease as a result of increasing the personal allowances and tax credits. Since I moved to the tax credit system last year the number of people on marginal relief has consistently reduced. It is the stated intention of various reports that the numbers on marginal relief will decrease. Marginal relief affects people who are just above the exemption limits and it is something they should try to get out of. As the allowances increase we should be able to get out of it. It will still apply to the exemption limits for the aged. I will review the position regarding marginal relief in future budgets. I shall get the figures for marginal relief and those for three years ago. Unless my mind has gone totally askew, they are much less than heretofore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that this is an argument we hope will be redundant in a few years' time. If we go the tax credit route and if the Minister makes good on his undertaking given on Committee Stage and repeated in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the minimum wage, £10,000 per annum, will be taken out of the income tax net within two or three <Col N="27" /> years. That will cover the current exemption limits and any likely increase in exemption limits. We should be able to move away from the whole notion of exemption limits, separate from the tax credits system, and should be able to do away with marginal relief as a principle and in practice. Whether we need to recognise the position of older people on top of that becomes a central policy question. My view is that we need to recognise income which older people derive from small occupational pensions. It is difficult for people to understand if they have a pension of, say, £5,000 per year, that as and when any additional pension they might have by way of PRSI contributions is increased, the income tax clawback from their occupational pension also increases. In dealing with the taxation of older people there is a case for looking specifically at pension income with an exemption limit.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed the Minister did not accept our original amendment on Committee Stage. Had he done so, he would have made it clear to elderly people that we are sensitive to their needs. However, I accept that improvements have been made.</P>
      <P>I am familiar with a number of former council employees who receive an occupational pension from Kerry County Council as well as an old age pension and are taxed at the higher rate. The Minister has promised to keep this matter under review. It is important that we target tax concessions at the lower paid and the elderly. These two groups of people are vulnerable in many ways. The elderly have more medical expenses and often must pay to have maintenance work done on their houses, and so on. The argument for this amendment was made on Committee Stage. I ask the Minister to consider this question before next year's budget, which will be drawn up in only six or seven months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 12, to delete lines 27 to 48, and in page 13, to delete lines 1 to 9.</P>
      <P>The most controversial item in the budget was the announcement of the individualisation of tax bands. While very little justification for this was provided in the Budget Statement, the Minister argued his case subsequently at length. According to the Minister, the decision to individualise rested on considerations of equity and fairness. People who work were paying an undue amount of tax, particularly at the higher rate, and the Minister proposed that they should be allowed to retain a higher proportion of their earnings because tax was onerous. He argued that in situations where the second spouse, usually the woman, re-entered the labour force she would pay tax at 46% on all her earnings. In general, I agree with the Minister's analysis of the position but not with his solution.</P>
      <P>A second series of arguments rested on the fact that the great prosperity the country now enjoys could be put at risk if we ran out of workers and that while there are a number of sources from which we could draw additional workers, one of the principal resources of western economies is to encourage additional women to participate in the labour force. As a labour force policy, the taxation regime which the Minister proposed on budget day was designed to do this.</P>
      <P>My party has no objection to encouraging people to participate in the labour force. However, we contest the Minister's proposition that if tax bands were not individualised the beneficial results I have outlined could not be achieved by any other method. Fine Gael published a tax policy in September last which would have provided a fairer and more equitable tax system. It would have achieved all the Minister's objectives, including the labour force objectives, without the trauma which the Minster's announcement caused throughout the country. Our policy would not have aroused the feelings of being hard done by in many households. I still receive submissions from families where one spouse works, saying that it is unfair that a couple who are both working would not go onto the higher rate of tax until their income exceeded £34,000, while a household in which one spouse is working would go onto the higher rate at £28,000.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the Minister's projection into the future would give rise to a position in two years' time, where the two income family would not pay the higher rate of tax until their total income exceeded £56,000 while a single income family would go onto the higher rate at £28,000. That is blindingly unfair. The Minister argued that this unfairness is necessary because of the need to give women an incentive to go out to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a better way of achieving the Minister's objectives. The Minister missed an oppor<Col N="29" /> tunity to deliver significant tax relief to everybody at work, regardless of marital status, although he had the resources to do this.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 includes a table of tax rates, with a proposal for a middle rate of tax of 33%. On Committee Stage the Minister said he was not opposed to this and that he would return to this issue when his immediate tax objectives had been achieved. I have argued for a long time, not only that people enter the higher rate of tax at too low a level of income, but that the jump of 22 points from the standard to the higher rate is too steep at the level of income at which it occurs. The main emphasis of this amendment is to show that if the Minister simply increased the range of the standard rate band to £17,000 for a single person and to £34,000 for a married couple, he would get the same benefit in terms of equity and of labour force participation by women. There was no need for the trauma which the Minister caused.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that this solution would be significantly more expensive than his. On Committee Stage he said it would cost £130 million more. However, by raising the single person's band to £17,000 and the married person's to £34,000 the Minister would have removed the inequities and eliminated the differentiation between one and two income families.</P>
    <P>Money does not grow on trees and any prudent Minister for Finance must take the cost of his measures into account. Immediately after the budget, the Minister argued that he would have liked to be as generous as Fine Gael proposed but that by doing it his way he had saved the Exchequer £130 million. However, a week later we witnessed spontaneous interviews by backbenchers who were lined up by an assistant in the Taoiseach's office to ensure they recited their words properly, and the Minister was undermined. In response to that initiative, at a meeting of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party the Minister brought forward a commitment included in his election literature to introduce a £3,000 allowance for stay at home spouses in caring positions. The principal problem with this allowance &ndash; it has many &ndash; is that it will cost £125 million. The Minister argued that he would do it his way rather than my way causing trauma within and between families because it was the most cost efficient way of doing it and that he would save £130 million in the process, but this was all given away again when he had to balance his proposals.</P>
    <P>The allowance was costed at £125 million before the Minister designed the full proposal under which the first £4,000 of earnings will be excluded from consideration. There will be marginal relief up to £5,000. While it can be argued that this will not give rise to an increase in cost from £125 million, it is also convenient that it was pegged at this sum, even though it was seriously amended after the announcement was made. It would be extremely embarrassing for the Minister if I was stating that the cost of his balancing measure was £140 million. At least the insistence <Col N="30" /> that the amended proposal should cost nothing extra saves his blushes.</P>
    <P>The net point is that the Minister had an opportunity to introduce serious tax reform in the budget but he introduced it in a way which divided the country, particularly women. His only justification was that it would have saved him £130 million but within a week he was forced into a position where he had to balance his proposals by spending £125 million of the £130 million he had hoped to save. This makes no sense and the Minister was stubborn in the extreme in browbeating the social partners into continuing with this insane proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain individuals in ICTU for different jurisdiction had different views on individualisation from what would be the norm down here but the Minister has got himself into an almighty twist for no good reason and I presume he has received submissions similar to the ones I have received about the unfairness of the £3,000 allowance. He complicated what was a very straightforward system when he had bags of money to give the tax relief that we all wanted and which would have achieved the desired labour force effects. His only justification was to save £130 million, of which he is giving £125 million away. This makes no sense. The Minister states that it will not cost any more than £130 million as there will not be a 100% uptake but if there is it will cost about £145 million to £150 million rather than the £125 million to which he is nailing his colours. This is an extremely bad day's work.</P>
      <P>I am trying to think of a parliamentary word to describe what the Minister has done; the words in my head are all unparliamentary. He embarked on a course of action that was unnecessary. He could have achieved all his policy objectives by extending the range of the single rate band and doubling it for married couples regardless of whether they both work. That would be a fairer way of doing it.</P>
      <P>As the Minister is in the mood to provide additional information, what are his intentions next year when he states he will widen the standard rate tax band to £23,500 for a single person and £47,000 for two persons at work which will be increased to £28,000 and £56,000 the following year and, if I understood him correctly on Committee Stage, in line with wages after that? He indicated shortly after his Budget Statement that phase 2 and phase 3 will not cost as much as phase 1.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed rates more or less resulted from the extensive discussion which took place last year on vehicle registration tax. The Minister justified the introduction of three rates by stating it would be penal to jump from a lower to a higher rate. He was, in effect, justifying the introduction of a middle rate. From this we extrapolated the concept of three rates of income tax. This makes much sense. I am sure the Minister will agree that the jump from 22% to 44% is severe and penal and creates a shock. We are therefore proposing the introduction of a middle rate of income tax of 33%.</P>
      <P>The amendment is skewed in favour of those on low and middle incomes who did not benefit from the budget to the same extent as the top 10% of taxpayers. The figures clearly show that the Minister's proposals favour the top 10% of taxpayers. What we are proposing would be much fairer and would not cause the same level of confusion by having too many tax rates.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan covered the amendment well and we await the Minister's response. Does he support the concept of three rates of income tax? Does he have anything against it? Would it be workable? Does he accept it would not create the same level of confusion? His reaction would be welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment and the sections to which it refers deal with the individualisation proposal on which I wish to concentrate. For the sake of clarity and debate I wish to comment briefly on what Deputies Deenihan and Noonan said about what is, in effect, the Fine Gael tax proposal which is primarily to introduce a middle rate of income tax of 33%. My difficulty with this proposal has to do with priorities. If we are seeking to stimulate a genuine debate on the issue of income taxation there is an onus on Opposition parties as well as on the Government to be upfront, not just about what we would like to do but also about what we see as being the priorities. I have sought to make it clear that we should target almost all resources at tax credits which exempt an increasing number of income earners from income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan said the proposal as set out in the amendment would benefit low and middle income earners. It would not. It would not impact on the 60% of people who currently pay at the standard rate of tax. It obviously would not benefit anybody who is exempt from tax altogether. It would exclude the top 5% or 7% and concentrate the primary benefit on the next 30% or so, in other words, middle income earners and in some cases the higher range of middle income earners. I understand why that is being proposed, but I <Col N="32" /> just do not see it as being the priority. There is another way in which those people as well as everybody else can benefit and that is what I have been arguing for. Before I open up another front with the Fine Gael Party, I appreciate that it has also made proposals on the exemption of the minimum wage and that would have a balancing effect.</P>
    <P>Over Christmas I read the autobiography of Mr. John Major, the former British Conservative Prime Minister, and I was interested to note that just before the 1997 general election in Britain he contemplated the possibility of reversing changes which had been made by predecessors so as &ldquo;to do something for the family&rdquo;, which I think was the phrase used. I suppose that really is the core issue here, whether two individuals who are married and who perhaps have children should get a particular tax break from the State. The Minister rightly points out that that tax break or favourable treatment is inherent in the current system and he seems to regard that as being a distortion which he must undo. On a policy level, that is the central question.</P>
    <P>My view and that of my party, for what it is worth, is that this comes down to choice. Most women who do not work choose not to work because they are looking after children &ndash; obviously there are some men who make the same choice but, for the sake of simplicity if nothing else, let us assume that it is women who are involved. Currently I suspect a significant number of them choose to do so not for the rest of their potential working lives but just for a period of years &ndash; they might choose to opt out of the workforce for four, five, six, seven or maybe ten years. The policy question is whether we give those people a tax break through the income tax system. Let us leave aside the argument about child care and caring generally because, although that is an associated argument, it is not quite the same thing. There is a cogent case for saying to a couple that if they are both working now and one of them ceases to work, they will not be far worse off from a taxation point of view and there will be an inherent benefit for them. By preserving that <i>status quo</i> we would have been enhancing choice. The way the Minister has chosen to proceed in individualising the standard rate band is restricting choice and in some cases eliminating it altogether.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Noonan rightly pointed out, the Minister gives two reasons for doing this: he wants to increase the participation rate of women in the workforce and he wants to use this way of taking 83% of taxpayers out of the income tax net. I do not want to repeat what we said on Committee Stage, but I think the Minister advanced the argument somewhat by conceding, if I understood him correctly, that the participation rates in that section of the female population which is most likely to be persuaded to go out and work is already very high and that the scope for increasing that participation rate, through the income tax system or, I suspect, in <Col N="33" /> any other way, is not great. Therefore, I am not sure that he can stand over the proposal he has made on those grounds alone. If he seeks to stand over it on the grounds of reducing the number of income earners paying tax at the higher rate, as Deputy Noonan rightly pointed out, other ways could have been chosen which do not involve the sort of social judgment or engineering in which the Minister has engaged.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister, for understandable reasons, accused people on these benches of hypocrisy and suggested that over the years the trade union movement had taken a different view. I will be upfront and honest and say that in terms of my criticism of the budget my focus was, always has been and still is on its treatment of people on lower income. The issue of individualisation was a subsidiary issue and still remains so. Nonetheless, it is an important one and one which, as the Minister does not need to be told at this stage, excites interest and strong views among large parts of the population, not least the female population.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Noonan, I would like some clarity as to exactly what the proposal in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness means. I am not sure if we teased this out fully on Committee Stage. The implication, as I understood it, was that it would increase the £28,000 to £56,000 plus an additional 15.5% so as to take into account the increase in incomes that is projected over the course of the programme &ndash; that would obviously change the mathematics somewhat.</P>
    <P>On the rebalancing measure, to which I will return later because there is an amendment tabled to deal with that, there is a problem in that it introduces an anomaly into the system which sits extremely uncomfortably with the nature of the reforms which we have been trying to carry out over recent years. It increases the disincentive to work, in particular, for women on lower income. Only a few days ago somebody earning £14,000 or £15,000 whose wife has a part-time job earning £5,000 or £6,000 contacted my office because they will be excluded from the £3,000 carer's allowance. Those people who are on fairly low income will benefit scarcely if at all from the changes the Minister has made. They are excluded from the £3,000 allowance and they are also excluded from the benefit which arises from extending the standard rate band because they are not earning enough. These are the people who are still being caught by virtue of the fact that the Minister has introduced a measure which will be seen in three, four or five years as an anomaly that must be removed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments concern the income tax rate band structure which will apply for the year 2000-01 and subsequent years of assessment. Last week we had a comprehensive discussion on this issue on Committee Stage when we considered identical amendments. The structure envisaged by these amendments is one which would contain a standard rate band of £17,000 for <Col N="34" /> a single person and £34,000 for all married couples, introduce a new third intermediate rate of 33% which would apply to a tranche of taxable income of £8,000 for a single person and £16,000 for a married couple above the standard rate band and retain the standard and higher rates as proposed in the Bill with the higher rate applying to taxable income of £25,000 for a single person and £50,000 for married couples.</P>
      <P>Acceptance of these amendments would result in setting aside the radical change which I am introducing this year, that is, a move to individualisation of the standard rate band. One of the main difficulties with the present band structure is that the single person's standard rate band is doubled for all married couples whether one or two incomes are involved. It is worth reminding the House that the pattern of work in Ireland has been transformed in the past decade. The proportion of households in which both spouses work outside the home is now above the EU average and an increasing number of these households find themselves liable to pay income tax at the higher rate on what are modest incomes. The tax system must recognise and be flexible in its response to this change.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Government is committed in An Action Programme for the Millennium to work towards having 80% of taxpayers taxed at the standard rate. The Government believes that the introduction of a single standard rate band for each individual taxpayer is essential in order to meet that commitment.</P>
      <P>Now that the allowances are effectively being converted into tax credits, the only way to reduce the numbers on the top tax rate and to reduce high marginal rates on average incomes, is to widen the standard rate tax band. The most effective way to widen that tax band is to put it on an individual basis and tax persons on what they earn as individuals, whether single or married. This is what the Government has set out to do and section 3 contains the first move in this direction.</P>
      <P>Tax reform, to be meaningful, must involve making radical change, and that is what I am proposing in section 3. I will be happy to be judged on the combined effect of the five budgets which I will have brought forward by the time of the next general election. Each of my budgets &ndash; this one is no exception &ndash; must be taken as part of a sequence and not considered in isolation. The Government's tax strategy will bear fruit in terms of higher take home pay and an increased incentive to work. I am confident that the considered judgment of the electorate on this record will be favourable at the next election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take satisfaction from the fact that the policy of individualisation has been supported by people outside the political spectrum. Representatives of the social partners endorsed the proposal in the recently published Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The key statement on this matter is worth repeating for the benefit of the House: The social partners support the policy of establishing <Col N="35" /> a single standard rate income tax band for all individual tax payers. They also agree that the standard rate income tax band should be kept under review in the light of increases in income levels and the objective of ensuring that, over time, at least 80% of taxpayers are not subject to the higher rate of income tax.</P>
    <P>In addition, the results of an MRBI opinion poll in January indicated that the proposal was generally well received by the public, including a high proportion of those who would normally support the parties opposite. In <i>The Examiner</i> last week the chief economist of Goodbody Stockbrokers was quoted as emphasising that economic growth is dependent on the implementation of the Government's current tax policy, especially the tax individualisation scheme.</P>
    <P>With regard to the introduction of a third intermediate rate of income tax, I indicated to Deputy Noonan last week that, in principle, I would have no great objection to it. I agree with him that the jump from 22% to 44% is too much in one go. However, I do not agree with doing a little here and there but nothing substantial. I am engaged in a radical overhaul of the income tax system which, over the life of this Government, will see the introduction of tax credits and individualisation with a significant rising of the standard rate band and a substantial reduction in existing rates of tax. My attitude to a third rate tends to be Augustinian &ndash; not just yet. I will be prepared to consider a third rate when the standard rate of income tax is down to 20% and the top rate is at 42% and, if possible, at 40%. I must bear in mind that the introduction of a 33% rate at this time, as proposed by Deputy Noonan, would mean an effective cut of 11 percentage points for higher rate taxpayers at a time when the Government is trying to assist the lower income taxpayer by endeavouring to remove as many of them as possible from the tax net. As I indicated to Deputy Noonan last week, the next administration of which, hopefully, I might also be Minister for Finance, can consider the question of a third rate of income tax. In the circumstances I have no alternative but to reject the amendments.</P>
    <P>We discussed this and other related matters in considerable detail on Committee Stage. It is a pity that, apart from the Members opposite and other Members of the committee, the broader public has not been informed of our deliberations. I know from experience it is more difficult to draft amendments when in Opposition as one does not have the benefit of the expertise of civil servants and so on, that is available to the Government. Perhaps I am mistaken but I did not see any newspaper coverage of the deliberations of the committee last week which sat for three days from 10 a.m. until 6 p.m. Perhaps this matter should be borne in mind when people talk about the amount of work done by Deputies and public representatives.</P>
    <P>A letter that appeared in the newspapers was brought to my attention. It stated that what was <Col N="36" /> occurring under individualisation was a great tragedy. Considering the abuse one gets one would not want to be thin skinned. Some of the outbursts in this area since the budget have been mind-bending in the extreme as far as I am concerned. Deputies Noonan and McDowell know that in the past I have criticised Ministers for trying to do a little here and there. Since becoming Minister for Finance anything I have done in the tax area has been dramatic, whether people like it or not. In the end the public will judge these matters. It is not my style to do a little here and there. One does not get real results that way.</P>
    <P>Suppose I had decided to do just one thing in the budget on income tax and not do anything else on bands or rates and so on. Suppose I decided to just concentrate on individualisation. The cost of going from £14,000 to £28,000 in individualisation last year would have been £839 million. By going from the £14,000 to £17,000 cost £310 million and that leaves £529 million. This was explained in the detailed notes to the budget on budget day, but apart from the Deputies opposite, I do not think anyone else read them. If they did, it was not reflected in the debate on individualisation.</P>

      <P>The Deputy did, but not many others. It and its effects were explained in very simple language. Suppose I had introduced the £839 million package and did nothing else, no-one would have been disadvantaged nor would anyone be in a worse position post the budget than before it. The people who would have gained would have been those on incomes ranging between £14,000 and £28,000. Not one single income married couple would have been disadvantaged. If I had done that, what would have been said then? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the arguments made outside the House on individualisation are antediluvian, to put it at its mildest. I read articles in the newspapers saying this was a tragedy for society. Not one woman would have been forced out to work on 2 December who was not working on 1 December, if I had done that. Things would have continued on as before and the same people would have continued working. Those staying at home would have been able to make a free choice to stay at home. Other articles stated this would force people out to work. I do not see how that comes into the debate. One thing the debate threw up in relief is that over the years politicians have been critical of the catch-up mentality within the public service, whereby if the chief heart surgeon in a public hospital gets an increase it will eventually filter its way down to everyone else, despite the relativities. After the debate on the budget I realised the relativities are endemic in society. In this case, nobody was being disadvantaged. People were being advantaged. However, some seem to have big problem with <Col N="37" /> the possibility that anyone could become better off and they were not going ahead proportionately at the same rate. That was an interesting insight thrown up by the debate. No single income married couple was disadvantaged but the awful possibility that the working couple next door bringing the children off every day at 7.30 a.m. to the crèche and collecting them at 6 p.m. and all the hardship involved, paying their mortgage and so on, would get a break while others were not getting as big a break seemed to be anathema to some.</P>
    <P>I expressed the opinion a week after the budget that this debate had triggered off a debate in other areas of social policy that I had thought were long dead. I did not address these issues before. However, since everybody else did not want to debate the tax aspects of this which were set out in the annex to the budget and everyone talked about the social aspects of it, including eminent political correspondents of various newspapers, I thought I would throw up that aspect too. I have heard Deputy Noonan talk about sociology and I would like to hear him deliberate on that point which the debate threw up. I have concluded much from the debate since last December. One other conclusion I have come to now is that the relativities and rigidities in the public service are a reflection of the whole Irish being. Nobody wants anybody to catch up on them in wage terms, and this is clear not only in the public service but right throughout society. That was part of the argument, as everybody was better off under my budget in terms of individualisation. I raise this for further debate by those who wish to comment. Nobody was hard done by. Deputy McDowell asked about social engineering, but there is no social engineering involved in this. I dealt with that point&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Noonan made a case about the middle rate, and I explained this in some detail on Committee Stage and again this morning. In principle, I have no difficulty with having another rate of taxation, but it is not possible to do all those things at the one time. Successive Ministers for Finance over the years have been bedevilled by colleagues, lobby groups and Government asking for a little bit of this and a little bit of that, with the result that nothing ever gets done. That is why we have such a viciously unfair tax system for people who work, where a single man or woman earning up to £14,000 before my budget fell into the top rate of tax. The average industrial wage is almost £17,000 and we were taxing these people at the higher rate of 46% when their earnings reached £14,000. Over the lifetime of the Government I intend ensuring that 12% of income earners will pay tax at the higher rate, which will be 42%, and if possible, 40%. The standard rate will be 20%. This is the commitment we gave the people in the last general election. Following the election people wanted to fight it again, saying we should have ignored the promises we made and work on bands and allowances. We gave a specific commitment regarding bands and allowances and rates of tax, which I will fulfil.</P>
      <P>It is true that lower direct taxation, be it income tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax, etc., leads to a greater yield for the Exchequer which allows greater things to be done in the area of social spending. The difference between myself and people such as Deputy McDowell and others is that they seem to regard high rates of taxation as a badge of social virility. With respect, Deputy McDowell, that type of thinking has resulted in the economic stagnation of the central European countries&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;for the past ten or 15 years, with high welfare and high rates of tax. The Irish solution of going in the other direction has led us to economic success and though this may be strange for social democrats throughout Europe, they are increasing realising this. Germany, in particular, is trying to reverse its policy. Lower rates of taxation lead to greater yields of money <Col N="39" /> which allow greater things to be done in terms of social exclusion. The Scandinavian countries have learned the same lesson. I make no apologies for having long stood for this principle and I have been proved to be correct.</P>
      <P>The other solution advocated by Deputy McDowell, his party and others on the Opposition, has led to economic stagnation in Europe, something the countries concerned have begun to realise. I remember replying to a parliamentary question on Irish corporation tax rates tabled by the Deputy about two and a half years ago. I predicted that Europe would move in the Irish direction rather than Ireland going in the European direction, and that will happen. This is the reality whether socialists throughout the world accept the principle. Lower tax leads to greater resources which can allow Government do something in terms of social inclusion, and this has been the Irish experience. The difference between myself and others is that I am prepared to say that now, and was prepared to say it ten and 20 years ago, and I have been proven to be correct. More resources can now be devoted to social welfare, health and homelessness as a result of economic prosperity, which has partially come about as a result of sane taxation policies. The central European countries are learning this lesson. Whether one is on the far left or far right of world politics, this is an inescapable fact which must be faced and it is the basis of my taxation policies.</P>
      <P>Today Deputy McDowell, and on other occasions Deputy Noonan, asked about the commitment to individualisation in future years. As I pointed out on Committee Stage, when the partnership programme was published, Deputy Noonan said that in terms of individualisation the Minister had gone from £14,000 to £17,000 and that the £17,000 will be increased through wage increases over the coming years. Deputy Rabbitte repeated the same mantra, proving that he did not read the partnership agreement. The agreement says:</P>
      <P>The social partners support the policy of establishing a single standard rate income tax band for all individual taxpayers. They also agree that the standard rate income tax band should be kept under review in the light of increases in income levels and the objective of ensuring that, over time, at least 80% of taxpayers are not subject to the higher rate of income tax.</P>
      <P>As I explained on Committee Stage, that means that the £28,000 band which we will achieve for everybody will be increased by the rate of average earnings in the period.</P>

      <P>Deputy Noonan asked what will happen in the next two budgets. In the summary of the budget measures we went to the enormous trouble &ndash; I will advise my officials and Revenue not to bother doing so again &ndash; of having an annexe explaining these matters in very simple detail regarding individualisation and what would happen, giving examples. We also set out the number of tax payers concerned, etc. If I raised the threshold from £14,000 to £28,000, the cost would have been £839 million. By raising it from £14,000 to £17,000 it cost £310 million. That is due to the pyramid effect created by the number of people paying different rates of tax and separate details were provided about that. As the threshold is raised to £28,000, the cost would be £529 million extra based on current figures. It would cost another £310 million to raise the threshold to approximately £20,000. A large group of taxpayers earn smaller levels of incomes and as the threshold is increased it does not cost as much.</P>
      <P>I announced in the budget that in my next two budgets, I would raise the single tax rate band to £28,000. Deputy Noonan asked what I would do. No Minister for Finance has ever outlined in February, March or even September his total tax package for the next budget because the prevailing economic circumstances must be considered. All things being equal, it is my intention to proceed with the individualisation proposals as outlined in my Budget Statement and to fulfil section 1.3 of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, which states, &ldquo;It is an agreed policy objective of the Government and the social partners that, over time, all those earning the minimum wage will be removed from the tax net&rdquo;. It is also an agreed objective that over the lifetime of the programme, which extends beyond the lifetime of this Government, everybody earning the minimum wage will be exempt from taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage, I pointed out that the social partners recognise that this is not just about <Col N="41" /> bands and allowances, and I have debated this issue with the Deputies in the House on numerous occasions. Over the years I have rejected the mantra, which has been uttered since 1993, that there is but one way of dealing with taxation, bands and allowances. Section 1.1.3 of PPF, which the social partners have agreed, states:</P>
    <P>Tax benefits can be delivered through increased personal tax credits, widening the standard rate bands and reductions in the rates at which tax is levied. The Government and the social partners regard increases in tax credits and the development of a tax credit system as the priority areas for resources over the course of this Programme. It is an agreed policy objective of the Government and the social partners that, over time, all those earning the minimum wage will be removed from the tax net.</P>
    <P>Section 1.1.4 refers to the individualisation policy. The agreement incorporates the Government's objectives which it outlined in An Action Programme for the Millennium and the tax credit proposals which Deputy McDowell wants me to pursue. I introduced a tax credits policy in the 1999 budget.</P>
    <P>When the next election takes place another two budgets will have been implemented. At that stage only 12% of all income earners will pay tax at the top rate. If anyone said prior to the last election in June 1997 that it would be possible to do that, people inside and outside the House would not have believed it. We will have achieved that, along with a standard rate reduction from 26% to 20% and a top rate reduction to 42% from 48% and, hopefully, we can reduce that to 40%. The record will speak for itself and at the next election we will not lose on the basis of our taxation record.</P>

      <P>The sun then rose but the hens on the farm were a little lazier. They were not up that early and they sought an explanation for this racket in the morning. The cock said that the sun would not rise if he did not crow for 15 minutes. The Minister's extravagant claims about his taxation policy reminded me of that cock because his policy has as little to do with the prosperity which Ireland enjoys as the rising sun had to do with the cock crowing. While, in his delusions, he may claim that he caused all this, the facts are that he inherited a booming economy and extra<Col N="42" /> ordinary tax buoyancy. It is a wonder of the world that he made such a colossal mess of the budget, when any five-eighth would have dispensed such buoyancy in a fair and equitable, user-friendly and popular way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The mess he made on budget day is amazing, not to mention his taxation policy. He still defends the indefensible. He cannot understand the scenario regarding two couples who live side by side and have similar mortgages, expenses and household income where in one house, one individual works and in the other both work. His regime will lead to a position where in the house where one works the couple will pay the higher rate of tax when they reach £28,000 in income, while in the house where two work, they will not pay the top rate until their income reaches £56,000. Yet, the Minister cannot understand why people would get upset about that and he thinks there is begrudgery among neighbours which is endemic in the Irish consciousness.</P>
      <P>At the end of the day, Committee Stage, which nobody attended or commented on, rumbled his regime. The only reason he did it this way was to save £130 million and it was clear on Committee Stage that he gave back £125 million and sought to implement a balancing measure. Every other objective could have been achieved with an amendment similar to mine. He saved money and was then forced to pay it back again. His big speech was equivalent to the cock crowing in the farmyard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel I must defend 50 years of social democracy in Europe in two minutes, which will not be easy. We have never believed in a high nominal rate of tax for the sake of it. One should not tax just because it makes people feel bad and makes us feel good. We tax because we want to provide services and it has a re-distributive effect. That is deliberate and has always been part of the political philosophy which I support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the increased tax take have anything to do with the fact that the number of people in work has increased from 1.1 million in 1992 to almost 1.7 million today? Approximately 600,000 more people are working. It would require extraordinary gymnastics on the part of any Minister for Finance not to generate a dramatically increased income tax take from any change in taxation which he or she introduced given that the number of incomes tax payers had increased by almost 50% in that time. That is the key and in so far as changes in income tax influence people to work, surely at the lower end one makes it worthwhile for people to work in the first place. That relates to the argument we have had over a number of years in regard to the integration of the social welfare and tax systems. However, that has little to do with the changes that the Minister has introduced in the taxation <Col N="43" /> system in the past three budgets of which he is most proud.</P>
    <P>With regard to individualisation the Minister, in a sense, has accepted that he has changed the accepted balance of the way in which we do business, and it was always intended in broad terms to be a pro-family measure. There is an onus on him to tell people why. He has gone some distance by saying that he wants to give a tax break to couples where both individuals work, but he has not made the case convincingly. He has not persuaded the bulk of the people that that must be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the Minister must make the case for changing that balance and say that in circumstances where a wife typically decides to stay at home for a number of years the tax treatment should be different to that in the past. I accept it is possible to make a case for saying that simply doubling the standard rate band was a crude way to do so. Perhaps different ways could be examined, but the Minister did not even seek to make that case before the budget. There was no discussion and there is certainly no democratic mandate for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make one point. When the Murphy judgment was issued, the Government of the day decided to implement it in a certain way. The then Minister for Finance, Deputy O'Kennedy, was at pains to point out on Committee Stage in the Dáil and in the Seanad that to meet the Murphy judgment requirements would cost only about £30 million but that he was going further and doubling up the bands. That argument got lost in the debate, however, because the Opposition successfully put the case that the Minister was implementing the measure only as a result of the Murphy judgment. That is what is stated in the Official Report. Until that change in tax policy by the then Minister for Finance, there were no double bands for married couples. I was a Member of this House at the time. Deputy Noonan entered the House in 1981 or 1982 also. It was the 1981 Finance Bill, and there were double bands for married couples in the implementation of policy subsequently. That was the change made then and it makes no sense, therefore, for Deputy McDowell to ask if that is the way we always did it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is beginning to <Col N="44" /> show his age. He is talking about 20 years ago. I was at school 20 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make that point. Until the implementation of the budget measures post the Murphy judgment, everybody had the same bands. It was a policy decision of the time to introduce double bands and that is what has got us into difficulty. I have not heard anybody pointing that out in all the debate of the past three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>After all of that, it is still the position that the theory of taxation does not impact on people's lives. The issue is the amount they pay overall and the incidence of taxation at different levels of income. This amendment has proved beyond any shadow of doubt that if the Minister increased the range of the standard rate band from 14% to 17% for single persons and simply doubled it for married couples, he would have achieved all the policy objectives he argues in terms of equity and fairness, allowing people incentives to work by taking home more money, and in allowing the two people in the household to retain more of the income they earn individually. He would have achieved all the policy objectives also in terms of extra labour force participation. It would have cost £130 million more and if the Minister had rested his case on that, which he did initially, he would have a valid case to argue but the problem is that the balancing measure which was forced on the Minister eliminated the savings. His balancing allowance of £3,000 is costing £125 million on his own undercosted figure, and the saving is £130 million.</P>
      <P>The Minister went around in a circle and he introduced an unnecessary complication to the taxation system. His policy objectives could be achieved if we ignore the proposal in the table for the 33% band and examine the 17% and 34%, which will cost an extra £130 million. The Minister gave that money away anyway in his balancing measure. He has arrived, via a very complicated route, at this frightful mess which will continue in the next two budgets. This issue has not gone away, you know, to liberally quote some of the people who aspire to become Members of this House.</P>

      <P>The amendment in my name essentially seeks to use the tax credits system to increase the standard rated personal tax free allowances up to a figure of £12,940 with consequent changes in the other allowances. I have argued before, and I do not want to detain the House too much this morning, that this is the fairest and most effective way of reducing income tax, and there is a general acceptance that we can and should reduce the income tax burden. It would have taken, by my reckoning of figures supplied to me by the Department of Finance, about 150,000 more people out of the income tax system than the Minister has done; the Minister has taken about 70,000 out of the system. This measure would have allowed us to take approximately 200,000 to 220,000 people out of the system, depending on how generous we choose to be. It is the fairest way of reducing tax and it is what we should concentrate on for the next few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the time available to me I want to concentrate on one matter, that is, to allow the Minister the opportunity to express with greater clarity exactly what he intends to do over the course of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, which will run for two years and nine months. We debated this matter at some length on Committee Stage but three different parallel commitments have now been given by the Minister and we need to establish how they inter-relate and what will happen if we cannot afford all of them. The Minister has given a commitment which I find persuasive, not in the argument but I accept he is persuaded of it, that he will reduce the standard rate of tax to 20% and the higher rate to 42% and, if possible, to 40%. He made it clear this morning and over the past number of months that he intends to pursue the individualisation project over the next two budgets. As I understand it, both of those projects are to be completed, assuming the Minister is still in power, in the 2001 and 2002 budgets at a total cost of approximately £1.1 billion, £500 million of which will be spent on individualisation and rather less than that on reducing the two rates of tax, assuming he reduces the top rate of tax to 40%. The difficulty the Minister faces, and it is a very real one, is that he has chosen to graft on to something in which he probably does not believe, that is, the commitment to the objectives set out in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to exempt a minimum wage of £5 an hour, or £200 a week, from the income tax net. That will be an enormously expensive commitment, probably costing somewhere in the region of £1.25 billion. If we roll all of that up over a period of two to three budgets, <Col N="46" /> we are talking about commitments already given which amount to about £2.5 billion. I have said before, and I repeat now, that that would be far too much of a commitment. It would reduce our capacity to pay for services and would be grossly inflationary in terms of stoking up domestic demand. It would be too much, it is unaffordable and I do not believe this or any other Government is likely to do it.</P>
    <P>The question workers will ask themselves over the next two or three weeks, as they come to vote on the programme, is which of these commitments, if any, will fall by the wayside. Which of them will be incomplete in two or three budgets? On Committee Stage, the Minister gave us a fairly clear indication of what would happen because I questioned him several times on it and he stated, quite deliberately, that he intends to work towards the objective in the programme of exempting the minimum wage from tax. He said that three times, by my reckoning, with no absolute commitment that he would achieve it. He stated it more than once as an objective but he was clear in using the phrase that he would work towards it. That is fairly clear code.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only quoting what is in the programme. The programme states that &ldquo;over time, all those earning the minimum wage will be removed from the tax net&rdquo;. That is what it states. I did not make it up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seeking greater clarity from the Minister this morning. The programme will run for two years and nine months. It was not clear to me that the Minister will reach that objective within two years and nine months, or the three budgets of the programme. If the Minister is making a commitment to reach that target he should tell us, and if it is just an aim or an objective, or something he might do if he has enough money or time, he should say that. That is a central consideration which will decide many voters, particularly trade union members, in the next two or three weeks.</P>
      <P>On an associated matter, I want to give the Minister the opportunity to comment on the controversy which arose at the end of last week in relation to the commitments in the programme. I have a SIPTU analysis of the programme which states clearly that, on average, most workers can expect a 10% increase in wages as a result of the reductions in income tax which will come about during the three budgets of the programme. It would be useful if the Minister took this opportunity to restate his commitment to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are aware of the statement from Government and we have a reasonably clear idea of the Taoiseach's view on this. Since the Minister has, on more than one occasion, advocated his primacy in making these decisions, not least in the earlier discussion we had about credit unions, it would be useful if he made a clear statement that he regards that 10% overall reduction as a <Col N="47" /> reasonable interpretation of the provisions in the programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are amendments in my name and that of Deputy Deenihan which have a similar purpose to those proposed by Deputy McDowell. The figures are different but it gives us an opportunity to debate the effects of increases in personal allowances and their payment by way of tax credit. I notice the text of the Finance Bill still refers to allowances. One has to do a type of mental gymnastic to bring about a tax credit. When will the drafting changes be made where one will talk about credits rather than allowances? When will the change to tax credits be completed in language as well as in law?</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell rightly said we should have priorities when we make commitments on tax relief. In any set of priorities my party would have, the elimination of low paid persons from tax would be our highest priority. That was a feature of the proposals I brought forward in September when we calculated the minimum wage at around £170 per week and said we should progressively eliminate all tax on the minimum wage. The commitments on the minimum wage are now somewhat higher but as far as we, as a party, are concerned, the commitment remains. We intend giving priority to that commitment.</P>
      <P>The arguments I made about a third rate of tax are to address a different matter. If one was arguing on grounds of equity and fairness and if that was the sole consideration, one would put all the money where Deputy McDowell said to put it. Apart from considerations of equity and fairness, there are occasions when the taxation system has to be used as an instrument of economic policy. Whatever the state of the labour force, it is self-evident that we will run out of key workers very quickly. Key workers, who are Irish people working abroad, are very responsive to the high marginal rates of tax. If one looks at the situation after 6 April when the Minister's proposals will be implemented, the top rate will be 44%. People frequently forget that, from the first pound, the same taxpayer will pay 2% on all income, in terms of the levy.</P>
      <P>There is not much political bang for eliminating levies but it takes an enormous amount of money out of high paid and middle income people's pockets if one is to pay 2% on all income from the first pound. Many people think one only pays from the threshold up but once one passes the threshold, it is like snakes and ladders. One goes back to the tail of the snake again and pays from the first pound. I presume the Minister's officials and the Revenue people with him would have a calculation on what 2% on all income would add to the marginal rate of tax but it is certainly more than 2% which one would add on to 44%. On top of that, one must pay PRSI. I know that is subject to a ceiling but it is still a significant added penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one takes, for example, a person working in a <Col N="48" /> hi-tech industry in the fields of California, around Silicon Valley, who faces the same type of housing costs as people in Dublin, although that would not be the major consideration, they are looking at a national tax rate of about 20% and a local state rate of another 6% or 7%. It is very hard to convince them when they run the numbers on the bottom line that they are making a good career move by coming back to Ireland to work in industry here. It is that tranche of people about whom I would be concerned when we talk about a middle rate of tax.</P>
    <P>I take the point, however, that we should put our priorities on the table. My priority, if we are talking about equity and fairness, would be the low paid. However, if there are other policy considerations, other things will become priorities of almost equal magnitude. The overall priority is the sustainability of the prosperity we now enjoy. That is the policy objective we all share &ndash; how we keep the roll going, what are the things which might stop and how we eliminate them from national life. That is basically where the whole debate lies.</P>
    <P>People looking at tax commitments are inclined to underestimate the resources available to the Minister. What historically would have been an enormously expensive commitment is not that expensive now in terms of the buoyancy which exists. When dealing with our tax policy document, I was fairly surprised when I looked at the three proceeding budgets &ndash; one was Deputy Quinn's last budget in office while the other two were the Minister's first two budgets &ndash; because the combined tax relief given in those three budgets was £1.5 billion. The interesting thing was that when one looked at the yield to the Exchequer from income tax, it had increased by £1 billion. Despite the fact that £1.5 billion had been given back, the Exchequer ended up £1 billion to the good over the three tax years. I was fairly surprised at that and when I pitched our personal commitments, I ratcheted them up on the basis that it was there. As far as I know, buoyancy has accelerated since then and continues to do so. I would be surprised if the figures at the end of the year did not show that the extraordinary tax relief package introduced by the Minister, which is about £1.2 billion, will be well covered and that the estimate for the budget surplus will be incorrect.</P>
    <P>We will have the resources to do what is contained in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness in terms of tax relief over three budgets and even to do the type of things about which I am talking in respect of a third rate. There will be another debate on whether it would be prudent to spend the resources and about what we are doing generating additional heat in the economy if the Minister spends £1 billion again next year and the year after. That is what we should be debating now. I do not believe it will be lack of resources which will prevent the Minister from doing what is proposed in the programme. Whether it will be prudent will be a fairly nice <Col N="49" /> judgment call next autumn because it may not be prudent at that point and the Minister may have difficulties at that stage.</P>
    <P>Coincidentally, I have been reading John Major's book over the past few days. I do not believe I have reached the point referred to by Deputy McDowell.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>What struck me, and what is being reflected in much of the debate from London and European capitals, was that the various decisions made about 1989 in the United Kingdom expanded the economy rapidly, although it subsequently burst, and that there were all the theories of a bubble economy. There is an echo here of much of what happened around that time and of many of the decisions taken about 1989. That is why one is getting advice from the City of London and various other cities that things might not be as good as they look in Ireland and that the advice from fund managers or people in stock broking firms to institutional shareholders is not to buy into Irish companies. That would explain why bank shares, for example, are so low at the moment. They are simply not being bought by investors in London. I understand the London disease is spreading to other European capitals.</P>
      <P>I believe the circumstances here are totally different. I am optimistic and believe this situation will continue if properly managed. I do not believe we have a bubble economy. The issue facing the Minister when he prepares for next year's budget will be how much it is prudent to spend on tax relief rather than whether the resources are available to him. I do not intend to say any more on this point other than it completes the tax package. Unlike the Minister, I have always been of the view that to design a proper tax reform package and to give proper relief, one must use all the mechanisms available. That includes bands, allowances, rates and exemptions. One must use all four and it is the mix of the four that gives the best result.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments propose to increase the standard rate of personal allowances of £4,700 for single persons and £9,400 for married couples as proposed in the Bill. Deputy McDowell's amendment will increase the allowance to £6,470 for a single person and to £12,940 for a married couple at an additional full year cost of £584.3 million. The amendments tabled by Deputies Noonan and Deenihan seek to increase the standard rate of personal allowances to £5,200 for a single person and to £10,000 for a married couple. Acceptance of these amendments would result in an increased cost of £172.5 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cuts in personal income tax already provided for in the Bill come to more than £1 billion. This represents a very substantial cost way above anything that has been given in a single year pre<Col N="50" /> viously. It is a very significant step in the fulfilment of the commitments set out in the Government's, An Action Programme for the Millennium. In line with that plan, this year's budget continues to concentrate on reform of the tax system, which is designed to remove as many low income earners as possible from the tax net and significantly reduce the burden on those who remain within it. The changes being provided for by me this year will remove nearly 40,000 people from the tax net.</P>
    <P>The increase in the personal allowances of £500 for a single person to £4,700 and £1,000 for a married person up to £9,400, as announced in the Bill, which apply at the standard rate of income tax, when put together with the PAYE allowance of £1,000 will result in a standard rate of personal allowances for a single person on PAYE of £5,700 per annum. This will mean they will not pay any tax on income below £109.60 per week. When taken in conjunction with the changes in the tax rates and the standard rate band, there will be a significant reduction in the tax bill for all taxpayers. Those on the average industrial wage will see tax cuts of £20 per week. The proportion of taxpayers on the higher rate will fall from 46% to 37%.</P>
    <P>While in common with most, although not all of my predecessors, I would like to do more and even possibly question the Deputies opposite, I am unfortunately subject to constraints to which they are not. In the circumstances I must reject the amendments.</P>
    <P>One of the speakers asked the number of people Budget 2000 would take out of the tax net. The age exemptions would take out 9,527 people, the personal allowances would take out another 39,233 and the allowance for earners with children would take out another 22,753. The number of taxpayers who would stay within marginal relief but have a reduced tax bill is 13,945 and the number of taxpayers who would move from marginal relief to the 22% rate would be 3,432. The total of those figures amounts to approximately 88,889.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell asked me a number of specific questions about what will happen over the next few budgets. I tried to answer those questions on Committee Stage. I said it would be possible in March or even in September to announce what the total budget package would be. The agreement states that the Government and the social partners regard increase in tax credits and the development of the tax credits system as the priority area for resources over the course of this programme. It is an agreed policy objective of the Government and the social partners over time that all those earning the minimum wage will be removed from the tax net. The Deputy is correct that the priority area, as agreed with the social partners, is that of tax credits. There will be three budgets under this programme and I hope to be in a position to introduce the next two. I intend over the next two budgets to move substantially towards taking more and more people out of the tax net.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="51" /> For the benefit of historians in years to come, I point out that I, as Opposition spokesperson, committed Fianna Fáil to the introduction of a minimum wage. That was a policy initiative of mine, which I announced, and that was the first announcement of it. I wish to emphasise that, given that I am regarded as a roaring right-winger. I was the person who came up with that idea.</P>

      <P>It is perhaps because I have been associating for too long with ordinary people that I have got to be like Deputy McDowell and others. Deputy McDowell asked me about the minimum wage. I will move substantially in that regard and I will move forward in terms of individualisation.</P>
      <P>He also raised a question about the debate that took place last week, which was more an internal trade union battle when people in the trade union movement stood against social partnership for their legitimate reasons. They argued them well and I have got to know some of the people involved reasonably well in recent years, and I admire them for the forthrightness of their views. I always admire people for the forthrightness of their views. Those people have always opposed social partnership as against the other trade union leaders who have been pro-social partnership. The Taoiseach made a telling remark in a radio interview last Sunday when he said, he had not ever heard any of the people who opposed social partnership in a trade union movement say what the alternative would have been over the past 12 years and what they advocate. The benefits of social partnership speak for themselves. I agree with the social partners and what is quoted in some of the documents, that on average the benefits of the tax package will be in the order of 10%. As was pointed out in supplementary documentation last week, if recent years are anything to go by, we have always bettered what has been agreed in the programme for Government. There is a definite commitment in the programme to work towards removing those on the minimum wage from the tax net. I agree with the trade union leadership that the benefits of the tax packages in the budgets to come will give people an average income increase of 25%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to note from Deputy Noonan's recent contributions, particularly since last year when he announced the new Fine Gael tax policy and from his comments here this morning, that the Fine Gael Party, particularly Deputy Noonan, is returning to a policy to which it subscribed for many years. That is more or less what I have said can be done by way of bands, allowances and tax cuts. I would disagree with very little the Deputy <Col N="52" /> said in his contribution this morning. I detected this change when he published his policy document last year. All I can put the tax policy of the previous two years down to is contamination from which the party suffered when in Government with the Labour Party and Democratic Left, which influenced his Leader more than any other member to pursue this kind of&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a bit worried about reverse contamination, but we survived and proceeded.</P>
      <P>Equity and fairness is one aspect that must be considered in framing the budget, but there are also broader policy considerations, and Deputy Noonan referred to a number of them. While we believe we are doing well to reduce the top rate of tax to 44%, to have a PRSI rate of 4.5% &ndash; the 4.5% PRSI cuts off at approximately £29,223 &ndash; and levies of 2%, the Deputy said that still appears a very high marginal rate of tax to the people we are trying to attract home from the United State or the United Kingdom. Those matters must be borne in mind as well.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan also referred to buoyancy considerations and there is no point in denying them. They were partly due to the increasing numbers returning to work, a point which Deputy McDowell made earlier. That also makes the total figure better, but there are other matters to which Deputy Noonan alluded in framing the budget. Prudence is one of them. As Deputies have been so frank and open about it this morning, I had better be frank and open as well.</P>

Given the imminent departure of so many Ministers to the United States for St. Patrick's Day, will he and his colleagues consider the misfortunes of native Americans who suffered at the hands of many Irish people who were in the American Army in the 1880s and beyond, following incidents such as the massacre at Wounded Knee in South Dakota?

He went on to say that there were no requests to provide support to native American projects under consideration in his Department.</P>

That may or may not have been considered appropriate at the time, but it was still very welcome. Given that the world has become smaller thanks to technology, it is all the more important that that reconciliation be valued and that a gesture be made. I ask him to consider this matter again. There are many documented instances of massacres where Irish people carried out the most brutal policies, though they might not have been involved in making those policies. If the Minister of State wants historical information I will provide it and, having done so, would he then reconsider the matter of an apology? More tangible assistance could also be considered, such as the drug or drink addiction programmes operating with the co-operation of Father McGuckian of the pioneers in Dublin. If the Minister of State wants neutral and unbiased information he could contact Father McGuckian in the pioneer headquarters in Sheriff Street.</P>

While these views were clearly outlined, the FAI indicated at the conclusion of the meeting that, while it appreciated the decision, it intended to build its own stadium.</P>

Is it not strange that the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation with responsibility for the capital programme for sport did not attend a meeting concerning a project costing between £280 million and £0.5 billion when completed? Will the Minister agree the public would be correct in assuming that the Taoiseach is calling the shots and pulling the strings, that he has no input into the project and that it is being said privately that he is opposed to the project because it will consume all the capital allocation available for sport in future?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my predecessors, I have been lobbied to introduce a mandatory licensing system for the bed and breakfast sector. Like my predecessors, I have concluded that, in order to be effective, such a system would require a significant diversion of resources away from developing the tourism industry towards policing and administration. There is not any evidence to suggest the transfer of the current voluntary system to a mandatory basis would have any appreciable impact on accommodation standards over and above that currently brought about by market forces.</P>
      <P>The impressive expansion of tourist accommodation over the past decade has resulted in increased competition and higher standards across all categories, not least in the bed and breakfast sector. In my recent contributions to this debate, I made the point that, rather than go down the road of mandatory registration of the bed and breakfast sector, it would be better to pursue a strategy in which the industry led in the determination of standards and quality for the bed and breakfast sector, which has matured and progressed beyond all recognition over the past decade. Such an approach had been envisaged as far back as 1994 in the A.D. Little Review of Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, I have always contended that, due to the substantial increase in the volume and range of accommodation in recent years, there is a greater choice available to tourists, thus allowing market forces to weed out accommodation which is not of a sufficiently high standard. The recent emphasis by bed and breakfast providers on developing their own marketing capability will result in greater transparency for the consumer as to the quality of individual bed and breakfasts and the services they provide. This process will be further enhanced by the advent of the Internet and e-commerce, and the marketing and retail opportunities offered therein, directly in the marketplace, to both bed and breakfast providers and their consumer market at home and abroad. In short, there have been major changes in the bed and breakfast sector itself, in the marketplace and in consumer protection, safety regulation, etc., since the introduction of the concept of approval in its current form. The time has now come to consider a more appropriate system for a modern, sophisticated accommodation sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current position with regard to approval of bed and breakfast accommodation is that, following a recommendation contained in the A.D. Little Review of Bord Failte, the approval and inspection functions were outsourced to recognised self-regulatory bodies within the industry itself. Currently, three separate companies carry out these functions for different sections of the <Col N="58" /> bed and breakfast sector. Having reviewed these arrangements, Bord Fáilte has launched a tender process for the award of the new contract for inspection and approval. Bord Fáilte currently has the role of ensuring that appropriate standards are set for the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I put down the question is that there is confusion in the approved sector in relation to a statement made by the Minister on 11 February repeating what he said here this afternoon. The sector needs to know who, if anyone, will regulate the product. There was an advertisement in the newspaper some time ago inviting tenders from a body to approve the town and country homes sector and the farmhouse sector. There was a separate advertisement for the registration of hotels and guesthouses. This is all tied up with the proposal from Government that rates will be levied on the bed and breakfast sector. A worrying aspect is that the proposed levies on the bed and breakfast sector are contributing to the decline in the numbers applying for registration or approval. Will the Minister clarify who will regulate the product and will he go ahead with the tendering process because there is confusion in the sector regarding the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in the interim. We have advertised for continual approval and recognition as was the case heretofore. Given the quality and amount of accommodation available in the past ten years, I believe the consumer is the best regulator. This country has high quality accommodation and visitors coming here are very discerning. As I pointed out previously, one dissatisfied customer can undo the work of 20 satisfied customers. One can be guaranteed that 95% of dissatisfied customers will not return. Therefore, the marketplace will dictate in future. The consumer is the best regulator because of the competition that exists in the whole area. The quality of the accommodation is far superior to that which was available prior to regulation and approval. I do not say that just because it is my view. I will meet the different people concerned and will discuss the issue with them. Some people believe there should be independent approval systems.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also raised the rates system. That is completely different for bed and breakfast accommodation and is a matter on which I have had many representations recently. The time has come to redefine what is meant by a bed and breakfast. It is no longer in accordance with the bed and breakfast we had previously. I am of the view that a bed and breakfast has somewhere between a minimum of three rooms and a maximum of five. Most of those establishments which are regarded as bed and breakfasts are small guesthouses and small hotels.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister but what people want is a level playing <Col N="59" /> pitch. Some bed and breakfasts are regulated and approved while others are not. The term bed and breakfast is confused. In the traditional bed and breakfast the owner is there to meet the guests. Does the Minister agree we must protect that sector?</P>

That sector has to be redefined and we must be careful to have an approval system. The question of whether the consumer and market forces should dictate or whether the independent approvals should continue is open for discussion. This evening I will meet a certain section of that&mdash;</P>

      <P>Although tourism business from Britain to Ireland remained buoyant in 1999, Bord Fáilte expects that the holiday segment will be down on previous year figures for the first time since 1992.</P>
      <P>As I said in my recent address at the annual conference of the Irish Hotels Federation, our most important tourism source market, the UK, may be showing signs of fatigue in terms of pure holiday numbers, despite the strength of sterling and an absence of violence in Northern Ireland. While we have to await the final figures for 1999, preliminary indications are that we may be experiencing a peak in our current fashionability in Britain at the same time as many newer and competitively-priced alternative holiday options are opening up from that market. Bord Fáilte is currently reviewing the British market to try to get to grips with any fundamental underlying changes and to see what marketing repositioning and revamp of packaging by the industry may be required in the future to maintain our strong place in this market. I am anxious that this work is completed as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of continental Europe, which represents more than a quarter of our business, our overall market performance has been stagnant in recent years. while I acknowledge that we have been doing well in Italy and the Nordic countries, for example, this has not compensated for performance out of France and Germany &ndash; our two most important European source markets &ndash; where we had similar levels of visitor numbers and revenue earnings in 1999 as in 1995. Bord Fáilte has devised and is implementing a new <Col N="60" /> three-year strategy for the German market. A formula simply must be found for doing better in continental Europe.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte is also well advanced in a total review of Tourism Brand Ireland which was launched more than three years ago. This review involves a reappraisal of prospects in the individual markets, detailed research among consumers and ultimately the development of refined visual, communications and promotional material. Bord Fáilte is looking at the opportunities and challenges associated with the wider use of the Internet as a tool in tourism marketing and promotion. This exercise will build on experience with its own award-winning site, recent feedback from the industry and the growing importance of new media and new technology in the tourism business.</P>
    <P>Under the National Development Plan, published in November 1999 in excess of £350 million will be available in public financial support for tourism marketing, training and product development over the period 2000 to 2006 to complement investment by the industry itself. This funding will facilitate a range of initiatives, including the creation of Ireland's first ever multi-annual tourism marketing fund, which will support the continued successful development of the tourism sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the alarm bells are ringing loud and clear, notwithstanding the double advantage of peace in Northern Ireland and the strength of sterling against the punt? Is he now admitting that the figures for the first time in many years from the UK and our main customers in Europe &ndash; Germany and Holland &ndash; will be either stagnant or show a reduction? Has the Minister and Bord Fáilte addressed the issues that may be affecting this trend? Has he considered our litter-strewn countryside and the difficulty in getting to the regions outside of Dublin? Is he aware that it takes four hours to get to Cork as opposed to three hours 12 months ago? Has he considered the issue of duty free sales? Given that the Minister said £350 million will be available I hope he is not depending on throwing money at the problem. Surely more thought should be given to the fundamental reasons our tourism market in the UK and for our main customers in Europe is entering a period of stagnation? The alarm bells should be ringing loud and clear in his Department and in Bord Fáilte.</P>

      <P>The figures are estimates taken by Bord Fáilte from approximately 10,000 people. This is far short of the 350,000 to 400,000 figures which the CSO take into consideration. The words &ldquo;alarm bells&rdquo; used by the Deputy are somewhat strong. I am certainly concerned about the figures. We have indicated that Bord Fáilte should keep its finger on the pulse and it has done so. That is the reason Bord Fáilte has been successful in maintaining the tourism market. The <Col N="61" /> figures are a matter of concern given that we have peace in Northern Ireland and sterling has never been so much in our favour. Regardless of the question of access to the regions, litter and so on &ndash; which I will deal with later &ndash; we are an island economy and, as such, are vulnerable to any increase in price changes. Consequently I resist anything that has to do with increasing access or airport charges coming into this country. We would all agree that this success has been based on&mdash;</P>

      <P>My Department has already conveyed detailed views to the Department of Public Enterprise on the future strategic direction of Aer Rianta in the context of tourism policy, and my officials have had discussions with their counterparts in the Department of Public Enterprise on the subject.</P>
      <P>My view is that the priority requirement, from a tourism perspective, is the provision of necessary infrastructure and services at our main airports at the lowest possible cost consistent with safe commercial operations. Accordingly, Aer Rianta, the main provider of airport services in the State, has a critical role to play in this context. Competitive air access, to which Aer Rianta strategy has made a major contribution, has been of enormous importance in facilitating tourism growth to Ireland in recent years. Competitive access continues to be a critical element of tourism strategy for an island destination like Ireland. I look forward, therefore, to presenting my views on this subject, and on how Aer Rianta can continue to contribute to maximising Ireland's tourism potential, when the matter is raised in Government.</P>

Does he agree that the profits from Dublin Airport should be used to reduce landing charges at regional airports and at Shannon and Cork airports, and to market the regions? Does he agree that if Shannon and Cork airports were sold, it is likely that the new owners would be driven by a desire for profit rather than an obligation to meet the needs of the region and that such an action would be a contradiction of the policies on providing low cost access to the regions and of their development?

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 18, 22, 24, 26, 31, 35 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>In response to parliamentary questions on 3 February and during the special debate on 9 February I outlined the Government's decision to proceed with plans to build a campus of sporting excellence, including an 80,000 all seated national stadium to be known as Sports Campus Ireland. This decision was informed by the feasibility study conducted by the consultants to the stadium steering committee and the committee's recommendations.</P>
      <P>Having been identified by the consultants and recommended by the steering committee the site at Abbotstown in west Dublin was accepted by the Government as the optimum location for the proposed sports campus and stadium. The question of affordable housing is a matter for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and does not arise in the context of the national stadium.</P>
      <P>The feasibility study and the committee's recommendations are available in the Oireachtas Library as is the legal document referred to by Deputy Allen. This latter document, a letter of assignation between Pictet and Cie, Geneva, and the Department of the Taoiseach, gives effect to the private donation of £50 million from Mr. J. P. McManus towards the financing and development of Sports Campus Ireland and Stadium Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A development company is to be established to take the project through the design and construction stage to which normal EU provisions and tendering arrangements will apply. This development company with the board of trustees in which <Col N="66" /> the asset will be vested are in the process of being established.</P>
    <P>Ireland, despite being a nation of sports enthusiasts, does not have a stadium suitable for hosting all its field sports. The stadium proposed will be capable of accommodating a wide range of sports and entertainment events. The position regarding the provision of swimming facilities at Sports Campus Ireland is that the feasibility of developing an aquatic centre for the Special Olympics as part of the campus is to be considered by the development company for decision by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and me.</P>
    <P>Regarding the meeting on 26 January referred to by Deputy Quinn this was a breakfast briefing hosted by the Taoiseach for representatives of the IRFU, GAA, FAI, OCI, National Community Games, Ireland Special Olympics, Athletic Association of Ireland and the Irish Sports Council. I also attended. All those present at the meeting welcomed the Government's decision to proceed with the development of Sports Campus Ireland and Stadium Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Taoiseach promise at the press conference on 26 January that he would place in the Oireachtas Library on that date a copy of the agreement between the State and the donor of the gift? Why did the Minister make a similar promise on 9 February? What was placed in the Oireachtas Library on 29 February was not the legal agreement between the State and the donor named by the Minister but a letter of assignation from the bankers, Pictet and Cie, Geneva, on behalf of an unknown client &ndash; there is no mention of a donor in the letter &ndash; confirming that 64 million euros would be paid to the Department of the Taoiseach. What was the reason for the long delay? Although the Taoiseach promised on 26 January that a copy of the agreement would be placed in the Oireachtas Library on that date&mdash;</P>

I seek a categorical assurance that a similar independent consultancy report will be compiled on the national stadium and its possible effect on Dublin Airport? Should the report be of a similar type will the Minister for Public Enterprise be as forthcoming in objecting to the new national stadium? There is another point which has been missed. It is stated in one of the appendices to the consultants' report on the national stadium that 15 stadiums world-wide were surveyed. It transpires&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister did not answer the second part of my question. Going on the consultants' report and nothing else, on average there was an overrun of 73.4% in respect of the 15 stadia surveyed. Would the Minister concede that in practical terms we are not talking about a stadium for £281 million plus £20 million but one which will cost well in excess of £0.5 billion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="69" /> Can the Minister categorically assure the House no rights will accrue to the donor of the £50 million <i>vis-à-vis</i> the trust which is to be set up or the company which is suggested in the consultants' report?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the last question is yes.</P>
      <P>On the cost of the stadia, I have also met people who have told me this is probably an overestimation of the cost. Many people would hold that opinion. The stadium at Cardiff cost approximately £60 million less than the proposed cost of Stadium Ireland.</P>
      <P>There may be additional costs. The costs may be underestimated or overestimated, but we will go ahead with it because this country needs a national stadium. Of course the costs are important, but £40 billion is being spent in the context of the national development plan, which amounts to pay-back time for the people for the good policies of successive Governments over the past ten years, and they should not quibble over £280 million for a sports infrastructure.</P>

Will he agree there is a serious possibility that the estimated cost of £280 million will be greatly exceeded? Just 20 minutes ago he threw the cost of a 50 metre pool onto the bill and he has not taken that into consideration. What about the removal of staff from Abbotstown? What about the in-built price of the land which is being used? That has not been built into the overall sum. Does the Minister agree the cost is approaching £400 million and with the escalation of costs it will increase to £500 million? With 2,000 applications for funding from clubs, some of which do not have running water, this is a scandal. Does the Minister agree we should refer this huge capital project to a special committee of the Dáil where it could be examined in the same way the Wembley Stadium project in England was subjected to scrutiny by an all-party committee? In the interests of Ireland, the taxpayer and sports people, I ask that this should be given the critical analysis it deserves rather than the off the wall statements which we are hearing from the Minister.</P>

In the context of his reply regarding the EU competition problems, the Minister spoke about the State not being allowed, if we were to follow this through, to build national galleries, museums, etc., but sport has become a highly competitive area and nowadays it is a commodity. I put it to him that there are commercial factors at play here, the situation is not as simplistic as he describes and there could be a serious problem in terms of competition law within the EU.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>The national development plan, published in November 1999, included a specific allocation of £150 million for a tourism marketing sub-programme over the period 2000 to 2006. The marketing sub-programme consists of two measures, a destination marketing measure and a niche marketing measure, to be funded from Ireland's first ever multi-annual tourism marketing fund. The main purpose of this fund is to finance the promotion and marketing internationally of Ireland as a tourism destination. Details of the activities envisaged are set out in paragraphs 6.97 &ndash; 6.100 of the national development plan.</P>
      <P>The first annual allocation under the fund has been incorporated in my Department's year 2000 Estimates &ndash; a provision of £14.4 million under a new subhead B.11. When taken with the total estimated budget of £6.5 million for the overseas tourism marketing initiative in 2000 and Bord Fáilte's current grant-in aid allocation of £23.5 million, I am satisfied that sufficient funding is available for the promotion of Irish tourism internationally this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin:</NameTxt>
      <P>We all agree that the peace process has contributed greatly to the increase in visitor numbers. The current state of the peace process should not be allowed to impede the momentum of successful cross-Border tourism co-operation. With that in mind the Irish Hotels Federation has called on the Minister and the Government to allocate £10 million now out <Col N="73" /> of the £20 million set aside for 2001 marketing to continue the OTMI. Does the Minister agree this is a reasonable request? As regards paragraph 6.100 is it proposed to make funding available to small operators to assist with IT marketing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the North-South institutions have come to an abrupt end. We were looking forward to working with them. There was a great deal of consensus on this area and we were looking forward to ironing out the difficulties that existed. The IHF pointed out that it was anxious we would go ahead with marketing. I assure the Deputy that Bord Fáilte is aware of that and we are putting plans in place. It is necessary for us to market for 2001 now. We must have a provision of at least that amount of money. This year we have £14.3 million and £14.4 million available to us. We will have up to £20 million available. I am fully aware of the Deputy's concerns and we will be acting on them.</P>

      <P>Paragraph 6.100 refers to small operators, bed and breakfast accommodation providers and so on, who are of central importance to tourism. Will the Minister include some funding for small operators so that they can become IT literate and be involved in marketing through the internet?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>Such operators are a vital part of the industry. Last year for the first time I provided £300,000 for the marketing of the smaller sector and this year I provided £500,000 towards marketing bed and breakfast accommodation, farmhouse accommodation, and so on. I hope that will include marketing in the IT sector.</P>

Will the Minister clarify brand Ireland as regards Northern Ireland and the cross-Border areas where Deputy Moynihan-Cronin has correctly stated the benefits cannot be seen?

      <P>As I mentioned earlier, the regional operational programmes under the national development plan are currently being drafted by the Department of Finance and I understand they will be finalised in the near future.</P>
      <P>Over £400 million has been allocated to my Department under the special sub-programme for social inclusion of the regional operational programmes. These moneys will be directed at activities currently carried out by the area based partnership companies and ADM supported community groups, the local drugs task forces and the development groups of the young peoples facilities and services fund.</P>
      <P>Actions will be supported under the social inclusion measures on the basis of integrated local action plans which will be drawn up in consultation with the director of community and enterprise and the city and county development boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment and wish him well.</P>
      <P>I do not think partnerships want to be merely another delivery mechanism as opposed to having a delivery and innovative role which will allow them, for example, establish pilot projects in their own areas. How will partnerships link in with other relative operational programmes at local level to ensure there is an integrated area based approach to tackling disadvantage? In reply to an earlier question the Minister spoke about the drugs task force. However, other disadvantaged areas may not need drugs task forces but rather transport, child care to allow women out to work, etc. Area based partnerships are concerned that they will be limited to solely delivering a small number of measures in the overall programme and will not be in a position to deal with issues on the ground in disadvantaged areas, particularly in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Moynihan-Cronin and thank her for wishing me well. There is a difference between urban and rural areas and <Col N="77" /> in many urban areas there is an overlap between drugs task forces and partnerships, although they are working together and doing much good work. Area based partnership companies have been advised that the current area based partnership structures will broadly continue as they are until the mid-term review of the programme in 2003. It is foreseen that the area based partnership companies, ADM supported community groups and other local agencies will work with the local director of community and enterprise and county and city development boards to bring about an agreed realignment of boundaries and work focus to comply with the recommendations of the report of the task force on the integration of local development and local development systems.</P>
      <P>We must ensure there is no overlap and that different groups work together to deliver the services about which the Deputy spoke. If they do not deliver the services then the entire structure will fall short of its goal. It is up to other groups to ensure the services being provided are mainstreamed or that partnerships are allowed get on with their job. Partnerships exist because various Departments and other authorities were not delivering the services in those areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>The recently published national development plan has as one of its core objectives the fostering of balanced regional development. Under the plan, the tourism sector will receive in excess of £350 million for tourism marketing, product development and training over the next seven years.</P>
      <P>During these years the strategy for tourism product development will be based on the needs of areas, having regard to whether they are developed, developing or undeveloped. One of the main priorities will be to support sustainable proposals to build up an interesting mix of tourism products through support for a small number of large scale tourism attractions and for the creation and completion of clusters of mainly existing, smaller scale attractions and facilities in prioritised developing or still undeveloped areas.</P>
      <P>The key marketing objectives in tourism under the plan are to increase tourism revenue and <i>per diem</i> visitor yield and to help the industry achieve a wider seasonal and regional distribution of tourist revenue, thereby contributing to sustainable development goals.</P>
      <P>The regional marketing objectives can be partially fulfilled by Bord Fáilte through destination promotion and will be supplemented by specific measures that can provide leverage in attracting visitors to specific regions, for example, encouragement and support for special niche products which benefit particular areas.</P>
      <P>During the past ten years growth in tourism has been unprecedented, with visitor numbers to Ireland doubling to almost six million and foreign exchange earnings tripling to over £2.3 billion. It is important to recognise that all regions have shared in this growth. However, there has been some variation in performance, in particular due to international industry trends, such as the growth in short breaks and urban tourism.</P>
      <P>Ultimately, it is the prerogative of the visitor to determine where he or she spends a holiday, but I assure Deputies that since becoming Minister one of my top priorities has been to facilitate a more balanced seasonal and regional spread of tourism revenues and this will continue to be a central policy goal during my remaining time in office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a lot of information to take in. The IHF's recent conference dealt with this. Concerns were voiced about our litter problem, which comes under the auspices of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Will the Minister in conjunction with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and tourism industry <Col N="79" /> interests, which would be more than helpful, co-ordinate a campaign to assist local authorities in making people aware of the litter problem? I recently travelled by train from Kerry to Dublin. It is a disgraceful how much rubbish is thrown on to railway lines given that many tourists travel by rail. We must admit that Ireland is not the clean country that is advertised and we should be concerned about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with the Deputy and this matter has been highlighted on a number of occasions by various people in the media, Members of the Oireachtas and the president of the IHF. Litter has become an embarrassment. All one has to do is go outside the gates of Leinster House and walk along the pavement and one will see at least a cigarette butt for every person in Dublin. I agree with the Deputy that litter has become a major problem and, while it does not necessarily come under my Department's remit, it has been one of the main areas of contention for those involved in tourism.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for littering does not seem to be taken by anyone. All of us seem to take it as a <i>fait accompli </i>and litter is accepted. However, Litter Pollution Acts are in place. I read some statistics recently and I may quote them incorrectly. However, I understand that while progress has been made, a number of years ago there were only two litter wardens in the Dublin Corporation area. At least now there are 20 but it is far short of the number required. How many litter wardens have local authorities appointed over the past number of years? All of us are guilty in this sense.</P>
      <P>Traffic wardens could overlap as litter wardens if necessary because the only way to deal with the litter problem is to enforce the Litter Pollution Acts. The Deputy will not park her car on a double yellow line in Dublin because she knows it will to towed. Unless something is done in terms of enforcement of litter laws, we will go nowhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the regions do not experience their fair share of tourism growth and that improved access to them is fundamental to the success of the tourism industry and the economy? Does he accept that the overcrowding and congestion experienced by tourists in urban areas influences them not to return? Does he further agree that people from the industrialised cities of the UK and Europe expect a clean, green, stress free environment when they visit Ireland but more and more that is not the reality because they cannot visit the regions? Does he accept that the problem will not be resolved by him alone and that there needs to be a move away from the compartmentalised approach to the many issues which face the tour<Col N="80" /> ism industry? Will he organise an interdepartmental think-in on all these issues? Dealing with one issue in isolation will not resolve the problem. A serious challenge faces us according to the preliminary results about which we were informed earlier.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite correct. I have tried and will continue to try to ensure that there is a level playing field for the regions. The seeds that we are sowing today will reap a benefit for the regions. Areas have not been recognised and marketed. The citizens of Cologne, Berlin, Paris and Rome do not necessarily want to visit Dublin and may prefer to visit other areas of Ireland. I have asked Bord Fáilte to focus on certain regions in large markets, such as Germany and France, to attract people because they are more likely to visit Irish regions. Every region and county has benefited dramatically since 1990. Dublin, Cork, Galway and Kerry have been the top earners from tourism, with dramatic increases in turnover, while Monaghan, Leitrim and Carlow are the bottom three in the league table. However, they are making themselves known as they have established county tourism boards. The Deputy's native county, Cork, has been very successful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Targeted marketing campaigns should be implemented, which highlight the favourable aspects of various areas which do not experience a high concentration of tourists. That should help them while taking the pressure off the most popular areas currently which cannot breathe in July and August.</P>
      <P>The local authorities would be delighted to appoint enough litter wardens if they were provided with the necessary funding. Will the Minister consult his colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, to make funding available as a priority to local authorities so that they can appoint sufficient litter wardens?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>The regional distribution of tourism is important. The IHF stated that certain areas of the north-west do not have a hotel. An incentive is available to promote the concept but more help is needed from the Department in terms of the promotion of regions which have not benefited to any extent from the recent economic boom. The Minister will realise that certain areas in the north-west have not benefited, excluding Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>Targeted campaigns are necessary. We must enter the French and German markets and target specific areas which match certain areas in Ireland and that is the only way Ireland will benefit. Since I allocated funding to the regional tourism authorities, they have entered the marketplace and they have benefited. The regional authority in the Sligo area is running an <Col N="81" /> excellent campaign on RTE currently and I have no doubt that it will bear fruit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the issue of litter wardens, discretionary funding is available to all local authorities, whether it is for signposting, etc., but this could be used to fund the appointment of litter wardens. All the regions have benefited from the tourism boom between 1990 and 1998. Tourism income in Dublin increased from £203 million to £474 million; from £74 million to £136 million in the south; from £136 million to £308 million in the south west; from £98 million to £187 million in the Shannon region; from £134 million to £220 million in the west; and from £78 million to £110 million in the north west. Certain regions have benefited to a far greater degree than others but they have all benefited to some extent.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>The sports capital programme for 2000 was advertised in early December 1999 with a closing date of 11 February 2000 for the receipt of completed applications. In excess of 1,600 applications were received and the initial processing of these applications has commenced. Until such time as the processing has been completed, I am not in a position to indicate the combined value or cost of these applications.</P>
      <P>Applications received under the programme will be evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria which are outlined in the guidelines which accompanied the application form. I hope to be in a position to announce the grant allocations by June 2000 at the latest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree it is most important that projects receive approval as speedily as possible so that construction work can start and be significantly advanced during the good summer weather? Can he give an assurance that every effort is being made to clear the approved applications as speedily as possible? <Col N="82" /> Will he indicate if his Department has any policy this year on giving priority to a particular sport or sports over other sports? Also, how much money will be available for grants this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree we should try to get the approvals out as soon as possible. That is the reason I approved the newspaper advertisements in December for publication in February. I hope to advertise again, if at all possible, towards the end of the year to be in a position to approve applications in January or February 2001. We should not prioritise one sport over another. We have to take into consideration the fact that, because of their size, certain sporting organisations receive more applications than others but each application will be judged on its individual merits. The amount of money available to me this year will be approximately £20 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that 1,600 applications were received. From my time in the Department I estimate that projects would be worth anything from £700 million or £800 million, yet only £20 million is available. How does the Minister reconcile the demand from organisations at grass roots level for basic facilities such as running water, sanitation and even electricity with the spending of £400 million on a stadium that will be used about six times a year? That is the crunch issue facing the Government and the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spoken about this matter before. Contractors find State sponsored contracts more difficult to deal with than those in the public service. There is a higher level of inspection and also a greater time lag on payment. Is there any reason the Minister could not direct the payment of grants to contractors when his inspectors have cleared the work? That could make some of these jobs more attractive to contractors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is merit in what the Deputy said and I would like to progress his suggestion further. I will look into this matter. If it will expedite matters and get more contractors in to do the work, the suggestion is worth pursuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>There appears to be a misunderstanding of the problem in that the Minister indicated that many people were unable to draw down the funds but that is due to the fact that they are getting so little money. In certain cases the contracts can cost up to £200,000 but they may get funding of only £10,000, less than 5% of the cost. Of a total of 50 applications from Sligo, only four received funding. This problem must not be allowed to recur but there seems to be a misunderstanding in relation to the cost involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the case when Deputy Allen was Minister. He allocated £9 million to 800 different projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tried to do the opposite. Last year I approved about 400 projects but I increased the amount of money we allocated. That is the change I made since Deputy Allen's time as Minister. Previously, counties which had a small population such as Sligo, Carlow, Leitrim and others were allocated money on a <i>per capita</i> basis. I am doing away with that to an extent in that I announced at the weekend that every county would receive a minimum of £200,000 this year and that subsequently the money would be allocated on a <i>per capita</i> basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from that, an allocation of £200,000 will only guarantee each application £4,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies, Senators and public representatives are the best people to guide me as to the priorities of a particular area. That is the reason I kept the national lottery funding within <Col N="84" /> the ministerial remit whereas Deputy Allen wants to give it to other areas. Public representatives are the people who know exactly what to do. That is why I have told my own colleagues, and the Deputy, that they must individually prioritise what is necessary. I will not give £4,000 to any one project. I will fund one, two or three decent projects so that there will not be abstract plans on someone's desk but a three dimensional project in place by the time the next applications are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is three years since I was in that ministry and the figures the Minister is quoting are mainly of his making. Does he accept it would require almost a team of accountants and experts to fill out the forms he is asking clubs, which are struggling to survive, to fill out? Does he agree that approximately 1,200 clubs were refused funding last year? Some of them do not even have the basic services of running water, sanitation or electricity and they would have been glad to spend £5,000 or £10,000 if they got it. If they got it, they would have had it spent the following morning because they serve young people who must undress and dress on the sides of ditches and roads. To try to say this problem has arisen because of the lack of contractors and workmen is like something out of cloud-cuckoo-land. The Minister is out of touch. He does not realise the basic difficulties faced by clubs. Will the Minister look at clubs in the most disadvantaged areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister has agreed that, in regard to future funding of applications in Sligo, he will consult Opposition Deputies and will take their recommendations on board. That is a welcome announcement which I very much appreciate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is Deputy Allen in the real world? Has the Deputy, who comes from a city, tried to ask somebody to do a little extension to his house, although perhaps he may not have to do that? He will not get anybody to do these extensions. These small clubs, which are trying to help themselves, must have local funding in place as well. If a small application for £10,000 is made, I may give it all to the club provided it is able to draw it down. It is not true that smaller clubs have no water. There have been tremendous improvements in the past ten years and the Deputy knows that. That is as a result of both Governments coming together.</P>

      <P>A report commissioned by CERT and published last year entitled &ldquo;Hospitality 2000&rdquo;, quantified the skills shortages facing the hotel and restaurant sectors up to 2005. This report highlighted two major challenges facing the industry, namely the recruitment of new entrants and the retention and development of existing staff.</P>
      <P>CERT has been working with industry partners to address the challenges set out in the report. Implementation of the recommendations will require industry to commit additional resources to develop and retain valuable staff and find ways to achieve excellence and improve productivity with the same or fewer people. A number of projects are already under way with a particular focus on recruiting women into the workforce.</P>
      <P>To broaden the recruitment focus within the industry, CERT has launched innovative pilot programmes targeting women wishing to work outside the home and the long-term unemployed. Each programme has been designed to meet the needs of the participants. In the case of women interested in going back to the workplace, the return to work programme is operated on a part-time basis to tie in with possible family responsibilities and it is envisaged that local hotels and restaurants will also offer flexible hours in a bid to attract this category of worker. The initial pilot programme took place last year and is being extended during the current year. It is expected that up to 500 women will receive training in 15 centres throughout the country and that this number will grow in future years.</P>

        <i>Additional Information.</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>Courses for the long-term unemployed have already been established by CERT in Ballymun, Clondalkin and Merchants Quay, all areas of high unemployment, in an effort to make it as easy as possible for people to avail of training and to enter the industry. All of these projects have been developed in conjunction with local employers and area partnerships and it is expected that all participants will have job offers on completion of training. More than half of participants on these special programmes for the long-term unemployed are women. Feasibility studies are being carried out by CERT for future similar projects in Sligo, Galway and Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CERT has also increased its recruitment efforts <Col N="86" /> among the unemployed, one of the traditional sources of labour, but one that is showing decline due to the buoyancy in the economy and the associated more competitive labour market. To promote careers in the tourism sector among this group and women wishing to return to work, CERT launched a travelling road show specifically aimed at the adult population. An information unit, advertised through local radio and newspapers, visited 15 locations in late November and December last year, providing information on elementary courses and conducting walk-in interviews. It is planned to repeat the road show during this year.</P>
    <P>It must be pointed out, however, that while CERT is providing tailor made programmes to attract women and the long-term unemployed, the industry itself must provide the necessary attractive and flexible working conditions to entice this target group to make a career in the hospitality sector.</P>

      <P>The Minister will agree we have a crisis in the tourism industry, that is, staff shortages. The reason is that people are not attracted to work in an industry with perceived long hours, bad pay and which is seasonal. Women, who are at home at present, would be a fantastic asset. What plans do the hotel and restaurant industry have to provide these people with flexible hours? Is it <i>ad hoc </i>or is it being done by the Irish Hotels Federation and the restaurants association? These plans must be made in a co-ordinated manner. They cannot be<i> ad hoc</i> because they will not work that way.</P>

      <P>CERT has asked the industry, as stated in the report, to identify the problems it has. The problem has been the unsociable hours which pertain in the industry. While the tourism industry is doing exceptionally well, there has been an image problem with the industry over the years. We are trying to invite certain categories of people, including the long-term unemployed and women, who would benefit from coming back into the workforce.</P>
      <P>CERT has taken initiatives and has advised the industry on working with women in terms of being more flexible with the hours it offers them. The industry will respond to that because it recognises that 200,000 people will be required in the next five or six years. We can do better and achieve greater productivity from our workforce. CERT and the industry recognise the problem and are working together. The matter is being handled in the best way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I always say indiscreet things, so there is nothing unusual about that. Does the Deputy mean today's indiscretion?</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell made the point about prudence when it comes to the budget and that if one added up a number of factors and made them all priorities, the total amount of money injected by way of tax refunds over the next two budgets would be such and such. The Deputy opposite talked about the various objectives a Minister for Finance and Government have to take on board when it comes to a budget, including being equitable and fair in the taxation system and other economic factors. He made good points which I acknowledged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was going to make an interesting point which has been at the back of the minds of Ministers for <Col N="88" /> Finance in recent years, including my own. It has been possible due to our economic success and the way the economy has been run over the past ten to 12 years to fulfil the taxation obligations and commitments under various programmes in the budget. Let us say the new programme is accepted by the social partners. I am not prejudging what will happen, I am just making a comment. If we assume the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is ratified by the unions and employers and comes into effect, it contains specific commitments on taxation. The previous programme contained even more specific commitments on taxation in terms of quantity as to what the sum must be. It was £925 million over three years. Deputy Noonan was part of the Government that negotiated that agreement. We were able to achieve £1.5 billion over three budgets.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the similar views Deputy McDowell and I might have on inflation, I wish to consider a situation whereby if other macro-economic considerations dictated to the Government and Minister for Finance of the day that, even though the Exchequer was buoyant and tax revenue would be good, the prudent action would be not to make taxation reductions this year or ultimately to increase taxation.  Deputy Noonan, having read Mr. Major's book, which I have not yet had the opportunity to read, said that happened in the late 1980s in the UK. If, on the one hand the Government was faced with honouring its commitments in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and, on the other hand, one had compelling advice that maybe the ultimate course of action would be to increase taxation &ndash; I am not saying that is likely to occur &ndash;  the Government would be faced with the dilemma of balancing the two aspects, judging whether the benefits of social partnership, which have helped grow the economy and keep down inflation, should be married with the other imperatives. I put forward that point for debate. We have not had a problem delivering on the various programmes and the commitments in them in recent years, but in the future it could come to pass that a Minister for Finance would be faced with that dilemma. One could be faced with delivering the commitments in a programme and with compelling advice, as Mr. Lawson had in the late 1980s, if that was the case to which the Deputy was referring. Balancing those two completing imperatives would not be easy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Where the debate started this morning, we tried to tease out what is likely to happen in terms of tax reductions during the course of the two and three-quarter years of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. I made the point that if the Minister did everything to which he is committed, that would cost in the region of £2.5 billion, give or take a £100 billion here or there. I gather the Minister has not dissented from that. He accepted that is broadly accurate in terms of a £5 minimum wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are already at the point where we have to choose. We are well within sight of a position where the choice will become much more difficult than it was this year for the Minister. I agree with the Minister, and on Second Stage I said that in terms of some of the advice we get from OECD and the Commission, and which we have got for several years, there seems to be a misunderstanding of the sort of economy we have. There is a general consensus in the House that is right, but at the same time we should not allow ourselves to be lulled into complacency about this. There are signs that inflation is becoming a genuine problem in terms of stoking up domestic demand and that wage rises are now at a higher rate than they were a year ago. We are predicting a 5.5% inflation rate for the year that started 1 January. The price of services in particular, which is very much a function of domestic demand, is increasing much more quickly than the average rate of inflation. There are signs already in the system that this is beginning to feed into an inflationary cycle and we all know what can happen if that takes root in any serious way. Quite apart from <Col N="90" /> anything else, within a short period it could undermine the competitiveness of our economy and the partnership process. I ask the Minister to examine a figure of £2.5 billion and to give me his reasoned opinion as to whether he thinks, purely in terms of the prudence of the argument, that will be an affordable amount over the next three budgets, and, if not, which parts of the commitments that have been made will fall by the wayside? That was the purpose of what I was trying to tease out this morning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's contribution was interesting about what the Minister of the day should do if the macro-economic situation dictated that it would be unsound or unsafe to give the tax relief committed. Even though this partnership agreement is more sophisticated than its predecessors, there are other elements which should be considered. The share option procedure and profit sharing need to be developed and refined much more. One refinement that could be made would be to offer people cashable paper rather than pay increases or tax relief, which could be cashed down the line when the economy is not as hot as it is now. There is a strong case to be made on the pay side for lump sum payments that would not impact on the wage base rather than annual increases or as well as annual increases in say, the public service. That would not affect the wage base and it is easier to take it out if things go wrong. Also, tax relief could be given in some kind of Exchequer bond form paid into a special savings account, which would be cashable in three or four years' time but which in the meantime would attract interest. Those are mechanisms that could be considered as general concepts, but they would need to be refined and negotiated.</P>
      <P>I take the point the Minister made. While this is a far more sophisticated document than its predecessors, it is more refined and it contains more policy decisions that are way outside the area of direct remuneration. However, the necessary macro-economic levers are not in place. In circumstances where the Minister and the Central Bank no longer control the exchange rate or interest rates, the only policy options are fiscal policy and wage policy. They are the Minister's primary tools of influencing macro-economic activity. He should try to refine the tools to the highest possible degree. He can only do that in peace time. Once the war breaks out it is too late to introduce these ideas because they will not run. He must put the levers in place in advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan has given this matter some thought. Some of the options he put forward can be and should be considered. The main limiting factor is that we have only one tool left to use in this area. As we do not have any control over exchange rates or interest rates, our only tool is budgetary policy. The Deputy put forward some ideas, which I am sure will be considered. The difficulty with these agreements is <Col N="91" /> that the Government of the day, irrespective of its composition, must keep its side of the bargain. It is unthinkable that the Government would not honour its commitments. Everybody else has the luxury of breaking some of their commitments, whether through unofficial strikes or whatever the case may be, but the Government must always fulfil its commitments to the letter. There will be interesting times ahead but I am not sure of the solution to these matters.</P>
      <P>The question of share options, paper and other ideas the Deputy put forward, can be considered but I hope we will not have to face these problems for a while. Sooner or later, however, they will have to be faced and it is inevitable that some day a Minister will have to face this dilemma.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is standard rated on the PAYE allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>All right. An increase in the PAYE allowance is being proposed and it is part of our portfolio of proposals. I recognise that additional expenses are incurred when two spouses, rather than one, work. When two people go out to work in the morning it is self-evident that there are additional expenses. When the PAYE allowance was introduced in the first instance it was supposed to reflect certain tax disadvantages which PAYE people would have over schedule D taxpayers. It is difficult to know the justification for the PAYE allowance now that the Minister has moved to individualisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the tax policy I brought forward, the proposal was that the PAYE allowance would be increased to £3,600 and standard rated from the £1,000 at which the Minister set it last year from the original £800 marginal rate which it was prior <Col N="92" /> to last year's budget. It is very difficult to justify the restriction of the PAYE allowance just to PAYE workers. There has been an ongoing lobby from self-employed persons and farmers that it should also apply to them. What is new now is that very significant numbers of young people working in the IFSC, for example, and to a certain degree in the information technology sector, are on contract. They are not PAYE people and they are not getting the PAYE allowance because of the manner in which their payment is constructed. This is becoming a big factor among the bright young set which we regard as the life-blood of the booming economy. It is reaching a point where, if the Minister is going to maintain the PAYE allowance, he will have to apply it to all taxpayers.</P>
    <P>If two people in a household go out to work there are extra costs. I am proposing that if the Minister lifts the £1,000 allowance to £3,600 one would get £3,600 at the standard rate rather than £1,000. To some degree, this would reflect the additional cost of one additional person in the household going to work. In its actual effect, there would not be much off what the Minister is proposing. There would not be a lot of difference between the 28 and 34 figures as regards pounds in people's pockets. However, as the Minister's proposal is taken into next year and the year after, it would steam well ahead of my modest proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to substantially increase the standard rate of PAYE allowance from £1,000 to £2,500, and to extend the allowance to the self-employed. The cost of the amendment is estimated to be £470 million in a full year. In addition to the 900,000 PAYE taxpayers already entitled to the allowance, it will benefit some 150,000 self-employed individuals as well as 63,200 proprietary directors.</P>
      <P>The PAYE allowance was introduced at the time of the tax protests in 1979 to compensate PAYE taxpayers for the fact that the self-employed enjoy a generally more favourable basis of taxation. For example, the self-employed are usually not taxed on the full current year basis, rather they are taxed on their profits in the year of account ending in the current tax year. Depending on the accounting date chosen, for example 30 April, they could in effect be charged with tax almost on a previous year basis. The PAYE taxpayers are, however, taxed on an actual current year basis. The self-employed have to pay a maximum 90% of liability in the tax year compared to 100% for PAYE taxpayers. The balance is not due for payment until 30 April the following year, that is over 12 months after the end of the tax year in which the income is chargeable. This means the self-employed, having the use of the money due in tax for a longer period, enjoy a more favourable tax collection regime than those within the ambit of PAYE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there are some restrictions in the area of <Col N="93" /> car and entertainment expenses, the self-employed generally enjoy more liberal reliefs for expenses than employees. The PAYE employee has to show that expenditure is necessarily incurred in the performance of his or her duties before a tax deduction is allowed, whereas a self-employed person has a somewhat less onerous obligation of showing that the expenditure was wholly and exclusively incurred.</P>
    <P>If this allowance, which has been in place for 20 years, was extended to the self-employed, the whole purpose would be defeated. Trade unions are likely to be opposed to extending the allowance to the self-employed as it is regarded as a distinguishing feature in the tax code between PAYE taxpayers, who pay the bulk of income tax, and other income tax payers.</P>
    <P>As well as extending the PAYE allowance to the self-employed, the Deputy also proposed to increase this allowance by 150% from £1,000 to £2,500, at a total combined cost of almost £500,000. I do not see this as the best way forward in reforming our tax system.</P>
    <P>While the Government is committed to increasing personal tax credits, the primary focus this year is on individualising, widening the standard band and reducing tax rates. As I have said many times previously, I will be happy to be judged on the combined effects of the five budgets I will have brought forward at the time of the next election.</P>
    <P>In 1979, when the PAYE allowance was first introduced, self-employed people were taxed on a previous year basis of assessment, but since the tax year 1988-89 they have been taxed on a current year basis. Depending on what date one's year end takes place, one can still effectively pay a long time in arrears. It is not as bad at the old previous year basis of assessment, but depending on one's year end one could effectively have a fairly long lead in period before paying taxes.</P>
    <P>Since 1988-89 the case has been made by the self-employed sector that since they are assessed on a current year basis the PAYE allowance should be extended to them. It is fair to say that the trade union movement regards the PAYE allowance as a unique feature relating to employees and I know all hell would break loose if it were extended to the self-employed sector. There is a cost element also, the figures of which I have already given.</P>
    <P>Each year when I meet ICTU before the budget &ndash; whether in the context of partnership this time, or just for pre-budget submissions &ndash;  it always emphasises this point and wants the PAYE allowance increased. If it was increased and given to the others, it would have a difficulty. On the other hand I readily recognise that with self-employed people now being assessed on a current year basis, the case for the differential is not as strong as it was in 1979. I wanted to point out that aspect of the issue.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raised the question of the increasing use of contract staff who are treated as self-employed persons. This is a feature of not only <Col N="94" /> contract staff in the IFSC, which the Deputy mentioned, but of staff in other areas of business. People cannot have it both ways. I receive representations from trade unions &ndash; not so much from Deputies &ndash; seeking to put a brake on people being self-employed. The building industry has always had a history of people sub-contracting, but they are effectively self-employed. Periodically I am asked about the construction industry and there is a ferocious lobby &ndash; some of it behind Deputy McDowell &ndash; seeking to stop this altogether. That has been ongoing for some time.</P>
    <P>In many industries management companies have made units self-employed. Some construction companies in Kildare made their haulage fleets self-employed as long ago as 1970 and I am sure the same applies to Dublin and Limerick. People became self-employed even though their main or only contract was with one company. That system benefited everyone, as a self-employed person would have a bigger financial burden in paying off loans on a vehicle, while the employing company, if that is the term, had fewer maintenance people as the self-employed person would repair a vehicle himself or get someone else to do it. The tendency in many of the industries mentioned by the Deputy has been in that direction.</P>
    <P>There has always been a debate as to whether such people are PRSI liable, but I recognise the change in work practices, particularly recently, and I have no problem with it. However, I wish to point out the down side of doing what the Deputy asks, which is considerable. I have answered the Deputy's questions as best I can, but there are considerations other than the cost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand. The Minister has less need to do so since the individualisation of the tax bands, but it was the one instrument of policy available to a Minister for Finance to focus relief on people at work as against focusing the relief on dependants also. The trade union movement would be opposed to its extension to the self-employed, but that movement's recent pre-budget submissions would always have advocated a very substantial increase in the PAYE allowance. ICTU's submission suggested increasing it to £3,000. My proposal was to go to £3,600, but obviously not in one budget, so the figure is pitched here at £2,500 for the purposes of debate. The Minister must now clarify, in the changed circumstances of his budgetary announcements, where he stands on the PAYE allowance. Does he intend increasing it dramatically in future, will he freeze it at £1,000 at the standard rate or, with individualisation in play, will he take the allowance off the table altogether in a future budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is also on increasingly thin legal ground with this allowance. The only reason it has not been challenged up to now is that £1,000 at the standard rate &ndash; which he is now introducing &ndash; is £220 per year and I do not think anyone is going to take him to the High Court for that. <Col N="95" /> However, if it is increased substantially the Minister will be challenged by a self-employed person or contract worker and he is on very thin ground. If it goes up to the figure I or ICTU have mentioned, he will be challenged. The Minister must clarify where he stands on the PAYE allowance. It is not clear to me whether he sees it as a permanent feature of the tax system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue has been teased out reasonably well. Deputy Noonan made the point about individualisation and we had a short debate this morning about giving extra assistance to couples when both spouses are working. One point that has been missed about individualisation as the Minister has chosen to implement it is that it affects only a minority of people. It affects only those earning enough to be able to use the full standard rate band and that still amounts to fewer than 40% of taxpayers and 35% or fewer income earners. If the Minister is seeking to give a break, as he said, to couples when both are earning, he must look elsewhere to ensure the benefit or stimulus is extended to the 60% of people who do not benefit from his individualisation proposal. That is where use of the PAYE allowance might be beneficial, as that would help everybody and not just those who earn more than £34,000 or £56,000 per year. In seeking to pursue his policy of giving a break to those who want to go out to work &ndash; I will not say getting people out to work &ndash; he needs to look at the PAYE allowance as well as the individualisation process on which he has already elaborated.</P>
      <P>I agree with what the Minister said about the trade unions guarding with some jealousy the specific arrangement that has been made for PAYE workers. That is a feature of their thinking. While their arguments are not as persuasive as they were 20 years ago, there are still grounds for this. It is still possible for self-employed people to write off as expenses costs that PAYE workers could incur but which are not allowable as expenses for them.</P>
      <P>I gave the Minister an example when I said that if I put up an office plaque stating &ldquo;Derek McDowell, Solicitor&rdquo; I could write it off against tax, but if I put up a plaque stating &ldquo;Derek McDowell, TD&rdquo; I could not because, as a Deputy, I am a PAYE worker. It is possible for the self-employed &ndash; quite legitimately and properly &ndash; to write off against tax certain costs they incur in their businesses, while PAYE workers do not have that facility. I am with the Minister in restricting this to PAYE workers, at least at the moment. In terms of giving people an extra impetus to work, he might look at this in the future.</P>
      <P>However, I hope his officials will tell me I can write off the cost of my constituency plaque.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage I referred to the thin ground on which we may be skating. <Col N="96" /> That factor was referred to by Deputy Noonan in terms of increasing this allowance substantially. He has referred to these matters already and I do not intend giving them any more impetus. Since we changed the basis of assessment in 1988-89, the justification for a large differential between the PAYE worker and the self-employed person as taxpayers is somewhat narrower. That must also be borne in mind. That also covers Deputy McDowell's point. Increasing this substantially, as the amendment proposes, would be likely to run into a legal challenge, which is another factor to be borne in mind.</P>
      <P>The cost of increasing the PAYE allowance without extending it to the self-employed would be £24 million per £100 increase. Bringing the PAYE allowance for PAYE taxpayers to £2,500 would cost £339 million and bringing the PAYE allowance to £3,600 for PAYE workers would be £480 million. The cost of increasing and extending the proposal to £470 million&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness refers to the treatment of work-related expenses and benefits. The Programme states:</P>
      <P>It is recognised that there can be situations where the tax treatment of work-related expenses and benefits under the current regime could lead to unintended effects. There are also important differences between the treatment of work-related expenses incurred by the self-employed and by employees. The social partners agree that the issues involved will be reviewed by the appropriate parties, including the Revenue Commissioners, ICTU and IBEC before Budget 2001.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;appropriate percentage&rdquo; in relation to a year of assessment means a percentage equal to the standard rate of tax for that year;</P>

    <P>(b) £5,000 in any other case.</P>

    <P>(i) an amount equal to the appropriate percentage of the specified amount in relation to the individual for that year, or</P>
    <P>(ii) the amount which reduces that income tax to nil.',&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We did not reach this amendment on Committee Stage but it was discussed briefly. The amendment seeks to isolate pension income in particular of which older people are in receipt in addition to any social welfare pension to which they might be entitled. It provides that additional tax credit or tax free allowance would be available to single people on the first £5,000 and to married couples on the first £10,000 of pension income. This issue has already been dealt with in some detail. There is an obvious difficulty where someone has a small occupational pension and the contributory PRSI pension is increased. This exposes an additional amount of the occupational pension to tax. Depending on the interaction of allowances and so on, it is possible that the end result will be that people do not receive much increase in the PRSI pension. Many older people resent the fact that having paid tax all their lives and contributed towards a pension fund, they receive a relatively small pension in the end or possibly their deceased spouse received a pension a part of which they now receive, and they still must pay tax on foot of this. My amendment seeks to acknowledge the frustration this causes and to make some gesture towards people who have a relatively small pension which would allow them to take £5,000 in the case of a single person and £10,000 in respect of a married couple free of tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide for an additional relief for those aged 65 years or more in respect of pension income. The form of the relief would be a standard rated allowance of £10,000 for a married couple and £5,000 for other pensioners. Income tax statistics do not distinguish between individ<Col N="98" /> uals who have income from pensions and from other sources. It is not, therefore, feasible to provide a precise cost for the amendment but it could conceivably cost up to £65 million in a full year, depending on absorption.</P>
      <P>Income tax is, to quote a former learned judge in the UK, &ldquo;a tax on income&rdquo;. As far as is possible, there should not be differentiation between different sources of income and this principle has been endorsed in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The measure of a person's liability to tax should be determined by the level of his or her income and personal circumstances and not the source of his or her income.</P>
      <P>The elderly already have favourable treatment under the income tax code, and rightly so. In addition to the normal personal reliefs, they are also entitled to an additional allowance, an age allowance. That allowance is being doubled in the current Bill from £800 to £1,600 for a married couple and from £400 to £800 for others. Also the elderly with low income are entitled to an enhanced exemption limit, which is being increased from £13,000 to £15,000 for a married couple and from £6,500 to £7,500 for other taxpayers. In accordance with the commitment in Partnership 2000 and now reiterated in the PPF, the Government will continue to review the income tax allowance and exemptions for those aged 65 and over with a view to further assisting the position of the aged.</P>
      <P>However, there is not a justifiable reason pension income as such should attract more favourable tax treatment than other income. The way to help the elderly is, as is Government policy, to remove as many of them as possible, particularly those on low incomes, from the tax net through the exemption limits. Those on higher incomes will benefit the same as other taxpayers through increases in the personal tax credits.</P>
      <P>With regard to the purpose of the amendment, it should not be lost sight of, that pensions are payable out of resources that have already received favourable tax treatment, that is, pension contributions are tax relieved and pension fund income is exempt. As a <i>quid pro quo</i> pension payments are taxable. If the relief now being sought in respect of the actual pension was conceded, it would call into question the continued relief for contributions and investment income. In all the circumstances, I reject the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand where Deputy McDowell is coming from in this regard. My approach has been to increase the exemption limits. When in Opposition, I put some of these points to my predecessor, but to no avail. However, in my budgets to date I have increased the exemption limits by more than two-thirds and I will continue to do so. This will take as many ordinary pensioners as possible out of the tax net. Deputy McDowell is seeking that where a single person over the age of 65 is in receipt of an occupational pension, a State pension and other income, £5,000 of the pension should be exempt. This would not be the proper way to go about this because it would only <Col N="99" /> benefit high income earners, people who would have substantial pension increases. When I put this proposal to my predecessor, I had in mind people in County Kildare who were employees of Bord na Móna and the ESB. These industries were major employers in my county up until recently. It was terribly messy when employees who received pensions from these sources received bills at the end of the year and their tax allowances were reduced by the amount of their social welfare pension. It was difficult to explain to these people why all the form filling had to be done. My approach is to deal with this issue by way of exemption limits. I would like to complete the exemption limits plan before I consider other options.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to occupational pension funds and the principle of EET whereby one receives tax relief on money being put in. When it is in the fund one receives tax relief and the money is taxed when it is withdrawn. This principle has been in operation for quite some time in relation to pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, except in relation to lumps sums which are tax free. I understand what Deputy McDowell is trying to achieve but I think increasing exemption limits is a more equitable way of dealing with the generality of ordinary pensioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that increasing exemption limits is a more straightforward way of doing this because it would apply to all income. I was seeking to ring fence it for reasons of costs more so than anything else. I do not have a great deal of sympathy for people in receipt of rental income, deposit income or whatever who happen to be over the age of 65. However, there is a difficulty, particularly given the way increases in PRSI pensions interact with the taxation system and the possibility of another occupational pension and where some of it might be clawed back by local authorities if these people happen to be local authority tenants. I was seeking to cater for that detailed problem which nonetheless affects thousands of people. I accept the same effect could be achieved by increasing the exemption limits but that would obviously cost a great deal more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke about EET. I heard that argument being made, not least by his predecessor, on a number of occasions. On the face of it, it has a superficial appeal. It certainly would appeal to people in Revenue. However, it is not easy to explain to someone over the age of 65 that because he got tax relief all those decades ago, he must now be taxed. I found myself on more than one occasion trying to make such a case to people, which is not easily received or understood. However, I still believe there is a case for taking out pension income in particular <Col N="100" /> and providing a tax credit in respect of this. I accept the same effect could be achieved, though at greater expense, by increasing the exemption limit.</P>

      <P>In page 18, line 34, to delete &ldquo;£1,600&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£2,500&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment was not reached on Committee Stage. It was tabled largely for discussion purposes and it seeks to increase the tax free allowance to people who have incapacitated children. This is part of the carer's allowance argument. The simple way to deal with this is to extend the carer's allowance either without a means test or to loosen the means test so that it is available to virtually anyone, whether working or not, who is in a caring position. This is the simplest way to deal with the various situations. I tabled the amendment because it deals with a particular allowance which has been in the tax code for some time but which has not been increased. The Minister's changes this year, as I understand them, simply deal with the effects of standard rating and do not increase the value of the allowance to the taxpayer. I tabled this amendment to ascertain see what future the Minister sees for this allowance, whether he sees it as being incorporated as part of a greater carer's allowance or incorporated into the new allowance he introduced this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments seek to increase the allowance available to taxpayers in respect of an incapacitated child maintained by him or her from £1,600 as proposed in the Bill to £2,500 and to increase from £2,100 to £3,000 the level of income which a child may have in his or her own right before any restriction in allowance comes into operation. The cost of these amendments would be £1.9 million in a full year. In this Bill I am providing that the allowance in respect of an incapacitated child will be doubled from the current level of £800 to £1,600 and will, in future, be available at the standard rate of tax only. This provision is in keeping with the commitment I gave last year to provide that all secondary allowances, including an incapacitated child allowance, would be standard rated to accommodate the transition to a full tax credit system which will be put in place for the income tax year commencing 6 April 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The doubling of the incapacitated child allowance will be of particular benefit to standard rate taxpayers who will see their tax allowance increase from £192 to £352, an increase of over 80%. The total tax deduction provided for in the Finance Bill comes to over £1 billion and has been used in various ways to remove low income <Col N="101" /> people from the tax net and to provide significant tax deductions for others. I do not have any further resources to give away this year.</P>
    <P>However, the Deputy will be aware that an incapacitated child can be a dependent person for the purposes of the £3,000 home carer's allowance provided for in section 12. I regard the current limit of £2,100 as satisfactory and do not propose to increase it. Consequently, I am not prepared to accept the Deputy's amendments.</P>
    <P>I said on Committee Stage that I intend to review all the allowances in the caring area &ndash; the incapacitated child allowance, dependent relative allowance and so on &ndash; not with a view to disadvantaging anybody but to introduce rationalisation with a view to achieving the same result by a simpler mechanism. I intend to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a discussion on that issue on Committee Stage. I reiterate that in the review we need to look at people with a taxable income and those without a taxable income. It would be wholly unfair if we were to simply give additional advantage to those who have a taxable income, or whose spouses have a taxable income, and ignore the position of those who do not. Provided we focus on that difficulty I do not have a problem with the Minister's suggestion.</P>

      <P>We had a reasonable debate on this matter on Committee Stage. It deals with the provision of tax relief on personal donations to charities other than Third World charities. The Minister indicated on Committee Stage that he was favourably disposed towards proposals in this area. I think he was of the view that he had been taken advantage of by the lobby groups in so far as he did not expect them back at his door looking for more at this early stage. Nonetheless, he said he was well disposed towards the amendment.

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes that the tax relief for individual donations to Third World charities should be extended to include all the charitable organisations which are currently approved for the purposes of corporate donations under section 486A. This latter provision covers both domestic and Third World charities. The effect of this amendment would be to extend tax relief to donations to domestic charities. The tax relief in section 848 for personal donations to designated Third World charities was introduced in 1995 to mark the 150th anniversary of the Famine and the recognition of the particular type and scale of the human tragedy in the Third World. The Minister for Finance made it clear at the time that it was not the intention to extend tax relief to domestic charities.</P>
      <P>In 1998, following representations from the Irish charities tax reform group, I introduced the tax relief in section 486A for corporate donations to charities. When I agreed to introduce this particular relief I did so on the explicit understanding that it would not be extended to personal donations. The reform group, which was delighted with my response to its representations, accepted this and indicated it would not press for its extension to cover personal donations. As indicated to the select committee last week, l am disappointed to note that this is precisely what it is now seeking.</P>
      <P>In common with other Members I have the greatest admiration for the work done by Irish charities at home and abroad. We should actively encourage people to give to charities and if the tax system can facilitate this then it should do so. However, there is no proper regulation and supervision of charities. I understand my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, proposes to bring forward legislation later in the year which will provide a statutory basis for this. Once that has been done I am prepared to give further consideration to the question of tax relief for personal donations to domestic charities. Meanwhile, I am not prepared to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am well disposed to the charity sector here and I recognise the work that has been done. I availed of the opportunity on Committee Stage to explain the background to this request. When my predecessor introduced the Third World charities relief it was specifically limited to Third World charities and he said it would not be extended to the private sector. Immediately after that the Irish charities tax reform group started to lobby for tax relief for corporate donations. I am sure I tabled an amendment when in Opposition and I promised I would do something about in Government and I did. The group specifically <Col N="103" /> sought tax relief for corporate donations and we put in place exactly what it sought.</P>
    <P>The group volunteered, without being asked, that it would not seek tax relief for personal donations. I did not impose this upon them, they volunteered it as part of the lobbying exercise. Following the granting of the relief &ndash; I do not know what controversy I was involved in after the 1998 Finance Bill &ndash; the chairperson was very appreciative and went public and thanked me for so doing. I am astounded that inside two years the group has come back requesting something it said it would not seek. I want to meet the persons in the relevant organisations to ask if they are the same people who volunteered not to seek this relief before next year. I want to look them straight in the eye to hear what they have to say. I have not met them, only intermediaries on their behalf through Opposition backbench Deputies.</P>
    <P>I promised also on Committee Stage that officials of my Department and Revenue would look at all these areas &ndash; Third World charities, corporate donations, donations to universities and other approved gifts which I sanction occasionally &ndash; with a view to some rationalisation. I do not intend to disadvantage any of the reliefs but I want to see if we can make it universal. Despite what I have said about the Irish charities tax reform group and its commitment I am still prepared to look favourably on this idea and hopefully to bring forward a proposal in next year's budget and Finance Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice of allowing tax relief on personal donations is prevalent in the United States and in other countries. The Minister would merely be following the example of those countries in allowing tax relief here. Numerous charities in Ireland depend on personal donations. For a cost to the Exchequer of between £3 million and £5 million charities could receive £17 million. This would be a major boost to the services they provide, many of which should be provided by the statutory agencies.</P>
      <P>Charities such as Shelter provide services for people with mental and physical health problems. I recently helped to raise funds for the association which funds research into meningitis and I was astounded to learn how little support it receives from statutory agencies. Organisations of that sort need large donations to continue the work which the Government ought to be doing. I hope the Minister will consider the contribution made by voluntary organisations when he reviews the proposals in this amendment.</P>
      <P>Charities should be allowed to reclaim VAT on buildings, consultancy fees, marketing, advertising and so on. The Finance Bill does not address this question but I ask the Minister, when reviewing the question of tax relief on charitable donations, to consider the question of VAT payments by charities.</P>

      <P>As the Minister knows, that legislation has been a long time in preparation. I hope this issue will be postponed until the broader legislation is available.</P>
      <P>As part of the tax relief scheme for corporate donations, the Revenue certifies that particular charities are entitled to receive donations under that scheme. I understand that more than 300 of the 7,000 charities that are otherwise registered have been certified as relevant charities for the purpose of the corporate donation scheme. I see no reason the same system of certification could not be extended to personal donations.</P>
      <P>When the scheme was extended to corporate donations for domestic charities, why did the Minister choose not to extend it to personal donations as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners do not regulate charities. They come under the remit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is ten years since the Costello report was published and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform hopes to bring forward a Bill later in the year. I know this has been said before but I am assured it will happen this year. There is a need to regulate charities. One of the main reasons for not extending the scheme to personal donations was the absence of regulation. The other reason was that I was not asked to do so. The Third World charities reform group lobbied me to extend tax relief to corporate donations. It specifically requested that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the chairperson at the time came to see me on a few occasions and did not make that case. The group was quite clear that it wanted relief extended to corporate donations. The reasons for not extending relief to personal donations were the same then as they are now. Cost would be involved and there might be a difficulty with regard to regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the amount of money raised in the United States by having a tax regime favourable to charities. Charity is a big business in the United States and both corporations and individuals contribute large amounts of money. However, the United States is a very wealthy country with a population of more than 240 million. I am not averse to charities being well regulated or to establishing a tax system which would encourage charitable donations. Nevertheless, I was taken aback when the Third World charities <Col N="105" /> reform group came back so soon, even though it had not mentioned this point when it sought the previous change. It originally made its request regarding relief on corporate donations when Deputy Quinn was Minister for Finance. When I was appointed Minister I fulfilled my promise to meet its request. I am well disposed to this question and I hope to rationalise this area and to examine its request before next year's Finance Bill. I hope by then the intended response of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will have been published but the publication of that Department's Bill is not a condition of my looking at this matter favourably.</P>

      <P>This amendment concerns the tax allowance provided by section 467 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, which caters for the situation where a taxpayer employs a carer to look after himself or herself or another family member, including a spouse and the cared for person, who is totally incapacitated by mental or physical infirmity. The relief, which is given at the taxpayer's marginal tax rate, is available in respect of expenditure up to £8,500 in respect of each incapacitated person.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment would be to ensure that the carer need only be employed for part of a tax year in order that the relief would apply. The amendment is prompted by representations by the carers association to Deputy McDowell and me, for such a change in the law. The request for a change in the law appears however to be the result of a misunderstanding as to the requirements and administration of the relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated to Deputy McDowell in the select committee last week, it is not necessary for the care to be provided for the full year. The carer may be employed for part only of the year, as is now being proposed by this amendment, but it is a statutory requirement that the total incapacity must exist throughout the year. However, if the total incapacity occurs during a tax year, in <Col N="106" /> practice a claim would not be refused. Similarly, if the incapacitated person were to die during the year, relief would not be withdrawn for that year.</P>
    <P>I therefore think that as the position sought to be achieved by the amendment already obtains, there is no need for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 24, lines 17 and 18, to delete &ldquo;(other than the spouse of a qualifying claimant)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These are amendments to the section which introduces the new £3,000 stay at home spouse allowance which was introduced by the Minister to balance the perceived inequities in his proposal to individualise the tax bands. As a balancing measure it is targeted at a different category. As Deputy McDowell indicated, the individualisation proposal only benefits those who are being removed from the higher tax rate band. There is also a perceived advantage in future years as the Minister's plans progress.</P>
      <P>The allowance is targeted at stay at home spouses exercising a caring function. Because of the speed at which it was introduced and because it was announced without great reflection it is extremely anomalous. I have tabled the amendments to try to remove one of the principal anomalies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two concepts running in parallel, the first of which is that the working partner of the stay at home spouse should be entitled to an additional personal allowance of £3,000 in respect of the person who stays at home provided he or she is exercising a caring function. In all circumstances one may only qualify if there are three <Col N="107" /> people involved. In circumstances where there are just two people involved one cannot avail of the allowance. Yesterday I was contacted by a retired school principal who is in receipt of a pension and caring full time for his spouse. He cannot avail of the allowance because there is no third person. If there was a third person in the house such as a child or elderly relative that would be sufficient to trigger the allowance.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 22 indicates a case that would be considered common in Ireland. It seeks to have the allowance paid to the working spouse in circumstances where another relative is performing the caring function. As proposed, if a mother decides to stay at home to look after her daughter her husband at work will get the £3,000. If the daughter stays at home to look after her mother, the sole earner, her father, will not receive the allowance. The Minister cannot stand over this.</P>
    <P>There is an anomaly which has to be removed. The problem is that in all circumstances the allowance is only available where there are three people involved &ndash; the two spouses and a third party in respect of whom the stay at home spouse must be exercising a caring function. There are situations where there are only two people involved and the caring function has to be exercised to the best of their ability and they are deprived of the allowance.</P>
    <P>I cited another example on Committee Stage, the case of a husband who was the sole wage earner but who can no longer work due to illness or incapacity. His spouse has had to become the sole wage earner. She works as a nurse in the local hospital. Because of the nature of the profession she has to work unsocial hours and perform the caring function to the best of her ability in addition to the cooking, cleaning, washing and shopping. Because it is her husband who is incapacitated and deemed to be the stay at home spouse she does not qualify for the allowance. There is no third party. This is very unfair.</P>
    <P>I am not claiming to be an expert parliamentary draftsman but the intent of amendment No. 22 is clear. In circumstances where a spouse is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity and where there is a residential carer &ndash; usually a family member, although this is not stated in the amendment &ndash; the spouse who is the sole income earner for the family should qualify for the £3,000 allowance. It is not beyond the ingenuity of the Minister and his officials to construct an amendment which would bring such categories into the loop of the allowance. Even at this late stage the Minister should seriously consider this. The cost implications would not be huge. I would even accept a situation where a relative would be nominated &ndash; a son, daughter, son-in-law or daughter-in-law &ndash; but it is more than an anomaly; there is an unfairness, inequity and injustice in the way this is constructed.</P>
    <P>There are many other things I could say about the £3,000 allowance which is an ill-considered <Col N="108" /> imposition on the tax structure. It does not fit in easily and a future Minister will either modify or take it out. I do not want to go back over the circumstances which gave rise to it. I appreciate that it took the sting out of the individualisation proposals for some families. To that extent it was good politics but good politics is not always good tax law.</P>
    <P>The Minister has opened up what I consider to be an area of injustice and will receive strong submissions in relation to it. Members of this and the other House will have people at the door of their clinics when they apply for the allowance. The brochure issued by the Revenue Commissioners is very useful which is reflected in the tax certificates issued but others are being refused. I was contacted by a couple from the west in recent days who thought they were entitled to the allowance but who have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners by letter that they do not qualify as there needs to be a third party. In the case in question the husband is looking after his wife. They were astounded at this. It will increasingly be a hot issue and we have until 1 p.m. tomorrow to do something about it. I strongly advise the Minister to table an amendment along the lines suggested to include this category in the benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I understood the Minister indicated on Committee Stage that he would give some consideration to the issue before today. I take it, given that we do not have an amendment before us, that he has at least for the moment rejected the proposal. That is a pity.</P>
      <P>The genesis of the carer's allowance is of some importance. As Deputy Noonan said, we have been around that block several times and I do not want to take us around it again but the reality is that the Minister would probably have been better off and created fewer anomalies if he had provided an additional £3,000 allowance in circumstances where only one spouse was working, the primary purpose of introducing the allowance in the first place. The primary purpose was to rebalance but the Minister chose instead to limit the cost by looking to introduce this caring requirement. He has done so in a way that produces as few anomalies as possible.</P>
      <P>The examples given by Deputy Noonan indicate genuine anomalies. I cannot image that many people find themselves in this position or that it would cost the Exchequer an undue amount to extend the definition of the caring function in the way proposed by Deputy Noonan. I unreservedly support the amendment and I hope the Minister can still find his way to introduce an amendment along similar lines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments relate to the new home carer's allowance which is provided for in section 12. The person being cared for &ndash; the dependent person &ndash; is defined to mean a child for whom social welfare child bene<Col N="109" /> fit is payable, a person aged 65 or over, or a person permanently incapacitated by mental or physical infirmity. The spouse of the claimant is specifically excluded from this definition.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 21 is designed, to facilitate amendment No. 22, to set aside the exclusion of a dependent spouse from the scope of the relief. Amendment No. 22 proposes to introduce a further category of dependent person so as to bring within the relief an incapacitated spouse who is cared for by somebody other than the qualifying claimant.</P>
      <P>This proposal was discussed in some detail on Committee Stage last week and I have considered it again in the meantime. It is worth reminding the House, as I did on Committee Stage, that this measure was introduced to specifically recognise the role of spouses who work in the home caring for children, the aged or handicapped persons. The emphasis is on care being provided by the spouse in the home.</P>
      <P>It was never envisaged that this allowance would be available where a person other than a claimant or his or her spouse would be providing the care or where one spouse is incapacitated. Section 467 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, is specifically designed to deal with the situation where a taxpayer employs a carer to look after himself or herself or another family member, including a spouse, who is totally incapacitated. There is relief &ndash; at marginal tax rates &ndash; for expenditure of up to £8,500 per annum in that instance and the employed person can be another family member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it was accepted last week by Deputy Noonan that this offered a technical solution, he seemed to think it might not work in practice in a family situation where, for example, a father might be reluctant or not want to pay his daughter to look after her mother. I do not subscribe to that proposition. The experience of Revenue, particularly in regard to the dependent relative allowance in past years, is that taxpayers are more willing to avail of tax reliefs than social welfare assistance. While I have some sympathy with the kind of case for which the amendment is designed to cater, I must re-state that the change being proposed is not in keeping with the underlying reasoning behind the home carer's allowance which, as I have indicated on many occasions, was intended to cater for a couple where one worked outside the home while the other cared for a dependent person. In the cir<Col N="110" /> cumstances, I am not prepared to accept the amendments.</P>
    <P>However, I gave notice on Committee Stage last week that there are a number of areas in the tax code which I intend to examine in the coming 12 months with a view to streamlining and rationalising them. This will include various reliefs in the area of caring, such as the £8,500 allowance I have just mentioned for the employment of a carer to look after an incapacitated person, the dependent relative allowance and nursing home expenses in the context of relief on medical expenses. I will examine the type of case prompting this amendment in the context of this overall review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is very unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>I want to clear up a technical matter. In drafting this amendment I thought it was necessary to remove references to spouses in lines 17 and 18. The intention was that other amendment would be in order. I do not mean it as a separate proposal. Therefore, I will not press amendment No. 21, but I will press amendment No. 22.</P>

      <P>If the father is on the top rate, he should employ the daughter to care for the incapacitated mother and pay her £4,700, for which the father will get relief at 44%, which is significantly better than the £3,000 allowance at 22%. Even if the father is paying tax at 22%, he will still get relief at 22% on £4,700, while the daughter will pay no tax, assuming she has no other income. That is free tax avoidance advice we are giving out during the course of the Finance Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We had some debate on this on Committee Stage and I do not intend detaining the House in respect of these amendments. They deal basically with rent allowance and I am anxious to establish the principle of equality of treatment for those who rent and those who buy. Traditionally we have given additional tax benefits to those who buy their own home and, while that is fair, we have a responsibility, including from the point of view of housing policy, to people in the rented sector. The principle behind the amendments is to establish equality of treatment between those seeking to buy and those seeking to rent. The <Col N="113" /> effect of the amendment is to increase the amount of rent which can be set off against tax to bring it in line with mortgage interest relief.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments relate to section 473 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, which grants relief on rent paid by individuals in respect of private rented accommodation. Currently, the level of rent qualifying for relief is dependent on one's marital status and age &ndash; under 55 years or 55 years of age and over. The effect of Deputy McDowell's amendments would be to introduce a single limit irrespective of marital status but with different limits for those under 55 years of age and those aged 55 years and over. There would also be an increase for all over the limits proposed in the Bill. The cost is estimated at £36.5 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage Deputy McDowell indicated that his amendments were prompted by the desire to see equality of treatment between people buying and renting houses. However, while acknowledging the rationale and logic of the proposal, I have to reject it on grounds of cost. As the House is aware, the full year cost of the tax reductions already provided for in the Bill is estimated to be over £1 billion and that is all that can be afforded this year. However, as I indicated on Committee Stage, I will see what I can do in future years on this matter.</P>

      <P>This amendment is intended to focus the benefit of mortgage interest relief on first time buyers. It is fair to say that most of our housing policy in terms of the interaction of tax and the provision of grants has been intended primarily to stimulate the construction industry over the years. We are clearly in a position where the construction industry does not need tax relief in order to be stimulated because significant profits can be made by builders and developers. However, we have a difficulty with one type of buyer, namely, the first time buyer, who deserves particular support. The purpose of the amendment is to give preferential treatment to first time buyers in terms of mortgage interest relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are similar to the amendments the Deputy tabled on Committee Stage. They seek to increase the upper limit of mortgage relief available for first time home purchasers from £5,000 to £6,000 for mar<Col N="114" /> ried and widowed persons and from £2,500 to £3,000 for single persons. First time mortgage holders are allowed claim 100% relief at the standard rate of income tax on interest paid on home loans. The cost of Deputy McDowell's proposal is estimated at £4.5 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I propose to introduce with effect from 1 April 2001 new arrangements for the deduction of mortgage interest relief at source. This will be a much more efficient way of dealing with mortgage and medical interest relief and will do away with much of the paperwork. In addition, it will ensure a 100% take up for mortgage interest relief. As a lead in to these new proposals, this year I am simplifying and streamlining the current arrangements relating to mortgage interest relief to make it easier and less complicated for financial institutions to operate the new deduction at source system. In the case of non-first time mortgage holders, I propose to abolish the 80% rule and the deductions of £100 for single and widowed persons and £200 for married persons. In future, non-first time mortgage holders will be entitled to a ceiling of interest reliefs of £2,000 for single and £4,000 for married persons. In the case of first time purchasers, I propose to leave the existing limits of £2,500 for single and £5,000 for married couples, but to extend the married limit to widowed persons.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell suggested on Committee Stage that a scheme of mortgage interest relief should be amended to be more generous to first time mortgage holders. While currently I have no strong views on this, the scheme already favours first time purchasers by up to 25%. I may revisit this matter when the system of deduction at source is up and running. This year, however, my concern in respect of mortgage interest relief is to streamline the system to accommodate the transition to deduction of relief at source. In the circumstances I am not prepared to accept the Deputy's amendments.</P>

      <P>The amendment relates to section 21 of the Bill which introduces a new tax relief, namely, relief on post-graduate fees paid in publicly funded colleges here and in the EU, and in private colleges in the State. The amendment proposes widening the scope of the measure to include publicly funded colleges in the USA, or universities or similar institutions elsewhere approved by the Minister for Education and Science. Since the introduction of the free fees initiative, a number of tax reliefs have been introduced for undergraduate students who have to pay fees. In 1995 tax relief at a standard rate was made available for full-time undergraduate courses in private colleges in the State. Since 1996 tax relief has also been available for part-time undergraduate courses in private and publicly funded colleges in the State, while last year relief was introduced for full-time undergraduate courses in publicly funded colleges in other EU members states.</P>
      <P>As I stated on Committee Stage, the introduction of tax relief for the postgraduate fees was intended to mirror broadly what was available to undergraduates. The institutions which qualify in the context of undergraduates are those which are situated here and in the EU. Students in third level colleges in other EU member states can only obtain relief if the college is publicly funded. We have very little information on the funding of universities in America.</P>
      <P>In Ireland private colleges and their courses must be approved by the Minister for Education and Science. Similarly, private colleges and their courses in other countries must be approved by some authority, such as the Minister for Education and Science. Our understanding is that the Minister does not have the capacity to approve a large number of colleges or their courses in other countries, such as the United States. It is also felt that it is likely that post-graduate students in America would be in receipt of a scholarship in respect of their fees. As I mentioned on Committee Stage, I propose to examine tax reliefs for undergraduate and post-graduate fees with a view to rationalising the relevant sections before the next budget. I can then fully consider all the points raised by the Deputies today and on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I referred to the trend whereby a number of US universities are seeking to entice Irish graduates to study there and when I visited the US two weeks I came across this. American universities are very interested in what is happening in Ireland and are attracted by the high quality graduates here. US institutions and industries are trying to lure Irish post-graduates to conduct research. I welcome the Minister's proposal to examine this issue because it is not straightforward. However, it provides a new opportunity for graduates which we probably do not yet fully appreciate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not treat this departure lightly in terms of maintaining Ireland's current rate of <Col N="116" /> development and highly educated workforce, retaining our competitiveness and improving the calibre of our workers at whatever level. The amendment was not tabled for the sake of it and the Minister's officials should examine the bigger picture and not reflect on the small cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend before next year's Finance Bill to rationalise the tax rules relating to this area because, since Deputy Quinn started the ball rolling in regard to these reliefs a number of years ago at my behest, I extended them last year to non-Irish publicly funded courses and I introduced post-graduate relief this year. However, different rules relate to some of them and I intend to rationalise them next year and in that context I am prepared to refer to the matters raised by Deputy Deenihan earlier and on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>There is an added difficulty because this series of reliefs is confined to publicly funded colleges in Ireland or in other EU member states. As we understand it, the US colleges are not publicly funded. The reliefs that exist for undergraduate fees relate to courses approved by the Minister for Education and Science. He is not in a position to extrapolate that principle to approve courses in the US and, therefore, cannot undertake the work. However, I am disposed to making further changes in this area next year.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to what I term the &ldquo;rolling forward&rdquo; of the relief. For example, if an individual undertook a full-time post-graduate course, had to borrow money and was not employed for three or four years, the cost of the fees in years one, two and three would be lost under the present arrangement because he would not have taxable income to offset the fees. I am sympathetic to carrying forward that relief so that such individuals could offset fees against their income during their first years of employment. I will also examine that in the context of next year's budget and Finance Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a lame enough reply to a serious proposition and if the Minister reflects on it we should encourage our brighter graduates to undertake post-graduate work in the US. The direction of the free market and the world economy will be largely dependent on developments in information technology and the US is at the cutting edge of such technology. We should have an active policy of encouraging graduates to study in US universities and it is shortsighted to reject the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undergraduate tax relief provisions only apply in this jurisdiction and in Europe but tax relief should follow practice. It is not the norm for large numbers of undergraduates to study in the US. A handful of Irish graduates avail of scholarships to specific universities but a large number of graduates undertake post-graduate work in the US and, while some are on scholarships, others are not. It <Col N="117" /> is a trend which should be encouraged in terms of industrial development.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that the Minister for Education and Science does not have the capacity to carry out this work or that his officials and himself would have to spend inordinate time on this. If I had three hours, I could outline 95% of the colleges in the US where it would be appropriate to provide this relief. Some, such as the great Ivy League colleges, are privately funded through fees or trusts but every state in America has a state university and I would be surprised if they were not publicly funded. The officials who are advising the Minister, whether they are from his own Department or the Department of Education and Science, are making excuses and could not be bothered. The US is transparent in regard to its institutions. Any intelligent undergraduate could quickly put a list together of approved universities for the Minister.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to stipulate a condition whereby the tax relief would not be provided automatically, as I have proposed, for any recognised college in the US and wants to provide that the Minister for Education and Science should approve each application individually, an enormous amount of work would not be involved. At the end of the day, if somebody applies to the Department and states that he or she is undertaking post-graduate work at Harvard University and wishes to make a tax claim on his or her fees, great consideration would not be needed to sign off on it. There will be obscure third level institutions in remote parts of the US about which the Minister for Education and Science might be unsure in terms of reputation. However, we are in the excuse business. This is a serious and valid proposal which should be considered.</P>

    <P>Both these amendments relate to approved profit sharing schemes and employee share ownership trusts. These amendments relate to amendments to the Finance Bill which I introduced on Committee Stage last week. Those amendments provide that certain time periods in relation to approved profit sharing schemes and ESOP's can be reduced by ministerial order. Deputy Noonan expressed a general concern about tax changes being made by order and wondered if the power to make orders could be time limited. While I share the Deputy's general concern about tax changes by order, the provisions I introduced last week, which are merely enabling powers, are regarded as a desirable facility in the context of approved profit sharing schemes and ESOP's. It is not possible to say if and when it might be required. In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate to limit the period within which the power may be exercised. However, to deal with Deputy Noonan's concern, I am providing, under the present amendments, that no orders can be made until such time as a draft of them has been laid before and approved by the Dáil.

      <P>In page 52, before line 1, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;24.&ndash;The Principal Act is amended in section 128 by the insertion after subsection (2) of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(2A) Notwithstanding any other provisions, where a person realises a gain by the exercise of a right obtained by the person on or after the 6th day of April, 1986, the person shall, in so far as the gain arises from the exercise of rights which, where granted, amounted to not more in value than 5 times that person's emoluments for the year of assessment when the rights were granted, be taxable at the rate specified in section 28(3).'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Currently the gains made on shares on which employees have options is liable to tax under the income tax code. The type of employee who normally gets share options would be on the higher rate of tax, the proposed 44%. This amendment would enable persons to get five times their annual salary in shares and, up to that value, the tax would be capital gains tax rather than the higher marginal rate of income tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister is gathering his thoughts, we had some discussion about this matter on Committee Stage but I want to restate the principle which I attempted to articulate on Committee Stage. I am not opposed to this amendment as such, but there is a danger of tak<Col N="120" /> ing too restrictive a view of the application of share options, share trusts and the various other gain sharing arrangements that can be made. We should only go this route provided we do it with the intention of encouraging greater financial participation by all employees in the company in which they work. Not everybody will want to take up financial participation and not everybody will be eligible. I do not have a problem with restricting this measure to people who have been in the company for a period of six months, a year, 18 months or whatever. Nonetheless, the broad principle must be clearly established that it should be available to all workers in a particular place of employment and should not be simply a means whereby favoured employees can be given a golden handshake, which is effectively a means of remunerating them in a particular way. If companies in whatever sector want to retain employees who are particularly valuable, they can pay them and pay tax on that in the normal way.</P>

      <P>On Second Stage I referred to both gain sharing and profit sharing. Whereas the Minister made a promising start in last year's Finance Bill, it was not continued to any great extent in this Bill. Nevertheless, the changes the Minister has introduced this year will help.</P>
      <P>In regard to this amendment, some people contacted me on the issue of motivation. As the Minister knows, employees taking a stake in a company is a growing trend. It is happening throughout the country, particularly here in Dublin. The new indigenous companies are very much based on the principle of profit sharing and gain sharing as a motivational factor for employees. Before people even agree to join a company they demand a stake in the company but they know that if they are to gain from this at a later stage, they must not be penalised. This rather simple amendment would send out the right message to the workers who are actively encouraged to participate in various companies throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage, I introduced a number of changes to the current taxation treatment of share options, principally providing an option to employees to defer payment of the income tax charge arising on the exercise of a share option. The details of these changes are in section 27.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in the select committee last week, when Deputies Noonan and Deenihan moved a similar amendment, the new Programme for Prosperity and Fairness recognises the importance of various forms of employee financial participation, including share options and gain sharing, in developing and deepening partnership and in increasing performance and competitiveness. The PPF proposes that a consultative committee, involving ICTU, IBEC and appropriate Government Departments and agencies, be established to prepare proposals for consideration in the context of budget 2001. The <Col N="121" /> committee has already been established and had its first meeting on 16 February. I await with interest and will give careful consideration to the outcome of its deliberations.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, while I would not be unsympathetic to some form of income tax relief for share options, the Deputy's amendment is premature at this stage and I cannot accept it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan referred to motivation of employees. We spoke about this matter for a considerable length of time on Committee Stage and, as the Deputies will gather, I am disposed to making some significant change in this area in time to come. A number of aspects must be borne in mind, however, and Deputy McDowell alluded to some of those. We had a share option system in tax law from the mid-1980s to the 1992 Finance Act when one of my predecessors, the current Taoiseach, decided to abandon it primarily on the basis that share options were being used by major institutions, particularly in the financial area, to reward their high-ranking employees. As I pointed out on many previous occasions, there must be a balance between different categories of employees, perhaps of the same standing. We must try to ensure equity among all taxpayers and to give incentives to people in particular areas.</P>
    <P>I readily recognise, and Deputies Noonan and Deenihan have made the case, that part of the success of the technology industry in the United States was grounded on very attractive share option schemes which effectively ask an employee to take a chance on the expectation that the business will grow, that it will be floated on the stock exchange and everybody will do well. The case has been put to me that in order to attract employees back to Ireland to work in this area, and to hold on to the employees already here while keeping salaries reasonably low, a proper share option scheme should be put in place.</P>
    <P>A very worthwhile document was prepared last year by the software association section of IBEC in which these ideas are put forward. I recognise the arguments made in that regard and have some sympathy for them. On the other hand, if we are to have a new scheme of share options, we do not want it abused as it was in the past. Perhaps &ldquo;abused&rdquo; is too strong a term but it was used to limit the income tax liabilities of very high salaried employees and ensure they had very attractive share options.</P>
    <P>Some ground rules on profit sharing were laid down in recent years, the basis of which were that everybody should be entitled to participate &ndash; from the head of the company to the person letting people in at the front gate. Some people are of the view, and I understand some of the reasons for the differentiation, that share options are in a different category to gain or profit sharing. Many of these particular companies have never made a profit, so it is not profit sharing, because profits have not been made, but the expectation of profits which might be around the corner.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out on Committee Stage, there must be equity between taxpayers. If two people <Col N="122" /> left the same educational institution at 20 years of age with the same degrees and one happened to work in the Department of Finance and the other in one of these technology companies, one can avail of share options schemes which will be at a lower rate of tax &ndash; there is debate on what the level of tax should be &ndash; while the other has to pay tax at 46%, or 44% after 6 April 2001. There should be equity between the same class of taxpayer.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised, however, that we have discriminated in the tax code, not only in Ireland but in other tax codes, for generations in order to encourage people to engage in different forms of business and to incentivise them. The argument is that if one does not incentivise people to do other things, there will be no jobs for people in other areas. That balance must be struck as well.</P>
    <P>We had hoped that during the discussions on the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness the discussion on this area could be advanced. Although it was, it was not advanced enough to allow anything to be brought forward. It was agreed that all these issues would be considered by a consultative committee comprising ICTU, the relevant Departments and agencies to report before next year's budget. I hope it will be able to come forward with new initiatives in this area.</P>
    <P>There is some merit in the idea put forward by Deputy Deenihan and Deputy Noonan on Committee Stage for a certain form of share options relating to a person's salary and perhaps it will be considered by this committee. The best thing is to allow the consultative committee to get on with its work. I hope that in next year's budget and Finance Bill, I will be able to introduce an overall scheme.</P>

      <P>In page 52, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Section 261 of the Principal Act is amended by the substitution for subparagraph (i) of paragraph (c) of the following:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(i) the amount of any payment of relevant interest shall be regarded as income chargeable to tax under Case IV of Schedule D, and under no other Case or Schedule, and shall be taken into account in computing the total income of the person entitled to that amount, but, in relation to such a person (being an individual)&ndash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(I) except for the purposes of a claim to repayment under section 267(3), the specified amount within the meaning of section 187 or 188 shall, as respects the year of assessment for which he or she is to be charged to income tax in respect <Col N="123" /> of the relevant interest, be increased by the amount of that payment,</P>
    <P>(II) the part of taxable income on which he or she is charged to income tax at the standard rate for that year shall be increased by the part of such relevant interest which comes within paragraph (b) or the definition of &ldquo;appropriate tax&rdquo; in section 256(1), and</P>
    <P>(III) as respects any part of relevant interest which comes within paragraph (c) of the definition of &ldquo;appropriate tax&rdquo; in section 256(1), the person shall be chargeable to tax at the rate at which tax was deducted from that relevant interest,</P>
    <P>and'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a technical amendment to make certain consequential changes to the DIRT legislation following the imposition of a 25% rate of DIRT on certain long-term deposits. The reason for the 25% DIRT rate is to mirror the rate of tax which is being imposed by sections 53 and 58 of the Bill on the proceeds of similar investment products, namely, certain life policies and certain investment funds.</P>
    <P>The amendment introduces a new subsection (2) into section 28. This subsection makes a technical amendment to section 261 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, to include in that section a reference to the new rate of tax on DIRT interest provided for by subsection (1) of section 28. Of necessity, this involves replicating substantial parts of the existing text unchanged. The only real change being effected is to introduce a new clause (III) into the provision which ensures that a reference to the DIRT interest to which the new higher rate of DIRT will apply is included in section 261.</P>

      <P>In page 73, line 49, after &ldquo;that&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in his or her opinion&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These three amendments relate to section 30, as amended on Committee Stage, which deals with dividend withholding tax. Currently, if a non-resident company is to qualify for DWT exemption from 6 April next, the company auditor must give a signed certificate certifying, in a case where the company is resident in a relevant territory, that is, another EU member state or a country with which Ireland has a double taxation treaty, that the company is not controlled by Irish residents or that the company is ultimately controlled by residents of relevant territories or that the company is a company whose principal class of shares <Col N="124" /> is substantially and regularly traded on a stock exchange in a relevant territory, or a 75% subsidiary of such a company, or a company which is wholly owned by two or more such companies.</P>
    <P>Representations have been made to me by the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies in Ireland about the requirement for an auditor to certify compliance with these tests. The CCABI is concerned that certification implies a degree of factual certainty which no examination of systems and records can normally provide. It suggested that instead the auditor should give a report, in the form of an opinion, on compliance with the various tests.</P>
    <P>However, under the DWT legislation the auditors' certificates have a five year period of validity for the purposes of qualification by a company for exemption from DWT. Legally speaking, it is doubtful whether a report, as opposed to a certificate, could be said to have a period of validity. Nonetheless, I and the Revenue are anxious to keep compliance obligations and expenses associated with obtaining DWT exemption to a minimum.</P>
    <P>In this spirit, the Revenue Commissioners considered that the concerns of the CCABI could be met by retaining the requirement for an auditor to give a certificate but providing that the certificate would be given on the basis of the auditor's opinion. In other words, the certificate would certify that, in the opinion of the auditor, the recipient of the dividend met the test for exemption from DWT. Revenue has consulted the CCABI on the matter which has indicated that it would be amenable to this compromise. The amendments now before the House will, in effect, allow the auditors to form opinions as to whether a company meets the test for exemption from DWT based on persuasive evidence gathered on a sample basis and from discussions with company directors. I commend the amendments to the House.</P>

      <P>We do not want to create a position where, effectively, the opinion becomes almost worthless.

      <P>If one looks at a normal auditor's certificate on the accounts of a company, one will see the word &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; or, that &ldquo;in the opinion of the auditor he has formed a true and fair view&rdquo;. In order to form an opinion on the true and fair view, he has to satisfy himself when going through the books and records that he can do so. The same considerations apply in forming his opinion on this matter. This brings us back to the point made by Deputy Noonan in that an auditor could write that he is satisfied and has formed an opinion but if it is subsequently found that he had not carried out any tests from which to form that opinion he would be in serious difficulty with the accountancy profession and the Revenue Commissioners. If he formed his opinion in such a way, it would not be worth anything. In order to form an opinion, one must look at the background.</P>

    <P>Deputy Kenny has the primary interest in this matter. This is a proposal to extend the date to which projects in the catchment of Knock Airport enjoy the tax breaks that were allocated to that series of developments. This relief has not lived up to expectations. More time would be justified in ascertaining if the difference in the economic circumstances now together with the tax breaks would deliver the original intention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seeks to extend the termination date for the scheme of capital allowances related to qualifying buildings located at certain enterprise areas adjacent to the regional airports. The tax relief for areas adjacent to regional airports was approved by the EU Commission in February 1998 with an end date of 31 December 1999. At that stage the Commission requested the Irish authorities to submit details of individual projects to the Commission for approval by it.</P>
      <P>A total of two projects were submitted to my Department for referral to the Commission. The first, a business park in Cork Airport, was approved on 7 July 1999 and the second, a cargo building operation at Knock Airport, was approved on 2 December 1999.</P>
      <P>We have secured informal approval by the EU Commission for a one year extension to 31 December 2000 in respect of capital allowances for both projects. That is a generous concession by the EU Commission, when one considers the recent changes in the Commission's policy regarding State aids.</P>
      <P>I remind Deputies that our present difficulties with the Commission regarding tax reliefs can be traced back initially to the issue of tax relief for regional airports. I regret, therefore, that I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted Deputy Noonan used the phrase &ldquo;This relief has not lived up to expectations.&rdquo;  Irrespective of whether it did, it certainly lived up to the political expectations because Fine Gael succeeded in getting three of the five seats in Mayo in the last general election. Notwithstanding my respect for and long-standing friendship with Deputy Kenny, as I pointed out on previous occasions, he contributed inadvertently to the greatest number of man hours in recent years spent in the Department of Finance in dealing with the Commission on taxation problems. They can be attributed to the wonderful headline that appeared in a Sunday newspaper to the effect that Knock Airport would become another Shannon, which some kind person sent to the EU Commission. Bad and all as it was up to then, when the Commission thought we were going to have another Shannon relief type scheme, it put matters into a spin and we have been trying to deal with taxation queries from the EU commission from that date. I disagree with Deputy Noonan that the relief did not live up to expectations because it secured three seats for the Fine <Col N="127" /> Gael Party in the last election. Some good came out of it.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;(b) in respect of an administrative county, the council of the county concerned,',&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposes to amend section 42. Section 42, as inserted, makes a number of amendments to Chapter 3 of Part X of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, in so far as it deals with enterprise areas and multi-storey carparks. In relation to multi-storey carparks, section 42 contains an amendment of section 44 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, to include the county councils of Kildare, Meath and Wicklow in the definition of the relevant local authority so that these councils could issue certificates in relation to qualifying multi-storey car parks.</P>
      <P>It was pointed out by Deputy Fleming on examination on the section on Committee Stage that there may be further projects in urban centres where a county council rather than a corporation or urban district council would be the local authority involved. I undertook to broaden the definition of the relevant local authority to cater for these. The amendment implements the commitment I gave in this regard on Committee Stage. I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for accepting a suggestion I put forward on Committee Stage when we had a detailed discussion on this issue. As much of it was in private session, it is not on record. I highlighted this position on Committee Stage because due to an anomaly Portlaoise, which is a very large provincial town, was excluded from the provisions of the section. An amendment was proposed on Committee Stage because Portlaoise is not categorised as an urban district council. It is classified as a town commission, but its population would be far greater than many of the other urban district councils. The Minister agreed to favourably consider a proposal to include towns such as Portlaoise and other major urban areas and he has brought forward a measure which is the most practical way of achieving that by including the administrative <Col N="129" /> county of all county councils that are not otherwise included in the original sections dealing with this matter.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for tabling this amendment. This provision will greatly assist in alleviating traffic congestion and in addressing parking needs in Portlaoise. It will facilitate and speed up the development of a multi-storey car park, which is intended to proceed in that area and which will be of major benefit.

      <P>(c) in relation to any building or structure or qualifying premises which is provided for the purposes of a project, the regional aid for which is limited under the &lsquo;Multisectoral framework on regional aid for large investment projects prepared by the Commission of the European Communities.&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 45 proposes to amend section <Col N="130" /> 45 which contains a number of amendments in relation to the rural renewal scheme.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 94 proposes to amend section 89 which provides a scheme of tax incentives for the renewal of small towns throughout the country.</P>
    <P>One of the provisions contained in all three sections is a restriction in line with European Commission requirements on the availability of capital allowances for business premises in use in the sectors of agriculture, transport, steel, shipbuilding, synthetic fibres and financial services, and in the coal, fishing and motor vehicle industries. As originally drafted, the restriction on the availability of capital allowances would have applied regardless of whether the person who incurred the expenditure was active in the various sectors or industries. For example, an investor leasing a building to a person involved in one of these sectors or industries would be denied capital allowances, even though he or she may have no connection with the actual sector or industry.</P>
    <P>The effect of these amendments is to confine the restriction on the availability of capital allowances to situations where the person who incurred the expenditure is the person who is acting in one of the various sectors or industries I have listed.</P>
    <P>I commend these amendments to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming:</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister on introducing this amendment which arises directly from a discussion on Committee Stage. Amendment No. 94 seeks to amend section 89, while amendments Nos. 44 and 45 are consequential to ensure consistency between the various urban renewal schemes. These schemes were originally drafted with the major cities in mind and it was understandable that they would exempt properties involved in marketing agricultural products. That has not created a problem up to now. As we are now extending these incentives to small rural towns, however, we might find that DIY and general merchant stores that are involved in the areas qualifying for the urban renewal tax designation scheme, might also be involved in marketing agricultural products. They might, thus, be inadvertently excluded from this scheme.</P>
      <P>The Minister has agreed to this point in the amendments which only exempt buildings if those types of businesses are carried out wholly or mainly in those areas. Some of these shops can have an element of that type of business but the entire premises will not now be excluded from the scheme. The Minister has correctly amended the schemes for major urban areas to make them consistent with what is proposed for small rural towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 89 is the most important part of the Bill for many rural towns. More than 100 such towns will qualify for renewal under this scheme. These tax incentive schemes have provided major benefits in the main cities and all the major provincial towns, so much so that it was having a negative impact on the smaller rural towns in County <Col N="131" /> Laois, such as Mountrath. Rathdowney, Portarlington and Mountmellick. Expenditure and investment in these areas was being sucked into larger towns like Portlaoise. This section will provide an opportunity for people to reinvest funds in their own areas and rejuvenate towns that are badly in need of investment. The same applies to every county.</P>
    <P>Today, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government informed me that in about two months' time he will be in a position to announce the areas in each of the designated towns that will be included in this scheme. With the Finance Act in place by then, I hope people will be able to avail of these incentives at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister will be clarifying through the European Commission whether this section exempts buildings where a person is involved in the financial services sector. I have sought clarification on that point to know if it includes accountancy practices and similar services. They are not what I would consider the normal financial banking services, but that matter has yet to be clarified. I look forward to receiving word on that in due course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made by Deputy Fleming on Committee Stage was that the section, if not amended, would have precluded people in agricultural or financial services. Therefore, we re-examined it. The reason it was there in the first place was to comply with an EU directive. We have now drafted the section so that the investor will get the reliefs if he leases the property to somebody else in those areas. It is taking a legal interpretation of the EU directive. We do not expect any shipbuilding to take place in Mountrath at the moment, but one never knows. It is taken that the allowances will be available to the investor. We have accommodated Deputy Fleming who raised this point on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>In page 94, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(iii)by the substitution for the definition of &lsquo;relevant deduction' of the following definition:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;relevant deduction' means a deduction of an amount equal to 100 per cent of the relevant investment in respect of a film where the total cost of production does not exceed £4,000,000 and 80 per cent where the total cost of production of a film is in excess of £4,000,000;',&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is aimed at boosting the film industry. I realise the Minister has made a commitment to continue section 48(1) for another three years, but he will probably have to do more than that. In a way, he is accepting a large percentage of the proposals contained in the amendments I tabled on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go over the same ground again, but the Irish film industry is under increasing pressure from competitors such as the British film industry which has improved its position considerably over the past four years. The Dutch came here to examine our film industry and saw that we were attracting major blockbusters by virtue of the fact that we had an attractive tax package. California itself is now offering enhanced packages to try to encourage film makers to make their films there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland was acquiring a major international reputation as a filming location through films like &ldquo;Braveheart&rdquo;, &ldquo;Saving Private Ryan&rdquo; and many more. Unfortunately, however, the uncertainty <Col N="133" /> that was created last year by the lack of commitment to continue section 48(1) at that time, certainly did not help the situation. In Britain, large sums of lottery money are being thrown at the film industry which makes the situation even more difficult.</P>
    <P>The amendment seeks a 100% tax write-off, but I realise the Minister cannot grant that. However, the film industry would like to be compensated for the reduction in the top rate of tax. Perhaps the Minister could consider raising the 80% figure to 82%, which would compensate for the reduction. I realise that 100% may be too much to expect. The Minister could implement it in the Seanad, but he would have to come back to the Dáil again. That would be acceptable.</P>
    <P>The Minister has accommodated the substance of amendment No. 47 in his own amendments and I thank him for that. It means that for films budgeted under £4 million people can claim tax relief on 66% of the total production and on 55% for films costing more than that. That will no doubt be welcomed by the film industry &ndash; that is what they are seeking. Is it possible for the Minister to accept an increase from 80% to 82%? He will probably come under pressure from his contacts in the film industry to do so and if he provided for the increase tonight he would not have to come back here to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>There were two primary purposes associated with this relief, the first of which was to have films made in Ireland, with the increased profile that gives a country and the consequent spin-offs. The other intended effect was an increase in ancillary employment in Ireland. The Minister should tell us about the effectiveness of the relief in increasing ancillary employment in supporting film production in Ireland. I am not convinced it has been as successful as we had hoped on that score.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 46 seeks to have 100% of the personal investment allowed in films deducted for tax purposes when the film has a budget of £4 million or less. At present a deduction of 80% is allowed no matter what the budget is. Based on the number of such films made in 1999, that proposal would have cost approximately £2 million. I am not convinced expenditure by the Exchequer of such moneys would generate a return of any significance, either in economic terms or in terms of encouraging the film industry. With present interest rates the return for investors in films is attractive when existing tax relief is taken into account. I have extended the relief this year by a further five years; when previous extensions were given they were for a maximum of three years. Extending it by five years was a significant gesture to the film industry and will allow people to plan ahead. It is part of a package of measures agreed by the Government for the film industry following the report of the film think tank and the presentation to the Government of proposals for a strategic <Col N="134" /> plan for the film industry by my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. I understand these plans are being worked on in her Department and include an extended role and increased resources for the Irish Film Board and closer co-operation between the industrial agencies of State in the further development and strengthening of the industry.</P>
      <P>I understand that while 1999 was a disappointing year, in that levels of production were lower than in 1998, the signs for 2000 are encouraging and the industry is making good use of the extension of section 481. However, I do not want to see overheating, as that would be counterproductive and in the medium term would damage the competitiveness of this increasingly important sector. While the physical and skills base is sizeable and growing, it is not unlimited. The ideal is to facilitate the organic growth of the industry. I understand that during a recent visit to Los Angeles, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands received a positive response from the studios and film industry there. I am confident the measures approved by Government are sufficient to ensure the continued, orderly growth of the industry.</P>
      <P>I have examined internal Department of Finance reports prior to my previous budgets and I was very conversant with this relief. I was amazed at the return a person could get with no hassle or exposure. The proposed tax return is approximately 17% per annum and I have no evidence that the 80% relief is making film investment unattractive. In 1999 a total of 28 films with budgets under £4 million were made; this was out of a total of 35. In each of the previous years the number was 20 out of a total of 32. I cannot sanction an Exchequer cost of £2 million on that basis and must reject this amendment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deenihan's second amendment proposes that the amount of a film budget which should be eligible for tax relief be increased by 10% in the case of all films and not just films made in the winter, as is the case at present. This proposal is based on one of the recommendations of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and I advised Deputy Deenihan on Committee Stage that I would give this proposal serious consideration I have done so and am bringing forward 12 amendments to give this extra 10% uplift. Amendments Nos. 57, 59 and 60 appear to be alternatives to the previous amendment. As I have accepted amendment No. 47 in principle, I assume these amendments will not now be pressed.</P>

      <P>We have had various reports from Fitzpatrick's and Indecon &ndash; though they are the same company as far as I know. The evidence seems to be that the smaller films, which tend to be Irish, are doing fine. The Deputy asked what the measure has done for employment and I can send him the various reports on that. I was lobbied by film industry workers who were out of work before Christmas. Before the budget they were very anxious that some of this film relief could be restored. Any information or reports on film employment will be sent to the Deputy. As I have said previously, particularly in the debate on last year's Finance Bill, there is no parallel in the tax code for the investor's tax break here. It is guaranteed money for old rope.</P>

      <P>That was not the purpose of my question. We should not lose sight of what the relief was intended to do. Obviously we all benefit from the increased profile associated which large international films made in Ireland. However, this was also intended to stimulate employment for Irish actors and those providing support services to film-making in Ireland. It is important that we test the relief against the delivery on that score also. I am aware of the reports mentioned by the Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose dealing with amendments Nos. 48 to 56, inclusive, 58 and 61 together. I advised Deputy Deenihan to consider his Committee Stage amendment which sought to raise the amount of film finance which would be eligible for tax relief under section 481. These amendments increase the amount of tax relief financing which can be raised for a film project by 10%. The percentage of the film cost eligible for section 481 relief now ranges from 55% to 66% subject to a maximum <Col N="136" /> of £8.25 million. The special provision for films produced during the winter months has been abolished in the sense that it is now available all year round. The last amendment makes the commencement of the section subject to an order to be made by me. This is because an extension of this scheme would have to be approved by Brussels though I do not foresee any difficulties in that regard. I commend the amendments to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>Goraibh maith agat, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. Tá áthas orm labhairt ar an díospóireacht seo. Tá an cheist thábhachtach seo faoi dheireadh a chur le caitheamh tobac á phlé againn agus déanaim comhgháirdeas leis an Teachta Shatter agus Fine Gael as an Bille a chur os comhair na Dála.</P>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Shatter and the Fine Gael Party on bringing this Bill before the House. It is timely following the publication of the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children. It has no doubt contributed to the announcement by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, that he will publish the Health (Amendment) Bill within the next fortnight. Having had for a time departmental responsibility for the anti-smoking campaign &ndash; I recall the Leas-Cheann Comhairle introduced the first anti-smoking legislation &ndash; I have a great interest in this area. I was a smoker when I was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Health. Obviously I had to cease smoking and I have not smoked for more than five years. During my period in the Department of Health, like all converts, I became more and more opposed to smoking. The medical evidence and research spoke for itself. There are 6,000 deaths annually from smoking-induced ailments, whether respiratory or cardiovascular. There were also negative effects in relation to illness and reduced quality of life. I look to the day when tobacco smoking will be a thing of the past. However, like all desirable objectives, its achievement is easier said than done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that environmental regulations and legislation aimed at eliminating smoking are enforceable. If not, there is little point in introducing them in the first instance. I have misgivings about banning the sale of tobacco products to those under the age of 18. The sale of alcohol to those under 18 years of age has long been pro<Col N="137" /> hibited, yet it still happens to a considerable extent. The idea that the State should seek to prohibit alcohol or tobacco is laudable but enforcement requires extensive resources. Is the Government willing to provide these resources? There is a significant school of thought that supports the premise that price is the most effective mechanism in the fight against smoking. There is merit in this argument but, human nature being what it is, the position is not that simple. There is a very real danger that if tobacco becomes too expensive on the legitimate market, the possibility of the purchasing of tobacco going underground becomes all the greater. Prohibition of the sale of alcohol in the US brought about a plethora of anti-social consequences and was eventually abandoned. Balance is the key to success.</P>
    <P>It appears the trend among young people in taking up the smoking habit is on the increase. It also seems that life skills programmes seeking to induce young people not to take up the habit have had little or no impact. It is clear that strong action is called for. However, in pursuing that strong action, the State must avoid creating the forbidden fruit syndrome which is always the most sought after. The trend in the increase in young people, particularly girls, taking up the habit in increasing numbers begs the question what is the attraction? I recall one piece of qualitative research into why girls take up the habit which found that peer pressure was the major reason. To be effective in influencing young people not to take up the habit, the ultimate consequences of smoking must be illustrated to them in a stark manner which will impact. Lecturing young people seldom brings worthwhile results. A multifaceted approach is how the best level of success will be attained.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his statement yesterday spoke about smoking in public houses. I agree there should be talks with the vintners organisations. During my time in the Department there were efforts to set up a working group between the vintners organisations and the Department to develop this aspect of environmental regulations in relation to smoking. Many people nowadays do not like going to public houses and waking up the next morning with a smell of nicotine off their clothes, hair and so on. Substantial progress can be made in this area and the Minister should, by way of working group with the vintners organisations, explore the possibility of introducing new environmental regulations. Obviously if this proves unsuccessful, the Minister would have to deal with the matter from his own position given the advice from within the Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a ban on sponsorship of Irish sporting events by tobacco companies. I compliment the Minister on taking this progressive position. However, alcohol must be examined in this context. I am concerned that where sporting success is being celebrated, all too often it is accompanied by the consumption of alcohol. Alcohol advertising surrounds many sporting activities in Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="138" /> On anti-smoking campaigns, the ultimate objective is the eventual elimination of smoking. We need to focus on the positive aspects which include improvement in the quality of life for many people. We must bear in mind that it not just smokers who are affected but also those in close proximity to smokers. It has been well established that smoking has consequences for those who smoke and for passive smokers. There is the issue of life expectancy. We are all aware that there will never be sufficient resources in terms of the health service. However, if the resources now being used to deal with illnesses which arise as a result of smoking can be significantly reduced, there will be a great saving to hospital care services and those resources can be applied to other areas of health care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputies McGuinness, O'Flynn, Fleming, Pat Carey and Michael Moynihan.</P>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Shatter on his work commitment as rapporteur to the Joint Committee on Health and Children. This Bill is a direct consequence of that report. Deputy Shatter will recall that on the day the report was launched I stated that the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, had commissioned the tobacco free policy review group. I am pleased the Minister, Deputy Martin, has committed himself to tackling this national scandal which kills up to 7,000 of the population each year.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Shatter on the report and its findings which involved major research. His wife Carmel was involved in the research. It is important to keep this issue to the forefront and the Bill does exactly that. The Minister who has this week introduced his own review group is <i>ad idem</i> with us in terms of where we want to go in regard to the smoking issue.</P>
      <P>We cannot allow smoking to continue unabated. We have got to tackle this problem and it is important to have a united approach. We are all aware of the cost in terms of lifestyle. It cuts ten years off the life of a person who continually smokes. It is a major financial drain on the health budget each year. The Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children said it costs anything up to £1 billion each year. That is an extraordinary amount of money. We can all think what could be done with it and the health service we could have if smoking was eradicated.</P>
      <P>We cannot continue to tolerate the easy access to cigarettes for young people. We must advertise the addictive nature and composition of cigarettes and hold out the tobacco companies as taboo because of the way in which they subterfuge advertising to ensure young people are addicted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's report introduced this week is incisive. The first line states that we have to change attitudes towards smoking. When compiling our report we became aware of the unco-ordinated nature of the advertising campaign to stop people smoking. This document looks at how to make smoking unpopular and uncool. It is as if, <Col N="139" /> with the first cigarette, young people suddenly come of age, are robust and become an example to their peers. The Florida and the Canadian experience, in terms of advertising to ensure people do not commence smoking, has focused on young people and involved them in putting the advertisements together. Our advertising to date has been from the adult viewpoint and it is not having the desired effect on young people. The role should be reversed to ensure young people are involved in any future anti-smoking campaigns.</P>
    <P>The legislation introduced in the past has been impressive. A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you were complimented here tonight as being one of the first people who introduced controls on smoking in public places, and rightly so. The Minister said help must be readily available for those who have commenced smoking.</P>
    <P>I wish to focus on environmental control which is also a feature of the review. We have reached the stage where the majority of restaurant owners would say good food, good wine and smoking are incongruous and would like to have smoking banned in restaurants. I strongly urge the Minister in the legislation he is introducing to adopt this line of approach.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Shatter's concern about vending machines and the availability of cigarettes. The issue will have to be tackled. In welcoming the Bill, the Minister, and the Joint Committee on Health and Children are <i>ad idem</i> on what the Deputy is trying to achieve. We cannot send out any signal of disagreement because it would be exploited by the tobacco companies. Given that the Minister has said his Bill will be introduced in two weeks, I suggest Deputy Shatter does not push his Bill, but let us move forward with a combined Bill which will embrace all the features which form part of his Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. The anti-smoking campaign has been a feature of health promotion going back to when I was a teenager and that is not today or yesterday. One was encouraged, through the schools, not to participate in the habit of smoking. For one reason or another we have failed to change the culture of smoking. I hope the Minister's Bill will put on a firm basis steps which can be taken and policed to prevent smoking and ultimately to wipe it out. The sooner we get to the stage of being in control of the situation the better.</P>
      <P>In the past the Irish Heart Foundation has been to the fore in ensuring the problems and the health risks associated with smoking were highlighted. The educational process, where it has to start, was entered into by the foundation. Through its efforts the campaign which has been brought to schools and organisations has highlighted the drastic effects of smoking on the lives of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statistics show that more than 6,000 people per <Col N="140" /> annum die from smoking related illnesses not to mention the serious adverse effects on our people and the cost to the health service. As outlined in the European Heart Network and the Irish Heart Foundation correspondence to us all, I would like to see the equation balanced. Cigarettes should come in packages of 20 or more and the cost should be such as to almost prohibit people from purchasing them. I agree with the Irish Heart Foundation that there should be an annual increase in the cost of cigarettes and that the sale of tobacco should be licensed and available to 18 year olds and over.</P>
    <P>The Government should ensure appropriate funding is made available through schools and organisations such as the Irish Heart Foundation which supports the cause to promote the risks associated with smoking. The second phase of the campaign must assist the 80% of smokers who wish to give up smoking. Through legislation and education we must ensure these people are given every opportunity to overcome their habit.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister in bringing forward the proposed legislation and I hope it will incorporate the submission made by the Irish Heart Foundation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask Deputy Shatter to wait for the Minister's Bill which will be before the House in two weeks' time. There is no home in the country which has not suffered from the side effects of smoking. I was shocked to read in <i>The Examiner </i>recently that two thirds of all hospital admissions in Great Britain are for ailments caused by smoking. The expert cited stated chronic bronchitis, chest and heart diseases and cancer are among the multitude of smoking-related illnesses. Recently, the former chairman of the Southern Health Board, Dr. Catherine Molloy, spoke out strongly on the issue of smoking and her views are shared by the members of the Southern Health Board.</P>
      <P>The Irish Heart Foundation has done tremendous work in promoting anti-smoking campaigns. The foundation's area manager in Cork, Paddy O'Brien, has campaigned to have annual health checks carried out and to promote non-smoking. Since assuming office, the Minister, Deputy Martin, has responded positively to the many calls he has received on this question and will shortly present a Bill to the House.</P>
      <P>Smoking has wreaked havoc on the nation's health for too many years. Many years ago there were no health warnings on cigarette packets and people did not realise the consequences of smoking. In those days smoking was a habit of the adult population although some teenagers smoked. I remember being offered a puff after my Confirmation by an older friend who was out to prove that he was a man of the world. I failed the test of manhood by refusing to smoke at that time. I did smoke a little in my late teens and early twenties although not heavily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main focus of the Bill will be on teenage smoking. The National Youth Council of Ireland <Col N="141" /> was shocked by the findings of a recent report which revealed that one in three people aged between 15 and 17 are smoking. Adults are becoming increasingly aware of the truth of the health warning on cigarette packets but unfortunately, more and more teenagers can be seen smoking on the streets, in bars and restaurants and in any public place where people congregate. The tender years of some of those inhaling nicotine comes as a shock to me. I can hardly accept that what I see is really happening, but I know it is.</P>
    <P>In days gone by, smoking by young people was actively discouraged. As a young man I was told that if I smoked a cigarette I would stop growing. I may have been naive but I did not doubt that this would be the case. I am sure that advice, given to many of my age, discouraged many young people from smoking.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the dangers of passive smoking. People who do not wish to expose their lungs to cigarette smoke are entitled to protection. There can be no softly softly approach to the elimination of smoking. There is no soft sell that will induce smokers to quit their addictive habit. There is only one way to address the many problems caused by the habit. It must be tackled head-on from the highest levels of Government. The World Health Organisation has defined tobacco use as a global epidemic. The report of the tobacco-free policy review group, chaired by Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, has been published and is a model of its kind. The report breaks down the use of tobacco on the lines of gender and age and looks at the tobacco industry and its contribution to tobacco-related illnesses. It is a blueprint for the tough action that must be taken immediately against the use of tobacco.</P>
    <P>Tobacco-related illness will kill half of those who smoke. Parents who smoke heavily are having a detrimental effect on their own health and on that of their children. Expectant mothers have long been advised against smoking while pregnant because of the potential damage to the health of the unborn child. Tobacco kills. This is the message which we must convey to smokers of all ages. People pay the price of lifelong addiction, crippling financial cost and disease when they smoke. Most hospital patients are people who have smoked throughout their lives.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he wants to see a tobacco-free society. He believes this is achievable and so do I. We must help those who wish to overcome the habit and work to ensure our children are prevented from starting to smoke and that they get positive help if they have done so already. We face no easy task. The tobacco industry has international campaigns in place that paint a positive and attractive picture of the joys of smoking. The advertising of cigarettes has always focused on the benefits to be gained from being a smoker. We must nail those lies. The industry has successfully extended its market by making a sales pitch to the young smoker. This is to offset a reduction in the adult smoking population. The Minister is <Col N="142" /> raising the age limit for the purchase of cigarettes to 18 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming:</NameTxt>
      <P>If so, it will be the shortest long finger ever because we are asked to wait only a couple of weeks.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for Health and Children. He has identified a very important issue and has launched a get tough policy on smoking. There is enormous public support for the Minister's initiative. Very few people could argue against it. Those who are addicted to cigarettes may object to this action but we have a duty to help these people overcome their addiction and stop smoking.</P>
      <P>In recent times I have been concerned at the number of young people who have taken up smoking. A number of years ago the Health Education Bureau was responsible for a major advertising campaign to make it unattractive to people to smoke. I recall seeing billboards depicting a cigarette with a knot in it and slogans such as &ldquo;Knot on your life&rdquo;. Ten or 15 years later I still remember those billboards. They were very stark and they contributed to a reduction in smoking at that time. However, smoking is once again on the increase and it is vital that we launch a new campaign to get tough on smoking.</P>
      <P>It is important to concentrate on young people because smoking is an addiction and prevention is the best cure for any addiction. Ridding oneself of the habit of smoking is a painful and tortuous process. The Minister's initiatives will make it uncool to be seen smoking. Many young people have part-time jobs and more disposable income than young people had in the past. They use this extra cash to buy cigarettes. I welcome the Minister's announcement that he will eliminate the packet of ten cigarettes. Smokers will have to spend at least £3.68 for the standard packet of cigarettes. This will make people think twice about smoking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase of 50p on a packet of cigarettes which was introduced in the budget is expected to generate approximately £132 million in revenue in the current year. The Appropriation Act which was passed last December earmarked this money for the Department of Health and Chil<Col N="143" /> dren so that a major fund will be available to the Minister for Health and Children to promote health issues which relate to smoking. This measure is particularly welcome.</P>
    <P>The cynics might say that the price of a packet of cigarettes was increased to gain extra revenue but to my knowledge as a member of the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service the decision was taken purely on health grounds. The question of additional revenue did not enter the debate at Government level. The increase of 50p on a packet of cigarettes led directly to an increase of 0.75% in the general inflation rate at a time when the Government was heading into national pay talks. Although this created difficulties, the Government was prepared to take the risk to drive home the message that cigarette smoking is not to be encouraged. I support the Minister on the new initiatives he has taken in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I place the tobacco industry and the gun lobby in the United States in the same category. They have the same insidious motives, undermine the good health of society and will do anything to promote their cynical initiatives. In the United States a short time ago a six year-old shot another six year-old. None of us should be under any illusion therefore about the task ahead. I compliment Deputy Shatter on introducing the Bill which presents a welcome opportunity to discuss a number of related issues. I also compliment the Minister on the initiatives he has announced in this regard.</P>
      <P>We have a gargantuan task ahead of us. That being said &ndash; I am not sure everyone will agree &ndash; we have managed in a strange way to convince young people that it is no longer cool to drink and drive. There is a very high incidence of deaths on our roads as a result of drink driving, something the older population continues to do. I am not sure how the message is being sold but it does seem to have sunk in among younger members of the population that, apart from being life threatening, it is no longer cool to drink and drive. Can a similar message be conveyed in relation to smoking?</P>
      <P>I spent 30 or more years teaching during which which time I often took youngsters from youth clubs away on holidays. I often found them behind trees with a cigarette in their pocket. They would deny to one's face that they were smoking, although a hole was being burned in their jeans. Smoking is an epidemic that needs to be addressed but it will not be addressed by wholesale banning. If anything, banning would lead to the creation of a black market. In the area I represent ways would be found to obain cigarettes off the back of a lorry to sell them in twos and threes. Banning is not the solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Members have high expectations on the role schools can perform in promoting a healthy lifestyle but there is a limit to what they can do. I promoted litter campaigns in school until the <Col N="144" /> cows came home. As soon as pupils walked outside the gate of the school grounds which were perfectly tidy they were tossing crisp bags everywhere. Every day that I open my office I see girls primarily buying cigarettes in the local convenience shop and stamping on the butt at the school gates. Perhaps the attitude is that if one smokes one will have a more lithe figure and be able to wear cooler gear but there is much that organisations which deal with young people out of school hours can do. I welcome the intiatives taken by the National Youth Council in co-operation with the health promotions services. Much good work has been done in the Eastern Health Board in this regard. It has to be targeted at where young people are; otherwise it is money down the drain.</P>
    <P>In the short time since the announcement was made that the selling of cigarettes in packets of less than 20 is to be banned I have been contacted by a number of shopkeepers to say, &ldquo;Thanks be to goodness somebody is doing something&rdquo; as they are being plagued by school kids. I commend the Minister on taking this initiative.</P>
    <P>Thirteen local drugs task forces were established to combat drug abuse. Their remit should be extended to combat the scourge of tobacco abuse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Both Deputy Shatter and the Minister have proposed that the sale of cigarettes to those under the age of 18 years should be banned. We should not kid ourselves into thinking that this will stop young people from smoking. One can drink legally at 18 years of age but as we are all aware young people are able to access alcohol at a much younger age, perhaps as young as 12 or 13. As Deputy Carey said there is a limit to what schools can do but we have to remove the cool image from smoking which is seen to be attractive among second level students in particular and, to a certain extent, in some primary schools. It is considered cool to be seen getting away with lighting up behind the diesel tank at the back of the school.</P>
      <P>There is a need for a much better system of communication to educate young people on the harmful side effects of smoking. In this connection the tougher regulations on the tobacco industry are very welcome. Sideline advertising in motor sport in particular gives the impression that it is cool to smoke.</P>
      <P>There is one point which has not been touched on. While we are all aware that smoking is anti-social and detrimental to one's health and well-being, there is little support within the health system for those with a smoking addiction. I therefore welcome the Minister's initiative in his action plan to make available through the health boards nicotine replacement therapy to encourage more people to give up smoking. Some 80% of smokers want to stop. We all know of people who used to smoke 50 to 60 fags a day and have quit the habit through sheer willpower and hard work.</P>

This is an important issue and if the Government joins us tonight, we could have a measure passed into law before the summer recess which could make a real difference. The Government, however, has decided to go the other way for its own reasons. This House is not just a debating chamber; it is where we pass legislation. The Minister promised that he will publish a Bill in two weeks. Making announcements does not change the law; one must do more than that. The Government's record to date on this matter has been abysmal. We have had Deputies from the opposite side coming in here crying crocodile tears, saying how terrible it is, but doing nothing. Nothing has happened in two and a half years. The numbers smoking have increased.</P>
      <P>The Government is being two-faced on this issue and I call on the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, who is a medical doctor, to support this legislation. It can be passed into law before the summer and by the time the schools reopen in September the campaign can be up and running to ban cigarette smoking to those under 18. Otherwise it might be Christmas before it becomes law.</P>
      <P>I have seen vending machines in hotel lobbies and all kinds of places where young people congregate and, as far as I am aware, the Minister has not alluded to vending machines. The onus of age verification must be placed on the retailers.</P>
      <P>The Minister has had reams of publicity on this issue, but I call on the media to report tomorrow that the Government is against this measure. On Ash Wednesday the Fianna Fáil-led Government will vote against these measures which would help to stop smoking among children, and that is a disgrace. Let the Government bring forward its own Bill later with all the other measures in it and we will back it. We will not oppose its Bill but it will oppose this one. This has to do with political publicity and nothing else. It is a disgrace. The Government is spending £250,000 on anti-smoking measures but the tobacco industry is spending about £7 million on promoting smoking; it is like David and Goliath. The Government's credibility has been tested on this and sadly found wanting.</P>
      <P>Some 22% of those between the ages of 15 and 16 &ndash; many of them girls &ndash; are smoking and the numbers are rising. The damage they are doing is crazy. This is one of the most additive drugs and once people start to smoke, it is almost impossible to stop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot place all of the responsibility on <Col N="146" /> schools. We as legislators must take action. The measures in this Bill will go some way, admittedly a small way, to doing something about this problem and they could be in force by next September, but the Government does not agree. It wants its hour of glory and publicity. It says it will do it all. That is wrong.</P>
    <P>There are two medical doctors in the Chamber, an Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Deputy Moffatt. I call on both of them to support the Bill. If they believe in what they practise, they should support the Bill because it would then become law before September.</P>
    <P>The rate of smoking is alarming. Some 31% of the population smokes. The cost in human terms is crazy. A good friend of mine is in hospital at present and she has collapsed four times already. She is 59 years of age. The suffering she is enduring is horrendous.</P>
    <P>We must take action on this issue. We can do it tonight if the Minister would change his mind. We will forget about the publicity campaigns and pictures in the newspaper; the Minister can have it all but he should do something here. Let us take action in this Chamber tonight and not wait until next October when the Dáil resumes to debate the matter. This is not good enough.</P>
    <P>The Government has a glorious opportunity on Ash Wednesday to do something constructive about this measure. I call on the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, at this, the 11th hour, to change his mind and back this legislation. It does not make sense to vote against it. He is not opposed to it. There may be a need for minor amendments but they would be quickly sorted out on Committee Stage. If the Bill passes Second Stage tonight, it can be in committee in a matter of days, passed by the committee and passed into law. I do not know why the Government is acting in this way. I cannot understand it. The people will not be able to understand it either if the media does its job and reports that the Government voted against these measures tonight.</P>
    <P>There are 32 national organisations under the National Heart Alliance calling for measures like this and the Government will vote against it. Why? It is one of the biggest pillars in the country at present.</P>
    <P>When one passes any secondary school, one will see children of 12, 13 and 14 smoking, doing terrible damage to themselves before they go into school and when they come out in the evenings. It is crazy that this is happening. Deputy Pat Carey mentioned drinking and smoking but smoking is most addictive, that is the difference. I call on the Government to do something constructive tonight and let us pass this legislation into law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what my colleague, Deputy Stanton, stated about the political reality of this debate. From what I have heard tonight and last night, there is cross-party support for the measures being proposed by Deputies Shatter and Stanton. I am rather disappointed that the new Minister has taken the opportunity not to <Col N="147" /> support the Fine Gael legislation but instead to announce what he might or might not do next week, next month or whenever. It is bad for politics and it presents a bad image of politics when a common sense proposal with the full support of every Member of the House is not being passed into law simply because it was introduced on the wrong side of the House. I would have thought, as we enter a new millennium, that we would have been mature enough to ensure legislation which is good for the country and which is being advanced in the common good should be supported by all sides regardless of which party or Deputy tabled it. While I look forward to seeing what the Minister will produce in a few weeks and to that debate, I express my disappointment that the Fine Gael Bill is not being supported by the Government because any deficiency in the Bill could be amended on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Some Members referred to the smoking issue as being a national scandal. Anything causing the deaths of 7,000 every year in Ireland is an epidemic and a scandal and needs urgent Government attention. The anti-smoking efforts, which vary from television and radio advertising to all other forms of advertising, which we have seen in place down through the years have failed. That one third of school children between the ages of 15 and 17 still smoke speaks for itself. Regardless of what we have done up to now, we must redouble our efforts. Apparently the Minister proposes to think of new methods to get the message across that smoking causes severe damage. I suggest he might liaise with some of the script writers on the television soap operas, which appear to have more impact on the man and woman on the street, and particularly on children, than many of the advertising efforts. If the script writers for &ldquo;Fair City&rdquo; and &ldquo;Coronation Street&rdquo; include episodes about the damage caused by smoking, that could be an effective method of getting the message across because unfortunately what we have been doing to date has not worked.</P>
      <P>In the final minute available to me I want to refer to some of the recommendations made by Deputy Shatter at the Joint Committee on Health and Children. He proposed that nicotine replacement products should be available on the medical card system. That deserves the immediate support of the Government and should be put into practice immediately by the Minister and the health boards. He also proposed that the cost of tobacco products should not be taken into account in the consumer price index. It is ridiculous that when the Minister for Finance increases tobacco prices in the budget, which is good from a health point of view, it increases inflation. The CPI should be amended to take account of that. The committee also recommended that the price of cigarettes should continue on an upward spiral. These and other suggestions must be taken on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed the Government is playing <Col N="148" /> politics here and that the Fine Gael Bill is apparently being shot down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand why the Government has not accepted this Bill. I compliment Deputy on the work and effort he put into it. He went to America to talk to people there about what was happening. It would not be the first time he brought a successful Bill through the House so it cannot be faulted for lack of professionalism, as Fianna Fáil knows well. I am a Member of the House for too long to know that is something Fianna Fáil would do.</P>
      <P>The Bill will be voted down tonight and we understand a new one will be introduced. We can only hope it will be brought in quickly and will contain all that is in Deputy Shatter's Bill. I support any measure that tries to prevent young people from smoking. It is a hideous, dirty habit and as sure as night follows day it will shorten people's lives. Those who smoke heavily will not have as good a quality of life as they might have otherwise.</P>
      <P>I sat on the Committee for Health and Children when the tobacco companies gave evidence. They tried to convince the committee that smoking was not addictive. That must be the understatement of the year. We all know it is precisely because it is addictive that it is so difficult to stop smoking. They implied that thousands of people voluntarily stop smoking each year. That is true. We all know people who stopped smoking from fear of ill-health or sheer will power. What the companies did not tell us is the numbers who stop smoking are quickly replaced by younger smokers. The industry tries to target young people, though they do not admit that. The psychology behind it is that if 14 or 15 year olds are smoking they are likely to buy the product for a long time. The biggest problem is the difficulty of explaining to children the damage that will be done to their systems in 20 or 30 years. That is a lifetime away to a child of 13 or 14 years. If we could solve that it would go a long way towards resolving the matter. The decision to raise the age from 16 to 18 years is a step in the right direction. Permitting cigarettes to be sold only in packs of 20 is good but it will have limited effect. Everyone knows that if people want drugs they will get them and the same will happen with cigarettes.</P>
      <P>It is important that every possible official signal should be given to young people at an early stage that smoking is taboo. If we could only get it across that the in thing is not to smoke we would be on the way to solving the problem. I do not have the answers but I hope the forthcoming legislation will help us to some degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in congratulating Deputies Shatter and Stanton on bringing forward this Bill. It is good to see something positive. We hear much talk and see press statements and announcements of intentions that do not come to anything but tonight we have a positive measure that could be implemented immediately. It is a <Col N="149" /> relatively small Bill that could pass through the Committee on Health and Children and by next September we could have an Act in place banning the sale of cigarettes to those under the age of 18 years. All the evidence shows that if one starts smoking at a young age one will be a smoker for life.</P>
      <P>I am a member of the Committee on Health and Children and Deputy Shatter, as rapporteur for that committee, has done a wonderful job in producing a report on health and smoking and a national anti-smoking strategy. There was much publicity surrounding it. I am glad that when the new Minister was appointed he announced his intention to address the ills of smoking in society. It would appear he had read the document and took on board much of what the committee recommended.</P>
      <P>The rate of smoking is increasing in this country. In the 1970s, 43% of those aged 15 and over smoked. In June 1993, 28% of people smoked but last year two surveys showed 31% of the population smoke. We must tackle this issue. Some 20% of deaths are tobacco related. Six thousand people die each year from tobacco related illnesses, cardio-vascular disease, cancer, stroke, respiratory illnesses, emphysema, peptic ulcer disease, the list is endless. Some 1,500 people die from lung cancer. What is the cost of that to the health services, if we are to look at it from a monetary viewpoint? We must consider the health of the nation. I do not understand why we cannot implement a simple, positive measure prohibiting the sale of cigarettes to those under 18 years.</P>
      <P>Adults can weigh up the pros and cons of smoking and make an informed decision but young children under the age of 18 cannot do so. Nicotine is addictive. Deputy Shatter in his report quoted an extract from the United States Food and Drug Administration's investigations into nicotine and its addictive nature which stated that nicotine in cigarettes and smokers' tobacco causes and sustains addiction. It is the psychoactive or mood altering effects on the brain that motivate repeated compulsive use of the substance.</P>
      <P>I cannot emphasise too strongly my view that it is necessary to implement the Bill. I regret that the Minister is not accepting it. I hope something positive will be done in this area in the near future. It is a minimal change that would make a big difference to the health of the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Dennihan Mr. Dennihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will repeat some of the facts on smoking. Every year 6,000 people die from smoke related illnesses, about one-third are under 65 years. Some 25% of all heart disease deaths is caused by smoking. Smoking kills six times more people each year than the combined number that die as a result of road accidents, work accidents, drugs, suicide, murder and AIDS. Regarding children, those who start smoking before the age of 17 are significantly less likely to stop in later adult life. The earlier children start smoking the greater the risk of developing lung <Col N="150" /> cancer and heart disease. As regards passive smoking, infants of parents who smoke are twice as likely to suffer from asthma or serious respiratory infections. At least one quarter of the risk of death due to sudden infant death is as a result of parental smoking. Nicotine inhaled by children of parents who smoke is equivalent to the child smoking 100 to 150 cigarettes per year.</P>
      <P>Enforcement of the legislation on the sale of cigarettes to children is very weak. Environmental health officers have no right of entry to the premises within which they are supposed to enforce the law. Neither do they have the right to request the names and addresses of offenders. This aspect of the legislation must be changed. Also, there must be more protection of children from passive smoking in restaurants, shopping centres and at sporting and leisure events by extending legislation as necessary. People do not even comply with non-smoking regulations on trains and in other areas where smoking is prohibited.</P>
      <P>Time and again over the past 17 years I have emphasised the need for a proper health education programme. Current arrangements are <i>ad hoc</i> and based on knee-jerk reactions. We have no health education programme despite what the Minister and his predecessors promised.</P>
      <P>It is cynical of the Minister to reject the Bill given that it has been crafted by one of the best parliamentarians ever to serve in the House, aided by Deputy Stanton. The Bill is flawless, something we all stand over. If the Minister wanted to send out a clear anti-smoking message he should have accepted the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to support the Bill and congratulate Deputy Shatter on bringing it before the House. It is very frustrating and surprising that the Minister has decided not to accept the Bill, particularly considering the recent publicity and clear anti-smoking stance which he has taken. At last there seems to be a general acceptance in the House that we must get tough on smoking by introducing policies and laws which restrict the sale of cigarettes.</P>
      <P>The impact of smoking on the quality of people's lives is undeniable. Thirty one per cent of people now smoke and levels of lung cancer are higher than ever before, with between 1,500 and 2,000 people diagnosed with lung cancer every year. More young women in particular are smoking than ever before, with 40% of women between the ages of 18 and 40 lighting up regularly. I wonder if they realise the increased likelihood of exposure to cancer of the cervix, for example, or complications with pregnancies and fertility as well as the obvious potential lung problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must accept that despite the large resources and effort to promote the dangers and negative health risks of smoking, little or no progress has been made towards reducing the numbers of smokers. In fact the opposite has happened. We must <Col N="151" /> ask what we can do to challenge the increase in smoking. The fact that one in three young people between the ages of 15 and 17 smoke is frightening when one considers the long-term consequences. According to the National Youth Council of Ireland, 80% of smokers become addicted between the ages of 14 and 16. This statistic is all the more extraordinary when one considers that a person aged 14 or 15 should not be allowed access to cigarettes.</P>
    <P>The advertising campaign to dampen the attraction of smoking has clearly failed while current laws restricting the sale of cigarettes are clearly not being adhered to. If accepted the Bill proposed by Deputy Shatter will make a serious impact on reducing the number of young people smoking, which in turn will reduce the number of potential addicts to nicotine. Increasing the age limit from 16 to 18 years is a serious step forward. Controlling the placing of cigarette machines is another step forward. It is a simple, straightforward Bill which is easy to understand and is consistent with what the Minister has said about smoking over the past number of weeks. I cannot understand why he is not accepting the Bill. The only reason I suppose is that he is playing politics with the issue, something I very much regret.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Shatter on the Bill and on his excellent report. Of 1,000 people aged 20 years who take up smoking and continue smoking for their adult lives, at least 250 will die from smoking related conditions before the age of 70 and a further 250 will die from smoking related conditions before the age of 75. Smoking is currently the single most important preventable cause of death. It is estimated that more than 6,000 people die in Ireland each year from conditions directly related to smoking and countless thousands more are admitted to hospitals with smoking related conditions. Smoking is a major causal factor in heart disease, stroke, lung cancer and other cancers, chronic bronchitis and a host of other serious conditions. Smoking during pregnancy is a cause of low birth rate, and infants exposed to cigarette smoke in their homes or other environments are at increased risk of serious illness, including sudden infant death syndrome and recurrent ear infections. Thus, the human and economic costs of smoking are enormous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most people take up smoking in their teenage years. There is considerable evidence that the tobacco industry in its advertising campaigns specifically target young people. Nicotine in tobacco is a highly addictive drug. The marketing strategy of the tobacco industry is based on the need to recruit new addicts to replace those who die from the habit. The Government must confront the tobacco industry. Currently, there is major concern about the possible adverse affects of Sellafield. While this is an important issue, it is dwarfed by the toll of suffering and death associated with the marketing of tobacco products. We <Col N="152" /> must continue to increase the price of cigarettes and there should be a complete ban on all forms of tobacco advertising and sponsorship with immediate effect. The proposal to raise the legal age for the purchase of cigarettes should be warmly endorsed. We must also ensure that the legislation, once in place, is enforced as current regulations are not being enforced. The Government should also consider raising an additional health levy from the tobacco industry to cover in part the cost of treatment for tobacco related illnesses. The Government should also support efforts to pursue the tobacco industry in court for damage relating to the marketing of tobacco products. It is a hugely profitable industry which makes millions of pounds and the best route is to pursue the industry through the courts, something which has had a huge effect in the US. It is the best way of precipitating an immediate effect.</P>
    <P>As a seller of cigarettes I am aware of the difficulty in policing the market, with older people buying cigarettes for those below the legal age.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to make a contribution on what is one of the most important debates in the House this session. I regret the Government has not seen fit or been big enough, and that the Minister has not been man enough, to take on board this excellent Bill introduced by Deputy Shatter, an able parliamentarian as has been correctly stated, and Deputy Stanton. The Minister is a former Minister for Education and Science, and I paid public tribute to him for being excellent in that portfolio. He is aware of the involvement of young people in smoking and now that he is Minister for Health and Children he has an opportunity to do something about it, but has rejected the good proposal made by Deputy Shatter. It is a contradiction, but the entire smoking industry is a total contradiction.</P>
      <P>Advertisements for cigarettes contain warnings in very small print saying &ldquo;Government warning: smoking damages your health&rdquo;. However, the print is so small that this can hardly be read. Sports organisations across the board are being sponsored by cigarette manufacturers, the very industry that destroys health. It is a total contradiction which is being aided and abetted by the Minister. The signals coming from the House, and God knows there have been enough bad signals over the past number of months, are not the right ones we should be sending to young people. We must take seriously what is being said here and ask young people, for God's sake, to stop smoking and ruining their health. It is a very serious problem and we should have taken it on board, something we have not done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the no smoking areas in various public places. However, parents who wish to have a smoke bring their children into smoking areas. Those children have no say and doing so should be illegal. It is wrong for parents to be puffing away at their cigarettes with small children at their knees, and it should not happen. Believe it <Col N="153" /> or not, I saw this happening this evening in the self-service restaurant. Parents, who were obviously visitors, were in the smoking area with smoke swirling around their two small children. Those children have no say, and they must get a proper start in life. Addiction starts at this stage, and once addiction takes hold it seems nearly impossible to break the habit, and it certainly takes a great amount of will power and effort to break it.</P>
    <P>We know that smoking causes heart disease and cancer, and we are familiar with the health care bill confronted by the State. However, the concern is not so much the bill as the unfortunate people who have damaged their health as a result of something to which they became addicted when they were young and when they had no guidelines from their parents who have the responsibility to bring up their children properly. If parents are not prepared to do that, then we, as legislators, must enact laws that will protect children. We expected to do that tonight. It is an excellent Bill, which would have stood up legally. It has been rejected by the Minister and he must answer to the public for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Members for their valuable contributions to this important debate. In particular, I thank Deputy Batt O'Keeffe who, as chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, initiated and directed a substantial inquiry into the issue of tobacco and health. Deputy Shatter was rapporteur to that committee and he also deserves praise for his work in producing a fine report.</P>
      <P>Strong support from all sides of the House for real and substantial action in this area has generally been expressed during the debate. There was not any opposition to the good initiation behind Deputy Shatter's Bill. However, one of the key messages of both the Oireachtas joint committee report and that of the tobacco free policy review group was the need for a multi-sectoral broad based approach using a wide array of instruments, including legal ones. That is the right way to address this issue. The Government shares the concerns expressed by the Members about the urgency of dealing with this matter.</P>
      <P>We have already taken significant steps. We introduced the highest ever increase in taxes on cigarettes in the 1999 budget and are advised that high prices are the single most effective barrier to young people smoking. We are currently establishing the office of tobacco control and are in discussions with the Department of Finance in regard to recruiting staff. Office accommodation has been identified and is being readied. We intend that the office will be operational by June 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shatter's Bill in some ways demonstrates the dangers of taking individual initiatives outside the context of a broader policy and strategic framework. The proposal that the Govern<Col N="154" /> ment should introduce compulsory signage in retail outlets is a good example of this problem. The report, &ldquo;Towards a Tobacco Free Society&rdquo;, recommends that all forms of display at retail level should he prohibited. This recommendation would ensure that in future tobacco products would no longer be visible at retail outlets. The presence of a sign alerting children that there is a dangerous product on sale in the shop would probably act as an inducement to a young person to look for cigarettes rather than a deterrent.</P>

      <P>I have a somewhat similar difficulty in regard to vending machines. The Deputy's legislation proposes that vending machines should be restricted to areas frequented by persons over 18 years. However, the report, &ldquo;Towards a Tobacco Free Society&rdquo;, agrees with that concept, but there is a serious question about the enforceability of this measure. The Bill proposes significant raising of fines for offences and, again, the Minister has signalled his support for that. However, the Government's legal advice is that the upper threshold allowable for summary convictions is £1,500.</P>

      <P>We are introducing a more comprehensive Bill in two weeks but we are also examining a more comprehensive range of penalties in this matter. Clearly, penalties in the order of £1,500 are significant for small retailers but we must look to a different order of magnitude when addressing errant behaviour by tobacco companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is conscious of the valuable contribution Deputy Shatter has made to this debate and we are also in considerable sympathy <Col N="155" /> with him in his enthusiasm to act quickly. However, this time we must get it right and ensure that our new policy is supported by real teeth and resources. Past initiatives from all Governments have been less successful than was intended because of the lack of a sustained commitment and proper resources. There have been some negative comments about our new policy. It is open to everyone to criticise those elements of the report about which they have reservations or misgivings. Such criticism can draw attention to opportunities to improve and enhance our policy.</P>
    <P>However, all Members should also focus on the report and read it carefully as it is excellent and incorporates best practice from around the world. Some of the criticisms made of the report last night were simply wrong. I refer, for example, to Deputy Shatter's complaint that his proposal that the broadcasting of Formula 1 races should be accompanied with suitable warnings concerning the dangers of tobacco was omitted. This criticism ignores the recommendation in paragraph 3 on page 48 of the report. The group was very conscious of the problem posed by the broadcasting of sporting events which carry tobacco advertising.</P>

      <P>I again compliment Deputy Shatter on his commitment to this issue. I assure the House that it is our intention to publish the miscellaneous health Bill in the next couple of weeks and that it will propose raising the age from 16 years to 18 years. I further assure the House that the Government will introduce a comprehensive Bill later this year following which there will be an opportunity to have a full debate on the issue of tobacco and public health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have rarely heard a more pathetic speech from a junior Minister in my two and a half years as a Member of the House. It is the most ridiculous set of arguments I have ever heard in response to a Bill which has the support of all sides of the House. The Minister of State said that there was no opposition to the good initiation to Deputy Shatter's Bill. Why, therefore, will there be a division on it at 8.30 p.m.? If the Minister of State and his colleague, the Mini<Col N="156" /> ster for Health and Children, are in favour of the good intention of Deputy Shatter's Bill, they should support it. That is what Second Stage is all about.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State's view on specific fines for small retailers was interesting. He is now concerned about small retailers. He dropped his guard and spoke more as a Minister for industry and commerce than one with responsibility for health affairs. It is quite ridiculous and it makes a mockery of Parliament that despite the fact that a committee of this House which has considered these matters for some time and the involvement of a parliamentarian of the standing of Deputy Shatter, we are following a procedure whereby there will be a division at 8.30 p.m. on a Bill which everyone supports. That is a complete joke. People outside the House laugh at us day and night and now the Government is making a mockery of the parliamentary system and the committee system.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government regularly refers to the fact that all of us should be legislators and spend more time in the House and on committee work. A committee of the House and Deputy Shatter have done the work for the Government, yet it will vote down this measure at 8.30 p.m.. It undermines the laudable comments of Deputy Dempsey and others. When the bar has been raised for the new Minister with his new branding for Fianna Fáil, etc., he will fall at the first fence because he is going back to the old ways.</P>
      <P>The way to run a Parliament is to ensure that everyone's voice is heard. It is not the exclusive responsibility of the Executive to pass legislation in the Oireachtas. It is the responsibility of 165 Members and the Ceann Comhairle to ensure that legislation is passed. It is not the sole preserve of the Executive to introduce legislation before the House and expect all of us to support it.</P>
      <P>There have not been any substantive points of difference on Deputy Shatter's legislation, except that the fine should be £1,500 instead of £2,500. Such an argument could be teased out on Committee Stage. It is not a substantive point to make against the Bill and the Government, even at this late stage, should support it and their colleagues on the committee who wholeheartedly supported the recommendations behind this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Shatter's initiative on this important issue. The Minister has lost a wonderful opportunity. Even at the eleventh hour he should change his mind and show that all of us in the House are united on this. He should send a message to young people that they should not smoke at a young age and that we are serious about this issue. The Minister is still in the shadow of his predecessor. I thought he would have come out of that. We would have expected the former Minister to jackboot an initiative like this and, unfortunately, the Minister has copied him on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to two issues. As a member of <Col N="157" /> the Western Health Board, I was horrified to learn that a health board, a statutory body, used a child as a pawn to bring to justice a shopkeeper it wanted to catch selling cigarettes to people under age. That was despicable. I ask the Minister, the first opportunity he gets, to issue a directive to every health board that they should no longer use children in this way, even if no other way is open to them. That is a sad indictment of our country. I am horrified that children would be used in this fashion and I hope it stops. Regardless of the legislation we have to bring in and the methods we have to use to stop young people from purchasing cigarettes, we should not use a child as a pawn. When this particular shop owner was convicted, it had to be stated that a child was sent into the shop on the initiative of a health board officer.</P>
    <P>We have to decide whether this is a health and education issue or a legislative issue. Having spent 20 years teaching in a classroom, I know that legislation will not completely prevent smoking among young people. The only thing we can do is highlight, through education, the health issues involved. Unfortunately, neither resources nor time have been made available in the schools to provide education in that regard, except where an individual teacher uses his or her own initiative because of their personal feelings against smoking. It is important that the Minister works out some system, in co-operation with the new Minister for Education and Science, so that this issue can be raised in the schools in a positive way. We must teach young children that there is nothing glamorous about smoking.</P>
    <P>How can employers provide a smoking area where employees can smoke in the workplace? I know legislation demands that but this matter should be re-examined. I wholeheartedly support Deputy Shatter's Bill.</P>

      <P>I want to thank all who contributed to this debate on both sides of the House. Tonight will be a bad night for democracy, for this Parliament, for our committee system, for the health of the country and for young people. We have a very simple Bill before the House which proposes to outlaw the sale of cigarettes to children under 18 years of age. The measures contained in it reflect identically those recommended by the Joint Committee on Health and Children when it supported unanimously measures in the report prepared by me for the committee as rapporteur. There are ten Fianna Fáil members of that committee. There is a Fianna Fáil chairman of that committee, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, who contributed to the debate this evening. The Government has decided that it will vote down this Bill. Why has it done that? We have a Government which says that Members of this House should act as legislators. We have a Minister who wants to change the Constitution to change the electoral system so we can act as legislators, but what happens when Members on this side of the House try to act as legislators? We are <Col N="158" /> told to get back into our boxes, that our job is not to be legislators but to simply debate. This is not just a debating chamber. It is a legislative assembly. We are not just debaters. We are legislators, and the most relevant work this House does that affects the lives of people is the enactment of legislation but the Government wants to consign Members on this side of the House to the position of legislative irrelevance. This Government favours parliamentary eunuchs, forever talking but never legislating.</P>
      <P>This Minister, the new Minister for Health and Children, held out so much promise. He was the Minister who would bring in a new dawn in the Department of Health and Children, the Minister to replace a predecessor who was not up to the job, but this evening this Minister is going back to the future. We are coming back to the time I remember in this House in the 1980s when Ministers jealously guarded their ministerial position and saw legislation brought forward from the Opposition side of the House as some sort of an attack on their ministerial status. Legislation was not seen as something constructive or as an advancement of policy. It was regarded as something one never let an Opposition Deputy do because if there was a good idea out there, they wanted to get the publicity for it. The Minister got the publicity for it yesterday.</P>

      <P>The work was done by the Joint Committee on Health and Children which produced the most detailed report ever on the issue of health and smoking. The report I wrote for that committee was then replicated by a report the Ministers' group published, a report that required an entire committee to write and two years to produce, a report that falls short in a number of respects to the recommendations made in the Joint Committee on Health and Children report.</P>
      <P>Both reports state that, first, we should ban the sale of cigarettes to children under 18 and, second, that we should increase the penalty for those who engage in under-age sales. What we had yesterday was major news. The Minister held a press conference and announced his intentions. We have reported today that the Minister declared a &ldquo;cigs&rdquo; war and that the legal age has already been raised to 18. The Minister declared war yesterday but he is surrendering tonight in this House.</P>

      <P>What the Minister should be doing tonight, on international no smoking day, is joining with this side of the House. This House should be sending out a clear message to young people that all sides in this House are committed to ending the scandal of young teenagers becoming nicotine addicted, that they want to end the scandal of the cigarette manufacturers targeting children, that they want to stop retailers ignoring the law in selling cigarettes to young children and that they favour more than just talking about banning the sale of cigarettes to those under 18.</P>
      <P>All the Minister, the Minister of State and their colleagues on the benches behind them have done is talk the talk. We are asking them tonight to vote with us to support this Bill. Do not divide the House. How can the Minister explain tomorrow morning the fact that he held a press conference on Tuesday at which he said he intended to ban the sale of cigarettes to children under 18 and then walked into the Dáil lobbies on Wednesday and voted against banning the sale of cigarettes to children under the age of 18? What is the explanation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>The explanation is that he did not want Fine Gael to do it; he thought Fianna Fáil should do it. He thought that if Fine Gael had legislation enacted into law within a couple of weeks of him becoming Minister, it might undermine his public credibility in some way. That is the only way the Minister can explain the manner in which his party colleagues and he will behave in this House this evening. It is a disgrace, because we know cigarettes are the only commodity sold by manufacturers who know the product they are selling is killing their customers. We have a duty to our children not only to enact this legislation, but to take a broad range of other initiatives to end youth smoking. I ask the Minister not to divide the House tonight and to allow the Bill to pass Second Stage. He can produce whatever Bill he wants. I do not mind if he produces another Bill in two weeks which says exactly the same thing. I do not care which Bill is enacted. I am interested in the issue; I am not interested in parish pump politics&mdash;</P>

    <P>I do not believe the Department of Health and Children will produce the Bill in two weeks. If this Bill passes Second Stage tonight, we can enact it into law before the summer recess. Delaying it means we will not do that. If this Bill is enacted into law, it will stop retailers, because <Col N="160" /> of the stringent penalties contained in it, continuing to engage in under age sales. It is regrettable that the Bill about which the Minister and the Government is talking, if and when they produce it, seeks to impose far less stringent penalties than those prescribed in this Bill. Let us not vote this Bill down tonight and divide the House. Let us send a clear message on international &ldquo;no smoking&rdquo; day to under 18s that this House wants to stop them smoking and stop unscrupulous shopkeepers selling cigarettes to susceptible children.</P>

If we can have a united House on the broader issue, I have no difficulty with that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a brief discussion about this on Committee Stage. It deals with particular circumstances which arise under an SAYE scheme whereby the <Col N="162" /> benefit-in-kind element is discounted after the three year period but there is a charge to CGT. Does the charge to CGT arise immediately as it could do if this position was immediate or does it arise on the basis of market value on the date of acquisition? Does one pay CGT on the price one pays for the shares or on the reduced price?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment relates to the SAYE share option scheme introduced last year. Under normal tax law, an employee exercising a share option is charged with income tax on the difference between what he paid for the shares and their market value at date of acquisition. Any further gain on a subsequent disposal is chargeable to capital gains tax.</P>
      <P>Under the SAYE scheme the income tax charge on exercise of the option does not apply but on a subsequent disposal of the shares the employee is chargeable to capital gains tax on his or her full profit from the shares, that is, the difference between what he or she paid for the shares and what he or she receives for them. Effectively, what would otherwise be a charge to income tax &ndash; at possibly 44% &ndash; is converted into a capital gains tax charge at 20%.</P>
      <P>What Deputy McDowell is requesting is that the profit on the exercise of the share option should be removed altogether from the tax charge and that the capital gains tax charge should be confined to the profit arising from the date of acquisition of the shares only.</P>
      <P>As I indicated on Committee Stage last week the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness recognises the importance of various forms of employee financial participation, including share options and gainsharing, in developing and deepening partnership and in increasing performance and competitiveness. To give practical effect to this recognition a consultative committee has been set up under the PPF to prepare proposals for consideration in the context of Budget 2001. I am sure the committee will consider this proposal as well as others being put forward on the question of employee financial participation.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell's amendment is, therefore, somewhat premature and in the circumstances I cannot accept it at this time. However, as I indicated on Committee Stage, and earlier in this debate, I will give full and careful consideration to the outcome of the consultative committee's deliberations for Budget 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy with the Minister's response. The CGT rate at 20% is only two points lower than the standard rate of income tax. We also want to give some benefit to people who are paying income tax at the standard rate when dealing with these sorts of options rather than only give considerable benefit to people who pay income tax at the higher rate. The Minister might consider that point.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;basis period' has the same meaning as in section 127(1);&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to section 52 which is concerned with the introduction of the 20% rate of tax for profits from dealing in residential development land which I announced in the budget last December.</P>
      <P>The income tax element of the proposal is intended to apply to profits arising on or after 1 December 1999 where it has been suggested that there may be an ambiguity in the way in which the provision is framed which, in certain circumstances, might result in the new rate applying to profits arising before that date.</P>
      <P>This is because while unincorporated traders are chargeable to income tax for a year of assessment &ndash; 6 April to 5 April &ndash; the profits to be assessed are those for the period of account ending in that year. One interpretation of the commencement provision put forward to Revenue, but not accepted by it, is that a portion of the profits to be assessed for the year 1999-2000 should be charged at 20% even though these profits would have been calculated by reference to profits which accrued before 1 December 1999. This amendment removes any possibility of that ambiguity arising and I, therefore, commend it to the House.</P>

      <Col N="164" />&ldquo;assigned, without having regard to any amount of appropriate tax (within the meaning of section 730F) in connection with the chargeable event.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is to section 730D which is being inserted into the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, by section 53 of the Bill. Section 730D sets out how to compute in the new gross-roll-up regime, the amount of a taxable gain on an investment policy with a life assurance company when various events occur, for example, total or partial encashment of the policy. The amount of the gain is provided in the section by various formulae. This amendment ensures that the value of a policy at any time for use in those formulae is the value of the policy without taking into account the tax liability that may arise at that time. I commend this amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>In page 125, to delete lines 21 to 26 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;intermediary&rdquo; means a person who&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) carries on a business which consists of, or includes, the receipt of payments from an investment undertaking on behalf of other persons, or</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) holds units in an investment undertaking on behalf of other persons;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments are to section 58, which provides the new gross-roll-up regime for collective investments which will apply in the IFSC and in the domestic market. The amendments arise from further discussions with the funds industry and extend the definition of &ldquo;intermediary&rdquo; to include a person who holds units in an investment undertaking on behalf of others. In the international funds industry it can be the case that an intermediary in a foreign jurisdiction holds units as a nominee for investors in that jurisdiction. Under the section, an intermediary is entitled to make a declaration of non-residence on behalf of his or her customers who invest in an Irish domiciled investment undertaking. I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

    <P>These amendments substantially rewrite section 739G, inserted in the Taxes Consolidation Act by section 58. Section 739G, as amended, will set out the tax treatment of a payment made by an investment undertaking to a unit holder under the new gross-roll-up regime. The tax treatment depends on the nature of the payment, the status of the unit holder and whether tax has been deducted from the payment by the investment undertaking. For example, where the unit holder is an individual and tax has been deducted from the payment by the investment undertaking there is no further tax to pay. In the case of a company the tax treatment depends on whether the units are held as an investment or as part of trading stock of a financial trade. In the case of a company which is not resident in the State or an individual who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in the State, there will be no tax to pay in the State. I commend these amendments to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. We discussed this to some extent on Committee Stage. The same position applies to Irish insurance funds as applies to the <Col N="168" /> funds in the IFSC area, in order to comply with EU law. The system used in that situation is known as gross roll-up. In other words, while the funds are accumulated within the fund they do not attract any tax, but they are taxed on the way out. That is the way it was with the IFSC industry. We have been prepared to do the same for Irish life assurance as well. We have come up with that procedure which involves an exit tax based on the standard rate of tax plus 3%. As I explained on Committee Stage, existing policies will continue to be taxed on the normal basis. Up to now there has been a special mechanism which was very complicated and very few people were conversant with it, apart from the Deputy and myself. That will continue for existing policies while new policies starting on and after 1 January 2001 will be taxed on the new gross roll-up mechanism which is an exit tax at the standard rate plus 3%. After some discussions I announced this in the budget. Various proposals were put forward as to how to do it. On Committee Stage I said we would evaluate all the existing policies but after further negotiations we decided that the new gross roll-up method would be for new policies as and from 1 January next. Deputies will also remember that on Committee Stage we inserted certain provisos so that people could not benefit from now to 31 December. All these amendments on Report Stage are tidying up that aspect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly. The industry would want a lower figure of course but I think it was a reasonable charge to make. The funds will be able to accumulate every year without any tax deductions. We thought the fairest way would be to apply the standard rate at the end plus a percentage. Various percentages were put forward, some higher than 3%. The industry wanted a lower figure, or none at all, but it is a fair compromise to have funds that can grow without any tax deduction. On account of that deferral of tax, when the funds mature they are subject to an exit tax plus 3%. The customer will not be involved in those calculations; it is something the industry will do with the various policies.</P>

      <P>It is now, although it was not last week. We have had negotiations. This amendment by Deputies Noonan and Deenihan which relates to the scheme of capital allowances for farm pollution control, proposes to extend this scheme to 5 April 2005. The scheme was introduced in 1997 for farmers in respect of expenditure incurred by them in necessary pollution control measures. Under that scheme, which applied for three years from 6 April 1997 to 5 April 2000, a special year one allowance of the lesser of 50% of expenditure incurred or of £20,000 was provided for and the balance of the expenditure was written off over seven years. In 1998 the year one extended limit was increased to the lesser of 50% of expenditure or of £30,000. This pollution control scheme was amended in section 30 of the Bill as initiated to extend the scheme for a further three years to 6 April 2003, and also to provide for an increased first year expenditure limit of £40,000 which I announced in my budget speech on 1 December last.</P>
      <P>Arising from the farm taxation undertakings in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, I am committed to the further enhancement of the scheme as follows: a reduction in the writing down period from eight years to seven years, an increase in the first year expenditure limit to £50,000 and the option to claim the lesser of 50% of expenditure or of the increased expenditure limit of £50,000 in a more flexible way over the writing down period. The next amendment, in my name, provides for this flexibility.</P>
      <P>As I have outlined, this scheme has been in existence since 1997. In my budget speech I extended the scheme for a further three years and I increased the year one expenditure limit. The terms of the scheme have been further generously enhanced under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. I do not consider it prudent or necessary at this stage to extend the scheme further and must reject the amendment.</P>
      <P>I would point out that amendment No. 84, in my name, has been agreed with the farming organisations. It gets over any difficulties we had up to last week.</P>

As I have stated, the scheme was introduced in 1997 for farmers with respect to expenditure incurred by them in necessary pollution control measures. The pollution control scheme was extended in section 50 of the Bill as initiated to extend the scheme for a further three years to 6 April 2003 and also to provide for an increased first year expenditure limit of £40,000 which I announced in my budget speech of 1 December last.</P>
    <P>Arising from the farm taxation undertakings in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, I am committed to the further enhancement of the scheme as follows: a reduction in the writing down period from eight years to seven years, an increase in the first year expenditure limit to £50,000 and the option to claim the lesser of 50% of expenditure or of the increased expenditure limit of £50,000 in a more flexible way over the writing down period.</P>
    <P>I brought forward the amendment on Committee Stage to give effect to these changes in commitments. In the case of the extra flexibility sought, that amendment provided that the year one allowance could be taken in either of the first two years of the writing down period instead of being taken in year one only. During the debate on Committee Stage I undertook to look at this matter again with a view to providing even greater flexibility as to when this allowance could be claimed. I am glad to say that I have been able to make the necessary changes to ensure this allowance can now be taken at any time during the writing down period at the discretion of the farmer who has incurred the expenditure. Thus, a farmer will now be in a position to claim the allowances in the way that best suits his or her needs. My amendment ensures that the farm taxation undertakings in this area given under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness are fully <Col N="173" /> met and I therefore commend the amendment to the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments relate to section 61 which I introduced on Committee Stage to provide a new scheme of capital allowances for expenditure incurred in the purchase of a milk quota under the proposed new national quota restructuring scheme which my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is introducing from 1 April next. The allowance will apply to a milk quota purchased from co-operatives or dairies as well as in the case of certain <Col N="174" /> milk quota purchased directly from lessors who are currently leasing that quota.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 85 is a technical amendment to ensure that a person who has only commenced as a milk producer and who has purchased a milk quota will be entitled to the CAP allowance under the scheme. With effect from 1 April next, as part of the new national quota subsidy scheme, a milk quota will no longer transfer with land with some exceptions, such as in the case of a family transaction or the sale of a holding as a going concern. Amendment No. 86 is an anti-avoidance measure to ensure that the transfer of a quota between families does not benefit from the new capital allowances regime. With effect from 1 April 2000, it will no longer be possible for quota holders not engaged in milk production to temporarily lease their milk quota. With regard to a milk quota lease that expires on or after 31 March 2000 the lessee may purchase the milk quota from the lessor without the relevant land. Amendment No. 87 is a technical amendment to the definition of a qualifying milk quota purchased by a lessee and clarifies the two relevant Council regulations as separate and distinct and that the qualifications in relation to a leased quota can be under either regulation and not necessarily both.</P>

      <P>In page 172, line 49, to delete &ldquo;and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In last year's Finance Act I gave the Revenue Commissioners new powers of access to financial institutions. The definition of financial institution in the relevant section only covered institutions licensed by the Central Bank and does not extend to institutions doing business here under the EU second banking co-ordination directive of 1993. Under this directive, credit institutions authorised by a member state of the EU may provide services either on a branch or cross-border basis to other members states without further authorisation from the regulatory authorities of the host country. I understand there are some 21 EU credit institutions operating on a branch basis in this State. These amendments revise the definition of a financial institution to bring these institutions within the ambit of the Revenue powers.</P>
      <P>A section in last year's Finance Act gave the Revenue Commissioners special powers in investigating an offence. This power &ndash; which is in section 908A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 &ndash; involves obtaining a District Court order to allow access to material in a financial institution for the purposes of investigating an offence. It was modelled on a similar power available to the Garda under the Bankers' Books (Evidence) Act, 1879. Unfortunately, an amendment to that power in the Disclosure of Certain Information for Taxation and Other Purposes Act, 1996, was not taken into account. That amendment extended the type of material which could be accessed under a District Court order. These amendments rectify that omission and I commend them to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 89:</P>
      <P>In page 173, line 39, after &ldquo;audit&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and the number of accounts which gives rise to this additional tax&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sub-committee of the Committee of Public Accounts made a number of recommendations in <Col N="176" /> its report and one was that the banks would pay the full amount of DIRT owed and that the Revenue would make an assessment of that. This amendment seeks to amend a section which implements another recommendation of that sub-committee, which was that Revenue would report back to the PAC. It details the headings under which that report would be made, including the amount of tax owed by each financial institution. This amendment provides for the Revenue to report on the number of accounts which gave rise to this tax.</P>
    <P>I put this amendment down for debating purposes more than anything else, but I want a clear statement from the Minister on what the Revenue Commissioners are doing in assessing the financial institutions, to calculate the outstanding liability of DIRT not paid. How many financial institutions are being examined? I understand from the Committee Stage debate that Revenue had some kind of sampling system in place whereby a sample number of accounts were examined and the evidence was then extrapolated from that to raise an assessment against the bank. I understand from one bank, however, that every account with a deposit of more than £25,000 is being checked systematically. The senior banker who spoke to me said that Revenue had already checked more than 50% of the accounts with more than £25,000 in them and was proceeding. He did not have categorical information that every account would be checked, but if it was a sample it was extraordinarily large.</P>
    <P>I want clarification on the <i>modus operandi </i>of the check. When it reaches the point where Revenue is satisfied it knows the outstanding liability of an individual bank, will the Minister outline what the procedures will be? Will there be a discussion at that point? If Revenue and the bank agree figures, is it automatic that both interest and penalties will apply or may Revenue exercise discretion? Is there a policy decision on interest charges and penalties?</P>
    <P>When that hurdle is cleared, whatever the decision is, will Revenue settle with an institution that is willing to settle? Can we talk in terms of a full and final settlement without appeal mechanisms or recourse to the courts if both Revenue and the financial institution are inclined to settle and if the institution is willing to write the cheque to finish the matter? Can they finish the matter? </P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate the time frame? I gather from one of the Minister's earlier comments that Revenue expects to be finished some time in June or July and to report to the Public Accounts Committee by September. Will settlements with the financial institutions have to await the report back to the Public Accounts Committee or can they be done in the period between the end of the check and the report back &ndash; in other words, can a settlement be reached in the summer months, between June and September as I understand? Many people feel pressured at the moment. The publicly quoted companies involved have had a series of difficulties with <Col N="177" /> share prices. There are newspaper stories that the main banks have an overhang of £1 billion. If that is believed in the financial capitals of Europe, one could understand why there would not be a great demand for shares in the principal banks. I would have thought that one of the main bank's potential overhang from DIRT liabilities would be quite small from what I saw in the Public Accounts Committee report. I know there is only so much the Minister can do in advance of going through the process, but he could give us as much comfort as he can by making the procedures transparent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear about the interaction of the committee. Do the Revenue Commissioners intend to wait until the process we are going through is effectively finished or do they intend to give an interim report to the committee? Do they intend to say to the committee that they are continuing to debate a disputed assessment with an institution and that they will come back as soon as they have reached an agreed assessment? In the event of an assessment not being agreed without court proceedings, do they intend to report that to the committee? What information can the committee expect to receive from the Revenue Commissioners next September or October?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 904B empowers and requires the Revenue Commissioners to report before 1 November 2000 to the Committee of Public Accounts, the results of the look-back DIRT audit in the case of each financial institution, specifying the DIRT arrears levied, interest charged and penalties imposed, any comments considered to be appropriate and if any appeal has been lodged. This is, in essence, what the Committee of Public Accounts recommended in its report.</P>
      <P>The power given to the Revenue Commissioners to conduct DIRT audits is set out in section 904A which I included in last year's Finance Bill. The focus of DIRT audits under that section is on checking a sample of non-resident accounts. The information gathered from checking the sample of non-resident accounts, together with the other information obtained by inspectors in the course of their audits, will lead to the estimation of the level of DIRT under-deducted by the financial institution. That, I imagine, would lead to discussions with the financial institutions concerned to seek agreement as to the DIRT liability. If such agreement was not forthcoming, an assessment would be raised by Revenue and if the assessment was appealed by the financial institution, it would be necessary for each side to put its case to the Appeal Commissioners for their determination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The focus of the report to be made by Revenue to the Public Accounts Committee in November is on the DIRT arrears, interest and penalties arising from the look-back exercise and fully <Col N="178" /> reflects the recommendation of the PAC. I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputies Noonan and McDowell raised various questions and we tried to cover these aspects on Committee Stage. There are more than 40 financial institutions at present. We are carrying out a stratified sampling exercise whereby there will be a weighted concentration on accounts of greater quantum. It is possible that certain financial institutions have a great concentration of deposit accounts above a certain figure. It is hoped to complete the investigation process by June or July of this year. The sampling work will be done by that date but the negotiations with the individual financial institutions will not be done at that stage. There will be the same discussions with the financial institutions as would apply in the case of individuals. If the financial institutions agree with the assessment and with the proposed interest penalties and costs, Revenue will have the power to agree these with the particular financial institutions. The Revenue Commissioners have the power at present to mitigate penalties which frequently happens in relation to individuals and other institutions. They will continue to have these powers. There is an appeals mechanism whereby if a financial institution does not reach agreement, the Revenue will raise an assessment, the assessment will be appealed and it will then go through the normal procedures.   </P>
    <P>The settlement will not be reviewed by the Committee of Public Accounts. However, various provisions in the Bill will be reported back to the committee. Section 68 amends Chapter 4, Part 38 of the Principal Act and section 904B at paragraph (3) reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;. in respect of each such audit</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>) the name of the relevant deposit taker concerned,</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) the amount of additional appropriate tax payable by the relevant deposit taker as a result of the audit,</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>) the amount of interest payable in respect of any such amount,</P>
    <P>(<i>d</i>) the amount of any fine or penalty imposed by a court on the relevant deposit taker under the Tax Acts, or accepted by the Revenue Commissioners in place of initiating proceedings for recovery of such fine or penalty,</P>
    <P>(<i>e</i>) whether an assessment has been made in respect of appropriate tax and, if so, whether the assessment has been appealed,</P>
    <P>(<i>f</i>) whether the audit has been completed as at the date of the report,</P>
    <P>(<i>g</i>) the amount of any payment on account of appropriate tax paid by the relevant deposit taker in anticipation of an audit being carried out or during the course of an audit, and</P>
    <P>(<i>h</i>) such further particulars as the Revenue Commissioners consider fit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="179" /> The Revenue Commissioners do not have to produce an interim report but they can publish the information at any time. If they decide on or before 1 November to publish the information, they can do so. They will report to the Committee of Public Accounts on 1 November but I hope the negotiations will be concluded by that date. It would be amazing if the negotiations had taken place and everyone was in agreement by that date, but Revenue will report back to the Public Accounts Committee on its progress by that date. The Public Accounts Committee will not decide on how the banks should be penalised but the Revenue will give it a full report. Revenue will then agree a settlement and proceed as it sees fit.</P>

Is it also the intention to go after them to establish the source of the money which was on deposit in the first instance? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>That will have to be considered by the Revenue Commissioners in due course when they finish with the DIRT audit of the financial institutions. As to the pursuance of individual account holders, that issue will arise in the normal course. Handling that aspect is not top of the Revenue agenda at present. It takes many man hours to deal with one particular back duty case to which I referred earlier today. If one is dealing with a couple of hundred thousand cases dating back over 20 or 30 years, I do not know in what century would it be completed. This is something Revenue will have to consider. This was not referred to very often during the Committee of Public Accounts inquiry but I am pleased the Deputy raised it. The financial institutions were at fault in turning a blind eye to bogus non-resident accounts. However, the depositors of the money were guilty of tax evasion in the first instance. In 99.9% of cases the <Col N="180" /> worry was not whether gross or net interest should be paid or whether there were bogus non-resident accounts, the worry was the underlying source of the deposits. There are thousands of bogus non-resident accounts. In an earlier debate today I referred to the multiplicity of accounts and tax evasion in general. That is something that the Revenue Commissioners will have to address in due course because it is their job to pursue each and every individual taxpayer without fear or favour. During the Committee of Public Accounts inquiry, in the lead up to it and in all the debates over the past two years, politicians in this House have taken it upon themselves to say quite often and quite stridently that the Revenue should go after everybody without fear or favour. That is a matter the Revenue Commissioners will have to consider in due course. It is possible that everybody who evaded tax will be investigated in due course. It is for the Revenue Commissioners to decide how they will go about it.</P>

    <P>The amendment modifies the transitional arrangements contained in section 70 of the Bill, which was introduced on Committee Stage. This section restricted the &ldquo;sideways&rdquo; set-off &ndash; that is set-off against other income &ndash; of certain partnership trading losses, capital allowances and entitlement to interest relief where a partner is merely a passive investor and is not actively involved in a partnership trade. I stress that the new section did not in any way impact on a taxpayer who is actively engaged in a partnership activity.</P>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment on Committee Stage was to close off, once and for all, the use of passive partnerships for tax avoidance purposes. Deputies may recall that in the Finance Act, 1998, I closed off passive partnership tax shelters specifically involving films and oil/gas exploration. At the time I also issued, in a press release dated 28 February 1998, a very clear &ldquo;yellow card&rdquo; as regards new schemes. That press release stated:</P>
    <P>If further similar abuses come to light in any other area of activity, the Minister said he will not hesitate to legislate against them with immediate effect.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the targeted and focused approach adopted in 1998 did not work. Variants of the same schemes have reappeared involving different activities and some changes in order to get around the 1998 Act restrictions. There are serious potential losses to the Exchequer if these schemes go unchecked. In one example given to me by Revenue a tax deduction of £113,749 &ndash; representing an actual tax saving of £54,600 &ndash; was available to a partner who had made a contribution of £25,000 &ndash; a 118% tax-free return on the partner's investment.</P>
    <P>There is a long history of attempts by various Ministers for Finance to tackle the problem of avoidance schemes involving partnerships. <Col N="186" /> Deputy Dukes started the process in 1986. His anti-avoidance measure in the Finance Act of that year was focused on limited partnerships &ndash; under the Limited Partnerships Act, 1907 &ndash; which were engaged in investment activities as diverse as ships, hotels and television series, and which were costing the Exchequer £35 million at that stage.</P>
    <P>In February 1991, when Deputy Albert Reynolds was Minister for Finance, another avoidance scheme was launched which would have involved Irish limited partners investing in services to property companies in the United States. However, this scheme was abandoned due to unfavourable media publicity.</P>
    <P>In 1992, when the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance, further action had to be taken against limited partnerships under section 23 of the Finance Act of that year. This provision further limited the offset of losses and capital allowances arising out of a limited partnership.</P>
    <P>In 1994, the Taoiseach, as Minister for Finance at that time, had again to introduce further measures under section 29 of the Finance Act, 1994. That section brought certain schemes involving general partnerships within the scope of the limited partnerships anti-avoidance provisions.</P>
    <P>As well as the action I took against film and oil/gas partnerships in 1998, Deputies may also recall that in 1998 I shut down the open-ended availability of capital allowances for passive investment in certain tax favoured buildings, such as hotels and buildings located in tax designated areas. At that time I completely ring-fenced capital allowances for passive investors in the case of hotels, except for seven north-western counties, and capped allowances available for sideways set-off at £25,000 in the case of buildings in tax designated areas.</P>
    <P>While my amendment on Committee Stage this year was primarily aimed at very aggressive tax avoidance schemes involving film and music partnerships, I decided, in light of the history of partnership schemes which I have just outlined, to adopt a broad brush approach to the problems in this whole area. This includes property based or asset based partnership schemes set up to maximise special incentive reliefs, such as double rent relief. While tax incentives are there to be used and to encourage investment which would not otherwise be made in areas such as films, urban/rural renewal and high risk business expansion, I have a difficulty when incentives are used in highly artificial and &ldquo;packaged&rdquo; ways which can reduce effective tax rates on very high incomes to very low levels. That would be unfair to the general body of taxpayers and would work against the progressivity of the tax system. What I am doing in this area is entirely consistent with what I did in 1998 as regards ring-fencing capital allowances for passive investors.</P>
    <P>However, since the text of the amendment on Committee Stage was published on 29 February I received a number of representations to the effect <Col N="187" /> that the transitional arrangements may be too harsh in relation to certain property based or asset based partnership schemes, particularly schemes involving seaside resorts, car parks and other projects qualifying for double rent allowances, the white fish fleet, and renewable energy projects.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Opposition spokespersons have also received similar representations. Having considered the various representations the Government has decided to bring forward the following amendments to the transitional arrangements. As regards existing seaside resort area partnerships, where a double rent allowance is being claimed the amendment provides that the ring-fencing restrictions for partnership losses, capital allowances and interest relief will not, in those cases, apply until the tax year 2004-5.</P>
    <P>As regards existing partnership schemes involving car parks and other double rent projects outside the resort areas, the amendment provides that the ring-fencing restriction will not apply to partnerships qualifying for the double rent allowance until such time as the entitlement to that deduction ends. These transitional measures only apply to existing partnerships who have a qualifying lease, under the double rent allowance provisions, in place before 29 February.</P>
    <P>As regards the white fish fleet, I brought in a scheme of accelerated capital allowances in 1998 for expenditure on BIM approved vessels, provided the expenditure is incurred before 4 September 2000 in the case of individuals leasing such vessels to fishermen. The amendment provides that the transitional arrangements for the white fish fleet will mirror the availability of accelerated capital allowances for that scheme &ndash; that is, expenditure before 4 September 2000 will be unaffected.</P>
    <P>As regards partnerships involved in leasing equipment &ndash; for example, windmills &ndash; to renewable energy companies, the amendment provides that the ring-fencing restrictions will not apply where the expenditure was incurred under an obligation entered into between the lessor and lessee before 1 March 2001. I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for a very full explanation, the first full explanation of this initiative. The Minister has traced the pedigree of the use of partnerships for tax avoidance purposes back to the 1980s when Deputy Dukes was Minister for Finance. The Minister has estimated that at that time the loss to the Exchequer was £35 million. He has traced the re-emergence of the difficulty through the periods when Deputy Reynolds and the Taoiseach were Ministers for Finance, to the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the roots of the use of partnerships for tax avoidance purposes is so deep and the practice so prevalent, the House requires an explanation of why this measure was introduced as a <Col N="188" /> Committee Stage amendment. If this measure is a considered policy position, why did it not appear as a section in the Finance Bill as published? If this had been done, Opposition Deputies would have had an opportunity to take advice on the matter. It is difficult enough for Opposition spokespersons to deal with the Finance Bill when we learn of its contents in time, but when we learn of measures by way of Committee Stage amendments it is even more so. This case was particularly difficult. While the amendment was published on 29 February, it was taken in committee without debate and was dealt with by way of time motion when only amendments in the name of the Minister were taken. Therefore, this is the first discussion of this issue on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>I thank officials of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners who put themselves at the disposal of the Opposition privately and took us through this informally. That was very helpful. Opposition Deputies who only learned of this measure on Committee Stage are being lobbied by tax practitioners who are far wiser in the way of tax avoidance than I am. This presents us with a difficulty.</P>
    <P>The Minister's policy was to outlaw everything that could be avoided by way of partnership and then to allow injured parties to make their case so that adjustments could be made on Report Stage. This is what the Minister is doing by way of this amendment. The House decided that certain activities should be encouraged through the use of tax breaks. If the House decided that partners in multi-storey car parks should have a tax break, a catch-all provision should not remove that tax break. If it is Government policy to encourage multi-storey car parks by means of tax breaks, that should stand. The Minister has restored the policy sufficiently. The same should apply to holiday homes, the white fish fleet and so on.</P>
    <P>I can accept the amendment. The Minister has done the best he can in the circumstances but his method of proceeding was less than satisfactory. If the House had had more notice of this, Deputies would have been better able to cope with it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has extended the proposed double rent allowance to the year 2004-5. I suggest that the Minister extends it for another year. The period was originally ten years and the Minister has reduced it to four. Five years would be an acceptable compromise. The people who are lobbying Deputies could feel that their efforts had achieved something and we could accept the measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been reasonable in amending the Committee Stage amendment. Is it reasonable for someone to claim allowance in respect of money actually invested, whether in holiday homes, multi-storey car parks or other projects? It is not reasonable when the losses on the investment are, through various mechanisms, overstated. The Minister tells us <Col N="189" /> that it is not possible to prevent the ritual overstatement of those losses. As Deputy Noonan has said, we have no choice but to take the Minister at his word. I am in no position to suggest an alternative mechanism.</P>
      <P>I accept the amendment. I agree that we have not had an opportunity to consider it in detail but it appears that the Minister has reached a reasonable compromise on the four issues he talked about earlier this evening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many advantages to the self-assessment system. However, one of its disadvantages is that many tax avoidance mechanisms do not come to light until they have been put in place. In February when tax inspectors examine the files of individuals, the claims under various schemes come to light.</P>
      <P>Tax breaks are given for multi-storey car parks, seaside resorts, urban renewal and so on. None of this has been changed. They are legitimate tax breaks for investments which the Government wishes to encourage. Members of my profession have used artificially contrived arrangements to create further tax breaks for their clients. I believe all is fair in love and war and that the taxpayer is entitled to minimise his tax liability to the best extent possible, using the law. Some time ago a section was inserted in a Finance Act to allow for any form of tax avoidance to be wiped out. In general, I believe that if a taxpayer can find a way of minimising his tax liability he is entitled to do so. On the other hand, when we find a tax avoidance mechanism we try to close it off.</P>
      <P>I have given the history of the use of artificial partnerships going back to Deputy Dukes's time. In my first Finance Bill I introduced an overnight amendment which I thought would put an end to this abuse. I gave a warning about the use of artificial partnerships and particularly the use of limited partnerships after 1987 which were never intended for the purpose to which they have been put in the past ten years. When I find that warnings are not being heeded and that abuse is continuing, my policy is to abolish the tax incentive scheme completely. That was the effect of the Committee Stage amendment.</P>
      <P>The present amendment introduces reasonable transitional arrangements and I believe this is the proper course. Many interesting schemes have been used over the years and people have made enormous returns. We will leave those for another day. I give a general warning to tax practitioners. If I signal that I suspect abuse of a particular scheme I will abolish the scheme completely if the abuse continues.</P>

    <P>These amendments are dictated by constituency considerations. They seek to extend in Deputy Deenihan's constituency the upper Shannon tax scheme to districts in the lower Shannon Estuary in north Kerry &ndash; Tarbert, Carrig, Asdee, Beale, Gullane and Killehenney. Deputy McGrath wants the administrative County of Westmeath included in the same scheme for tax break purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows exactly what I am going to say. The upper Shannon rural renewal scheme is meritorious. Deputy McGrath and I have been trying for the past two years to have it extended to include, for technical reasons, the administrative County of Westmeath but the Inny basin in north Westmeath, in particular, which is a defined segment. The River Inny is one of the major tributaries of the Shannon. I salute all the areas included but I was flabbergasted and astounded when the Inny basin was excluded given that the population of the area has fallen significantly by between 35% and 40% as a result of mass migration.</P>
      <P>I am very surprised that Senator Cassidy who lives in the area has not brought this matter to the attention of the Minister. When it was raised by Deputy McGrath and I at Westmeath County Council we took it as read that Senator Cassidy would bring it to the attention of the Minister, that our worries would be eased and that we would not have to worry him on a night like this, but lo and behold nothing has happened. We make this appeal for the third time. Why was the area in question, which stretches from my village of Ballynacargy through Rathowen, Lisryan, Lismacaffry, Multyfarnham, Coole and Castlepollard, excluded from the scheme?</P>
      <P>It has come to my notice that industries which might otherwise be attracted to the area are gravitating towards a neighbouring county which is included in the scheme in its entirety. Such industries are required to arrest the significant decrease in population. The area, which suffers from other disadvantages such as the lack of transport services, was the hub of activity at Coolnagun Bord na Móna and suffered huge job losses in the 1980s. Much work is being done at county level to attract industry to the area. It would be very disheartening if industries which might otherwise be attracted to it located in areas covered by a rural renewal scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the take up in those areas which have been included in the scheme? The Minister should take Deputy McGrath and I at our word and as a gesture of goodwill include the defined segment of north Westmeath to which I have <Col N="192" /> referred. If need be we can supply him with a map.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to support the amendments in the hope the Minister might be generous and in a good mood at this late hour on 8 March, Ash Wednesday, and see fit to include part of County Westmeath in the scheme. As Deputy Penrose said we had a difficulty framing the amendment in the sense that a defined area had to be included. It is being made very clear however that there is a major crisis in a small portion of north Westmeath &ndash; to a great extent, the Coole electoral area but the area that borders on counties Cavan and Longford, in particular, from which there has been significant migration which has resulted in devastation. The statistics show that the population of the area declined by 23% in the late 1980s.</P>
      <P>The beautiful village of Finnea on the County Cavan border is divided by a bridge with which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is very familiar. One side of the village is in County Cavan while the other is in County Westmeath. County Cavan is included in the rural renewal scheme. Thankfully, a number of industries have been attracted to the area. I mention the Crumb Factory in particular which was built from nothing by a local man who now employs about ten people. He has reached the stage where he wants to invest and expand. The question he has to look at is whether he should relocate 100 yards away on the far side of the bridge in County Cavan. Because of its tax designation status this would certainly prove worthwhile. As things stand he cannot avail of the same tax breaks in County Westmeath.</P>
      <P>What I find depressing about canvassing in the main village is that many houses are unoccupied. The same applies to the main street of Clonmellon on the County Meath border but in the same electoral area and, to a lesser extent, Delvin, which is starting to pick up. Ideally the entire Coole electoral area which includes Finnea, Delvin, Rathowen, Lismacaffry, Clonmellon and Castlepollard should be included in the rural renewal scheme. Should it not prove possible to include it the Inny basin, which is a defined segment, should be considered as an alternative. About ten years ago a study of the area was conducted. It highlighted the need for improvements and the need to attract projects to the area. That study is available as are the various maps, etc., associated with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The biggest disappointment from our point of view was that when the Finance Bill was published there was no mention of this area. We had been led to believe it was in the bag. Senator Cassidy, the Leader of the Seanad, indicated clearly that this was just a matter of him talking again to his good friend, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and there would be no problem delivering in this area. Regretfully when the Bill was published we saw that it was left out. We are really helping the Minister because I know Senator Cassidy has strongly made the case to <Col N="193" /> him; it obviously slipped the Minister's mind. We tabled that amendment and the Minister will be able to accept it knowing the commitments which have been given in County Westmeath. Knowing of the need for it in County Westmeath and the representations which have already been made to him by his good friend in the Seanad, I ask the Minister to possibly include the Coole electoral area or, if not, at least the Inny basin in County Westmeath for rural renewal.</P>

      <P>On amendment No. 95, this scheme is one which I promoted strongly when I was Minister of State at the then Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry. At that stage I set up a task force on rural development policy which led to the subsequent White Paper of this Government. This is a scheme which I suggested should be put in place and the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, to his credit, did so without pressure from anyone, as he said himself.</P>

      <P>I was inspired by one place, in particular, and the Minister, because of his knowledge of football, would be familiar with this particular place, Ballylongford. Great footballers came out of there, but unfortunately they may not be coming out of there in the future because the population has halved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and the Walsh's and all those great people. Deputy McGrath spoke about the villages in Westmeath, but the population of Ballylongford has halved. All along the Shannon Estuary, from Tarbert and Ballylongford right back to Asdee, Beale and Ballybunion, which was once a densely populated area, the population has declined because the traditional indigenous sources of employment like hardware stores, bakeries, local creameries, etc., have closed and there is nothing to replace them. As a result the population is completely demoralised.</P>
      <P>There were great expectations that something would happen in the Shannon Estuary. There are approximately 600 acres held in public ownership there but, despite various promises, nothing has materialised. For that reason, this scheme, which is a saviour for rural areas, should apply to other parts also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister is under a great deal of pressure to extend this scheme to north Cork, for example &ndash;  I met a delegation coming in to meet the Minister fairly late one evening &ndash; and to other parts. The justification for the inclusion of <Col N="194" /> this particular area and the DEDs which I am proposing at this part of the River Shannon, that is, the Shannon Estuary, is that the scheme should not be confined to just one part of the River Shannon, that is, the upper River Shannon. It should also be equally applied to the lower regions of the River Shannon. If it can be applied to that part of north Kerry, that is, Ballylongford and Tarbert, it can also be applied to the Clare area. My amendment applies to Kerry only. I look forward to the Minister's comments on this proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to extend the definition of &ldquo;qualifying rural area&rdquo; for the proposes of the scheme of tax reliefs which has as its aim the renewal and invigoration of certain rural areas on the lines of the renewal schemes which had previously been available in an urban context.</P>
      <P>This scheme is targeted &ndash; on a pilot basis &ndash; at parts of the upper Shannon region. The pilot scheme, as introduced, covers all of the counties of Leitrim and Longford as well as certain areas in counties Cavan, Roscommon and Sligo based on a district electoral division basis. In all, 150 such divisions are included: 38 in west Cavan, 77 in Roscommon and 35 in south Sligo. This, by any standard, is a significant area of the country in the context of a pilot scheme.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 95 seeks to add certain district electoral divisions in County Kerry to the scheme and amendment No. 96 would add County Westmeath to the scheme. A similar proposal to add this county was made on Committee Stage of the Finance Act, 1999.</P>
      <P>I was not in a position to increase the area in 1999 and the position remains the same now. The greater the area that is designated, the more diluted the impact of the incentive scheme. If the geographical scope of the measure is too wide, it will not achieve the aim of the scheme, which is an attempt to renew and invigorate parts of the upper Shannon region.</P>
      <P>To follow the line proposed in the amendments could result in rural areas from all parts of the country seeking to come within the scope of the rural renewal initiative. Additions to the scheme in this manner would be incompatible with the proposals for rural renewal as envisaged when I announced the scheme. At that time I stated clearly the area in which the new arrangements would apply, that is, in the upper Shannon. I do not doubt for a moment that there are other areas which would benefit from this type of incentive package, but I am not in a position to provide for an enlargement of the area already earmarked for the scheme. I regret, therefore, that I am not in a position to accept the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked a question about the up-take of the scheme. The business incentives were agreed by the European Commission only in July 1999. Therefore, I would not have any figures in that regard. From my travels around the country I <Col N="195" /> know that in certain parts of the designated area there has been considerable up-take.</P>
    <P>It is a generous scheme. I explained on many occasions that I have been advised to proceed accordingly otherwise I would have to extend it to the whole country. I have received representations to have other areas included from the time I announced the scheme. One of the most decent Deputies is Deputy Matt Brennan and I split his parish in half because it is done on a DED basis and he lives just outside the area. I have not been able to accede to the request of my very good friend, Deputy Matt Brennan, and have, in fact, partitioned his parish. When I was not able to succumb to the wishes of Deputy Brennan, I am not able to accede to these either. I know if I move the line by one inch, I would have to do so all over the country as the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, had to do with seaside resorts in the first place and then with regional airports. It is my intention to stick to the areas included in the pilot scheme until it runs out. I take Deputy Penrose's word that there are certain parts of his constituency which could do with this particular incentive, but it is my intention that the areas now defined will last until the end of the pilot scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the principle underpinning the amendment. I do not have any difficulty with the idea of tax incentives focused on a particular geographic area to encourage economic activity. I suppose if the economy was not as prosperous as it is, some of these schemes would not work. It is hard to distinguish between what is being delivered by the tax incentive and what is being delivered by the general boom in the economy, which is reaching out now from the main centres of population into other areas. We are anxious to proceed to other sections of the Bill, but I ask the Minister to indicate that, when the period is completed for this pilot scheme, he would not be averse to making the kind of extensions in future along the lines suggested by the Deputies who spoke on behalf of their constituencies. Indeed, many of us could make a case for areas in all constituencies.</P>

I am a little worried about expert groups because if I listened to them all, many of these schemes would never be created.

I made the point, not entirely facetiously, on Committee Stage regarding the urban renewal scheme and the town of Lisdoonvarna with which I am familiar. When we are looking at the effect of these schemes we must look not just at the area at which it is targeted but at the immediate adjacent areas. The difficulty for a town like Lisdoonvarna is that it will lose investment to adjacent towns such as Ennistymon that have the designation. The only way to get around it is to establish criteria that will be applied generally rather than doing it on a crude geographical basis.</P>

      <P>This deals with the issue of taxable gifts and inheritances and the minimalist rule. When we    debated this on Committee Stage the Minister spoke about the need to restrict the payment out of trusts, discretionary trusts in particular. It seems, having spoken to tax practitioners since, that it should be possible to delimit this so that only one payment out of a small inheritance would be possible from a trust set up by a disponer rather than allowing for a payment out on an annual basis. That should allow us to introduce the concept of a minimum inheritance that could be taken tax free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of this amend<Col N="198" /> ment is to introduce a small inheritance exemption similar to that which operates for small gifts. At present a gift up to £1,000 in any one year may be taken by a donee from a disponer without incurring a charge to capital acquisitions tax. No such exemption operates in relation to inheritance tax. The extension of such an exemption to include small inheritances could open up substantial possibilities for tax planning. A discretionary trust set up under a will trust could be used to appoint assets valued at £1,000 in successive years over a prolonged period and by doing so avoid a charge to mainstream inheritance tax.</P>
      <P> The only way the Revenue Commissioners could envisage restricting a small inheritance exemption to a once-off case would be to apply the exemption to every inheritance and this would cost £4 million in a full year taking into account the substantial changes I am making to the capital acquisitions tax code in the Bill. However, the matter will be considered further before next year's Finance Bill. It is worth bearing in mind that the new group 1 threshold being introduced in this Bill will exempt an inheritance of up to £300,000 from tax. For these reasons I am opposing this amendment. However, as I said, I will consider it further in the light of next year's Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 259, to delete lines 32 to 42, and in page 260, to delete lines 1 to 9.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 106 to 108 deal with inheritance tax and the changes the Government and the Minister have made. I am in some difficulty in this regard. The amendments that I would have looked to propose have been ruled out of order. What I sought to do was provide that, while accepting the Minister's major reform in relation to a shared family home, that would, in fact, satisfy the entire threshold amount. If you were to inherit the home in which you lived from an aunt or uncle while that would be free from tax as long as you lived there, it would be considered towards your threshold amount and you would pay CAT on any amount in excess of the family home. Unfortunately, the amendment has been ruled out of order for reasons that are well established in precedent but which I do not understand so I am left, in a sense, just objecting to the Minister's proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put on record that the Minister has gone further than he needed to in reducing the impact <Col N="199" /> of CAT. Inheritance tax is ultimately a redistributive tax. The Minister has torn the guts out of it and that is something I and my party cannot support. He has gone beyond what needed to be done in order to ameliorate the impact in particular cases on the family home.</P>

      <P>The threshold for inheritances received by immediate relatives, sons or daughters or parents, is £150,000 and the present index value of that is about £198,000. The Minister proposes to increase that to £300,000. That does not reflect the rate of increase in property values. Deputy Deenihan and I propose a threshold of £400,000. I have also argued that instead of having three class thresholds it would be better to have two but the Minister dealt with that adequately on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I had strong representations from the Kerry Hotels Federation on the issue of inheritance tax. I did not have an opportunity to mention it on Committee Stage. They believe that the threshold should have been increased to £1 million to reflect inflation over that period and also the increase in the value of hotels, guesthouses and bed and breakfast accommodation. Perhaps that is reflected more in the Killarney area than other parts. I realise they would have major business relief but the Minister might refer to that aspect. They believe the cost involved is prohibitive where it is being transferred on to a family member.</P>

      <P>I support this. Given the major increases in property prices in recent years the measure should be updated and placed on a realistic footing. I hope the Minister will take the amendment into account, which is realistic given the increase in prices, etc. As Deputy Deenihan said, there is not much point in a person getting a business which will end up like an albatross around their necks for the rest of their lives. People find it hard enough to survive in business, and there is not any point in putting a business in jeopardy. It would be better for the State to allow people the opportunity to trade successfully without this hanging around their necks.</P>

It seems this is one of those taxes which people only support as long as it affects almost nobody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>To a considerable extent this takes away the point of the tax in the first place. Deputy Belton asked why people should have to go through life with an albatross around their necks in terms of tax. Why should somebody be entitled to take a business, rather than having to go out and create one? There are people who must start from nothing, borrow money and build up a business. They are at a considerable disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> somebody who simply gets handed a business because he was related to the person who owned and ran the business prior to death. Perhaps my view is too fundamentalist, but I regard inheritance as not much more than the cascade of privilege down through the generations. If that is to happen then the very least we can do is have a tax take as it cascades downwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>In section 145 I have provided for increased thresholds and for a single 20% rate of tax. Taken together the new group thresholds, particularly the group 1 threshold of £300,000, and the 20% rate of tax will substantially reduce the liability of beneficiaries to capital acquisitions tax. When the dwelling house exemption provided for in section 151 is taken into account, the package of measures in the Bill constitutes the biggest single reduction in the incidence of capital acquisitions tax since its introduction in 1976. Accordingly, I oppose the amendment.</P>
      <P>As Deputy McDowell recognised on Committee Stage, I have introduced fundamental changes to the capital acquisitions tax code. He said I had taken the heart out of the code. On Committee Stage and previously, and in line with what Deputy Belton said, I said I prefer to tax people when they are living and not worry about when they pass on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The origins of this tax was estate duty, the premise of which was that much of the wealth of the country was confiscated by our near neighbours and we felt we should get a lump of their money when they passed on, and maybe that was good. However, I do not go along with the concept today, and I do not agree with Deputy McDowell's idea regarding CAT. That is why I have made significant changes this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McDowell's party leader also made very significant changes regarding CAT in terms of 90% business relief and 90% agricultural relief. It is surprising he did not go the full way and <Col N="201" /> introduce relief of 100%, as the relief is very generous. In terms of business relief, I have introduced a new threshold of £300,000 in the context of a father and daughter or father and son. Under this a business up to £3 million could be transferred to a son or daughter. The rate of 90% relief was not initiated by me, but by Deputy McDowell's party leader, and I do not necessarily think the Deputy agrees with it.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage Deputy Noonan mooted the idea of two classes, something he also mooted some time ago before the budget. On account of all the changes to CAT, and given that the major money comes from the class 2 threshold, ie, between uncles and aunts to nephews and nieces, I decided not to make any move to reduce the classes to two. However, I am well disposed to narrowing it further and I may address this area in future Finance Bills.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan mentioned the Kerry Hotels Group. As Minister for Tourism and Trade I remember meeting the Kerry Hotels Federation on a number of occasions, and apart from tourism issues, this issue was raised on a few occasions in 1993 and 1994. They must be more pleased with the changes I have made this year to CAT.</P>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Belton's point, due to business relief a pretty substantial amount of money can be transferred.</P>

      <P>In page 270, line 8, to delete &ldquo;£40,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£60,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's initiative to raise the threshold for exemption from probate tax from £10,000 to £40,000. However, in line with his general policy which favours doing things in big bites rather than nibbles, he should have reflected what a small estate is, and I think a figure of £60,000 would be more appropriate. Contrary to his own position he has pitched the figure too low. We would all agree to the increase as probate tax is a very serious imposition on persons who inherit very small amounts from parents, etc.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to speak about amendments Nos. 110 and 111. Section 147 provides for an increase in the probate tax exemption from £11,250 up to £40,000, the largest increase of its kind since the tax was introduced in 1993. This increase must be taken in the context of the other major CAT changes which will be made this year. The package of measures in the Bill will do much to alleviate the burden of CAT. We have new group thresholds, with the group 1 threshold <Col N="202" /> now being £200,000, with a new single rate of 20% and a new generous dwelling house exemption provided in section 151. For these reasons I cannot accept the Deputies' amendments.</P>
      <P>I considered scrapping probate tax altogether. It was introduced in 1993 for very good reasons but I more or less thought it was a return to the old estate duty idea which involved lumping all the money together and taking an amount from it. I did not like it from the day it was initiated. However, when I added the cost of the various changes we are making to CAT I decided not to scrap the tax at this stage. However, my views on probate tax are on record and are exactly the same as my views when I was in Opposition. I do not like the notion of probate tax and like it even less than CAT.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 112:</P>
      <P>In page 270, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) in subsection (1) of section 127, by the insertion of the following paragraph for paragraph (<i>f</i>):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(<i>f</i>) quoted shares in or securities of a company incorporated in the State.',&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is the result of a submission by one businessman and previously I put it informally to the Minister. It relates to a publicly quoted Irish company where the managing director/chief executive owns 24% of the shares. It has a very high capital value and employs between 2,000 and 3,000 people. Like any father he would like to transfer the business to his family, but he is not eligible for business relief because of the cut-off date, which I think is 1994. I am advised this amendment would get over that anomaly. I cannot understand why such an anomaly should exist, unless I am missing some policy consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to grant CAT business relief of 90% to shareholdings in companies which are quoted on the stock exchange. CAT business relief was introduced in order to alleviate the problems with businesses caused by the imposition of a 40% CAT charge on capital values. In order to fund such a liability the business concerned might have to be sold, go into liquidation or else be re-financed to such an extent as to threaten its future viability. Quoted companies do not have to face the same problems. Share in such companies can easily be sold on the stock market. The fund's CAT liabilities do not have any effect on the viability of the underlying business. This is why quoted shares do not qualify for business relief. However, as the Deputy may be aware, certain quoted shares already qualify for relief <Col N="203" /> provided they were unquoted when they were acquired by the disponer or on 23 May 1994, the date the Finance Act, 1994, was passed, whichever is the later date. The reason for this exemption was to avoid discouraging unquoted companies from subsequently floating on the Stock Exchange. However, I understand the purpose of this amendment is to grant relief to all quoted shareholdings, even those which were already quoted on the Irish Stock Exchange on 23 May 1994. Accordingly, I oppose the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a strong economic case to be made for encouraging companies to obtain capital through being publicly quoted and, in this case, it allowed a company to expand from a small base, make a major contribution to the economy and employ approximately 2,500 people. This is a penalty. If this man had made a decision to remain a limited company and did not expand as much as he did, the company would probably be worth less, but in terms of transferring it to his heirs he would get a much better deal because he would qualify for business relief. It is late now to debate it fully but I will forward the correspondence to the Minister and I would like him to consider it for next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 114:</P>
      <P>In page 272, line 44, after &ldquo;or&rdquo; where it firstly occurs, to insert &ldquo;, in the case of an inheritance, that dwelling-house has been occupied by the individual as his or her only or main residence preceding&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have serious doubts about the requirement for a person availing of the exemption from inheritance tax to be resident in the family home he or she inherits for several years before the death of the disponer. It is not necessary. The Revenue are fully familiar with the notion of principal primary residence and it seems that if it is a person's principal primary residence on the day of the death of the disponer and if the onus of proof that it is such a residence is on the beneficiary, that should be sufficient. The Minister will experience many problems. Someone will reside in the house for two years and 11 months and he or she will be excluded and there will be a great deal of lobbying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not necessary because the other concept is one with which the Revenue is familiar. The onus of proof would be on the beneficiary. He or she would have to show that it was his or her residence on the day prior to the death of the disponer and that would be done in the traditional <Col N="204" /> manner. In other parts of the tax code, people must do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>If any problems arise in regard to this issue I undertake to examine them because it should be a matter of fact whether it is one's principal primary residence. One cannot have two. The Deputy is also making the case that the three year residency requirement might present a problem. I thought three years was quite a reasonable period in order to prevent people from getting involved in tax planning exercises but I am willing to examine the matter before next year's Finance Bill in light of some difficulties that might arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will know that for the past three or four weeks the fishing community in Howth in my constituency, the premier east coast fishing port, has been in total disarray. The livelihood of the skippers and crews of between 15 to 20 boats, perhaps up to 500 to 800 people in total, has been diminished by the events of the past number of weeks. Howth is famous for its prawn fishery but this area is now impossible to fish. During another debate I asked the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to consider coming up with an urgent rescue plan for the fishermen and families of Howth in conjunction with the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sadly, the events of the past number of weeks have displayed the gross incompetence of my constituency colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, who held the marine and natural resources portfolio at that time. If we compare his performance with that of <Col N="207" /><Col N="208" /> the Northern Ireland Minister, Ms Bríd Rodgers, and the deal she got for Portavogie and the Northern ports, we realise that the Minister, Deputy Woods, got a disastrous result for the fishermen of Howth.</P>
    <P>The Howth fishermen have long understood the need for conservation. I have the lengthy report they submitted a number of years ago demanding conservation of the Irish Sea cod fishery and which became a basis for the Irish Sea cod recovery plan. There were discussions in Brussels at DG XIV at which a number of our fishermen were represented. Unfortunately, they came home to find that a large box in the Irish Sea, with which the Minister is familiar, encompassing the whole north Dublin coast and three hours sailing off the Howth peninsula was closed to them even though it was the main source for their livelihood. It is a disastrous situation. The key problem is the overlapping of the prawn and cod fisheries but whatever way one looks at it, the livelihood of dozens of families in an important part of my constituency has been removed.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Seán Ryan said when he raised this issue in respect of north county Dublin fishermen a few weeks ago, there is also a key safety issue. The Minister is effectively asking the fishermen of Howth, in their small 50 to 70 foot open decked boats, to sail for at least three hours to the open prawn grounds. This is extremely dangerous because if bad weather blows up, they are three hours sailing time from safety. Fishing has always been a dangerous job and one of the monuments in Howth, on Harbour Road, is dedicated to the many fishermen who died trying to earn a living over the past number of decades.</P>
    <P>The situation is now impossible. The Minister and his predecessor are asking these men to risk their lives. We urgently need a major compensation package at least based on the average industrial wage and on incomes for comparable periods last year. I ask the Minister to get together with the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to bring forward a compensation package as soon as possible for my constituents who have no livelihood until early May. It is a disastrous result for the people of Howth and the fishing industry there. It is the number one port on the east coast and the number one shell fish port in Ireland. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, to convey to the Minister, Deputy Fahey, the urgent need to bring in a compensation package and not to leave these men and women and their families without a livelihood over the next three months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne):</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Council and Commission decided in December, with the support of the member states, that an Irish Sea cod recovery plan had to <Col N="209" /> be put in place this year to ensure a future for the Irish Sea cod stock. I am little surprised that Deputy Broughan took the opportunity to criticise the Minister, Deputy Woods. I had the pleasure of working with him for the past two and a half years. I can say categorically that he worked extremely hard and probably got a better deal than most others would have. It is a little disingenuous to speak of him in his absence.</P>
      <P>In early January my Department circulated a discussion paper and discussed this with fishermen at a meeting in the Department. A delegation incorporating six east coast fishermen met the Commission and other member states on 21 January to discuss proposals for the protection of adult spawning cod. There was broad agreement on the areas that had to be closed but the Commission expressed strong concern about high by-catches of spawning cod in prawn fisheries. The Commission proposed a ten week closure of a large area of the western Irish Sea for prawn fishing. Due to the dependence of east coast Irish fishermen on prawn fishing, the Irish delegation sought to keep as much as possible of the prawn fishery open. The Commission eventually conceded to keep the bulk of the prawn grounds open. A small area of prawn ground overlaps with the biggest concentration of spawning cod in the Irish Sea and the Commission insisted on closing this for the ten week period.</P>
      <P>In mid-February my Department circulated a second discussion paper to the east coast fishermen on possible measures to ensure that small cod, of little commercial value, were not killed in Irish Sea fisheries before they had a chance to spawn. This paper was discussed with fishermen and a delegation, incorporating six east coast fishermen, met the Commission and the other member states in Brussels on 24 and 25 February to discuss the proposals. The Commission is now preparing a draft Council regulation to achieve this objective.</P>
      <P>The member states involved in beam trawl fisheries in the north eastern Irish Sea have also agreed that beam trawling will not be permitted in the cod protection boxes from 13 March to the end of April. Given that most of the beam trawlers target sole, which is also spawning at this time of year, it is expected that there will be a biological benefit for the sole stock from this initiative. The Irish beam trawl fishery for sole is always limited to a number of weeks in the spring and autumn by virtue of the quota restrictions on these species. Hence this measure, which has been discussed with Irish beam trawl fishermen, will not impact on the volume of sole caught by the Irish fleet this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall position is that a comprehensive package of measures is being put place in consultation with fishermen, which in combination offer the best chance yet to turn around the terminal decline of the east coast fishing industry. <Col N="210" /> That is something which they understand. Since the 1980s the Irish Sea stocks have been progressively declining and this has resulted in the demise of east coast fishing communities. This nettle is now being grasped and there has been significant support from the fishermen, who have been deeply involved in the process, for the actions which are being taken. The fishermen and their representatives recognise that the situation has to be turned around.</P>
    <P>I recognise that some prawn fishermen will have longer steaming times to get to the prawn grounds, but the important point is that the bulk of the ground is still open for prawn fishing. From the end of April onwards all prawn grounds will be fully open for the remainder of the year. Fishermen have indicated that the prawn grounds overall are very heavily fished and that the prawn catches will probably be improved in the area which is currently closed when the fishery recommences there at the beginning of May.</P>
    <P>The package of measures which has been put in place in the Irish Sea will primarily benefit the vessels targeting the mixed whitefish fisheries. It is those vessels that have suffered most from the decline of the cod and whiting stocks over the past decade and whose future would be secured by a recovery of these stocks. While I accept there is some short-term displacement of fishing activity this spring, this should lead to better returns in the coming years.</P>
    <P>The measures that are in place have been structured to give rise to the minimum disruption to fishing activity and to retain the maximum range of fishing opportunities possible for east coast vessels. The measures are necessary to ensure a viable future for east coast fishermen. They are of short duration and limited impact and in these circumstances the payment of compensation requested by the Deputy would not be appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to raise with the Minister what I can only classify as the scandal of the Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta pension scheme and to strongly recommend that this anomalous situation be rectified as a matter of urgency. I demand a review of this scheme in advance of any privatisation or part privatisation proposals from Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When first introduced the scheme was acknowledged to be one of the best in the country. Some 30 years later it is probably one of the worst in the public and commercial semi-State sectors. Today the Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta pension scheme has inadequate contribution income due to the low level of employer contribution, which is completely out of line with normal practice. Pensions are fixed on the basis of years of service and pay at the date of retirement with no guaran<Col N="211" /> tee of any post retirement pension increases. Increases that may be awarded must be at the discretion of the trustees. There is not indexation of pensions and any increases must not exceed the increase in the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>This scheme can be compared to those that prevail in the public and semi-State sectors. Throughout the public sector pensions are indexed to the salaries of existing employees. If staff get an increase in pay under a national pay agreement or if they get a special increase such as that secured by Army personnel, nurses, gardaí and firemen in the recent past, their pensioners get the same percentage increase.</P>
    <P>That rule applies to all civil servants, local authority employees, health board employees, Army personnel and the Garda. In the ESB, Eircom, An Post, RTE and CIE salaried grades pension schemes guarantee that pensions will be kept in line with existing salaries. The Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta pension scheme is the exception. A further exception is that over the past 15 years pension increases for the various companies have increased by significant amounts. In that period, CIE salaried staff got a pension increase of 80.96%, RTE staff got one of 163%, Civil Service executive officers got one of 107%, national teachers got one of 106% and at the bottom of the scale Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta staff got one at 58.9%. Is it any wonder that pensioners of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta who have made huge personal contributions over the years to ensure the future growth in development of both companies are angry and frustrated when they see themselves being treated in such a less favourable manner than pensioners in other comparable employments.</P>
    <P>The purpose of any pension scheme should be to enable all participants to acquire an income that allows them to maintain their established standard of living on attainment of retirement age and in the case of dependents on the death of the income provider. This scheme fails the test and, accordingly, I strongly recommend that it be amended to provide for pensions indexed to wage increases, as is the practice throughout the public sector and which also obtains in private sector employment.</P>
    <P>In reply to a parliamentary question I tabled on 9 February, the Minister confirmed that she had not yet received a report from the chairmen of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta on the work of the task force on the pension scheme. I am deeply concerned at this as I firmly believe this excuse may be used by the Minister for not amending this anomalous and unacceptable pension scheme prior to her privatisation proposals for both companies being announced.</P>
    <P>I seek a commitment from the Minister of State that this issue will be satisfactorily resolved before any privatisation proposals are brought <Col N="212" /> before this House. It is a fact of life that employees generally do not become interested in their pension entitlements until they reach 45 to 50 years of age. In this case and at this time, it is imperative that all the staff and pensioners of Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports take a stand on this issue.</P>
    <P>Members of the Oireachtas are unhappy with their pension entitlements. However, unlike the staff of those three airports we, like most other groups in the public and semi-State sectors, are contributing to an index linked pension scheme. Why should the staff and pensioners of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta be treated any less favourably? This is a true test as to how the Government treats its elderly who have contributed so much over the years to ensure the success of our economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob):</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Ryan on raising this important issue. The Irish airlines (general employees) superannuation scheme was originally established in 1954 to manage the pensions of all permanent staff in Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta. The scheme is a defined benefit scheme in which the employers match the contributions of employees. The object of the scheme is to provide pensions which are granted in accordance with the rules of the scheme for the benefit of the members and their dependants.</P>
      <P>The rules of the scheme provide for a mechanism within which annual increases are awarded to pensioners. This comprises a percentage determined by the trustees based on the amount of the actuarial surplus of the fund and the rate of inflation. The increase is at the sole discretion of the trustees.</P>
      <P>Members of the scheme pay a contribution calculated as a percentage of their salary. For staff recruited prior to 1970, this contribution is 6.375%, while for staff recruited after 1970 it is 5.1%. The companies, Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta, contribute a similar amount.</P>
      <P>The scheme, while established on a defined benefit basis, has paid pension increases in line with CPI every year with the exception of a number of years in the 1980s where the rate of inflation was high and the increases were below the rate in question.</P>
      <P>Since 1 April 1967, a member who retires at his normal retiring date or thereafter is paid a pension from the date of his retirement at the rate of one-sixtieth part of his final retiring salary for each year of pensionable service. The amount of any pension paid to a member at retirement is subject to a maximum of forty-sixtieths of final retiring salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise is aware that some members of the scheme have expressed concern at the indexation arrangements attaching to their pension entitlements and other issues. <Col N="213" /> The Minister is also aware that there is a wide range of complex issues involved in the scheme. Following receipt of representations from retired employees and unions representing employees in Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta, the Minister asked the chairmen of the companies to establish a task force to examine the concerns which have been expressed and to submit a report to her.</P>
    <P>The task force, established in December 1999, is working to terms of reference drawn up by Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta. It comprises four members nominated by the representative groups. The chairman and one independent member were nominated by the companies and were accepted by the representative groups.</P>
    <P>I understand the task force has concluded the extensive process of taking submissions, both written and oral, from interested groups and that it is currently having the issues and concerns costed as appropriate. Once this exercise is complete, the task force will document its findings and submit them to Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta who will then revert to the Minister. It would be inappropriate for the Minister to comment further in the matter in advance of receiving that report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Recognising that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, is a man of action I hope he will do something about Tralee Hospital. What is happening there is an absolute disgrace. I know it is not the Minister's fault but something has gone wrong with the level of staffing and resources. Last week we received the figures for public in-patient waiting lists. For example, from March 1997 to December 1999, the increase of those on the waiting list was 132%. It was 204% in 1997 and it has increased to 475%. The hospital is being forced to have such a long waiting list delay because it is under-resourced.</P>
      <P>Recently, I wrote to Tralee Hospital concerning a woman who was having major difficulties with varicose veins, a common enough problem, which was affecting her work and mobility. I received this response from the surgeon in the hospital, which sums up the whole situation:</P>
      <P>Dear Jimmy,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thank you for the copy of your patient's letter and the GP's letter. I note that this lady has varicose veins. Unfortunately, this is a non-urgent condition and she is not likely to be seen in this hospital for five years. At present there are over 4,500 patients waiting to be seen in the surgical out-patients' clinic. Many of these have malignant conditions and we will not discover which of these have malignant conditions until we actually see them. As of today there are people waiting from 1992 to be seen in the hospital. At present the surgical out-patients' clinic is filled to capacity. We see more new <Col N="214" /> patients in each surgical out-patients' clinic than any other surgical department in the country. Because of the continual refusal of the health board to provide us with sufficient staff and resources this situation is unlikely to change until the Southern Health Board and the Department of Health decides that it needs to be changed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a major responsibility as regards this situation. The <i>Kerryman</i> ran this article on its front page last week and there is major concern in the county about hospital waiting lists. People who have medical complaints are afraid that by the time they will be seen as public patients it will be too late for them. I have knowledge of an instance where a letter calling a woman to a medical appointment was sent to the person one year after she had died. I am afraid that by the time some people are called they will not be around because they will have passed on.</P>
    <P>In its explanation to the <i>Kerryman</i>, the Southern Health Board disputed the figures for waiting lists, stating:</P>
    <P>This arises because this list, which was built up over the past eight years, is currently being validated and many of the people on this list will have been seen either through the accident and emergency department in Tralee General Hospital, in another hospital or may no longer need treatment.</P>
    <P>I agree with them on the latter point, because the people concerned are probably dead. The health board spokesman insisted that people on the list were non-urgent cases and that all urgent cases are seen immediately. That totally conflicts with what a reputable surgeon said in his response to me.</P>
    <P>According to the Southern Health Board, Tralee General Hospital has two general surgeons who dealt with over 6,900 patients in their surgical out-patients' clinic in 1999. If they dealt with that number of people I cannot see how there could be such a waiting list. Obviously, therefore, that is not accurate.</P>
    <P>There is a problem in Tralee Hospital and I would advise the Minister to visit the facility. The Minister is a man of action and I know he will take on the problem. Since 1997, the increase in the in-patients' waiting list at Cork University Hospital, for example, has been only 5% compared to 135% in Kerry. Obviously, there is not the same problem in Cork hospitals as in Kerry. We are being victimised because we are lumped in yet again with Cork for our medical services. Something is radically wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity provided by Deputy Deenihan to discuss the current waiting list position at Tralee General Hospital. I wish to emphasise that I am conscious of the fact that the waiting times endured by many patients for access to acute hospital procedures are unacceptable. The multi-faceted nature of this problem was con<Col N="215" /> sidered by the expert review group which reported to my predecessor in 1998. I am currently reviewing progress to date in the implementation of the wide ranging measures of a short, medium and longer term nature recommended in that report. In attaching a serious priority to tackling lengthy waiting lists and times, a number of practical steps can be taken to accelerate progress, including achieving more flexible use of available capacity and closer collaborative arrangements between the different parts of the system.</P>
      <P>I have allocated a further £23.5 million to agencies under the waiting list initiative for the year 2000. This represents an increase of 17.5% over the £20 million allocated in 1999 and is almost three times the amount allocated by the previous Government in 1997. The Southern Health Board has this year receive £1,340 million in waiting list money which represents an increase of approximately 63% over 1999. In developing their service plans for 2000, agencies may include appropriate investment in aspects of out-patient services where they consider that the funding would help to address some of the underlying causes of unduly lengthy waiting lists. As part of this initiative Tralee General Hospital has appointed a third general surgeon who took up duty last month. This appointment is expected to have a significant impact in reducing both the in-patient and out-patient waiting lists for general surgery in the hospital.</P>
      <P>I am confident that these developments, together with longer term measures associated with the investment of resources available under the NDP will achieve real progress in addressing the underlying causes of waiting lists and unacceptably long waiting times for certain specialities.</P>
      <P>In relation to the waiting list position at Tralee General Hospital, I understand from the Southern Health Board that a validation process of the waiting list is currently under way at the hospital. Following the outcome of this validation process the hospital's primary objective will be to establish ways in which the quality of the out-patients' service to the public can be improved. In regard to the scheduling of hospital appointments, patients' GP referral letters are reviewed by the relevant consultant who classifies them into urgent, intermediate or routine. I have been advised by hospital management that urgent cases are seen at the consultant's next clinic.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the substantial additional resources provided to the Southern Health Board under the waiting list initiative, coupled with the validation procedures and the appointment of the additional consultant, will show a marked improvement in the waiting list at Tralee General Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can also assure the Deputy that when I do travel to Kerry I will call into Tralee General Hospital, as I have already indicated to the hospital authorities. I was due to do so two weeks <Col N="216" /> ago but I could not. Hopefully in the next month or so I will be able to pay a visit there.</P>

      <P>On 15 April 1999 an oral presentation was made to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation by Mr. Ted Neville and Mr. Michael Bolton on behalf of the Irish Real Tennis Club Association. The association was seeking to preserve the site of a real tennis court in Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin, for which planning had been granted for development as a recital hall for the National Concert Hall. I acknowledge the wonderful work and contribution made by all those associated with the National Concert Hall and the need for it as a centre of musical excellence to have greater flexibility in the accommodation that it provides in the many and varied events it presents. However, this issue is not about the development of the National Concert Hall but rather the preservation of a real tennis court that is the only one of its kind in Ireland and the only one in the world with marble features. It is one of only three in the world that are owned by national governments. The others, at Hampton Court, London and at Fontainbleau in France, are major playing and tourist venues. The facility at Earlsfort Terrace is one of only six existing courts in the world to have hosted the real tennis world champion challenge in the last 150 years, having done so in May 1890.</P>
      <P>Real tennis is a little known sport in Ireland. It is the original game of tennis, devised by monks and the game from which lawn tennis evolved in 1874. It has been played in its present format for over 400 years and is at present experiencing a huge growth in playing activity, with 42 courts across the world and many more under construction. The game is played on a large indoor court, with many internal features such as an offset wooden racket and hand-stitched, cloth-stuffed balls</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Behind the wall of Earlsfort Terrace, unknown to virtually all the population, is a unique gem that may soon be lost forever. How did this court come to be? Sir Edward Guinness of the Dublin brewing family built a court in 1885 and in 1939 his son donated his residence, Iveagh House, the Iveagh Gardens and the tennis court to the Irish nation. Rupert Guinness, the second Earl of Iveagh, wrote to Taoiseach, Eamon de Valera, when he gave the court to the nation and said that he was loth to think of the tennis court being destroyed as he felt it was unique in its way and might be appreciated by players in Dublin. The court has not been played on since. Its recent use as a workshop and offices by UCD and the Office of Public Works has resulted in alterations to the <Col N="217" /> interior which the Office of Public Works has costed at £1.5 million to repair. The Government wishes to develop the court as a facility for the National Concert Hall, but the Irish Real Tennis Association made a laudable presentation to An Bord Pleanála at an oral hearing <i>vis-à-vis</i> the change of use. At present the proposals are on hold as there are concerns that the proposal would contravene the deed of trust made in 1939 between the second Earl of Iveagh and the Irish State. I believe the Attorney General's office is currently investigating this.</P>
    <P>There should be no need for any of this. UCD can be relocated from Earlsfort Terrace to Belfield, with the NCH getting much deserved scope for expansion. In the process the real tennis court can be saved. If this course of action is taken and the court refurbished, in a few short years this unique facility will be as significant as any other landmark building in the capital. This is not about a sport for the elite, but rather preservation of part of our unique and various culture and I ask that the opportunity to save this unique heritage be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Timmins. I am a member of the Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation. The Irish Real Tennis Association made a very worthwhile presentation to that committee. As Deputy Timmins said, this is a unique gem and the Minister has an opportunity to preserve something unique to Ireland. The Irish Real Tennis Association has put a lot of work into this; theirs is a minority sport, but something so unique in culture and character should be preserved. I look forward to seeing this as a monument to the Minister's foresight if it is preserved and I do not doubt we will have the chance of a game of &ldquo;real&rdquo; tennis there. I look forward to seeing the Minister in her white shorts. The Minister has the opportunity to do something very worthwhile here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter. I am glad Deputy Reynolds has not yet lost his sense of humour.</P>
      <P>In recent years it has became apparent that the main auditorium of the National Concert Hall which was opened in 1981 was no longer adequate to cater for the various demands being placed on it or to meet the strategic objectives of the board of the hall. The strategic thrust of the NCH as a national cultural institution is to broaden its audience base and to develop a programme of events with a strong outreach, education and tourism content. Such programmes are aimed at stimulating people of all ages and backgrounds in the appreciation and exposition of various types of music. To develop effectively the programme needs a proper space in which to operate. Hence the proposal to convert what was the former UCD gymnasium building for use by the National Concert Hall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This building is currently being used as a teach<Col N="218" /> ing and testing laboratory by the UCD engineering faculty. The NCH has made a very good case for a space that can accommodate smaller recitals, the outreach programme and other functions that would be inappropriate in the main auditorium. The John Field Room, which functions from time to time as a second recital space, is regarded as inadequate and inappropriate for this purpose. For example, no concert, rehearsal or other public or private event can take place in the John Field Room while any performance is taking place in the main auditorium. This in effect means that the two spaces cannot be used concurrently.</P>
    <P>The addition of a new recital space within the same campus is intended to give a much needed flexibility to the NCH. The existing 1,200 seat auditorium of the NCH is far too large for the presentation of some chamber music concerts and other musical events which require more responsive physical and acoustic surroundings.</P>
    <P>It was decided in consultation between the Office of Public Works and the National Concert Hall to design a recital hall within the former gymnasium building with seating capacity for 320 people. Funding for this project was originally included in the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999, to be co-financed by the Exchequer and the EU. However, due to the implications of delays in progressing the NCH project, the funds earmarked for it &ndash; £1.6 million &ndash; had to be transferred within the operational programme. However, I am satisfied that Exchequer funding will be available for this project when it can proceed.</P>
    <P>Planning permission for the project was granted by Dublin Corporation subject to certain conditions relating to the preservation of original features within the building in November 1998. This decision was appealed by a group known as the Irish Real Tennis Association to An Bord Pleanála. An oral hearing of this appeal was held on 20 April 1999 and the board decided in favour of the planning authority's decision to grant permission in June 1999. The Irish Real Tennis Association, which claims a membership of about 30 in this country, has now lodged an application for a judicial review of this decision with the High Court. The case is currently adjourned. As I understand is the normal practice, the Office of Public Works has undertaken not to proceed with any works on the project pending the outcome of the legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>I must make the following two points before concluding. Should the development we are proposing proceed as approved by An Bord Pleanála it will involve the reinstatement or restoration of many of the original &ldquo;real&rdquo; tennis court features. This will not happen if the current use is maintained there. None of the adaptations required for use as a recital hall would prevent the building being used at some time in the future for &ldquo;real&rdquo; tennis if a decision was to be made for such a change of use. The nature of the work will, in fact, facilitate such a change if required in the <Col N="219" /> future. Second, the building when converted and restored will add a vital new element to the cultural infrastructure of Dublin and its hinterland. It will thus be accessed and used by many thousands of people attending recitals, a great deal <Col N="220" /> more than will be the case if the building remains with its current use or indeed if it were to be used as a &ldquo;real&rdquo; tennis court.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 9 March 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>While ministerial responsibility for litter and signposting lies with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, I have consistently also drawn public attention to the fact that these two issues regularly feature at the top of the dissatisfaction category in Bord Fáilte's annual visitor attitude surveys.</P>
      <P>The Litter Pollution Act is now being implemented in an increasingly proactive fashion by the local authorities. I welcome the fact also that the Minister has established a national anti-litter forum, on which Bord Fáilte and the Irish Hotels Federation are represented, and that the forum is expected to issue a report in the next month or so outlining strategies to combat litter. I trust that publication of the forum's report will result in widespread public debate on how best to resolve our litter problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two pilot projects, one in Waterford and one in Tipperary, in the tourism and the environment pilot initiative which I launched under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999 are <Col N="222" /> aimed specifically at developing models on how to effectively tackle the litter problem. These projects will be completed over the next few weeks and will bring fresh thinking to bear on this issue.</P>
    <P>With regard to signposting, a Bord Fáilte survey of all overseas travellers during the period January to September 1999 still found that 10% considered poor signposting to be either an unsatisfactory aspect of an Irish holiday or an aspect in need of improvement.</P>
    <P>Noticeable progress has been made in recent years by the National Roads Authority and local authorities in the quality and level of directional signposting. It is expected that continued priority will be given to improving our signposting provision as an integral part of the ongoing investment in our road system as envisaged under the new national development plan.</P>
    <P>These efforts have been complemented over the past six years by a special £1.5 million tourist signposting programme, financed under the operational programme for tourism, implemented by Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development, in conjunction with the six regional tourism authorities, the Central Fisheries Board and local authorities. This expenditure has been earmarked specifically for tourist signposting for coastal and inland touring routes, including mountain and valley drives, urban tourist trails, river names, historic and commemorative plaques, heritage towns and tourist information. Implementation of the tourist signposting programme will conclude in autumn 2000 after completion of the residual tourist signposting works outstanding at the end of 1999.</P>

      <P>The regional tourism authorities were established by Bord Fáilte under the Tourist Traffic Acts for the promotion and development of tourism on a regional basis. In line with the commitment set out in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium, Bord Fáilte initiated a review of the RTAs during 1999, carried out on their behalf by Fitzpatrick Associates.</P>
      <P>The objective was to review the role and operations of the RTAs and recommend how they could optimally contribute to the achievement of national tourism objectives and targets set by the Government in line with Bord Fáilte's strategic plan, while taking into account regional priorities and customer focus. The consultants met with my Department and a number of other agencies and bodies during the course of their assignment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chairman of Bord Fáilte forwarded to me a copy of the review together with the board's <Col N="223" /> view on its recommendations for my consideration. This consideration has also to take into account implications for the RTAs of the tourism provisions in the recently published national development plan and soon to be completed operational programmes, and of the possibilities for an all-island institutional structure for international tourism marketing as envisaged under the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    <P>In December last, I wrote to this effect to the chairman of the board. Subsequent discussions between officials from my Department and Bord Fáilte are likely to be concluded shortly which will identify issues to be addressed directly to the RTAs as the next phase of the review process.</P>

      <P>The Central Statistics Office has responsibility for the compilation of official tourism and travel statistics. Its latest release, published on 17 December 1999, relates to official visitor numbers for the first nine months of the year and revenue figures for the first six months. These figures show that the number of overseas visitors increased by 6.5% on the same period in 1998, from more than 4.5 million to more than 4.8 million. Revenue earnings from tourism for the first six months of 1999 increased by more than 12% from £954 million to £1,072 million. Publication by the CSO of official tourism figures for the full year is scheduled for the end of March.</P>
      <P>Preliminary results from Bord Fáilte's survey of overseas travellers for the breakdown of overseas visitors by type last year indicate that the number of those visiting for corporate, family or other reasons accounted altogether for 64% of all visitors. While our main growth target is the high yield holidaymaker, it is also important that we continue to attract the business visitor, especially the high spending incentive segment, and those who return regularly to visit with family and friends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord Fáilte confirmed that holiday visitors from North America, mainland Europe and other long haul markets increased last year, and expect final figures for North American holiday visits to be up by around 9%, for mainland Europe by more than 2%, and up some 7% from the other long haul markets, including Australia, New Zealand and Japan. However, although overall business from Britain increased again last year, the <Col N="224" /> board expects, as I have already stated today, that the holiday segment will be down on previous year figures for the first time since 1992.</P>

      <P>The emergence of e-commerce offers exciting new opportunities for tourism promotion and tourism policies. It has the potential to impact on each part of the tourism distribution chain including suppliers such as hotels and golf courses, intermediaries such as tour operators and travel agents, sectoral, regional and national marketing organisations and finally, the perceptions, behaviour and purchasing patterns of consumers.</P>
      <P>In the past five years Bord Fáilte, in conjunction with the industry and its strategic partners, has been at the forefront in introducing essential changes to avail of the opportunities presented by e-commerce.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte introduced its Tourism Brand Ireland Website in 1997 and almost immediately it became a primary source for information on Ireland and the range of tourism attractions available countrywide. In 1999, two million visitors accessed the Bord Fáilte Internet services which offer a wide range of services including dedicated sites specific to overseas markets, regional tourism marketing sites, as well as the on-line reservations service provided through one of its strategic partners.</P>
      <P>Infrastructure has been put in place to ensure greater access to dynamic information, provision of inventory on all available accommodation and other tourism services, as well as a range of motivational tools to encourage visitors to Ireland as a tourism destination.</P>
      <P>The main markets now have their own tailored world websites and this enables non-English speaking countries to travel around Ireland in their own language. The overseas tourism marketing initiative and the regional tourism authorities also have their own sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Harney, Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, recently commissioned a Forfás report on the policy requirements for e-commerce, including the tourism sector. This report recommends training for employees in the tourism sector in website management and transaction processing. It also recommends the integration of existing technology systems to the Internet and to local and national tourism offices, websites and booking systems. Both Bord Fáilte and CERT are currently involved with Forfás in developing an e-<Col N="225" /> commerce strategy for all the tourism providers in Ireland so that they can be integrated into the fast changing informative technology system.</P>
    <P>In tandem with the Forfás recommendations, Bord Fáilte under the direction of its chief executive, Mr. John Dully, is currently carrying out its own extensive Internet strategy review to ensure the tourism sector stays at the cutting edge of all new e-commerce.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>There are some 4,300 bed and breakfast operations which are listed in accordance with the criteria set by Bord Fáilte. Bord Fáilte has no comparable figures of similar accuracy for unlisted accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 9 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1957, Bord Fáilte is empowered to publish or cause to be published lists of tourism accommodation premises, including B&amp;B operations. However, &ldquo;B&amp;B&rdquo; is not a registered title, and <Col N="226" /> therefore is not a protected title under the Tourist Traffic Acts. Consequently, the system by which B&amp;B accommodation is listed is a voluntary one. While operators who do not wish to be listed by Bord Fáilte are not prohibited from carrying on their business, they are nevertheless bound by all statutory requirements relating to accommodation providers, including in such areas as taxation, planning, fire safety, hygiene, etc.</P>
    <P>The issue of mandatory licensing or registration of all tourist accommodation, including B&amp;Bs, has been examined by successive administrations over the years and they have all come to the same conclusion &ndash; that any mandatory system to be effective would require a significant diversion of resources currently devoted to the development of tourism towards administration and policing. This would be particularly burdensome as many accommodation providers only operate for short periods of the year.</P>
    <P>In recent years, there has been a substantial increase in the volume and range of tourist accommodation which has enhanced the choice available to tourists. This allows market forces to weed out accommodation which is not of a sufficiently high standard to meet tourist requirements. In light of developments in the supply of accommodation, I share the view of my predecessors that the introduction of a compulsory licensing system would be an inappropriate use of resources. There is no evidence to support the view that such a system would have any appreciable impact on accommodation standards over and above that brought about by market forces.</P>
    <P>B&amp;B operators who choose to be listed experience a number of advantages such as access to official marketing through Bord Fáilte, the Gulliver reservations service and the Tourist Information Office network. They may also participate at trade and consumer fairs, in advertising, in off-season promotions with tour operators, in trade education programmes, direct mail campaigns and publicity, etc.</P>
    <P>The various B&amp;B representative organisations play an important role in marketing this unique sector abroad, and increasingly in advising on how to reflect growing market expectations in the design, development and operation of the B&amp;B product.</P>
    <P>During 1999, I launched a new initiative which was targeted primarily at the small listed accommodation provider, under which Bord Fáilte is reviewing the branding and overseas marketing of the various groups in this category. I am confident this initiative will considerably expand the range of assistance and advice offered to the sector, thereby making listing a more attractive proposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>The sports capital programme for 2000 was advertised in early December 1999 and it was necessary for all groups applying for funding to complete an application form and submit it to my Department by the closing date of 11 February 2000. Initial processing of all of the applications received has commenced and a letter of acknowledgement will issue from my Department to all applicants within the next week.</P>
      <P>Applications received under the programme will be evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria which are outlined in the guidelines which accompanied the application form, and a copy of which was sent by my office to each Member of the House in December last.</P>
      <P>The criteria focus on the following factors: the extent to which the project, in terms of growth targets, will increase the levels of active participation in sport/recreational sport and/or result in improved standards of sporting performance; the extent to which the project, in terms of growth targets, will serve to increase participation in disadvantaged areas; the technical merits of the project, i.e. if the project complies with standard technical specifications from the relevant governing body and statutory authorities; the financial viability of the project, i.e. in addition to lottery funding, if the club-organisation has sufficient funds or firm commitments for funding to complete the project within a realistic timeframe; the level of local funding available; given realistic projections of income from the project, the extent to which the applicant will be able to maintain the project after completion; the level of socio-economic disadvantage in the area, as defined by ADM Limited's indicators, and the current and planned levels of sport and-or recreational sport facilities in the area; the need to achieve an equitable geographical spread of funds, having regard to the range of existing facilities in each county; the extent to which applicants have consulted with other clubs, community groups, schools and the local authority in developing their proposals and the outcome of these consultations; in the case of projects aimed at attracting people from disadvantaged areas, the strategies to be used to attract them; the need to achieve an equitable spread of funds among different sports and community groups; the priority of proposed improvements-facility in relation to the club-organisation's existing facilities; and the priorities for their individual sports, as identified by the NGB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A scoring system has been developed, under which individual applications are scored between nought and five under each heading depending on the extent to which they met the assessment criteria. Different weights, from one to four, are attached to the various criteria depending on their importance. The highest weighting is given to the disadvantaged criteria given that special <Col N="228" /> priority is being given to the development of facilities in disadvantaged areas. At the end of this process each application receives a score which decides its order of priority within its own county. Comparisons between the scores for applications in respect of projects from individual counties show that in some counties a lower overall threshold applies than in others, primarily because of the differing weightings attributed to various assessment criteria, for example, whether the county had disadvantaged status.</P>
    <P>In the past, grant allocations under the sports capital programme have been made on a county basis, <i>pro rata</i> to the population level in the county. I appreciate that under this system some particularly smaller counties are concerned at the level of funding which they have received under the sports capital programme. Accordingly, I have decided, subject to the number, quality and merits of applications received from counties, to set a minimum level of support for each county at £200,000. This enhancement to the scheme will encourage sporting organisations in the smaller counties to be innovative in the preparation of their plans for the provision of sporting facilities.</P>

      <P>The Irish Sports Council, which is statutorily responsible for implementation of actions to combat doping in sport, inaugurated the national sports anti-doping programme in November 1999. The programme has been designed with reference to the Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention, 1989, which seeks a three strand approach to the reduction of doping in sport, namely, testing, research and educational programmes and information campaigns.</P>
      <P>While my core objective has been to secure the establishment and implementation by the council of the programme, which is predicated on the active participation of autonomous national governing bodies of sport, the measures in the programme might be complemented through the application of certain legislative-based measures.</P>
      <P>A number of options have been identified, most specifically in the area of possession and supply of certain performance enhancing drugs, with regard to incorporating certain substances used in sport, under Ireland's general drugs legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I advised the House previously, consultations between my Department and the Department of Health and Children are at an advanced stage regarding the types of drugs used for the <Col N="229" /> enhancement of sport performances that may be suitable for inclusion in the Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act. In addition, the Department of Health and Children is engaged in a wider consultative process with the other relevant groups. Following the completion of this process the Minister for Health and Children will bring the declaration order and the corresponding regulations under that Act into operation.</P>
    <P>Including certain performance enhancing drugs will send a very strong signal to those coaches, trainers, athletes and any other persons found in possession of such specified drugs that they will, in future, be committing an offence under Irish law and be subject to the full rigours of that law.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999, included provision for 33 million ECU, £26 million, in European Regional Development Fund grant aid for the construction of a conference centre in Dublin capable of handling up to 2,000 delegates.</P>
      <P>A tender procedure, organised by Bord Fáilte under the direction of the independent management board for product development and conducted in accordance with EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC, was launched in September 1997 and culminated in June 1998 in the selection of the proposal submitted by Spencer Dock International Convention Centre Limited, to go forward for grant-aid to develop the conference centre at a site in Dublin's Docklands.</P>
      <P>Following a submission by the Government, the EU Commission, in November 1998, gave its approval in principle for a grant of 33 million ECU to the project with drawdown subject to resolution of an outstanding procedural complaint and the compatibility of any preferential tax regimes for the project with State aids rules.</P>
      <P>The Commission closed its file on the procedural complaint in April 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Towards the end of 1999, as negotiations between the various parties moved nearer to the end year deadline for entering legally binding commitments under the operational programme, the Government, after consultation with the Commission, secured agreement by the relevant monitoring committees that the grant of £26 million for the conference centre project would be financed from an increase in Exchequer non co-financed funds to the Tourism Operational Programme 1994-1999 to facilitate completion of the public procurement process and avoid any poss<Col N="230" /> ible risk of loss of European Regional Development Fund funds to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Having received confirmation from the Commission on permissible time limits for the grant drawdown, contract documentation was agreed by Bord Fáilte and the developers by end December 1999. I understand the parties' legal advisers are currently in contact over interpretation of one or two provisions of the grant contract.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance and the Commission are still in correspondence on the taxation issues. Meanwhile, planning permission for the conference centre, which was granted by Dublin Corporation in August last year, is under appeal and an oral hearing is under way. An Bord Pleanála has indicated that it expects to have a decision before July this year at the latest.</P>

      <P>Paragraph 11.4 of the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development 1994-1999 provided for the establishment of county strategy groups with the remit to secure the cohesion, from a county perspective, of the various local development initiatives being undertaken by the State and voluntary sectors.</P>
      <P>The issue of future integration and better linkages within and across publicly-funded programmes to provide a cohesive framework for the delivery of local services has been a key priority of this Government. To this end, it set up the Task Force on the Integration of Local Government and Local Development Systems in 1998, under the chairmanship of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey.</P>
      <P>The former Minister of State in this Department, Deputy Flood, was a very committed member of this task force, which published its recommendations in August 1998 and which were agreed by the Government.</P>
      <P>Central to the task force's recommendations was to replace the county strategy groups by the establishment of county-city development boards in 2000 whose primary functions will be to draw up a comprehensive strategy for economic, social and cultural development by January 2002 within the county-city and to oversee and work towards the implementation of the strategy. The boards will be assisted in their work on the strategy by the appointment of a director of community and enterprise to each board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>In December last, the FAI sought a subvention in respect of losses which they associated with the postponement of the Republic of Ireland-Yugoslavia match the previous June. As you will be aware, that postponement arose following the Government's decision to refuse visas to the members of the Yugoslav football team to enter Ireland. This decision was taken in view of the failure on the part of UEFA to cancel the match in the light of the unacceptable situation in Kosovo and the indictment of the International Tribunal against <Col N="232" /> the highest authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The decision of the Government was welcomed by the FAI. However, UEFA imposed a £50,000 fine on the FAI and the match was refixed for Dublin and played on 1 September.</P>
      <P>Costs and revenues generated from the Irish team's participation in events like the Euro 2000 Championships are generally a matter for the association and are dealt with in that context. Therefore, while of course continuing to provide funds to the FAI under a range of schemes, both capital and current, I did not make any specific allocation in relation to this item.</P>
      <P>Last year the FAI received some £166,000 in current funding, and FAI affiliated clubs were approved for almost £4 million in grants under the sports capital programme. The clubs which were the main beneficiaries under this programme in 1999 were Bohemians FC, Shelbourne FC, Kilkenny City FC, Cork City FC, Sligo Rovers FC and Finn Harps FC while a further 60 soccer clubs throughout the country were also supported towards the provision of soccer facilities. The applications for the sport capital programme for 2000 have now been received and I expect to announce allocations before June, including further allocations for the development of soccer facilities throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Grants to national governing bodies of sport for 2000, which the Irish Sports Council announced recently, include an allocation in excess of £114,000 for the FAI. This allocation is additional to funds which the council has also set aside for the association, along with the GAA and the IRFU, in respect of pilot initiatives in which the three organisations are involved, aimed at increasing participation in sport and recreation by young people from selected disadvantaged areas. The aim of the pilot is to produce models of best practice for governing bodies and clubs working in areas of disadvantage generally. Last year the association received an allocation of £58,000 under this scheme. The Sports Council will be evaluating the effectiveness of this expenditure before determining allocation levels this year under the scheme.</P>

      <P>The company was established as a power tool assembly operation in Dublin in 1990. Its parent company announced on 25 February 2000 that, due to a global restructuring of the company, it is reducing the size of the Dublin company from 184 to 68 people. The reduction of the workforce has arisen as a result of severe overcapacity within the group which operates plants in Japan, China, Singapore and Malaysia, as well as Ireland.</P>
      <P>The company's decision was arrived at following several meetings with IDA Ireland where it became apparent that these jobs could not be rescued. The proposed reduction will take place over the period April to August 2000. The company will relocate from its existing premises of 120,000 square foot to a smaller 50,000 square foot factory and IDA Ireland is assisting the company in identifying suitable factory premises.</P>
      <P>In light of the current demand for experienced workers in the greater Dublin area, including Clonshaugh, it is expected that the employees who are made redundant should not find it unduly difficult to secure new positions. It is understood that approximately six companies in the area and a number of employment agencies have contacted the company regarding the availability of employees. In addition, FÁS is available to assist the company and its workers in identifying and meeting particular training needs.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland has been informed that the company has offered a voluntary redundancy package covering 92 employees and that 95 applications have been received. A further 14 compulsory redundancies are scheduled. Also, a small number of further job losses will occur which will bring the total to 116.</P>
      <P>In so far as the State agencies under the aegis of my Department are concerned, I have been informed that the company has received employment grants of £780,000 and R&amp;D grants of £156,114 from IDA Ireland. IDA Ireland has commenced the process to recover grant liabilities due on foot of these redundancies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the availability of insurance cover, be it employers' liability, public liability or motor vehicle insurance, there is no provision under insurance legislation for me to interfere in the criteria for acceptance of a risk by an insurance company nor am I empowered to regulate the premiums to be applied for granting insurance. The provision of insurance cover is generally based on underwriting experience, including trends in the cost and frequency of claims, and is a matter of judgment for the individual insurance company. Any changes in the circumstances affecting the risk to be insured would be assessed by the insurer from an underwriting standpoint. The premium to be charged and even the availability of an insurance quote will reflect any material increase in the risk.</P>
      <P>I note that the gentleman referred to in the Deputy's question has incurred two claims against his policy, one following damage to his property and one following a claim from an employee who suffered personal injuries. The payment of any claims by an insurance company is likely to increase the cost of insurance for the policyholder. I can only suggest that he seek quotes from as many authorised insurance companies as possible.</P>
      <P>In the case of motor insurance, any motorist who is refused compulsory third party cover has the option of applying under the declined cases agreement for a quote from insurance companies which are party to that agreement. The agreement is operated by the Irish Insurance Federation and motor quotes are arranged for motorists under certain criteria including evidence of five refusals of motor cover by member insurers.</P>

      <P>The Government is profoundly concerned at reports of grave human rights abuses in Chechnya. The safeguarding of human rights is a core value of democracy. The Government is working to ensure that action is taken by Russia in this serious matter, and that practical assistance is made available for this.</P>
      <P>On Friday, 3 March, I raised the question of human rights abuses in Chechnya directly with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Gusarov, who was in Dublin for political consultations. I made clear that, both in a bilateral context and as chair of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, Ireland was deeply disturbed by the reports of abuses. I stressed that I expected Russia, in keeping with its international obligations, to investigate these reports fully and transparently and, where the reports proved to be well founded, to ensure the perpetrators were brought to justice.</P>
      <P>Acting President Putin has appointed a special representative for human rights in Chechnya, Mr. Kalamanov. Russia is now examining the possibility of Council of Europe human rights experts working with Mr. Kalamanov. I emphasised to Deputy Foreign Minister Gusarov that any Council of Europe presence in the region would have to be established in such a manner as to be credible and effective. Discussions by the Council of Europe with the Russian authorities on this issue are ongoing.</P>
      <P>The European Union, the OSCE and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights have all expressed their deep concern at the reports of human rights abuses and called for a full investigation. At a European Union meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov in Lisbon on 2 March, the European Union Presidency made clear that it expected Russia to take immediate action. This message was reiterated the following day by the European Union and the United States in a trilateral meeting with Russia.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government remains deeply concerned about the suffering being endured by the Iraqi people and particularly at the high rate of infant mortality, malnutrition, the inadequacies of the health system, and the deterioration in water supplies.</P>
      <P>In response to the humanitarian situation, the UN Security Council set up the oil for food programme, in operation since 1996. Essential food and medicine is purchased for distribution in Iraq. During the six month period ending next month $6.6 billion has been available to this programme.</P>
      <P>Ireland is involved in discussions on the issue of the humanitarian situation in Iraq both within the EU and at the United Nations. We favour the holding of an open debate in the Security Council on sanctions next month. We think that the Security Council in its further consideration of the sanctions regime needs to take greater account of the grave humanitarian situation. In particular, we would advocate a reduction in the number of refusals and delays by the sanctions committee in clearing supplies contracted under the oil for food programme.</P>
      <P>The Government would urge the Iraqi government to co-operate with Security Council resolution 1284 of 17 December 1999, which unconditionally removed the ceiling on the export of oil to fund the purchase of humanitarian supplies and provided for the suspension of sanctions in return for Iraqi co-operation with a new disarmament supervisory commission, UNMOVIC, and full compliance with all conditions imposed by the Security Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government made an emergency humanitarian grant of £100,000 to the International Committee of the Red Cross in 1999 to assist its relief work in areas such as medical support for the victims of war, prisoners' welfare and water and sanitation. The increase in the Irish contribution reflected the concern of the public and the <Col N="238" /> government that the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people should be addressed and further suffering by them be avoided.</P>
    <P>The Government has also been providing support to the Iraqi Marsh Arabs who are currently seeking refuge in Iran. The Marsh Arabs are Shia Muslims whose traditional homes in the Iraqi wetlands have been destroyed as a result of a massive drainage programme carried out by the Iraqi government. The majority of the refugees live in camps which depend on assistance provided by the Iranian authorities and the international donor community. In the past three years Ireland Aid granted a total of £358,000 to AMAR, the only NGO operating in this area of southern Iran, to fund basic health care, water and sanitation facilities and to organise supplementary feeding centres. A further £126,000 grant by the emergency and rehabilitation committee was approved by the Minister of State last week.</P>
    <P>Since 1997, the European Community Humanitarian Office, ECHO, has disbursed almost £15 million in aid to Iraq. ECHO has focussed on the most vulnerable and on areas where it would be most useful and cost effective, such as the renovation of water supplies, support for malnourished children and the rehabilitation of hospitals.</P>
    <P>The Iraqi government continues to fail to co-operate adequately with the UN oil for food programme, as detailed in a number of UN reports, for example, UNICEF, UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Iraq. At the same time, the Iraqi government has used the crisis to reinforce its power. In his report of 14 October 1999 the UN special rapporteur stated that &ldquo;the prevailing regime in Iraq has effectively eliminated the civil rights to life, liberty and physical integrity and the freedoms of thought, expression, association and assembly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The special rapporteur details the significant differences between the improved health and declining child mortality in the north of the country where the UN administers the oil for food programme on behalf of the Iraqi government, and the deteriorating health and child mortality rates in southern and central Iraq where the programme is administered solely by the Iraqi government. He also noted that though revenue from oil exports had increased, the Iraqi government had cut budgets for child nutrition programmes. The UN panel report on the humanitarian situation questioned the stockpiling of essential food and medicine in government warehouses, access to which was strictly restricted to certain categories of people.</P>
    <P>Iraq is a party to the International Covenants on Human Rights, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Ireland believes that, in line with the requirements of these covenants, there should be no discrimination of any kind in the observance <Col N="239" /> of international human rights standards and would call on the Government of Iraq to abide by its obligations under international human rights treaties and international humanitarian law.</P>
    <P>The systematic, widespread and extremely grave violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law by the government of Iraq were condemned in a resolution sponsored by the EU at the UN Commission on Human Rights in 1999. The human rights situation in Iraq continues to be grave and is expected to be the subject of a resolution tabled by the EU at the forthcoming session of the UN Commission on Human Rights.</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concerns regarding the human rights situation in Mexico. It is widely acknowledged, including by the Mexican authorities themselves, that there are a range of systemic human rights deficiencies in Mexico which require to be addressed. I am heartened by the increasing willingness of the Mexican authorities to acknowledge these grave deficiencies and to initiate a dialogue on human rights issues with their international partners including the EU.</P>
      <P>This new approach has been reflected in a number of positive developments, including acceptance by Mexico of the human rights clause in the EU-Mexico Global Agreement, increasing cooperation with EU countries in terms of practical human rights projects, recognition of the jurisdiction of the Inter American Court of Justice, the constructive engagement by the Mexican authorities with the visit last November by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Mary Robinson, and the admission of Mexico to observer status at the Council of Europe, under the auspices of the Irish Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is against this background of a developing dialogue that embassies of the European Union in Mexico city were able to hold a meeting late last year with the Mexican authorities, in which they discussed their concern about threats made against officials of the PRODH organisation, a concern fully shared in the Mexican Foreign Ministry. In addition to the threats made, one PRODH official, Ms Digna Ochoa, had been attacked on two occasions, as a result of which arrangements for official security protection have <Col N="240" /> been agreed between the Mexican authorities and PRODH.</P>
    <P>Much work will require to be done over time to translate the Mexican Government's human rights commitments into a new reality on the ground throughout the country. The European Union intends to maintain a continuing dialogue with the Mexican authorities to help achieve this objective.</P>

      <Quest>the consideration, if any, being given to the development of a naval reserve unit in Drogheda, County Louth, in view of the fact that the original proposal put forward in 1993 is not now the desired location; if the Drogheda and east Meath areas will be the focus; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan, 1996-1998, which was approved by Government in March 1996, provides for a special study of the Reserve Defence Force, which consists of the first line reserve made up of former members of the Permanent Defence Force, An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil and An Slua Muirí, to be undertaken during the lifetime of the plan. Accordingly, I set up a joint civilian-military steering group to carry out this examination. Also, as part of the examination process, the chief of staff established a military board to conduct a study of the reserve. Part of the function of the steering group was to oversee and guide the military board in its task.</P>
      <P>In September 1999, when the steering group had completed its review of the reserve, including consideration of the military board report, it submitted to me a draft report which I am currently in the process of examining. Pending completion of consideration of the draft report I do not intend to make any comment on any of the findings or recommendations contained in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, in the meantime no decision will be taken by me on the setting up of a unit of An <Col N="242" /> Slua Muirí in the Drogheda-east Meath area or in any other location.</P>

      <P>The European Commission is finalising the Leader+ draft guidelines document, having regard to the observations of the European Parliament which have been accepted by the member states. It is expected that the commission will shortly issue the approved guidelines and based on these, member states will draw up operational programmes for Leader+ for forwarding to the Commission for approval with a view to commencement of the Leader+ programme as soon as possible. The Commission over a period of some months will examine these programmes to ensure that significant innovation is evident to merit approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, a Leader mainstream programme to apply nationwide is being funded under the national development plan. As with other measures provided for in the national development plan, approval by the European Commission is necessary to enable commencement of <Col N="243" /> arrangements for the establishment of Leader mainstream activity.</P>
    <P>In determining the local groups to deliver the new programmes, the report of the task force on the integration of local government and local development systems, which has been adopted by the Government, requires that attention be given to the avoidance of overlap between agencies including Leader groups and to consider approaches which will facilitate the combining of rural development and rural partnership activities in rural disadvantaged areas specifically.</P>
    <P>I recognise the importance of continuity in the delivery of Leader+ and Leader-type rural development programmes and I acknowledge that the work programme effected under Leader has benefited local communities in County Waterford. Every effort is being made to ensure the earliest commencement of the two new Leader measures.</P>

      <P>The person named joined REPS on 1 March 1996 and obtained payment for the first and second years of his agri-environmental plan. In January 1999, arising from a query from my Department, he informed the Department that he had ceased farming in August 1997 and disposed of his land to two other farmers, both of whom are also REPS participants.</P>
      <P>To date, neither of the two farmers to whom the person named disposed of his lands has included them in their REPS plans. As a result these lands are no longer in REPS. For that reason, and also because the person named had not completed three years of his REPS plan, my Department has no option under the scheme conditions but to seek to recoup the aid paid to him since he joined REPS.</P>

In addition, and as agreed in the context of the negotiations on the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, among the further measures to be adopted to reduce the current incidence of TB by 50% over the next four years is the assignment of specified staff resources in each district veterinary office, including Naas which covers the west Wicklow area, to carry out further research work into the contribution of badgers to the spread of TB. A pro-active approach to the removal of all sources of infection will be taken in each DVO concentrating in the 20% of the country which yields 50% of reactors. My Department is making arrangements to pursue this aspect of the agreement.</P>

    <P>Following the recent receipt of the observations of the European Parliament and their acceptance by the member states, the European Commission is finalising the draft guidelines on <Col N="245" /> Leader+ and it is expected that the approved guidelines will issue shortly.</P>
    <P>Based on these guidelines, member states will then draw up operational programmes for Leader+ for forwarding to the Commission for approval with a view to commencement of the Leader+ programme as soon as possible. The Commission over a period of some months will subject the programmes to detailed examination to ensure in particular that they show evidence of significant innovation to the requisite standard for approval.</P>
    <P>Also, a Leader mainstream programme to apply nationwide is being funded under the national development plan. As with other measures provided for in the national development plan, approval by the European Commission is necessary to enable commencement of arrangements for the establishment of Leader mainstream activity.</P>
    <P>Pending EU clearance for Leader+ and the Leader mainstream measure under the national development plan, it is not possible to define the precise arrangements for delivery. It is clear, however, that the Commission's intention is that funding for Leader+ will be confined to a limited number of rural areas and that the essential aim of the Leader+ measure will be to encourage the emergence and testing of new approaches to integrated and sustainable development.</P>
    <P>In the determination of local groups for delivery of programmes, the report of the task force on the integration of local government and local development systems requires that attention be given to the avoidance of overlap between agencies including Leader groups and to explore mechanisms capable of combining rural development and rural partnership activities in rural disadvantaged areas specifically.</P>
    <P>I recognise the importance of continuity in the delivery of Leader+ and Leader-type rural development programmes and I acknowledge that the work effected under Leader I and Leader II has benefited local communities.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>Arising from certain suspicions, in March 1994 the officer referred to was relieved of responsibility for Greenore port. Subsequently on 4 May 1994 he was relieved of responsibility for all live animal exports from County Louth while these suspicions were investigated.</P>
      <P>In the absence of specific evidence of any irregularities and taking account of the officer's rights under natural justice, the officer was allowed to continue to operate as an official of the Department. In this context the officer's duties involved the overseeing of the tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication schemes in the county and other animal health and welfare functions.</P>
      <P>The officer was on sick leave for extended periods between April and November, 1994. During this period the officer was under investigation and was formally notified by the Department in November 1994 of the possibility of disciplinary action being taken against him. The procedures to give effect to such disciplinary action were commenced and were ongoing during 1995. During the latter part of 1995 my Department and the Garda worked jointly in investigating the officer's activities. These investigations culminated in a successful surveillance operation in January 1996, the circumstances of which were the subject of his prosecution and sentencing in the Central Criminal Court on 18 January 2000.</P>

      <P>A total of 141,749 cattle was exported from Greenore in the period from 1 October 1991 to 28 February 1994. Information on the value of these animals is not available.</P>
      <P>In this period one superintending veterinary inspector, three veterinary inspectors, two senior agricultural officers, three technical agricultural officers and one ship inspector who retired in September 1993 and was not replaced were responsible for performing pre-export checks at Greenore port. The number of officers present to perform inspections on particular occasions varied in accordance with the number and size of consignments intended for export.</P>
      <P>The identity cards of all cattle intended for export, including those at Greenore, are checked at the point of export by authorised officers of my Department. These are are then cross checked against the animals' ear tags to ensure that the details correspond. Veterinary officials also perform a clinical inspection to ensure that the animals are fit to travel and are vigilant for signs of interference with ear tags or identity cards which might be indicative of an attempt to conceal or falsify the identity of the animals.</P>
      <P>While there have been allegations from time to time as regards the origin of exports, the checks performed at Greenore port in the period referred to by the Deputy revealed no proof that animals intended for export had been illegally imported from the UK.</P>

Such allegations are taken very seriously and have been investigated as far as <Col N="249" /> possible in close co-operation with customs officers and with the Northern Ireland authorities. As a result of its control activities in this area, my Department has seized animals in a number of instances and control procedures have been regularly reinforced.</P>
      <P>In this context and as a result of suspicions that an officer of my Department was engaged in activities which might facilitate the falsification of cattle identities, my Department conducted a joint investigation with an Garda Síochána which culminated in a successful criminal prosecution on 18 January 2000.</P>
      <P>Neither the controls effected by my Department on a day to day basis, nor any of the investigations referred to above have provided proof that cattle originating in Northern Ireland were exported as cattle originating in this State in the period referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The latest survey of nursing vacancies was carried out by the health service employers agency and related to the position at 30 September 1999. This was the most comprehensive report to date and covered all agencies and nursing disciplines. The Southern Health Board reported no vacancies in its area. However, the board has indicated that it can have difficulty in getting temporary staff to replace permanent staff, while in some rural areas the delay in recruiting suitable, permanent staff necessitates overtime.</P>
      <P>In relation to the number of overtime hours worked, it should be noted that overtime is calculated at time and a half and double time for additional hours worked . These rates increase the hours for calculation and give rise to an apparent excessive figure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his/her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>In view of this special provision, I do not feel it justifiable, nor did previous Governments, on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means, as a general rule. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that possession of a medical card does not affect an individual's position on a hospital waiting list which is determined on the grounds of clinical urgency.</P>
      <P>Non-medical card holders are entitled to a broad range of health services including an entitlement to public hospital and public consultant treatment subject only to modest statutory charges and out-patient services free of charge. There are also a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication. Under the drug payments scheme a person and his-her dependants will not have to pay more than £42 in any calendar month for approved prescribed drugs, medicines and appliances.</P>

    <P>The population figure for each board area and nationally are taken from the 1996 census of population.</P>
    <P>Under the relevant legislation, all medical cards are discretionary. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the local health board has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>

      <P>The Mater Misericordia Hospital perform adult cardiac surgery procedures of the nature referred to by the Deputy and paediatric cases are treated at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin.</P>
      <P>As at 7 March 2000 there were 78 public patients waiting over three months for such treatment in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children.</P>
      <P>Our Lady's Hospital has a total of 14 intensive care beds of which 11 are in use. The remaining three beds are closed due to a shortage of appropriate nursing staff. There are five operating theatres in this hospital and all are operational. The development of the theatres at the hospital is under way. When completed the new theatre development will provide five new operating theatres complete with ancillary accommodation, a day surgery area and a central sterile supplies department.  The existing theatre facilities will also be upgraded to provide a further two theatre suites. When these theatres are fully commissioned it is expected that Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children will be in a position to perform an additional 100 paediatric cardiac procedures per annum, which is an increase of 40% on its existing capacity.</P>
      <P>There are 499.5 whole time equivalent &ndash; w.t.e &ndash; nursing positions at the hospital. As nurses may be assigned to more than one specialty-duty it is not possible to provide a breakdown of the number of nurses specifically engaged in cardiology-cardiac services.</P>
      <P>The total number of nurses and surgeons employed in the hospital for the years 1995, 1996, 1997 , 1998 and 1999 are outlined as follows:</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Government policy in relation to the development of the ambulance service is as set out in the report of the Review Group on the Ambulance Service. While nurses have traditionally been involved in the ambulance service in certain parts <Col N="255" /> of the country, the introduction of two-person crewing by emergency medical technicians has been under way since the publication of the report of the review group in 1993.</P>
      <P>As set out in the report of the review group, the policy of successive Governments has been to move towards two person crewing by EMTs whose training was considerably upgraded in response to the recommendations of the report of the review group. Staffing ambulances with personnel specifically trained to provide essential life-support in an out-of hospital setting is in line with widespread international practice in the provision of pre-hospital care. With regard to the role of serving nurses in the ambulance service, the report states that serving ambulance nurses should be fully integrated into the organisational structure of the ambulance service and be required to undergo the same development and training programmes as other ambulance personnel.</P>
      <P>I am committed to ensuring that the training of EMTs is relevant and suitable to the varied requirements of pre-hospital emergency care. The current level of training for emergency medical technicians was established by the National Ambulance Advisory Council which included medical, nursing and ambulance expertise. As recommended in the cardiovascular health strategy, Building Healthier Hearts, I will shortly establish the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council with responsibility for developing professional and performance standards for ambulance services and personnel. This body will carry forward the work of the NAAC in ensuring that the skills and training of emergency medical technicians continue to meet all necessary requirements.</P>
      <P>This year I provided more than £10 million to the health boards for the development of ambulance services. Since the publication of the report of the review group in 1993 this brings to approximately £33 million the total funding made available to the health boards for this purpose, with well over half this funding being provided by this Government. This government has pursued a policy of investment aimed at improving key aspects of the service, including training, equipment, vehicles and communications.</P>

      <P>I have had inquiries made of Beaumont Hospital authorities regarding this matter and they have advised me that the equipment used to perform angiograms at the hospital was situated in the radiology department, where it was used to perform a wide variety of interventional procedures. This equipment was found to be non-Y2K compliant and was removed from use in December 1999. Following discussions with my Department, funding was provided to replace this equipment. The new replacement equipment is being installed but will not be suitable for the performance of coronary angiograms.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the need for dedicated interventional cardiology facilities at Beaumont Hospital, my Department has funded the hospital to purchase dedicated equipment to be sited in an independent facility. The hospital has informed me that work on this facility is currently in progress and that it is scheduled for completion by the middle of 2000.</P>
      <P>While this work is in progress, patients at Beaumont Hospital requiring coronary angiograms are having these procedures carried out by Beaumont Hospital staff at the Mater Private Hospital. This arrangement is under constant review by the hospital authorities to ensure patient safety and comfort.</P>

    <P>Casemix involves the monitoring and compari<Col N="258" /> son of costs and activity between hospitals. Data is collected in relation to over 340,000 inpatient cases in the 31 hospitals throughout the country which participate in the programme. The system uses clinical information which is based on the actual practice of medicine in Irish hospitals to determine a small proportion of the funding of these hospitals. All funding allocated under casemix remains within the hospital system, and any funding deducted from hospitals is distributed to the other hospitals, on the basis of their positive performance under casemix. The programme is operated in an open and transparent fashion, and full details of the clinical and financial information on which casemix budget adjustments are based, is provided to all participating hospitals.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the system is an extremely useful tool in the overall management of our acute hospital services and is also beneficial to clinicians and management at individual hospital level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>In July 1995, my Department published a code of practice for nursing homes which was drafted by a group of experts with first-hand experience of the care of dependant older people. Section 12.2 of the code sets out the guidelines for use of restraint, as follows:</P>
      <P>Every home should have a policy on the use of restraint, based on the guidelines of this Code of Practice. The use of restraint on an on-going basis should never be the decision of one person. The use of physical or chemical restraint should be kept to a minimum. Where the nurse in charge of a home considers that a person may need to be restrained, he or she should first consult the resident's general practitioner. The person responsible for the resident as well as the registered proprietor should also be informed. A record of all occasions on which physical or chemical restraint is used should be kept, detailing the nature of the restraint and duration. The use of restraint should also be noted in the resident's nursing notes. There should be a regular review of policy on restraint in the home.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to amend these guidelines.</P>

      <P>Statistics available to my Department indicate that greater numbers of old vehicles are being decommissioned than heretofore. Section 32(1) of the Waste Management Act, 1996, prohibits the holding, transport, recovery or disposal of waste in a manner that causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution. This general duty of care applies, <i>inter alia,</i> to the owner of an end-of-life vehicle &ndash; ELV. ELVs may be transferred to one of a number of facilities that have been permitted under the Waste Management (Permit) Regulations, 1998, to undertake the dismantling and recovery of such vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="262" /> Section 71 of the 1996 Act specifically prohibits the abandonment of vehicles on any land and empowers local authorities to deal appropriately with abandoned cars. It is entirely a matter for individual local authorities to take the appropriate necessary steps in this regard and to determine their own expenditure requirements in the context of their annual estimates. There are no additional moneys available from my Department to assist local authorities in this regard.</P>
    <P>In 1998, my Department initiated discussions with the Society of the Irish Motor Industry &ndash; SIMI &ndash; towards a producer responsibility initiative in relation to ELVs. Initial proposals for an ELV management system for Ireland were submitted by SIMI in December 1999. These proposals are currently being examined and it is my objective to secure agreement on an acceptable vehicle recovery scheme not later than autumn of this year.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the widow(er)'s contributory pension scheme and the possibility of introducing a special 50% pension similar to the 50% old age contributory pension introduced for certain people who were self-employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This special old age contributory pension was introduced to address the position of those self-employed people who were 56 years of age or over in April 1988 when compulsory social insurance was extended to the self-employed. This group failed to qualify for a pension under the standard qualifying conditions as they did not <Col N="263" /> satisfy the general requirement of having entered social insurance at least ten years before pension age.</P>
    <P>This pension is paid to those who were 56 years of age or over in April 1988 and who have, at least, five years reckonable contributions paid since then. It is paid at a flat rate of 50% of the standard, maximum rate. Increases for adult and child dependants, where applicable, are also payable at 50% of the standard rate.</P>
    <P>The qualifying conditions for the widow(er)'s contributory pension are already more flexible than those for the old age contributory pension. For instance, to satisfy the yearly average condition, a widow(er)'s entitlement may be based on either the full social insurance record or the record over the previous three or five years. A widow (or widower) may qualify on either his-her own or the late spouse's insurance record; in addition, social insurance contributions paid or credited under the National Health Insurance Acts since 1936 may be used to satisfy the requirement that 156 contributions are paid.</P>
    <P>A person on a widow(er)'s non-contributory pension can transfer to an old age contributory pension on reaching age 66 provided he-she satisfies the relevant social insurance contribution conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The detailed allocation of Garda personnel to an individual area is a matter for the Garda authorities who have informed me that the current personnel strength at Courtown Harbour station is one sergeant and two gardaí.</P>
      <P>The opening hours for Courtown harbour station are from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. each day, as resources permit. After 1 p.m. the remainder of the day is spent on foot and mobile patrol. All members from Courtown are employed on regular tours of duty alternating between early and late tours. When the station is closed, it is linked by way of the Green Man communications facility to the district headquarters in Gorey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="266" /> I am also informed that there is a marked patrol car permanently attached to Courtown harbour station. The Gorey district patrol car based at nearby Gorey is also at hand to lend assistance if and when required and demands at other centres permit.</P>
    <P>During bank holiday weekends and on other busy occasions at the resort, particularly during the summer season, when the area experiences a significant increase in population, the local district officer augments the strength at Courtown with other personnel from Gorey district. Local detective personnel are also utilised to pay attention to Courtown.</P>
    <P>I am aware that over the past number of years Courtown has been the subject of major development with a large number of new houses built in the area which in turn has contributed to a major increase in the population and created additional demands on local gardaí. In addition, these demands are further exacerbated on weekends with a major influx of young people attending discos and night clubs in the area. Ongoing efforts are made to combat crime in the tourist resort &ndash; including regular checkpoints and patrols in the area as well as patrols by detective personnel.</P>
    <P>I also understand that there are three community alert schemes in operation in the area, in Ballygarret, Ballycanew and Ballymoney.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that, having regard to the many policing demands of Gorey district and the division generally, especially during the summer season, the best use of available manpower and resources is made to provide an adequate policing service throughout the entire division. However, further consideration will be given to allocating extra resources to the district as personnel become available and in view of competing policing demands nationally.</P>

      <P>Following enactment of the relevant legislation, it is understood that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment intends to set a national minimum hourly rate of pay at £4.40. I can confirm that there are no staff working in my Department or in any agency <Col N="267" /> associated with it who are currently paid less than £4.40 per hour.</P>
      <P>However, the payment of a national minimum wage may have some implications in respect of the allowances provided to persons admitted as trainees for the Garda Siochána. There are currently around 500 trainees who may be affected. However, until the Bill has passed all stages and relevant details finalised, I cannot comment any further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 103 to 106, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no provision in the Juries Act, 1976, for the payment of out of pocket expenses to jurors from State funds. When the Act was intro<Col N="268" /> duced, consideration was given to this matter but it was decided that expenses should not be paid as the performance of jury service is considered to be a basic civic duty which arises relatively infrequently as far as the individual is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will, however, be aware that section 29 of the 1976 Act makes provision for employees to be paid by their employers while on jury service. I have no current plans to change the system.</P>
    <P>On the question of the duration of a trial this is dependent on a number of factors, such as the number of witnesses called, whether there are any legal arguments in the course of the trial, the complexity of the evidence presented as well as the length of the jury deliberations. Some trials may only last a day while other, more complex cases, could take two months or more to dispose of. As each trial is different it is, therefore, not possible to provide an estimate of the average length of a trial. However, in general, trials dealt with by the Circuit Criminal courts would be of a relatively short duration while trials dealt with by the Central Criminal Court would take longer to dispose of.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Courts Service that statistics are not compiled on the number of persons who served as jurors. However, based on the estimated number of jury trials dealt with by the provincial Circuit courts in the legal years ending 31 July 1997, 31 July 1998 and 31 July 1999, it is possible to provide an estimate of the number of people who served on juries in the provincial Circuit courts in these legal years. This information is provided on the following table. Similarly it is also possible to estimate the number of persons who served on juries in the Central Criminal Court and the High Court in the years ending 31 July 1997 to 31 July 1999 and this information is also provided in the table below. Estimated figures for the number of jury trials dealt with by the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court are only available for year ending 31 July 1999.</P>

    <P>I am again informed by the Courts Service that statistics are not available on the number of people who were summonsed for jury service in the years 1997, 1998 and 1999. However, as a rule provincial Circuit courts issue 250-300 jury summonses for each of the four court terms in the calendar year. The jury office in Dublin issues on average 1,900 jury summonses each fortnight when the courts are in session, approximately 18 times a year. Based on these figures, approximately 60,000 jury summonses would have been issued nationally in each of the years in question. <Col N="269" /> Allowing for the fact that some of the people summonsed will be ineligible, or disqualified from jury service and that others will apply to be excused from same, it is estimated that only one third of the summonses issued will result in potential jurors. This number will be further reduced during the jury selection process before each trial.</P>

      <P>Under the 1999 sports capital programme, over £5 million was allocated towards the provision of sports and recreational facilities in the Dublin area. Included in this figure was a grant of £1.3 million towards the refurbishment of the National Boxing Stadium and £740,000 towards developments at Dalymount Park and Tolka Park. In addition, £7 million was paid towards the cost of ongoing developments at Croke Park, with a further payment of £6 million earmarked for the project in 2000. Proposals for the provision of a new indoor athletics facility at Morton Stadium, Santry, are under consideration. The Deputy will be aware that the Taoiseach announced in January of this year that the Government has decided to proceed with the building of a national stadium, in Abbotstown, as part of a campus of sporting excellence to be known as Sports Campus Ireland.</P>

No decision has yet been made on what additional national facilities, if any, will be funded in the Dublin area under the 2000 programme.</P>

      <P>The Government, in line with the commitment given in the joint programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, decided, in November 1997, to initiate a tender procedure inviting proposals for the design, financing, construction and management of a national 50 metre swimming pool. This tender procedure, which was conducted in accordance with EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC, concerning the co-ordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, culminated, in July last year, with the selection of a proposal submitted by the University of Limerick to develop a 50 metre swimming pool on its campus.</P>
      <P>The university's proposal is based on receiving a capital grant of £5.95 million and an operational subsidy of £190,000 per annum for 20 years. The swimming pool will form part of the university's multi-purpose sports building project, which is under construction, and is located close to the national coaching and training centre. My Department is finalising contractual details with the university which anticipates that the pool will be operational by end 2000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 to 122, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The national lottery funded sports capital programme operated by my Department provides funding for clubs-organisations at local, regional and national level for the provision of sports and recreational facilities. Under the programme funding is allocated on the basis of individual applications received with special priority being given to proposals for facilities in disadvantaged areas, in line with Government policy aimed at increasing participation in sport and recreation in these areas.</P>
      <P>The 2000 programme was advertised in early December 1999 and the closing date for the receipt of applications was 11 February 2000. In excess of 1,600 applications were received and the initial processing of these has commenced. Applications received under the programme will be evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria which are outlined in the guidelines which accompanied the application form and I hope to be in a position to announce the grant allocations by June 2000.</P>
      <P>Under the programme applicants are required to consult with other clubs and community groups, including schools with sports and recreational facilities in their area, and the local authority before making an application for funding and to show the outcome of such consultations. The purpose of this is to ensure regard is had to identified needs of the area and that the proposed development does not result in an overlap with and-or duplication of existing facilities. Sports clubs developing projects at national level are also required to ensure that the proposals are consistent with the priorities of their national governing bodies.</P>
      <P>My Department consults as appropriate, when assessing applications, with other relevant Departments and agencies, including the Irish Sports Council, with a view to ensuring co-ordination in the provision of sports and recreational facilities at local level.</P>

The overall cost of implementation in the education sector will be minimal and the appropriate arrangements will be put in place in due course for those affected.</P>

      <P>The special educational needs of children with a mild general learning disability are capable of being met within the mainstream school system, either through placement in a special class attached to a mainstream school or through placement on a fully integrated basis in an ordinary class with the support of the resource teacher service.</P>
      <P>At present, there are 286 special classes for children with mild general learning disabilities attached to mainstream primary schools. These classes operate at a pupil teacher ratio of 11:1.</P>
      <P>Arising from a Government decision of October 1998 all children with special needs, including those with a mild general learning disability, who attend ordinary primary schools on a fully integrated basis now have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs. The nature of the response will depend on the assessed needs of each individual child. In the case of children with a mild general learning disability, the required response will normally take the form of resource teacher support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="280" /> Already, as a result of the Government's decision, the number of resource teachers catering for special needs children in the primary system has grown from 104 to 329. Further resource teacher support will continue to be allocated in response to identified needs and all schools have been advised of the procedures to be followed in seeking access to such support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to high levels of radon gas that have been recorded at the schools in question. Both schools have recently received details from the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland of the outcome of a survey of radon gas in each building. This survey of all primary and post-primary schools is being undertaken by the RPII at the request of my Department following indications of a problem with radon.</P>
      <P>The results of the first phase of the three year national survey relating to 685 schools in counties Carlow, Cavan, Kildare, Kilkenny, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow have been issued to the schools concerned. These results indicated that none of the rooms tested in 510 schools had a radon concentration above the reference level set of 200 (Bq/m3) above which remedial action is advised.</P>
      <P>Of the remaining 175 schools the RPII advised that 13 schools showing the highest level of radon require attention as soon as possible. Both O'Carolan College, Nobber, and Kilmainhamwood national school are among these 13 schools.</P>
      <P>My Department has appointed a consultant to undertake this work. Five schools, including O'Carolan College, have to date been inspected by the consultant who is preparing a mitigation programme for each. This is expected to be ready shortly. The consultant plans to inspect Kilmainhamwood and the other seven schools later this month. The remediation programmes for each school will be undertaken as soon as practicable. The full cost of the entire mitigation programme will be borne by my Department.</P>

      <P>The higher education grants scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. An approved institution is defined to mean a university, university college or other institution of higher education in so far as it provides a course or courses of not less than two years duration, being a course or courses which the Minister for Education and Science approves for the time being for the purposes of the Acts.</P>
      <P>The annual higher education grants scheme, which I approve, sets out a list of approved institutions for the purposes of the scheme. The approved institutions mainly comprise publicly funded third level institutions and a number of religious and other institutions that have been admitted to the scheme over the years. Any extension of the existing arrangements in relation to grants, to include courses in private colleges which have NCEA validation, can be considered only in the light of available resources and in the context of competing demands within the education sector.</P>
      <P>Tax relief is available at the standard rate, on fees paid to private colleges in accordance with the provisions contained in section 6 of the Finance Act, 1995 and section 15 of the Finance Act, 1996.</P>

      <P>While my Department has not been able to trace the papers on this issue, it is likely that the decision not to hold the course was taken because there was not a sufficient number of persons with the specified experience and qualifications interested in doing the course.</P>
