      <P>Deputies will have learned with profound regret of the death of Tom Foxe, a former Member of this House. May he rest in peace.</P>
      <P>Tom was born in Roscommon in June 1937. He was educated at the Christian Brothers' school, Roscommon, University College Galway and University College Dublin. He was a publican and an agricultural adviser. He was first elected to the Dáil in the general election of the summer of 1989 as an independent hospital candidate in the old three seat constituency of Roscommon, which comprised the geographical county of Roscommon with the exception of an area in the west around Williamstown and that part of Athlone west of the Shannon. He lost his seat in the 1997 general election. However, in the local elections last June, Tom repeated his poll topping performance of 1991 with nearly 300 votes to spare over the quota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of County Roscommon will be particularly saddened in view of the tremendous service he gave to that county down the years. Tom was active in many organisations at many <Col N="2" /> levels for many decades in his native county. He was treasurer of the Roscommon Community Council from 1973 to 1977, a member of the Roscommon Hospital Action Committee from 1976 to 1989 and its honorary secretary from 1987 to 1989. He was a loyal servant to Roscommon and his role in the Roscommon hospital campaign brought him to national prominence. He will be long remembered by the people of Roscommon for the strong position he took on that issue.</P>
    <P>Tom had a keen interest in sport, particularly boxing, and he was a member of the Connacht branch of the Irish Amateur Boxing Association from 1974. He was an international boxing judge, a manager of international boxing teams and a great expert on the sport.</P>
    <P>On my own behalf and on behalf of the Government, I offer our deepest condolences to his family. He will be sadly missed by all Members as it is only a few years since he left the House. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dhílis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The overwhelming majority of the Members knew Tom Foxe and we are personally shocked that he should have passed away at <Col N="3" /> such a young age. He would have been 63 years of age on his next birthday in June.</P>
      <P>It is, in a sense, symbolic of the great fight that marked Tom Foxe's political career that he should have passed away to meet his eternal reward in the hospital, Roscommon county hospital, which he did so much to save. I visited the hospital and it is probable that without his political commitment to and leadership of the campaign to save it, Roscommon county hospital might not be there in its current form with the capacity to provide a range of acute services. The people of Roscommon are deeply grateful to Tom Foxe for that contribution to their welfare.</P>
      <P>Tom was born in the townland of Derrane, close to Roscommon town. He had a deep interest in agriculture and served as an agricultural adviser in the Strokestown area until he retired from the service in 1971. He entered the licensed trade in Roscommon town with great success. Foxe's pub might not be quite as well known nationally as the pub of the same name in south Dublin, but its reputation among those who know it is as good if not better than any other licensed premises in the vicinity.</P>
      <P>Tom's interest in sport was mentioned by the Taoiseach. He was president of the Connacht branch of the Irish Amateur Boxing Association. He was a man of many parts, an agriculturist, publican, sportsman and politician. On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, which worked closely with Tom Foxe in different arenas, I express our regret at his passing and convey our sympathy to his sisters, Ann, Mary and Lily, and to his nieces and nephews, one of whom is continuing to run Tom's pub in Roscommon town.</P>
      <P>Having spoken to my colleagues in the constituency of Roscommon-Longford who dealt with Tom, the often used and, in this instance, true phrase applies: &ldquo;his word was his bond&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always an occasion of sadness when the House marks the passing of its former Members but it seems like only yesterday since Tom Foxe was present in the Chamber. The clock of time appears to tick more quickly when one thinks of that.</P>
      <P>I remember when Tom Foxe became a Dáil Deputy. He had landed a unique political uppercut to the body politic in Roscommon in defence of the hospital to which Deputy Bruton and the Taoiseach referred. He was always good humoured. He had an infectious grin and always had a comment or an observation to make, particularly when we were gathered in the Chamber for votes or during other assemblies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He came from a tradition of radicalism for which Roscommon has been known in the past. The late Jack McQuillan likewise, with his sporting background, captured a mood, a feeling and a demand for service in Roscommon which Tom Foxe was more than able to serve during his time in the Dáil. The comments already made are warranted. On behalf of the Labour Party, I extend <Col N="4" /> our condolences and sympathies to his three sisters, his nephew and to the people of Roscommon who were well served by a truly independent Deputy.</P>

      <P>Thar cheann an Pháirtí Daonlathaigh, ba mhaith liom comhbhrón a dhéanamh le clann Tom Foxe, go háirithe a dheirfiúracha, as ucht a gcailliúint mhóir. Bhí aithne mhaith agam ar Tom le blianta fada sular tháinig sé isteach sa Teach mar ionadaí do Chontae Ros Comáin. Fear lách ab ea é. Bhí suim aige sa spórt agus sa saol polaitíocht agus is mór an cailliúnt é do mhuintir Ros Comáin agus dá chlann nach mbeidh sé linn a thuilleadh.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats Party, I extend our sincere sympathy to the family of the late Tom Foxe. I knew him for many years before he became a Member. On the first day I met him after he was elected to the House, he reminded me of my efforts to teach him how to row when he was a student at University College Galway. Tom's interest in sport was something of which I was keenly aware and often we would have long discussions about it. His particular interest throughout his life was in boxing in which he represented Ireland on many important occasions as an official at international level, and he had a keen and abiding interest in it all his life. He was also an active member of the Vintners' Federation of Ireland and represented his trade. As a qualified agricultural instructor, he brought the benefit of his deep knowledge to the many farmers throughout Roscommon with whom he dealt over the years.</P>
      <P>His kind disposition and deep interest in people was reflected in the approach made to him to stand in the election to try to obtain a solution to what seemed to some of us the interminable problem of Roscommon hospital. He was a good standard bearer for them and was a well known, intelligent and popular person. He quietly set about his work here to solve that issue after the 1989 general election. Both he and Deputy O'Hanlon brought about a quiet solution which has been to the satisfaction of the people of the area. It is something to his memory which will exist for a long time.</P>
      <P>I extend my sympathy to his family, his sisters especially, and to all the people of Roscommon who looked up to him and supported him and who benefited from his kind diplomacy and gentle spirit. He will be deeply missed by his family and friends.</P>

      <P>Is buille tubaisteach é do ospidéal agus muintir Ros Comáin agus dá chairde go léir go bhfuil duine chomh trodach, éirimiúil agus macánta le Tom Foxe caillte. Bhí aithne agam air ó 1992. Ba dhuine é a bhí i gcónaí cúirtéiseach. Mar Theachta nua mé féin i 1992 , chuir sé mé ar mo chompórd agus bhí mé i gcónaí buíoch dó as an bhfáilte a chuir sé romham. Bhíomar ag com<Col N="5" /> hoibriú le chéile go minic. Duine neamhspleach é siúd agus duine aonarach sa Chomhaontas Glas mé féin. Ba dhuine óg é a léiríonn uair amháin eile nach fada saol na polaitíochta go minic do dhuine, ach chomh maith le sin, nach fada saol an pholaiteora leis an cineál saoil a bhíonn ann. I gcomhthéacs Tom Foxe, tá a bhás dochreidte, go mórmhór mar ba dhuine aclaí é a bhí i gcónaí gníomhach. Nuair a bhuaileadh duine leis, ligfeadh sé air go minic go raibh sé ag dornálaíocht agus ag pleidhcíocht agus an-chairdiúil mar gheall air.</P>
      <P>It is a great tragedy that someone so young and with so much to give to public life has been lost. Tom Foxe represented the dignity and integrity of politics we all strive to bring about. Thar cheann an Chomhaontas Glas, ba mhaith liom comhbhrón a dhéanamh lena mhuintir agus lena chairde go léir agus a rá leo go bhfuilimid ag smaoineamh orthu.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with all the tributes which have been paid to the late Tom Foxe and I express my sympathies to his sisters and family generally and to his many friends in Roscommon. Tom Foxe was a unique and special man in many ways. I recall the first day he became aware of his illness. We met and talked about it. The singular courage he displayed that day and throughout his illness over recent years was something which should perhaps teach more than a little to those who are more fortunate than him.</P>
      <P>Tom had a profound interest in people and he was at all times with them and close to them socially and in sporting and political life. He would not have been in politics were it not for the fact that he felt deeply about the issue of Roscommon hospital. He fought a battle and a campaign with a politeness and courtesy which are probably unique and much sought after in all our political activities. As a colleague, I regret very much his passing. I hope that eternal peace lies ahead of him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I too would like to be associated with the expressions of sympathy of the other Members. Tom was a man of honour and principle who was true to his word. He was an ambassador for politics and politicians. He will be best known in the national arena for his campaign to save the county hospital in Roscommon and he was instrumental in keeping the hospital open at that time. However, he also had other interests, including boxing, of which he was Connacht president. He was an agricultural adviser in both counties Roscommon and Leitrim as well as being a well respected publican in Roscommon town. He will be remembered by the people in Roscommon not only for his campaign on behalf of the hospital in which he passed away but also as a person who was highly respected for his honesty, generosity and decency. He was a true gentleman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="6" /> I remember Tom for his good-humoured outlook on life, especially during his long illness. I am sure he would have had to smile when the Taoiseach spoke of the geography of the county. He was elected in Roscommon-East Galway and was re-elected in Longford-Roscommon. He was a man who genuinely respected and decently treated those he met. I express my deepest sympathies to his three sisters, Ann, Lily and Mary, and to his nieces and nephews. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I too express my deepest sympathy to the family and friends of the late Tom Foxe. He was a good citizen. As an agricultural instructor, he was extremely respected by the farming community. As a publican, he was well known in the licensed vintner trade. In sport, especially boxing, he was known the length and breadth of Ireland. He was a dedicated person and a good politician. He was good at representing the case for Roscommon but he was also good in every other way as a politician. At the previous general election, he lost his seat and I was returned to the House. He was very gracious at the count. He said, &ldquo;I don't mind losing so long as you won, Louis&rdquo;, and those were his words. That was a nice thing to say to me and something I will never forget. He was a good friend to everyone so everyone has lost a good friend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have three questions for the Taoiseach, one of which relates directly to legislation and all of which relate indirectly to it. Does the Taoiseach agree, in the context of the difficult and important work he is doing to advance the process of peace, that after all armed conflicts victors decommission as well as those who have not been victors, that after the Second World War vast quantities of arms were decommissioned by those who had won that war, and that there is no equivalence between decommissioning weapons and defeat or victory? </P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach support the offer by the Bishop of Derry, Dr. Hegarty, to provide a means of facilitating the taking of weapons out of commission, which is inevitable after a conflict? </P>
      <P>In the Taoiseach's view, will legislation be necessary if the Government gives its assent to the activation of the legislation recently passed in Westminster for the suspension of institutions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Bishop Hegarty has been continually helpful in the Northern Ireland peace process. I have discussed the matter with him on several occasions and anything he or his fellow Church leaders in Northern Ireland can do is always helpful. If his offer is in any way helpful it will be useful.</P>
      <P>I have not looked at the matter of the necessity for legislation. Deputy Bruton is aware that some legal issues will arise regarding how the matter will be dealt with. I have taken legal advice on the current legislation and there are clearly some difficulties in that area. I have asked for some of those issues to be looked at and later in the week things may be clearer. If I have information I will be happy to give it to leaders of Opposition parties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann supports the Government's decision to proceed with planning for the development of Sports Campus Ireland and Stadium Ireland, having noted the contents of <Col N="14" /> the PricewaterhouseCoopers feasibility study A Stadium for the New Millennium.</P>
    <P>The recent announcement by the Taoiseach of the Government's decision to proceed with the building of a national stadium as part of a campus of sporting excellence &ndash; to be known as Sports Campus Ireland &ndash; represents a major milestone for sport in Ireland. The centrepiece of the campus will be an 80,000 seater national stadium capable of accommodating all field sports.</P>
    <P>The Government is determined that our country will have a world class facility providing the highest quality of services, right up to the best international levels for a wide variety of sports. I want the House to know that the decision to proceed with this project was taken neither lightly nor, as has been suggested in some media circles, at the whim of any Member of the Government. The Government, in coming to its decision, had the benefit of recommendations made to it by an expert steering group established specifically to consider how such a stadium might be provided.</P>
    <P>The steering group which comprised experienced business, sporting and public service figures was assisted in its deliberations by an independent feasibility study carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers, a world renowned company which, in turn, had the expertise of a range of other consultants available to it in the preparation of the study.</P>
    <P>I would like Members to note specifically that, in the preparation of their report, the consultants carried out an extensive consultative process involving the IRFU, the GAA, the FAI, the Athletics Association of Ireland, formerly BLE, and the NACA; stadium management companies of similar facilities in the UK, France, Germany, Portugal, Australia and the US; 28 of the non-stadium based national governing bodies of sport; the main concert promoters and exhibition management companies in Ireland and the UK; the management of alternative entertainment and exhibition facilities in Ireland and the UK and the top 100 companies in Ireland. The IRFU, GAA, FAI and the athletics association were also represented on the steering group. This was by far the most extensive consultative process and the most in-depth analytical study ever carried out in Ireland in relation to a sports project and the outcome of these deliberations provides a sound foundation on which to proceed.</P>
    <P>The construction of the campus and stadium will involve capital expenditure of £281 million. Included in the overall investment is a gift of £50 million provided by the businessman, Mr. J. P. McManus. In relation to this very generous contribution, arrangements are being made to have a copy of the legal agreement between the State and Mr. McManus placed in the Oireachtas Library. Of the Exchequer expenditure of £231 million, £135 million will be invested in Stadium Ireland with the balance being used to build the surrounding campus and to provide first class infrastructure, including an indoor arena capable of holding up to 15,000 people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="15" /> It is proposed that the facility will be located at Abbotstown in West Dublin which emerged, in the opinion of the consultants, as the most appropriate location for the proposed campus and stadium. The site is ideally located and an excellent infrastructure is already in place. Close to Dublin airport, it has significant frontage on to the M50 motorway. Once the M50 is completed, it will link all the main arterial routes to and from Dublin and the airport. The site of 495 acres is in State ownership and it is estimated that 220 acres will be required for the total complex, including parking. The total estimated building programme is scheduled to be completed in 2005.</P>
    <P>Ireland's unprecedented economic performance provides a unique opportunity to address, once and for all, what has long been perceived as the single largest gap in our national sport and recreational infrastructure, namely the absence of a major venue to accommodate all international field sport events. Sporting excellence is a potent symbol both nationally and internationally, and is, increasingly, an important engine for economic and social development. A national stadium of the quality envisaged provides a new and improved opportunity for the best of Irish sport to pit themselves against all comers in an amphitheatre which will allow all to perform to the best of their ability before 80,000 enthusiastic supporters drawn from one of the most sports-mad countries in the world. Of equal importance will be the economic spin-offs which will accrue to Ireland both in terms of its enhanced attractiveness as a location for major international sporting events and its projection as a modern, vibrant, energetic and welcoming nation.</P>
    <P>At present, the facilities in which we host our international sporting events, which are broadcast worldwide, are poor in comparison with those of our European neighbours and neither reflect nor project Ireland's desired image of excellence. In spite of being a nation of sports enthusiasts and in spite of much discussion over the years about the need for such a landmark facility, Ireland still does not have a stadium which is capable of hosting all its field sports. Now, for the first time in the history of the State, we are fortunate enough to have the wherewithal to consider building a state-of-the-art stadium comparable with the best in the world and capable of accommodating a wide range of sporting and spectator events for the whole island of Ireland. The stadium will possess sufficient amenities, together with the surrounding infrastructure, to satisfy the ever increasing requirements from the public and the media in this new age of popular sport.</P>
    <P>The concept is rooted in the belief that strategic infrastructural investment made today will realise significant benefits for future generations. A great stadium will contribute much to national prestige and our sense of national pride and the existence of a world class stadium will provide the basis for building on our national love of sport <Col N="16" /> and our ability to compete with the best in the world.</P>
    <P>In recent years, a number of our nearest European neighbours have developed major stadiums, for example Stade Francais in Paris, the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff and major re-developments and expansions at Murrayfield, Twickenham and, currently, Wembley Stadium.</P>
    <P>While I do not deny that previous Governments may have paid attention to sporting matters in the past, it was very much &ldquo;by the way&rdquo; or as an adjunct to other policies and strategies. This position has changed radically under the present Government and with the appointment of a Minister with responsibility for sport with a seat at Cabinet the Irish sports sector took a giant step forward. In the 30 months or so since the Government took office, Irish sport has benefited from unprecedented and long sought developments such as the enactment of the Irish Sports Council Act, 1999, and the establishment of a new statutory council dedicated to the promotion of sport; the introduction of Ireland's first ever anti-doping in sport programme, making Ireland one of only about 30 countries worldwide with its own such programme; the launch of an international carding scheme specially designed to meet the needs of our high performing sportspersons; the beginning of the construction of Ireland's first ever 50 metre swimming pool in Limerick and an almost fourfold increase in provision for annual spending on the sports capital programme, including an increase from £3 million last year to £15 million for local authority swimming pools and grant allocations totalling up to £20 million for other sport and recreational facilities spread across the country. In the next three years, £45 million will be spent on swimming pool infrastructure alone.</P>
    <P>Last year I was in the happy position to be able to allocate almost £14.5 million to about 400 community and voluntary groups towards the provision of local sport and recreational facilities in towns and villages throughout the country, another £3.5 million to national and regional facilities at seven locations throughout the country and more than £2 million to a range of county GAA grounds and FAI grounds. Since my appointment, grant allocations have been made in respect of some 800 projects throughout the country. The amount of financial support provided in the 1999 Estimates exceeded the combined allocations by the previous Government in the three years 1995-97. The overall provision in this year's Estimates for sport is up again to approximately £49 million. The comparable figure when I took office in 1997 was £13.5 million.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the funding which will be required for the development of Sports Campus Ireland and Stadium Ireland will bring about a reduction in the funding which will be available for supporting projects throughout the country under the sport capital programme. The amendment put down by Deputy Allen makes this very point. I assure the House that this Government has embarked on an ambitious pro<Col N="17" /> gramme of funding for the development of our sporting infrastructure through our sport capital programme and no funds will be diverted from the annual provision for this scheme into supporting the development of Sports Campus Ireland.</P>
    <P>Never has so much grant assistance been approved for so many different sports facilities and in so many locations. The decision to facilitate the development of an 80,000 seat national stadium, capable of accommodating all field sports, is a logical progression in the Government's ambitions programme to develop and upgrade the nation's sport and recreational infrastructure. It is right that Irish sportspersons and athletes, who are benefiting from the improved facilities now available around the country, and from the other supports and services now being provided by the State, should have a world class stage in their own country, where they can compete and showcase their skills and prowess against their world class peers.</P>
    <P>While Stadium Ireland will be the focal point of the proposed campus, the total campus will provide a much needed facility of international standard for a wide spectrum of sports and activities. The stadium will be designed in such a way as to enable it to be converted for athletics at minimal costs. It will include an indoor arena, capable of holding up to 15,000, for a wide range of different sports and entertainment events, as well as a series of multi-purpose sports halls for use by different sports. State of the art medical and sports science facilities will also be available on campus. A core value of Stadium Ireland is that it will be accessible to all sports on a basis of equity. The development company, which will be established shortly, will now proceed with the design and development of Sports Campus Ireland following consultations with the national governing bodies of sport.</P>
    <P>Of course, not every Irish person is a sports participant, and certainly not of competition standard. However, there is no denying that we are a nation of sports enthusiasts with many of us committed fans and spectators of the various disciplines which will be accommodated at Stadium Ireland. Now, in addition to being able to accommodate much larger numbers at events featuring on the existing Irish sporting calendar, we can also look forward to seeing some of the very best in international sporting spectacles in comfort and safety and in the flesh.</P>
    <P>As Minister with responsibility for tourism as well as sport, I am particularly pleased that the availability of this exciting new facility also has the potential to benefit our tourism industry. As the House is aware, a significant feature of our tourism marketing and promotion efforts in recent years has been our success in attracting a number of major international sporting events to Ireland. Events such as the Cutty Sark Tall Ships Race and the Tour de France have attracted enormous international publicity, while the Special Olympics World Summer Games in 2003 and the Ryder Cup in 2005 will help to keep that <Col N="18" /> precious media attention firmly focused on Ireland. Without having the infrastructure in place, we would never have been able to proceed with the Ryder Cup. Indeed, in last December's budget, I secured £2.5 million for the setting up of a dedicated unit within Bord Fáilte with the specific task of exploring opportunities to promote Ireland as a venue for international sporting events and to develop strategies for attracting them here in the future. I have no doubt our future success in this regard will be boosted enormously by the availability of Stadium Ireland.</P>

      <P>For many years now we have been listening to a constant stream of complaints and criticism, mainly directed against politicians, about Ireland's lack of top quality sports facilities to match the top class efforts and performance of our international sportspersons and to help level the playing field for them with other nations. Politicians have been constantly castigated. There have been sad choruses lamenting the pitiful state of our major facilities and the lost opportunities with events going to foreign lands. Today, for the first time in our history, we can afford to consider doing something about it. What is needed is the vision, confidence and determination to persist with the undertaking and give our country something it can be proud of.</P>
      <P>In the same way that our successful economy has led to extraordinary opportunities for our people in terms of jobs and prosperity, so too can the timely provision of this crucial piece of sports infrastructure ensure that Ireland is well positioned to avail fully of the rapidly expanding commercial opportunities now emerging from growth in demand for international sport, driven by the unprecedented expansion in leisure. Most importantly, this facility will also provide an unprecedented range and quality of facilities for our top established stars as well as our young and developing sports people to nurture their talents, hone their skills and sharpen their competitive edge in an environment which is conducive to the achievement of excellence.

    <P>&ldquo;but asks the Government to give assurances that capital funding will not be diverted from sporting organisations for the development of their own facilities to encourage participatory sport, that it will allocate capital funding to the FAI on a pro-rata basis as has been allocated to the GAA for the development of Croke Park, and that <Col N="19" /> an independent cost-benefit analysis will be carried out on the national stadium project before any major irrevocable commitment is made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Strategic Plan for Sport in Ireland 1997-2006, which I published in 1997 following wide consultation with sports organisations and all the political parties, advocated a national stadium. The Minister's speech, which was very self-congratulatory, should have mentioned that the proposals for the senior Ministry and greater resources for sport were contained in that policy document and plan adopted by all political parties. I was of the view that up to the mid-1990s sport did not have a corporate plan and that, like a businessman going into a bank, a Minister for sport going to a Minister for Finance without an overall strategy or plan did not have a hope of obtaining the resources sport deserved. It was the publication of that plan which convinced Governments and Ministers for Finance to loosen the purse strings in relation to sport. I support much of what the Minister is proposing because it conforms with the national plan published in 1997.</P>
    <P>The proposal for a national stadium contained in the national plan has been misrepresented by the Minister as a ploy to undermine our credibility in questioning certain aspects of the development of a national stadium. The plan reads:</P>
    <P>Ireland needs a high quality national outdoor multi-sports stadium. The development of a national multi-purpose outdoor stadium must be driven by the appropriate NGBs in partnership with the private sector, relevant local authorities and be based on sound commercial projections. In the event of an appropriate proposal emerging, the Government should support and actively promote such a venture.</P>
    <P>One of the essential elements in the plan was that it should be driven by the appropriate NGBs. This is not the case, neither is it based on sound commercial projections. My opinion on this key principle in the plan has not changed since 1997 but the scenario has changed dramatically. The GAA has proceeded with the redevelopment of Croke Park and received £20 million of taxpayers' money to fund that development, and the FAI has announced the privately funded construction of Eircom Park, which will cater for the needs of that organisation. I applaud both organisations for their courage and vision in going ahead with these projects. The national stadium proposed by the Government is not being pushed by any governing body. Even if the stadium is not built, the IRFU has all the resources it needs to develop its own facilities.</P>
    <P>Despite the development of Croke Park and Eircom Park, the Taoiseach announced some weeks ago the construction of a stadium at Abbotstown, costing at least £230 million of taxpayers' money. The Minister said at the outset that 220 acres of land at Abbotstown will be used <Col N="20" /> for the construction of the stadium. The cost of that land is not factored into the overall cost. I question the real cost of developing the infrastructure necessary to transport people to and from the stadium. Therefore, when one talks about £230 million of taxpayers' money, one is ignoring the potential value of the land and the infrastructural development which will have to take place. The Taoiseach, in response to a question in this House on 13 October 1999, stated that he was informed for the first time of the Eircom development through a telephone call made to him while he was in Jerusalem. The Taoiseach's statement in the Dáil certainly misled me into believing that he was hearing of the project for the first time when I subsequently learned that he had two meetings with senior officials of the FAI to discuss their plans long before the phone call to Jerusalem. Therefore, he must have been aware of the decision to be announced by the FAI about Eircom Park.</P>
    <P>The decision to build a stadium at Abbotstown comes at a time of enormous demand from sporting organisations, community groups and clubs at national, regional and local level throughout the country for capital grant aid towards projects. The Minister will confirm that he has approximately 2,000 applications in his Department requesting grants for sports projects valued at more than £600 million. Coupled with that demand, there is a serious situation where less than half our schools have sports halls. This is appalling and hinders seriously the development of sport and recreation within the education system. Where are the objectives contained in the strategy plan for the development of sport and recreation in the education system? There has been very little such progress in the past two and a half years.</P>
    <P>This bleak scenario conflicts seriously with one of the major objectives of the national plan, which is to provide young people with quality opportunities for early involvement in physical activity and sport, as well as to provide teachers and sports leaders with the opportunity to undertake recognised training in the area of sport for young people. It also conflicts with the objective of providing quality resources in our schools and communities for young people in order to develop realistic pathways for them into recreation, participatory and high performance sport. The development of sport in our education system was one of the key issues identified in the national plan for sport, and that has not been addressed. This is an urgent issue and I am very concerned about the deteriorating fitness of young people. My view has been strengthened recently by comments made by Brian Kerr, FAI coach, who said that the fitness level of young footballers now coming to him is much lower than it was ten years ago. This has major implications on a number of fronts, including the health area.</P>
    <P>The major investment by the Government in a national stadium &ndash; I use the words consciously &ndash; will not be in reality a national stadium as it <Col N="21" /> will not have the key players involved. The key players in field sports are the GAA, the FAI and the IRFU. The Minister said the GAA is committing two or three events during the year. I do not think that is practical. The Minister is not fooling anyone in saying that. When the FAI has its 45,000 stadium it will have contractual agreements, as will the GAA, for corporate boxes and so on because big business is now tied into all these events. It is ridiculous to suggest that these organisations will take major events out of their stadia to put into the stadium in Abbotstown. The proposed national stadium, which will not have the key players involved, is coming at a time when thousands of clubs in the four corners of Ireland are existing on a shoestring and when young people are still stripping off on the sides of ditches and in containers without electricity, water or sanitation. The Minister is well aware that this is the real face of Irish sport.</P>
    <P>The Minister was misleading when he stated recently on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; that he has so much money to give out that he cannot spend it on clubs, since clubs are failing to claim funding allocated to them. However, he knows better than I do that he rejected applications from approximately 1,300 organisations last year for funding. Clubs and organisations which work under primitive conditions developing the skills and talents of our sports people were refused help. The Minister, for example, was in Cork recently for a Cabinet meeting in the Hollyhill area, near where I live. He was within a quarter of a mile of a club which was refused a grant by him in 1999, a club which caters for hundreds of young boys and can only offer them a football ground of poor quality and a container without lighting, heating, water or sanitation. They were told, &ldquo;sorry, but try again next year&rdquo;. This is repeated throughout the country and no gloss or PR will override the fact that clubs are struggling and being refused help. I cannot equate what the Minister is doing with the reality throughout the four corners of the country.</P>
    <P>I am asking what is the status of the national strategy for the development of sports facilities at national, regional and local levels? The £220 million now available for a sports stadium is being invested in a project which has a major question mark over its viability.</P>
    <P>On the television programme &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; recently, the Minister, in my presence, gave a number of reasons for having the stadium. The first was that, because every banana republic in the world had a stadium, Ireland should have one. The second was that no one knew what the future would hold for sport in Ireland and we should have a facility in place to cover all eventualities. It is a characteristic of banana republics to build grandiose projects for personal egos and neglect the genuine needs of the people. The type of decision being made in the case of the stadium at Abbotstown has these characteristics.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in justifying the stadium for the <Col N="22" /> second reason, conveniently ignores the qualifications placed by the national plan on the construction of a national stadium. The key proposals in that section of the national plan have been torn up and discarded. Before investing funding of such magnitude, surely the Government should have spoken to what would have been the key participants in any national stadium &ndash; the GAA, the FAI and the IRFU &ndash; about the possibility of pooling resources to build a true national stadium of which we could all be proud. Instead, the Government acted without a strategy and it is proposing to spend taxpayers' money in a questionable manner. Therefore, I am asking that an independent cost-benefit analysis be carried out on the national stadium project before any irrevocable commitment is made. This feasibility study should be truly independent and not similar to the study carried out at the behest of the Minister and the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The cost to the Exchequer of this project has been put at £230 million but I question the actual cost. I applaud the public spirit of any individual who offers £50 million to a public project such as this and in posing questions I do not in any way question the motives of that individual who has been most generous to a wide range of projects in the past. However, I must ask about the status of the offer and if it has been made in writing. The Minister said copies of the contract will be placed in the Oireachtas Library and I will examine it when that is done. These questions are valid and I expect answers. I have already been criticised for asking questions about the status of the offer, the motives behind it and the validity of the project. However, these questions need to be asked and answers must be given.</P>
    <P>Sport in Ireland is changing rapidly and the demands of professionals and those who consider sport a business may take precedence over participatory sport and the great spirit of volunteerism that is the lifeblood of sport. Despite limited resources in the past, sport in Ireland has produced champions at all levels. However, this happened because of the great spirit of volunteerism at local level in urban and rural areas which has encouraged young people to get involved in healthy activities rather than be attracted to drugs and crime.</P>
    <P>True sport is about the development of skills and talents from early childhood. Sport is not only about Sky Sports's hyperventilated viewpoint. It is not only about professional rugby or soccer which appears to be the main menu offered by our national television station at present. This station axed the Saturday sports programme and thereby excluded 90% of sports organisations from our screens.</P>
    <P>I presume the Government will make a realistic response to the FAI's major redevelopment programme for its major grounds in view of the fact that, in a telephone conversation with the leader of the Fine Gael Party shortly before the Government announced details of the national stadium, the Taoiseach said the FAI would receive <i>pro rata</i><Col N="23" /> State funding for Eircom Park to the funding the GAA received for Croke Park. As the addendum to the motion seeks, the FAI should receive this <i>pro rata</i> funding in addition to its usual capital funding requirements.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There has scarcely been a time in our history when the provision of sporting facilities has been more needed. There is the healthy lifestyle aspect of a range of sports which all citizens can engage in throughout their lifetimes. In an age when too many of our young people abuse drugs and alcohol, attractive activities which offer a wholesome and disciplined alternative are a necessity. Involvement in sport, particularly team sports, <Col N="24" /> can develop a sense of place and a sense of community. Sport stimulates energy and vibrancy in communities.</P>
    <P>In personal, local and national life, sport provides enrichment of quality of life. Sport provides well paid careers and a substantial range of employment. The Labour Party fully supports the promotion and development of the widest possible range of sporting activities, but in holding that position it is equally aware, even in the face of the Celtic tiger economy, that limitless resources are not available. The careful management of the available resources is essential. Wasteful duplication and unsuitable and over ambitious projects are to be avoided. The Government must not only get the priorities right, but also address these priorities within an achievable timeframe and in a realistic way.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party acknowledges the need for a national stadium that meets the country's sporting needs but, like many citizens, it is concerned about a situation where there could be three stadiums in the capital, each of which could and probably would be underutilised. The main concern of the Labour Party is that, in supporting the Government's decision to proceed with planning for the development of the sports campus and stadium, effectively it would be supporting a half-baked project of a Government which is in denial of the reality of matters.</P>
    <P>The stadium steering committee has stated its belief that the stadium will fulfil the Taoiseach's and the Government's vision as an icon for the whole island in the new millennium. The choice of the word &ldquo;icon&rdquo; by the committee is rather puzzling, as the common understanding of &ldquo;icon&rdquo; has religious connotations and is hardly appropriate to describe a national sports stadium. The stadium steering committee has certainly elevated the vision of the Taoiseach and the Government to a very high plane.</P>
    <P>The steering committee recommended that the Government locate the new stadium at Abbotstown, pointing out that the 495 acre site is in State ownership and meets all the criteria relating to the location of a national stadium. My information is that there has not been any consultation with the relevant planning authority, Fingal County Council. Section 4 &ldquo;Financial Profile/Funding Options&rdquo; of the steering committee recommendations states that:</P>
    <P>The steering committee recommends that the Government decide that a positive decision on the new stadium is conditional on arrangements being made with the national governing bodies of sport such that a minimum case for meeting the operational costs is fulfilled.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister expecting to be taken seriously when he is seeking the support of the Dáil for a proposal that has not yet been subjected to the scrutiny of this condition?</P>
    <P>The steering committee further recommends that a positive decision on the new stadium is conditional on a satisfactory guarantee being in <Col N="25" /> place for a private donation of £50 million. The Minister informed us this morning that a copy of the agreement between Mr. J. P. McManus and the State will be placed in the Library and this is very welcome, as it addresses a difficulty the Labour Party has with this project and we were seeking further information about this matter. Mr. McManus has set a very important headline here. I do not know if the Minister has had discussions with other wealthy individuals who might also want to make a donation to this project in the national interest, but I hope the initiative taken by Mr. McManus will inspire others to make funds available for this important project.</P>
    <P>The initial statement of cost by the Government for the new stadium and campus was £281 million. The subsequent announcement of the additional 50 metres swimming pool will bring the total cost, as estimated at this stage, to between £296 million and £301 million. The Minister informed the House last week that the second 50 metres pool in Dublin will be a competition pool which will be required for the Special Olympics in 2003, while the Limerick 50 metres pool is to be a training pool. Every right thinking person will want the Special Olympics to be an outstanding success and to ensure that the very best facilities will be available, but the question must be asked: why was the 50 metres competition pool not announced at the time of the announcement regarding the stadium and campus?</P>
    <P>When the £50 million private donation is deducted, there is still a shortfall of approximately £250 million. Where will this come from? It seems likely that the lion's share will come from the national lottery and the Exchequer and in addition, there is the prospect of funding being required from the national lottery on an annual basis. This leads to the inescapable conclusion that when such moneys are allocated to the stadium-campus project, it will be at the expense of something else. Will it be at the expense of regional, county and local projects? The Minister has assured us that funds will not be diverted from the sports capital programme to develop our sporting infrastructure, which is welcome. However, is there now a reduced possibility of the sports capital fund being enhanced in the future?</P>
    <P>There are always difficult decisions to be made by Government in the allocation of scarce resources. If the stadium and campus are to be provided, it will be at the expense of other areas of expenditure. The question is whether the provision of the stadium should be a top priority for the Government. With the development of Croke Park by the GAA and the well advanced FAI plans for Eircom Park, there are fundamental questions that must be answered before the Government gets a blank cheque from this House to proceed with the planning of this project. What detailed discussions has the Government had with the national sporting bodies? Is it appropriate in terms of possible needless duplication and possible waste of taxpayers' money to have three <Col N="26" /> large stadiums in the capital? Is the Government committed to the maximum degree of co-operation possible between sporting organisations in regard to the provision of facilities at national level? Will the Government initiate urgent discussions to this end? The Labour Party is calling on the Government to take the steps necessary to optimise the benefits of a national stadium to the people at large and to the State.</P>
    <P>We have put down our amendment to signal our concerns to the Minister and will seek a voice vote. We will not seek to divide the House on the matter as we do not wish to be divisive. However, the Minister will be aware that Deputies are being questioned about this matter. The development of three major stadiums in the capital seems to be a case of over provision, but the Labour Party is fully open to being convinced by the Minister's arguments.</P>
    <P>There was an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning which related to Ferrybank AFC in my constituency. The club has nine schoolboy teams, two youth teams and two junior teams, but the players must still tog off in what are, effectively, containers. The Minister said in the article that he had sent Department officials all over Ireland to explain to people applying for lottery grants exactly what is required. It seems that Waterford was not one of the areas visited and I ask the Minister to correct that. There is a genuine problem in that people have difficulties with the forms and are not sure how to approach their applications. I welcome the fact that the Minister has sent people out and that there are also officials available to advise people by phone. As there is no substitute for a physical presence in the area I ask the Minister to address that problem. On the major issue, we need to be convinced that this project is not a white elephant, that it will fill a need and help develop sporting activities to the highest international standards, that there will be no needless duplication and no wastage of taxpayers' money or anyone else's money. A point made to me regularly is that the FAI has the money in place for the construction of Eircom Park and that there will be no cost to the taxpayer whereas it appears that £250 million, or the vast bulk thereof, will have to be provided by the State. It is in that context we have tabled an amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute and support the Government motion in connection with its decision to proceed with planning permission for the development of Sports Campus Ireland and Stadium Ireland, having noted the contents of the PricewaterhouseCoopers feasibility study. This debate is timely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been aware for decades of the need for a national stadium. This view has been voiced by sports enthusiasts, the media and people throughout the length and breadth of the country but it has not come to pass. Given the improvement in the overall economic situation and that <Col N="27" /> we are in a position to do something about it, it should be done as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Sports Campus Ireland will not be built at the expense of any other pressing, national or local need. The money is provided in the national development plan over the next six years and represents only a small percentage of the total expenditure. In addition, there will be much funding through the sports capital programme to organisations at local level. I am fully aware of the demands on the 1,900 organisations which applied for funding last year, 400 of which were successful. Many of those 400 have not yet drawn down their funds. The same is true of sports organisations and other community organisations which were granted funds in previous years. Where the Government has allocated funds those organisations should get on with the job as expeditiously as possible and improve the facilities at local level for which they have been given grant approval.</P>
    <P>Later in the year substantial funding will be provided for other local voluntary organisations. I know from practical experience on the ground that the problem for most organisations is to find matching funds and get on with the job of providing the facilities. I do not believe this project will cut across the funding required for local organisations. If it was at the expense of local organisations and their efforts to improve participation at ground level, the Minister would be the first to say he would not proceed with this project.</P>
    <P>The feasibility study was carried out by an experienced firm of consultants and all the major sporting organisations participated in consultations on this project before the final report was issued. The proposed location, Abbotstown, west County Dublin, off the M50 and somewhere between the N2 and the N3, would be accessible and would facilitate the provision of the necessary infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen said the IRFU, the GAA and the FAI may not easily go to Sports Campus Ireland given that they will have business commitments in relation to their current stadium. While this is part of the problem, the undue influence of big business and corporate boxes is shutting out participation by ordinary people who cannot afford corporate boxes. This new project will bring sport closer to the ordinary people rather than it being the preserve of the major companies and co-operatives which sponsor corporate boxes for their guests who in all probability do not know the first thing about the game they are coming to watch. More space should be provided for ordinary people at these events.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea said in passing there had been no consultation with Fingal County Council on this matter. I know from direct personal experience that the county manager of Fingal County Council has been consulted on this matter but not extensively given that the project is only at the initial stages. The project will have to go through <Col N="28" /> the normal planning process and there will be extensive consultation as it proceeds.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister. This debate raises an important issue about sport. Sport is all about the quality of life. Through projects such as this we want to increase participation in sport by young boys and girls, men and women, also the number of spectators and ensure it becomes a more family-oriented event and not the preserve of those who have a strong interest in a particular sport. All would agree the Government should take steps to ensure sport is for all. On a couple of occasions in recent months an excellent journalist with one of the Sunday newspapers has written about this project and suggested it is a pet topic for the boys in Government. I understand where she is coming from because generally most spectators at major sporting events are men. All sport starts at ground level. I live in Castletown, County Laois and in 1995, for the first time ever, my village and parish qualified for the senior hurling county final in Portlaoise. I went to the match that afternoon with my wife and child. Practically every man, woman and child from the parish was there to see their local team. That is what participation is about. The new stadium will allow every man, woman and child who has an interest in sport to come along. It is a joyous occasion for everyone involved.</P>
      <P>I record the gratitude of the people of Laois to the Minister for his support for the O'Moore stand development project in Portlaoise by allocating £300,000 towards this worthwhile project. When we go to future finals and other matches we will be able to watch them in greater comfort and safety.</P>
      <P>Sports organisations should be careful not to become too caught up in the development and management of property. All organisations should look at their core activity and concentrate their efforts at local level. I could envisage too much of the time of senior management and national governing bodies being preoccupied with ensuring their particular grounds or properties were financially viable when their energies would be better devoted to getting more people involved in sport at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This project is all about vision. I ask the other sports organisations to come on board because every sporting organisation is made up of voluntary members who have to spend too much time fundraising. If the national organisations have the benefit of Sports Campus Ireland they can con<Col N="29" /> centrate more of their time, effort and financial resources on developing clubs at local level.</P>
    <P>The Minister has outlined the many other uses for the national stadium, including entertainment events, concerts and major extravaganzas, such as Riverdance. We do not have a venue that would hold the audience such an event would attract. National stadiums in some countries are also used to accommodate religious and other conferences. The same could apply to this stadium. I also look forward to major pop groups, such as Westlife, performing at this venue in safety and comfort and to people travelling to and from such concerts in safety.</P>
    <P>Westlife recorded a song entitled &ldquo;I have a dream.&rdquo;  I also have a dream that my son and other young boys and girls will one day be on the playing field of Campus Ireland representing with pride their county or country in front of 85,000 people. I do not mind if it is in Gaelic football, hurling, soccer, rugby, swimming, track and field athletics or whatever. This motion will help to make this dream a reality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>News of the pending surplus in sporting stadiums serving the city of Dublin brings to the point of absurdity a planning deficit which for a long time has made the capital city a dowdy backwater of the sporting world. At best, two of the three proposed facilities are viable. The GAA, with its busy calendar and a headstart, both in rebuilding Croke Park and in selling corporate space therein, can justify its independent stance. Neither the Government nor the FAI, who appear to be building facilities with which to slap each other's faces, can make the same claim. The Government's plan to build an 80,000 seat stadium sounds excessively grandiose given that Lansdowne Road is in a position to comfortably house its entire constituency for live rugby and the international soccer match that requires greater space is rare.</P>
      <P>The lavish plans for the development make impressive reading but are certain to generate serious doubts as to whether State funding of up to £100 million should be made available to a stadium which may host only six or seven sell-out events a year. Although many concerns relate to funding for health services, education and social welfare, there will be a broad welcome for two out of the three stadiums, but a third stadium is unsustainable from a business point of view.</P>

      <P>In purely sporting terms, Dublin does not require a stadium on the scale proposed. Given the position of the GAA and the FAI, the question of viability must be addressed. This is especially relevant when the state of capital spending allocations in sport are considered. For example, the Sligo Institute of Technology requires an eight lane athletics track, but an application by Teeling Sports and Leisure Centre, Collooney was refused, as were applications by St. Joseph's Amateur Boxing Club, St. John's Community Development, Carrowroe, and St. Anne's Youth Centre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Regardless of the implications of the building boom in terms of availability of builders, communities have made a huge commitment in the form of the detailed applications they have submitted. The Minister said there was a lack of understanding of the application process and he indicated that officials in his Department are establishing the criteria used when deciding on funding allocations. That is welcome. However, the 46 clubs in County Sligo that did not get funding are very disappointed. The reasons for refusal did not indicate a lack of construction crews to do the work.</P>
      <P>The Minister's Department is unable to deal effectively with the sports capital programme. There is insufficient business to support three stadiums in Dublin. The Minister should, therefore, ensure funding applications submitted to his Department are dealt with. It is proposed to spend £230 million on a national stadium, yet County Sligo received only £150,000 in total under the last allocation of capital sports grants.</P>
      <P>The relevant Oireachtas representatives should be made aware if there are difficulties with clarity in connection with an application because the onus is on all of us to ensure funding is provided to those who need it. Many areas have no facilities. For example, last week I visited Cartron Estate in Sligo, which has no facilities for under 12, 14 and 16 year olds. It has been told by the FAI that if it does not get a pitch it will no longer be eligible to participate in the league championships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the capital city needs major sports facilities it does not need three stadiums. The GAA is building an 80,000 seat stadium while the FAI is also building a smaller one. Questions must, therefore, be asked about the need for a new stadium and whether it will be viable and profitable. Business is void of sentiment. Who will run the stadium, who will pay for it and from where will the subsidies come? Will it be self financing or will future Government have to subsidise it? How can three stadiums located in the capital city be self financing? Has the feasibility study taken into consideration Eircom Park, Croke Park and the national stadium in terms of viability? While <Col N="32" /> there is a very generous benefactor for Stadium Ireland, the £50 million could be the most expensive the State has ever received from the point of view of the subsidies which will be required and in terms of viability and profitability. Sport should be funded from the bottom up and the Government has failed dismally in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>If I referred to the Chair as the referee perhaps he could introduce the sin bin. I honestly thought every Member without exception would applaud the decision of the Minister and the Government to proceed with Campus Ireland. I have heard this project talked about at numerous conferences for years. I have been associated in one way or another with sports administration since entering local politics in 1985 through the VEC. I remember being involved in a conference in the College of Technology, Bolton Street, in 1988 where sports bodies across the board, without exception spoke of the need for world class facilities such as those now being proposed. It is a milestone project and a clear signal that we are taking sport seriously at the highest level and I compliment the Government. That said, I am asking for some modifications and refinements.</P>
      <P>Some of us might have laughed when Deputy Gay Mitchell as lord mayor set up the Dublin international sports council. He talked enthusiastically about the capacity of Dublin and Ireland to deliver major sports projects, not just for sporting reasons but also for good economic and tourism reasons. At the time we were trying to regenerate Temple Bar and were at the bottom of a very serious recession. I applaud Deputy Mitchell and the other people who supported him for their vision. I recall the late Noel Carroll when he returned from the Barcelona Olympics waxing lyrical about the ability of Ireland, with a little extra provision, to host not just the Special Olympics but the Olympic Games. I frankly thought he and Deputy Mitchell were somewhat hyperbolic to put it mildly, but they rationalised the project extremely well. We have hosted the Cutty Sark race, the Tour de France and the Ryder Cup, each of which have resulted in massive infusions of finance for the city, which I am particularly anxious to cater for, and the country.</P>
      <P>I do not pretend to be an economist, but having read the summary findings regarding the project I am very pleased and heartened to note the project will stand on its merits. It will not just be a monument to the current Government or Taoiseach, but a signal to Irish people and the international sporting community that we are serious about sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very happy that it will be located in Abbotstown, a little outside my constituency of Dublin North-West. A couple of years ago that site was designated for the national science park, but when Deputy Rabbitte was Minister of State in the Department with responsibility for industry and technology he very skilfully transferred the project to the City West business park, and fair <Col N="33" /> dues to him. I am glad this replacement project is being located in Abbotstown, a perfect location with plenty of land on which to build a high quality project beside the M50. Further modifications of the intersections around Blanchardstown will be necessary, while the extension of the Westlink toll bridge will facilitate it. The site is beside the rapidly expanding airport and the port tunnel. It could not be in a better location. It will not be competing with any other facility &ndash; the other facilities need to be developed and upgraded.</P>
    <P>A few Members were in Australia during August and September 1999 and one of the places we visited was the Olympic Stadium in Sydney. Those watching the sports programme on TV3 last night will have seen some film footage showing the magnificence of the project. Undoubtedly there exists a commitment to spending large amounts of money, but what impressed me most about the location of the Olympic village is the number of other things which have been done. A run down part of Sydney is being rehabilitated through new housing which will become social housing after the Olympic Games. A rail infrastructure is being developed while there are bus and cycle lanes to beat the band. Believe it or not, some of the village is being built on a rehabilitated landfill site. In an Irish context, we have Dunsink landfill, which is almost as well known as this House for the way it was mismanaged over the years by Dublin local authorities. Thankfully the Dunsink landfill is being rehabilitated courtesy of stricter EPA and general environmental guidelines. I see an opportunity for the Government to develop significant spin-off developments around the Dunsink area. At one stage I suggested that the city council could nearly host the Winter Olympics given the height of the tip head at Dunsink. I discovered that Fingal County Council has received a proposal from a commercial developer for an artificial ski slope at that location. When I heard the proposal initially I thought it was slightly off the wall, but Deputy Higgins, who is a member of Fingal County Council, might be able to advance this in association with the project being discussed.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>

    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not be too local, but the side of the tip head Deputy Higgins has spoken about is not where the development was to take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot underestimate the economic spin-offs of such a project. Putting a facility such as this in an area is almost as significant as locating a manufacturing facility in an area. The project will create jobs in a new sector. There are many young people being trained in post leaving certificate courses, in the University of Limerick and the institutes of technology who are being sought after in the leisure sector. I have no doubt these <Col N="34" /> people will gain employment in this facility where exhibitions, conferences, concerts, etc. will take place.</P>
    <P>Ireland must be able to attract its share of the growing television audience and there is a need for large-scale facilities to attract matches such as the European Cup, the Rugby World Cup and others which are televised to a vast world audience. Athletics has never been showcased in Ireland. Certainly previous Ministers, including Deputy Allen, have played their part in developing centres in Tullamore, Cork and elsewhere, but the Morton Stadium in Dublin, for example, has always been developed on the basis of a grant of maybe £10,000 this year, £30,000 next year, etc., from either Fingal County Council, Dublin Corporation or the national lottery. It is a good deal better than it was. For example, the bobsleigh team is using its facilities for training. An increasing number of young people play ice hockey but they must go to Northern Ireland to do so. There is a small ice rink in Phibsboro, Dublin, but it is inadequate. A facility could be developed for ice sports and it should be part of the new campus.</P>
    <P>I am glad the 50 metre swimming pool will be fast-tracked so that it will be available in time for the Special Olympics, which are important. The extraordinary work of those involved in the Special Olympics needs to be supported and developed. An integrated policy with a bottom up approach is necessary and is being developed by the Minister. Physical education must be promoted in primary schools and additional sports halls must be provided. I am pleased the refurbishment of local authority swimming pools is coming on stream.</P>
    <P>I have great admiration for the sports for all policy currently promoted by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and previously by the Department of Education. It has encouraged people to participate in sports who otherwise would not have a snowball's chance in hell of becoming involved in any sport, including walking or swimming. There is a role for such sports in a sports policy. The jewel in the crown will be Sports Campus Ireland. It would be churlish in the extreme if we were not to support it unanimously.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that we do not have enough time to debate this matter. Sport interests many Members and, unfortunately, all of us will not be able to participate fully in the debate. I compliment the Minister and his predecessor, Deputy Allen, for their input into sport. Deputy Allen was responsible for laying down much of the policy that is being implemented and the Minister, Deputy McDaid, is an enthusiastic <Col N="35" /> sports supporter. We are fortunate that both of them have held the sports portfolio over the past five years and they deserve recognition for their work.</P>
      <P>I wrote an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> in the late 1980s in which I outlined a sports policy, the kernel of which is being implemented now. At that time it may have been a fantasy and somewhat idealistic but now it is a reality because money is available. I support the Minister's policy but many of the ingredients that I proposed for inclusion in a national stadium have been provided since, such as market investment in Croke Park, the National Basketball Arena in Tallaght, a 50 metre swimming pool and the national coaching centre in Limerick. However, there is room for the Minister's proposal despite people describing it as a white elephant. I look upon it in a different light. The proposal will depend on how the campus is utilised and how much access people will have to its ancillary facilities. I envisage the provision of a national injury rehabilitation centre, accommodation for all the NGOs involved in sport and the adoption of a more scientific approach to sport. A larger concept could be built around the proposal.</P>
      <P>There are a number of aspects to sports policy. Provision of facilities at national level has been poor while similar provision at local level has left a great deal to be desired. When money is committed at national level sight must not be lost of local communities because outside Dublin and the other major urban centres there is a huge need for decent sports facilities. Many facilities which were provided in the 1980s in rural Ireland are run-down and inadequate. The standards which were accepted then are not acceptable now for many of our younger athletes. There is a major need for the refurbishment and construction of new facilities. There should be a balanced building policy both at national and local level.</P>
      <P>The Minister must examine mass participation and the issue of excellence. At one level more people must participate in sports while at another our top athletes must be looked after. There are indications that Ireland is becoming a nation of spectators and people are not participating in sport to the extent they did in the past. The walking craze seems to have waned and there are fewer joggers on our roads. The number of people involved in activities has decreased. Participation levels seem to have reduced and a national survey should be carried out on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is my pet subject as I have a physical education background. The introduction of physical education as a subject at secondary level will not resolve the core problem of the lack of fitness among children. The Minister along with the Ministers for Education and Science and Health and Children should seriously examine the provision of physical education in schools, both at primary and secondary levels. I have expertise in this area and will examine this problem in conjunction with the Minister or anyone else. I have <Col N="36" /> carried out two national surveys over the past ten years. The information is available and I want to discuss that with the Minister at a later date. It is critical for the future health and well-being of our nation.</P>

        <b>: </b>There is no way that Members of the Dáil are in a position to vote today on this Government motion on the sports stadium. The vote presumes Deputies have noted, which means studied, the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, which is a massive document. I have no doubt that the vast majority of Deputies have not had an opportunity to read it. <Col N="37" /> This stadium is also predicated on receipt of £50 million from a private businessman, Mr. J. P. McManus, but we do not have sight of the legal agreement between Mr. McManus and the State. I want to see that agreement before I vote. I ask the Minister to read into the record the agreement between Mr. McManus and the Government. At the moment we can only speculate on its contents. Does it include a runway for Mr. McManus's private aeroplane as he jets in from his tax exile in Switzerland? </P>
      <P>Sports is regarded as a way of raising the sights of youth to a healthy lifestyle and a better life. If this stadium is built, when the 80,000 spectators raise their eyes, they will see Mr. J. P. McManus snugly ensconced beside the Taoiseach of the day. He is a businessman who has made a fortune from gambling and speculation on the world's currency casinos, a profoundly anti-social, speculative venture that undermines poor countries, destroys social programmes and impoverishes people. Is that the model for youth? If Mr. McManus had stayed tax resident on this island rather than going off-shore, we would have hundreds of millions of such activities.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak in support of the Government's decision to proceed with the planning of Sports Campus Ireland and the associated construction of a new national stadium. I commend the Minister and his officials on their work and initiative in advancing to this stage the idea of a new national stadium. Over the past two and a half years, the Minister has secured very substantial funding for the <Col N="38" /> Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. If I thought the provision of a stadium would take away from the development of regional and local sports centres, I would not be an enthusiastic supporter of the project but I welcome the Minister's categorical assurance that this will not be the case and that funds will not be diverted from the existing sports capital programme towards the provision of the national stadium.</P>
      <P>There are none of us who have not felt a great sense of pride when we see one of our athletes, swimmers or our national football team do well on the international arena. We may hear our national anthem played many times during the year but it has a special resonance, producing an even greater sense of pride, when it commemorates the success of one of our own far from our shores. Our athletes and sports men and women are truly our ambassadors in tracksuits, carrying the torch of a new Ireland, embodiments of a pride in being Irish and in all things Irish.</P>
      <P>Apart from all their other benefits, the new sports campus and stadium will be an icon of a new sense of national identity. Our sports men and women have contributed substantially to the fashioning of a new Irish identity. There was a time when we used to look back to a mystic, mythological past in search of heroes like CúChulainn or Fionn Mac Cumhaill. Today, we do not have to look back. Instead, we can look all around us. Our sporting heroes have contributed to the defining of a new patriotism in which all can share. Their success is due to endless hours of training, a lifetime of dedication and vast reserves of stamina. Only a small number of people can ever reach the level of excellence of Sonia O'Sullivan or Catherina McKiernan, but it does no harm to try. Their achievements set a clear example of excellence which we can all try to achieve in our own chosen areas.</P>
      <P>Dedication and ability are not enough to ensure success in today's competitive sporting world. We need to ensure that our athletes have access to the best possible training facilities which will rank alongside those available to others. This can only be achieved through the construction of a sports campus. Such a campus would be a clear signal of our commitment to excellence. It will place the best facilities for the majority of sports under one roof instead of allowing a multiplicity of facilities to be spread too thinly. Furthermore, the most advanced techniques in the vitally important area of sports medicine and sports science will be available within the campus, providing yet another element of excellence.</P>

      <P>There will be adequate need for all these facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sports campus and the national stadium will be of major benefit to the most pre-eminent of our sports stars, but its facilities will not and should not be available solely to the elite. It will also provide a marvellous platform for people to <Col N="39" /> view their sporting heroes in action in an arena of international standard without leaving our shores. This will attract major television companies eager to relay events taking place in such an important sporting location.</P>
    <P>Our new national stadium and sports complex will attract visitors from overseas and will have a vitally important place in our tourism sector. There are many examples of major sporting facilities which attract visitors to areas which might seem to be the opposite of a major tourism destination. The majority of sports fans are willing to travel. The building of a national sports stadium will mean that we will be able to attract a significant proportion of this important section of the tourism industry. Its location at Abbottstown, close to Dublin Airport, will enhance its attractiveness to visitors coming from outside the State, while its position close to the M50 motorway will facilitate access from within Ireland, North and South.</P>
    <P>The national stadium will be used for more than just sport. Its flexible design means that it can be adapted at short notice and at little expense to cater for different types of sporting events. A building with a capacity of 80,000 seats will be a major asset for a whole host of cultural activities, especially musical concerts catering for different tastes and age groups. Some of the existing locations for these events are far from suitable. They are incapable of catering effectively or safely for crowds while ancillary facilities and services, from toilets to restaurants, are often non-existent. These problems will be solved with the building of a new national stadium.</P>
    <P>It will be built with a large number of people in mind, so safety and comfort will be guaranteed. It will also be built to cater for the interests of a wide range of audiences so it will not be inflexible. The further contribution of non-sporting activities to our tourism sector will be hard to quantify. The provision of a national stadium is a clear signal of the Government's support for the spectrum of recreational activities from the level of professional sport to local sports clubs.</P>
    <P>A national sports campus and new national stadium have long been sought. The decision to build them, however, was not taken on the spur of the moment but followed extensive rounds of consultation with relevant parties, ranging from those involved in sport to those who have experience in managing large sporting facilities. This project will involve a great deal of money but the expenditure will be worthwhile and will mean getting the project right.</P>
    <P>The new sports campus and stadium have many benefits. One of the greatest is the role they will have in fostering our national pride. It is the best and most fitting way for the people of Ireland to thank the sportsmen and sportswomen whose selflessness has lifted our hearts and to say to the many rising stars of the sports world, for whom medals must surely wait in the future, that we <Col N="40" /> believe in them and wish to help them every pace of the track.</P>
    <P>The closing date for new applications under the recreational and sporting facilities programme is the end of this week. Undoubtedly there will be thousands of applications. The funding for that programme should be increased substantially. All public representatives meet the officers of local sporting clubs and community groups but, unfortunately, a dwindling number of volunteers participate in recreational, sporting and voluntary organisations generally. Given the excellent work being undertaken by a small number of people in each parish, all worthwhile projects should get adequate funding to ensure that every parish and community has the level of facilities to which the people are entitled.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made good progress since he took office in June 1997 in providing additional funding under this heading. I urge him to provide substantially more this year to clear many of the worthwhile applications with his Department.</P>

      <P>I welcome the project being embarked on by the Government. It is important that we have a national stadium of international standard. However, there is huge confusion among the public and various sporting organisations as to the consequences of constructing this national stadium.</P>
      <P>There have been consultations by the steering committee. However one must query what has happened given the stand off position adopted by other national organisations with regard to this project. It is difficult to believe that, not having had a national stadium, there is now the prospect of the country having four important stadiums in the capital. There will be this national stadium in addition to the stadiums of the FAI, the IRFU and the GAA.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not get into those difficulties. The national organisations have said they do not object to this facility. However, the question exercising the public is whether the provision of this stadium will cause a drain on funding and, if not, it is important that the Minister clearly states as much and that funding will not be cut off at any source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is much appreciated in my constituency that the Minister has agreed to meet a group from Tuam, County Galway, this afternoon. Tuam is a classic example of what might happen. Its stadium is the headquarters of gaelic football in Galway and Connacht but it has been allowed to deterio<Col N="41" /> rate to a standard which has been called into question with regard to safety and health in the past 12 months. The group is seeking funding from the Minister's Department and I hope he will have good news for it. However, that is another day's work. This is a legitimate group which has been side stepped by the national organisation because the GAA has opted for the development of Pearse Stadium in the city of Galway. Tuam stadium, however, for health and safety reasons must get funding if it is to retain its position as the focus of football in Connacht and Galway.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will clarify the funding aspect. As the Minister's Department and the Department of Education and Science have decided to include physical education in the school curriculum, they must allocate resources for facilities in schools for physical education. The manpower is there and always has been, even if only on a voluntary basis. Now resources are needed to bring training and facilities to an acceptable standard.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will respond immediately to the criticisms of this major development going ahead. Some people consider it unnecessary. I welcome it but it is important that the criticisms being made are confronted instantly so these sporting developments can take place side by side.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been told that this is an inspiring project and in some respects it is. We have been told it is a potent national and international symbol, an engine for economic and social development and a potent symbol of the new, young Ireland of the future. These claims may or may not be true. Undoubtedly, there is an element of exaggeration.</P>
      <P>However, in the few minutes I have available, I will not deal with these high faluting matters but with the practicalities. I do not make any apology for being parochial; I am a firm believer in the aphorism of Tip O'Neill about all politics being local. I am concerned about the possible effects of this project on my constituents and their quality of life. The Minister said it is proposed that the facility will be located in Abbotstown in west Dublin, which emerged in the opinion of the consultants as the most appropriate location for the proposed campus and Stadium Ireland. I cannot verify that because I have not had the opportunity of looking at the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister added that the site is ideally located with an excellent infrastructure in place. Close to Dublin Airport, it has significant frontage on to the M50 motorway and once that motorway has been completed, it will link all the main arterial routes to and from Dublin and the airport. The site of 495 acres is in State ownership and it is estimated that 220 acres will be required for the total complex, including parking. That is all very well, but what about the people who will have to live and work adjacent to this proposed <Col N="42" /> stadium? There are already major traffic problems in the area which are increasing daily. Traffic congestion more than housing is the number one problem in my constituency of Blanchardstown, Castleknock and the Dublin 15 area generally. What effect will an 80,000 seat stadium and an indoor arena capable of holding 15,000 have on my constituents in terms of traffic congestion, noise, fumes and frustration? What effect will it have on their quality of life? Were these matters even considered?</P>
    <P>We were told about the wide consultation which took place with stadium management companies with similar facilities in the UK, France, Germany, Portugal, Australia and the United States. We were told that &ldquo;This was by far the most extensive consultative process and the most in-depth analytical study ever carried out in Ireland .&rdquo;. Did anyone ever think of consulting the local people?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">

      <P>We were told by Deputy Fleming that consultation took place with the manager of Fingal County Council. I do not know if that is the case. Did that consultation take place before a decision was taken or since then? Have local people the right to be consulted on these issues which will have such an effect on them?</P>
      <P>I have tabled questions to the Ministers for the Marine, Finance and Agriculture, Food and Rural Development on the effect on operations such as the Teagasc production research centre, the Marine Institute and other organisations which employ at least 350 people in the area? What will happen to the activities of those State-funded organisations? I attempted in advance of the publication of the report to discover if consultation had taken place with those Departments. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development did not even know of the proposal and that is verifiable. These are important matters to which my constituents deserve an answer because they will have a major effect on their quality of life and I deserve answers in the House to those questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On 13 October last, I raised with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation media reports to the effect that the Minister had indicated to the FAI that he was prepared to contribute £11 million to the organisation on condition that it did not proceed with the development of its own sports stadium, Eircom Park. If that had been true, then it would have been undue pressure on the FAI. In fairness <Col N="43" /> to the Minister, he said that it was not the case. He wished the FAI well and the Government was proceeding with its proposals. While I took this with a pinch of salt, I was prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt.</P>
      <P>However, the Taoiseach, the Minister and the Government are playing to the gallery and to the public. The Government and its consultants are well aware that it will take two or three of the country's major sporting organisations to be on board to make a success of the proposed national stadium and that the FAI will have to be one of them. Otherwise, in the short-term, the national stadium could end up a white elephant requiring massive annual injections of finance which would reduce resources dedicated to other local and national sporting organisations.</P>
      <P>The Government has embarked on a well orchestrated campaign with the support of many of the Taoiseach's friends in the media and in the League of Ireland to discredit Eircom Park in favour of its own national stadium proposal. The recent appointment of a public relations team by the Government at the taxpayers' expense is another indication of the Government's attitude. They put the Government spin on issues to confuse sports fans and ordinary people throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Prior to the budget the FAI produced a detailed analysis for improving the quality of life and social inclusion through the development of soccer in Ireland. It did not receive the courtesy of an explanation why it was not taken on board. The proposal was rejected out of hand. Furthermore, the FAI recently had reason to take issue with the Government on its refusal to contribute to the cost of the recent postponement of the Ireland versus Yugoslavia match. These are the reasons the Government is taking it out on the FAI.</P>
      <P>Soccer has been the Cinderella sport in the past, partly because of the inefficiency of the FAI and partly because of a cartel in the organisation which was more interested in perks than in the organisation. However, the FAI now has a proposal to provide the type of facilities needed. The Minister is sufficiently familiar with sports to know that, in a 45,000 seater stadium, an atmosphere similar to the Dalymount or Lansdowne roars can be achieved. How can such an atmosphere be achieved in an 80,000 seater stadium? The Minister can proceed with his proposals, but he should not put spanners in the works for the FAI which is proceeding with its proposals and put at risk in the long-term the recreational facilities for youth and sporting organisations the length and breadth of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At last Monday's meeting of Fingal County Council, the chief planner stated clearly that the Government had not been in contact with Fingal County Council, which is the planning authority for the area, yet the Government is proceeding with the spin doctors' proposals for the stadium. <Col N="44" /> The Minister should take his head out of the sand and deal with the people.</P>

      <P>I have stated on the radio that the people in the area and their public representatives will be informed of the proposed plans. Two different boards will be established, one of which will be the company to run the stadium and will contain people from the steering committee who will have expertise. They will know what they are talking about, and they could meet with public representatives so that residents will be fully informed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen's amendment refers to a capital allocation to the FAI. The Government has always wished the FAI well with its ambitious project. It is entitled to proceed with it and it has been exceptionally successful in the past. Its crowds would have exceeded 60,000 people on numerous occasions and its spectators have been our greatest ambassadors throughout the world. The Government has nothing but praise for the FAI and wishes it well in everything it tries to do.</P>

Does the cost of £230 million include the relocation of these laboratories? Will they be moved to Cork or is there a chance that some of these facilities may be moved to Monaghan? This is an important issue. Testing is vital for the quality assurance of our beef and the health of our animals. Many people from Monaghan travel to the veterinary research laboratory to have testing done and we appreciate the work being done in the centre. As a farmer and as a representative of Cavan and Monaghan, I wish to know where the laboratory will be placed and what will happen to its workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="48" /> We recognise the commitment of the Minister, Deputy Walsh. Even as a Minister of State, he was involved in the announcement of the Goodman package. His work on Agenda 2000 is recognised and he has been praised by members of farming organisations as well as by his own party members. Major problems have arisen, however, from the farmers' guide which runs to 28 pages and the accompanying leaflet which offers advice on how cattle identity cards should be used. I raise this issue to highlight the bureaucracy imposed on farmers. In a letter addressed to each farmer concerned the Minister said that regional meetings would be held. I understand he appeared at some of them, although I am not sure how long he stayed. The meeting I attended in a hotel in Ballybay lasted several hours and was attended by 500 farmers and their wives who were anxious to ensure the best possible outcome to the Agenda 2000 negotiations. They were shocked by what they heard and very few questions were asked as a result. While we have no choice but to support the Bill in principle, the Minister should ensure bureaucracy is kept to a minimum as farmers are literally being driven to suicide. Many are being driven off the land, which must be avoided at all costs. This is a serious matter as many farmers attended primary school only &ndash; many did not attend special agricultural college. The fact that a 28 page guide and accompanying leaflet have had to be issued through the Department gives some indication of the complications that have arisen.</P>
    <P>The proposed scheme only applies to beef produced in the European Union which has no control over issues such as the use of growth promoting hormones, hygiene standards at farm and meat plant level and traceability in respect of beef produced outside the European Union. It is inaccurate for the Minister to state, therefore, that consumers are fully protected by the Bill. The proposed standards put EU farmers and processors at a competitive disadvantage. To overcome this there is a need to make two changes. There should be a requirement to label all meat and meat products produced outside the European Union specifying the country of origin. Such a scheme should apply to all meat sold in retail outlets and restaurants. This is essential if the real objective is the protection of consumers. The Irish lobby at the EU-WTO negotiations must insist that those countries that wish to export meat to the European Union adhere to our internal quality assurance standards. We cannot allow beef which has been treated with hormones to be exported here from third country markets.</P>
    <P>The costs associated with the scheme are high. Farmers are subjected to a raft of inspections for TB and brucellosis as well as headage and REP schemes. The Minister must ensure the scheme is introduced in a sensible manner that avoids unnecessary inspection costs for farmers who may face additional adherence costs for such matters as pollution control and improved animal housing in respect of which the level of finance available <Col N="49" /> is inadequate. These costs will be most severely felt by those with least resources. The Minister should introduce a package of grant aid and tax relief to avoid financial hardship.</P>
    <P>To protect farmers from over-officious inspectors a fair and independent appeals procedure must be put in place. The Bill as it stands&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Over-efficient inspectors? That is hardly a crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a danger that inspectors could be over-officious. If farmers do not cross every 't' and dot every 'i' they are treated as criminals. I suggest that the Deputy should listen very carefully; we are not going overboard, we are talking about the practicalities. The legal profession will love this &ndash; the Bill provides for appeals to the Circuit Court. This is inadequate on the grounds that it will be unduly expensive and the courts do not have the necessary expertise to assess the reasonableness of a case and shall be obliged, therefore, to seek professional assistance in arriving at decisions. It would be far more preferable to put a more informal appeals procedure in place to allow a farmer and, if necessary, his farm adviser make representations directly to an independent expert who could assess the facts and, if necessary, visit and inspect the farm. Decisions should only be appealed to the courts on a point of law.</P>
      <P>To ensure traceability prior to slaughter we should be using microchip technology instead of a tagging system which is difficult to administer and in respect of which unscrupulous operators present a problem. Tag numbers are not always clearly visible and the new plastic tags are a nightmare. A farmer in my area who applied for a plastic tag for one animal in November 1998 only received it at the end of June 1999.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the scheme is to achieve a quality price for cattle. As we are all aware the BSE crisis was a major setback and caused enormous hardship. As the records clearly show in government we tried to keep the majority of markets open. In 1995 we exported 176,000 cattle to Egypt and 81,000 to Libya. In 1996, 106,000 cattle were exported to Egypt and 33,000 to Libya. We have exported no live cattle to those markets in the past two years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>I understand that a draft of the report on phase two of the basic income study was received from the consultants recently. The draft has been circulated to the members of the working group which will meet to consider it at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We seem to be going backwards. An earlier reply to this question was more comprehensive. What is the Taoiseach's attitude to this study? Was it part of Partnership 2000 as set out in paragraph 4.3.5? Has it now reached the end of its natural intellectual life or is the Government serious about pursuing it in a coherent way? Have Father Seán Healy and CORI pursued this matter in the context of the new partnership programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a commitment given in Partnership 2000 and I intend to pursue it. I do not know what the final outcome will be. Phase one of the study was dealt with by the working group some months ago and arising from that, it asked the ESRI to undertake further studies. The members of the group have, by and large, been occupied by the talks in the past three months and did not have a meeting. They will have one shortly. The second phase of the study has just been completed and has not been looked at yet. It should be pursued to the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides for the achievement of income adequacy to be progressed through a number of measures, <Col N="51" /> which is what CORI has been concerned with in the current talks. Included in the programme are specific social welfare measures in the framework of social inclusion, arrangements for pay which target those on low incomes &ndash; which was the original intention &ndash;  the introduction of a statutory minimum wage and tax provisions which benefit those on low but taxable incomes. The study will be an important part of the ongoing work regarding the new programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the tax provisions concerning those with incomes below the minimum wage, is it not the case that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness does not contain an explicit irrevocable commitment to take those at or below the minimum wage out of the tax net, as we had been led to believe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is Government policy to continue to try to take as many people as possible on lower pay out of the tax net. The matter is still being discussed at the talks &ndash;  the issue of low pay was probably aired more than any other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>To continue to try to take people earning below the minimum wage out of the tax net is not the same as giving a commitment to do so. Giving a commitment to do something is different from saying the Government will continue to try. Presumably the Government has been continuing to try, even in this year's budget which was the most unjust in recent history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has successfully continued to make the position of lower paid workers better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Taoiseach say the Government has done that when it published a budget in which those earning £10,000 a year benefited by £4 a week while those earning £50,000 benefited by £50 a week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>It is sad that, coming up to St. Valentine's Day, we have to talk about broken promises again. Does the Taoiseach recall that the Government programme promised in 1997 that we would have this study within two years? Has the Taoiseach considered that proposals for basic income be linked to the average income level rather than the industrial wage, as the two are often different? Does he accept that the need for flexibility in the labour market favours a type of basic income payment, which would help low-income families?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall aim of the study was to try to evaluate the economic and social benefits and the budgetary and administrative basis of the introduction of a basic income system. It depends on the final outcome of the study. It is difficult to examine the long-term dynamics of the effect of basic pay. We will continue the <Col N="52" /> process to the end, with the working group which is treating it seriously, as I am. Then we will see what we can do. It could differ from the first basic income study or it could cover other issues, including the Deputy's suggestion. The effects of the economy have changed since this study was first initiated. We will continue to look at the issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The last time this issue was addressed was 9 November. Prior to that, if not on that occasion, I asked if the terms of reference of the study undertaken by the ESRI had regard to the fact that Ireland is part of the Single Market and if the analysis of the efficacy of a basic income was constructed in the context of a European market of 373 million citizens. The Taoiseach was not clear if those terms of reference included that dimension. Does the briefing data available to the Taoiseach indicate whether that is now the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not. I recall the Deputy raising that point. To the best of my knowledge, after the first report, the ESRI was asked to take a more comprehensive market position. I think the Deputy's point was taken into account but I will double-check it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach write to me about it? It is fundamental.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard the Taoiseach speak on a number of occasions about basic income. Does he agree with the analysis of the Small Firms Association that basic income would be a disaster for the economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the association said that a minimum wage would be a disaster. It was not referring to a basic income, which is a different issue. I do not agree with the analysis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the reply to Deputy Quinn's question, will the Taoiseach agree that labour is mobile in a single labour market, therefore tax provisions concerning the taxation of labour in the Irish part of a single market would have to take account of the tax provisions applying in other parts of the single labour market? If this is so, will he agree, for example, if Ireland were to have a 53% marginal tax rate to pay for a basic income, there would have to be for administrative purposes&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Where did the Deputy get that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on how the basic income is set. The tax rate depends on the basic income. It could be 20% if the basic income is set low enough. I am using this as an illustration. Therefore, the only sensible proposal guaranteed to work is where there is European agreement on a basic income, such as advocated by a former <Col N="53" /> member of the European Parliament, Chris O'Malley. He urged the adoption of a European basic income where there would be some form of synchronisation of policy in relation to taxation of labour in all parts of the European Single Market. While that should not be used as an excuse for not proceeding with the matter here, we should at least take serious account of the issue raised by Deputy Quinn. The figure I mentioned was used previously but I assure Deputy Sargent I was using it for illustrative purposes only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Quinn, one must consider what is taking place in the labour market because our foreign direct policy is based on taxation policies. This is a critical area which is taken into account. Our domestic workforce is also a key issue where people are attracted back into the economy. I see no semblance of unanimity among members of the European Council or Social Affairs Council who discussed these issues when I was a member of the Council. They are light years away from coming to an understanding on minimum pay levels. We witnessed this last year when four different countries discussed the issue and came up with entirely different figures within the one calendar year. I do not think it is a likely possibility in this decade. I believe the EU tax directive will be resolved before this issue is resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Taoiseach's reply to Deputy Bruton, is he not sure whether the terms of reference of phase two of the study currently undertaken by the ESRI have regard to the implications of a basic income administered by the Irish Exchequer in the context of a single integrated labour market, where our level of unemployment is 4.9% and the average figure is closer to approximately 8%? How can anyone come to a reasonable conclusion if there is not regard to that level of potential mobility? Is the Taoiseach saying that his briefing documentation does not indicate that the study is being conducted by the ESRI without the prospect of the impact on the labour market of 373 million citizens?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn already raised this question and I replied that I believed it was. When asked by the Deputy for a reply in writing, I indicated that I would provide this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the importance of the taxation system involved if there is to be consideration of a guaranteed basic income scheme, will the Taoiseach say whether the NESC report on taxation systems for the partnership agreement will include consideration of moves towards a guaranteed basic income so that we can begin to converge the two issues? Does he agree there is <Col N="54" /> still considerable confusion in the public mind between the debate on a minimum income and a guaranteed basic income? Will he take this on board when trying to articulate a clearer description of the idea being talked about here and in other countries? Will he consider the citizens' dividend or some other name which might clear up the confusion which is of no help to either issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A minimum wage is the statutory and legal rate paid to people in employment. There will be a relative wage for part-time workers. The basic income study was commissioned to be carried out in two phases. The overall purpose was to evaluate the economic, social, budgetary and administrative impact of the basic wage system. This is a very different system which would assist those already receiving social welfare benefits. It would have to take into account issues such as wage rates and competitiveness to which Deputy Quinn referred. This is a complex issue. Labour market supply, which raised many questions in the first report, would have to be considered. The position in this regard is not the same as it was in the early 1990s when the issue was raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that basic income, by its very nature, treats one and two income families equally, whereas the Government's current tax policy represents a divergence from that principle? Does he agree that when reflecting on basic income, which is assisted by the Government's commitment to tax credits, the Government should reflect on inconsistencies in its other tax policies such as placing a restriction on the transferability of allowances within a marriage?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>My Department did not encounter any millennium bug issues in the crossover from 1999 to 2000 as intensive preparations had been made by staff of the Department to identify and remedy in advance any Y2K problems. This effort was successful. It was, therefore, not necessary to activate the Department's contingency plans.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree all Members were concerned that a problem might arise? I extend our congratulations to all those who made a major and successful effort to overcome difficulties which may have been threatened. On reflection, does the Taoiseach think the difficulties were as real as were portrayed or was a certain amount of hype generated by people anxious to sell their services as individuals who could solve a problem one did not realise one had, but which they were convinced one had?</P>

      <P>It was a bit of both. There were some problems internationally but, thankfully, they did not cause enormous damage. The hard work done to deal with such technical problems was successful. Many problems arose but none was too serious. This aspect must be taken into account.</P>
      <P>However, on the other side, the hype was unreal. As I mentioned previously, during an interview with CNN in the United States in November I said it was nonsense that people were being advised to stock up on food and to stay indoors. The interviewer asked me if I would be prepared to make a clip to be shown on 1 January and I said &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. I said most of it was nonsense and that I was happy for a clip to be shown on 1 January. I do not know if it was shown but the problem was overstated.</P>

      <P>I launched the Government's strategy for the development of the international financial services industry in Ireland last March. The strategy sets out a vision for the development of the international financial services industry in Ireland, building on the success of the IFSC.</P>
      <P>In accordance with my reply to Deputy Bruton on 15 December, a progress report on implementation of the strategy has been prepared. The IFSC Clearing House Group finalised the progress report at its meeting last week and it will be submitted to Government for approval in the next few weeks.</P>

There are now 8,500 people working in the IFSC, which is on a 27 acre site. Another 3,000 will start work this year on the 12 acre site. This will bring the total number of people working in this massively growing industry to 11,500.

As a former Minister for Finance he understands the fragility of the confidence of international institutions about new financial services centres of which Ireland is only one, albeit a spectacularly successful one. Does the Taoiseach agree the failure of the Government to resolve what is an interparty and interpersonal dispute at this stage within his Department is undermining confidence about the future of the IFSC and its relationship with a single financial regulatory authority?</P>
      <P>We understand this matter has been on the Government's agenda since early last year. Unlike other issues on which the Taoiseach refuses to ask questions for fear he will get the wrong answer, on behalf of IFSC workers, will he send the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Minister for Finance and the Attorney General into counselling or take hold of the issue himself? As a former Minister for Finance, he is well apprised of the significance of a failure to deal with this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Deputy's first query, that is an ongoing issue. The group set down a number of ways in which it believes it should be tackled. It launched a new module for training people for the financial services industry and it is important that is implemented. A meeting will be held later this year, in the spring or the summer, at which all the educational institutes, people involved in financial services training and financial services graduates at all levels, including technical and professional areas, will come together and consider what more can be done. This is an important aspect because the centre is growing so rapidly. There is need for more graduates and although that is being reflected in some <Col N="60" /> of the colleges, the group believes more needs to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is long-term planning, as the Deputy knows. All 27 third level colleges have increased their output for most courses, and those dealing directly with the financial services industry in particular have substantially increased their numbers. That is not to say that from the start there have not been non-Irish and non-European people working in the centre; there have been and I am sure that will continue. Labour market growth in Ireland is far higher than in most other places; if top quality people continue to qualify at graduate and post-graduate levels and if we keep the centre growing at the rate required, that will not be a problem. The problem will be to keep abreast of changes such as those which happened this year, when the major issue concerned the tax returns of policyholders of life assurance companies and collective investment funds. These are the key issues which will continue to develop and provide employment in the centre.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 to 11, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The results of the Information Society Commission's business community survey were published in December last. Overall, the results suggest that Irish businesses are making strong moves to embrace information and communication technology and are more engaged in e-business. While businesses now have a very positive attitude to e-commerce, actual levels are still relatively low. It is also apparent that small and medium enterprises in particular need to do more to keep up with technological changes in the marketplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main findings of the survey are: the vast majority of Irish businesses are now familiar with the terms and services relating to new technology; one third of Irish businesses have more than 75% of their employees using computers; Internet access in the business community compares competitively with the UK, Germany, France, Italy, the USA, Canada and Japan; use of websites for on-line sales by Irish businesses is still relatively low; Irish businesses are more enthusiastic about <Col N="62" /> the information society than their international counterparts; businesses are concerned about IT skills shortages but need to do more to provide training for their staff; and small and medium enterprises are more at risk of being left behind in the e-economy.</P>
    <P>Some of these findings have been confirmed by other studies carried out recently, including one by Andersen Consulting, entitled &ldquo;E-Ireland Takes Off&rdquo;. The findings relating to SMEs are a cause for concern and a range of awareness measures have been put in place, including a national awareness campaign for SMEs run by the commission with IBEC, which involves a series of seminars around the country with the objective of demonstrating the importance of e-commerce to SMEs. Enterprise Ireland has also enhanced the services it offers to SMEs in the e-commerce and information society area.</P>
    <P>As regards the provision of e-mail addresses for every citizen, the Deputy's question gives the impression that a decision to this effect has been made already, but this is not the case. The Information Society Commission was asked to assess the possibility and merit of providing an e-mail address and Internet access for every citizen and the commission established a sub-group to look into this matter. The work of that group led to publication of a discussion paper last November, the contents of which I have already outlined to the House. The paper set out a range of options regarding the possible provision of e-mail addresses for citizens. The commission is currently examining the many responses to its discussion paper with a view to preparing recommendations to Government on the question of IT access generally, including possible provision of e-mail for all.</P>
    <P>Turning to the fast track to information technology initiative, the Information Society Commission has no direct involvement in this scheme, though it did welcome it in its most recent annual report, saying that it provides a model which can be applied to other sectors and regions. The scheme is, in effect, a partnership arrangement between the State training providers FÁS and the vocational education committees, the local employment services network and the IT industry. It aims to provide training and employment for 3,500 people in the Dublin area over three years. The scheme, aimed primarily at the long-term unemployed, is being driven by the IT industry itself which is assisting in a number of ways, including the development of training curriculums, providing internships, contributing to operating costs and, ultimately, providing jobs and career development paths for the trainees.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that Ireland has been relatively slow in the use of e-commerce for selling goods and services produced in Ireland? Does he agree that the findings regarding the low use of websites by Irish businesses are a matter of serious concern? Does he agree that the fact that other countries, such as <Col N="63" /> the US and Scandinavia, have been more assiduous in the development of websites means that they can sell goods into Ireland to the detriment of Irish distributors, as Irish distributors are not quick enough to get onto the Internet?</P>

      <P>Use of the Internet has been low here, that is a fact. It has been low in Europe compared to the US where it has doubled or quadrupled every year over the past four to five years. There are a number of reasons for that and not all relate to the Internet. Irish people still like to go to stores and surveys have shown that people will continue to do so as long as it is possible. However, we must still grow and develop. There are various delivery systems such as brochures and catalogues, which people said would not take off, and I believe this will take off, though it may take some time to do so. We are ahead of most of our European counterparts, though we must continue to strive to get to the level of the US. The benefits of e-commerce, e-government and so on are clear and I am very supportive of the efforts to develop this.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that complacency is misplaced if we compare ourselves to mainland Europe, given that mainland Europe has an ageing population which is in the post-computer generation? Ireland has a young population which is in the computer generation, so to say we are not far behind or slightly ahead of Europe means we are far behind our real potential as a young country. Does the Taoiseach agree that the problem is that we are not encouraging businesses sufficiently to have their own sites and that it is the selling of Irish goods and services through the Internet that is insufficient? The issue is not one of buying by Irish people, as they can look after that for themselves, but the selling of Irish services by Irish businesses, which is inadequate at the moment.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will note that I said we are ahead of most of our European colleagues but that we should strive to reach the US level, so he and I are in agreement on that. The Government has produced six Bills promoting this area in various ways, but we must keep on pushing it, as it is an industry that changes dramatically. All our State industries and the Government generally must build and develop it. The Internet is not being used for sales as much as it could. It is increasing and expanding and we must facilitate it in every way we can by encouraging our agencies and legislatively making it possible.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree this is simply an extension of the protection of copyright and brand names by another name? The private sector looks after itself &ndash; caveat practitioner, if that is the correct phrase. In respect of assets owned by citizens, such as Campus Ireland, there is a necessity for every Government agency at every level to ensure its website is properly registered and owned so that the intellectual copyright of the electronic address, from the time it goes up on the screen and the web, is registered in the ownership of the body which actually possesses that name? Will the Taoiseach look at a punitive capital gains tax on cyber pirates? It is outrageous that somebody can gain £50,000 or £60,000 for anticipating the probability that a website will be registered and, due to the munificence of the conservative Minister for Finance, pay capital gains tax at the rate of only 20%. It is piracy and thievery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position regarding the issue of work permits is that my Department examines applications for work permits from employers in this country to employ non-European economic area nationals and, where appropriate, issues such permits. A total of 6,215 such permits were issued during 1999 and a further 707 were issued in January.</P>
      <P>As regards asylum seekers who are eligible to work, the Government decided in December 1999 that they will no longer require a work permit to work here. At that point a total of 56 work permits had been issued to eligible asylum seekers by my Department and a further 11 were approved, which subsequently issued.</P>
      <P>Since December 1999 eligible asylum seekers have been issued with an identification and verification letter by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which they can present to potential employers when seeking employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures come from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Since December a total of 1,325 verification letters have been issued by the Department and a further 150 are ready to issue. There is no information available on how many of those have secured employment. I will be tracking that with that Department and will be glad to keep the Deputy informed of developments. The system is much more user friendly from the point of view of asylum seekers. They have their letter and they can simply go and get a job. It is important that we know how that system is working.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm, even though they have the letter, what is the process when they arrive at an employer's door with that letter? Is it not the case that the employer must still apply for and get the work permit? The letter does not provide a <i>carte blanche</i> to work because <Col N="67" /> there is still a process to be gone through. Will the Minister of State explain what is involved?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a process involved. Those involved have the right to work. While the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform deals with the individuals concerned, my Department deals with licensing the employment side. The employer will have to follow the procedure involved. We will monitor the numbers who have secured jobs and I will keep the Deputy informed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for that information. Is he aware that within the past two weeks employers seeking non-national and non-EU citizens have been told they must advertise on the EURES system and wait for four weeks for somebody in Europe to apply for the job? Is he also aware that this was not the case up to two weeks ago? How many FÁS offices are doing this and how many have the capability to advertise in this way? Farmers who do not have computers have been told to advertise on the EURES system for, say, mushroom pickers and wait for four weeks before they can apply to employ a Latvian, Lithuanian or some other non-EU citizen willing to pick mushrooms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I will check the information the Deputy has brought to my attention. As Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs I am working closely with the Tánaiste in this area. I am anxious that the system runs as smoothly as possible. Companies seeking this type of recruitment are in the IT area and in catering hotels and restaurants. Where they have a need for employees they can seek them in the European economic area, which includes Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein as well as the EU. If everything goes smoothly and the paperwork is correct the process should take four weeks.</P>
      <P>However, I will follow up on the information the Deputy has brought to my attention. It is news to me that the system she has outlined is making it more difficult for employers. That is not the way we should proceed. Certain sectors have needs and we should try to make the system as user friendly as possible.</P>

      <Quest> the deadlines, if any, for the receipt of the various reports on the investigations being carried out in her Department; the number which have still to be completed; if she has been informed by the Director of Public Prosecutions if he intends to instigate prosecutions against anybody in relation to these investigations; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the 13 company investigations which have been undertaken in our Department recently, five have been completed, two are suspended due to judicial review proceedings and six are ongoing. We expect that a further report will be completed in the near future. We have set no <Col N="71" /> deadlines for the remaining five reports as I know the authorised officer and his staff are continuing to work flat out to complete their work as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Four of the five completed reports were referred to the DPP at the outset. The reports in question dealt with National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited, Bula Resources (Holdings) plc., Garuda Limited and Faxhill Homes Limited. These were referred to the DPP on 12 June 1998, 22 July 1998, 17 June 1999 and 21 June 1999, respectively. I am aware that the NIBFS and Bula reports were subsequently forwarded to the Garda Síochána. In the cases of Garuda and Faxhill, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions returned the reports to our Department on 31 August 1999 because it believed it was precluded by section 1 of the Companies Act, 1990 from forwarding the information concerned to the Garda Síochána for investigation. This was not a problem with the Bula report which was published by our Department under section 14 of the Companies Act, 1990. Neither was it an issue with the NIBFS report which though not published was undertaken under the Insurance Act, 1989 and was therefore not subject to the onerous secrecy provisions in section 21 of the Companies Act, 1990.</P>
      <P>The legal problem <i>vis-à-vis</i> Garuda and Faxhill was resolved in the recent amendment to section 21, which was made in section 53 of the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1999. Following the commencement of this provision, we returned the Garuda report to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions on 31 January last, as it is not legally possible for us to undertake any summary proceedings for suspected offences under the companies Acts in this case. However, we have decided not to refer the Faxhill report to the DPP for the time being, having regard, <i>inter alia</i>, to the fact that our Department is well advanced in considering, in conjunction with the Chief State Solicitor's office, the initiation of a number of summary prosecutions for suspected offences under the companies Acts identified in the report. Subject to legal advice, we also intend to undertake a number of summary prosecutions arising from the Bula report.</P>
      <P>Consequently, three of these reports remain with the DPP. Action contemplated by the DPP in any of these cases is not reportable to us as he is independent in the exercise of his statutory duties. Consequently, I have no information on whether the DPP plans to initiate prosecutions against anyone arising from these reports.</P>

      <P>There is much new information in that answer which, unfortunately, I do not have in front of me. This means I may not be able to ask detailed questions of the Minister of State. I gather his Department intends taking some summary prosecutions. Will he indicate the basis on which these summary prosecutions will be taken? Can he provide an update on the situation con<Col N="72" /> cerning the Celtic Helicopters inquiry which he did not mention as one of the companies which have been referred to the DPP?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Celtic Helicopters will be dealt with in a subsequent question. However, the report is expected shortly. The summary prosecutions refer to various breaches of the companies Acts. When the current examination is concluded and the legal advice is available we will take a final decision as to the options the Department and the Tánaiste will exercise.</P>

      <P>I assume the Gerard Ryan report is one of those to which the Minister referred to as being complete, handed to the Tánaiste in June 1999 and given to the Taoiseach at the end of July 1999. Will the Minister of State confirm whether the Minister referred the Gerard Ryan report to the Moriarty tribunal? If she did, does this give the Minister the right to be informed by the Moriarty tribunal if further information arising from, or not covered in, the Gerard Ryan report becomes available? Does the Tánaiste have a right to get information directly from the Moriarty tribunal on issues which have already been examined by her Department?</P>

      <P>If that is the position, as I believe it to be, the Tánaiste gave the Gerard Ryan report to the Moriarty tribunal and a new report from another source became available to the tribunal in November. Can the Minister of State say what the Tánaiste meant when she said in an RTÉ interview that she had information as a result of her being a Minister, and that she was aware of the information concerning Deputy Denis Foley without the Taoiseach having to tell her? How did the Tánaiste come across the information which I understand was given to the Moriarty tribunal by Mr. Collery's secretary?

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither the Tánaiste nor I have asked the Competition Authority to carry out investigations into the beef industry. I understand, however, that in 1997, prior to this Govern<Col N="74" /> ment taking office, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry requested the Director of Competition Enforcement to conduct an investigation into alleged anti-competitive practices in the beef processing industry. I understand this was one of a number of complaints relating to the meat plants received by the director which are currently under investigation by him. The director and the Competition Authority, of which he is a member, are independent in the exercise of their statutory functions.</P>
      <P>Quite separately from this investigation by the authority, the Government decided at its meeting on 19 January to establish an independent group to examine the continuing allegations of anti-competitive practices in the beef industry and the alleged failure of consumer prices to reflect reductions in producer prices.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the independent group are to examine allegations of anti-competitive practices in the beef industry, to establish why there is such a large differential between the producer price and the prevailing consumer price, and to make appropriate recommendations in the matter.</P>
      <P>The group has already begun its work. It is chaired by Mr. Kevin Bonner, former Secretary General of my Department, and includes Professor Seamus Sheehy and Mr. Colm McCarthy. The group has been asked to report to the Department by 28 April 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State accept that if the Tánaiste, on taking office in June 1997, had shown more interest in seeking reports and following the investigation by the Competition Authority into price fixing in the meat industry that we would not have had farmers blockading meat producing factories in January? When in 1997 was the request made to the Competition Authority? Why did the Tánaiste not follow up that inquiry more diligently on taking office? Does she believe changes in the law are necessary to give the Competition Authority more power?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>On 13 April 1997 the Director of Competition Enforcement received a letter from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry requesting the Competition Authority to conduct an investigation into alleged anti-competitive practices by meat processing companies. The director wrote to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry's private secretary expressing concern that any publicity would hinder its investigation by alerting the parties concerned. Unfortunately, the Minister subsequently announced that he had asked the authority to investigate the matter and therein lies the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the director first needs a <i>prima facie</i> case before he can obtain warrants to search a premises. It is a pity the Minister publicised this issue because had he not done so an investigation could have been conducted and dawn raids etc. carried out. Where such <Col N="75" /> a scenario emerged in other areas the best approach was not to publicise it. I was involved in bringing in the retailers and multiples and trying to track the price of meat in general from the farm gate via the processors to the shop counter. We have been active on that front. There were some reductions and special offers but that is a separate question. It is a pity the former Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry did not do what was requested by the Competition Authority and be silent on this issue, thereby allowing it to get on with its work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I admire the Minister of State's effort to try to sidetrack the question and blame somebody else. On 30 April 1997 a request was made and the Government took office in June.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State confirm that when the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Agriculture and Food took office in June 1997 they did absolutely nothing with regard to investigating whether a price fixing cartel operated in the meat processing industry and as a result the establishment of another review group is a fire brigade action? Is there a need to give the Competition Authority further powers given that it seemed to have been absolutely powerless to pursue this investigation since 1997? Has there been an examination of its powers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The investigation remains open and other avenues are being pursued by the authority. On behalf of the Department I pursued the issue by trying to trace the pricing issue from the farm gate via the processors. I had some concerns about the processors at the time and I discussed them with the Minister for Agriculture and Food. Both our Departments are anxious for the Competition Authority to make a breakthrough but, unfortunately, one must compile evidence in order to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case. Somebody on the inside ideally must reveal what is happening and that is the problem. A programme on this issue was broadcast by RTE last night. The IFA was involved in it and price lists were shown. The issue has been examined in great detail and in some cases prices were similar over a period. One can argue all day about examining lists but it is not enough because a <i>prima facie</i> case is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the issue was not handled well but we must move on. The Government has taken two forms of action. It has encouraged the Competition Authority to proceed and has also set up an independent body, chaired by Kevin Bonner. I hope that will give us a fresh approach to this issue because the authority must act within a legalistic framework. In many ways this is a <Col N="76" /> more flexible approach to the issue and let us see how it evolves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is very conscious of the legal restraints within which the authority and the Director of Competition Enforcement operate. It will allow them to proceed on the basis of the law that exists but it is prudent that another approach should be tried. We are not giving up on the original approach but we have every confidence in the independent body as it has acted in regard to other issues, such as alcohol and milk prices. There is no doubt that the system under which it operates has worked and will work. However, another approach was needed to deal with this issue and that is why the Government decided to established the new independent group.</P>

When it has fully considered the proposals the group will draw up its report and recommendations for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on this and the other areas covered by its terms of reference.

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I read with interest the debate on this issue recently at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, to which Deputies Perry and Owen contributed. Such questioning of the personnel involved is very helpful from our point of view. A number <Col N="77" /> of features of the groceries order have become redundant since the enactment of competition legislation in 1991 and 1996. However, there are a number of options. It could be repealed or replaced by regulation or legislation.</P>
      <P>We must concentrate on the concerns of small independent retailers. That is an important factor as we think our way through this. The Government will not outline its position until it receives the final report from the review group, but the concerns of such retailers must be seriously considered in terms of dealing with this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that food price inflation in Ireland is lower than general inflation and is less than that prevailing in the UK and elsewhere in Europe? I fully recognise the competence of the review group in terms of competition and mergers but I question its ability, expertise and whether it has the indepth knowledge to understand and address the key issues relating to the groceries order. Its recommendations, therefore, must be carefully studied by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that a slim majority of the group was in favour of not including the ban on below cost selling in any new legislation and that views were very divided means that we must be careful. I am conscious also of the UK experience and the Deputy's comments with regard to inflation. A great deal of information is available but the fact that the group appeared before an Oireachtas committee is important because it gave Members an opportunity to question those with diverse views on the issue. One must be careful about how one proceeds with this matter. A wide range of groups have a view and Aldi is the only multiple seeking any movement on this issue. The issues of hello money and below cost selling are important and must be addressed carefully. My one concern in regard to the introduction of legislation or regulations is that the concerns of independent retailers are borne in mind. This issue came up when we discussed Sunday trading and at that time I was concerned that we ensured that the position of the small shopkeeper would be borne in mind.</P>

      <P>The meeting in Seattle to which the Deputies refer was the WTO Third Ministerial Conference, which took place from 30 November to 3 December 1999.</P>
      <P>A date has not yet been fixed for any further WTO ministerial meetings. The WTO General Council in Geneva will be the main forum for discussions on this and on the strategy for the future of multilateral trade negotiations.</P>
      <P>The existing WTO agreements pre-commit members to certain follow-on reviews and negotiations across the so-called built-in agenda covering services, agriculture, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, intellectual property, known as TRIPS, technical barriers to trade, government procurement, investment measures, known as TRIMS, and textiles 2001-04. Negotiations in these areas have to take place, beginning in 2000, and, in line with the general philosophy of the WTO, should result in increased liberalisations.</P>
      <P>In the absence of a general round of trade negotiations, the immediate focus within the WTO will be on these built-in agenda issues. Negotiations in these areas will be conducted through the existing WTO groups in Geneva under the direction of the General Council.</P>
      <P>Ireland, in association with our European partners, will participate fully in the WTO Geneva process. We continue to remain committed to the launch of a comprehensive new round of negotiations involving a broad range of issues. This is the best way to address the challenges resulting from rapid and far-reaching economic changes, manage properly and effectively the globalisation process, promote equitable growth and development, and respond in a balanced manner to the interests of all WTO members, in particular the developing countries.</P>

      <P>I take it the Minister is taking this question on its own, even though there are other similar questions on the Order Paper. I notice Deputy Michael D. Higgins has tabled an almost identical one. Will the Minister tell the House, in very simple terms, the reason the WTO talks in Seattle broke up the way they did? What was the cause of that? Also, will the Minister tell the House whether Ireland is contributing to the WTO advisory centre for poorer countries?</P>

      <P>I do not know, but I found myself talking to &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; at one o'clock in the morning. To answer Deputy Owen's question, I believe it tried to do too much. The WTO is an ideal target for criticism and protest and I understand the reason the protesters were on the street. I would exclude, however, the type of anarchistic behaviour we witnessed. There is enormous sensitivity about certain issues and for Ireland, it was agriculture. The Americans, and the CAIRNS group in particular, wanted to move on quickly on agriculture. That was one of the issues about which I found myself talking across the Atlantic to &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, with Tom Parlon on the other line, although we were at one on this issue. As trade Minister, I was endeavouring to protect the Irish position on export refunds, the blue box, etc. In many ways the Americans and the CAIRNS group did not get their way on that, so that was one reason.</P>
      <P>Another sensitive issue was labour rights and the irony in that regard is that the western world wants to improve labour rights but the representatives of the developing world did not want us to get involved in that issue. The development agenda is something I am concerned about, as a former Minister for development, and on which we must make progress. Liberalisation of trade is good for Ireland but equally we have a strong voice in terms of human rights and development.</P>
      <P>On the other question, on behalf of the Government, I was one of the signatories in Seattle to provide for an advisory centre for the 48 least developed countries. We committed ourselves to $1 million&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste recently published the National Minimum Wage Bill, 2000, which delivers on the Government's commitment to introduce a national minimum hourly rate of pay. Subject to the passage of the Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Tánaiste will set the initial rate of the national minimum hourly rate of pay at £4.40 from 1 April 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" /> In the recently negotiated draft national agreement to succeed Partnership 2000, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the social partners agreed to recommend to the Government that the national minimum hourly rate of pay be adjusted to £4.70 from 1 July 2001, and £5 from 1 October 2002.</P>
    <P>Section 12 of the National Minimum Wage Bill, 2000, permits the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to review the national minimum hourly rate of pay. Where there is in existence or proposed a national agreement which contains a recommendation in relation to the national minimum hourly rate of pay to apply for the duration of the national agreement, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment must accept, vary or reject the recommendation within three months of being advised of the recommendation. The Deputy can take it we will not ignore the recommendations of the social partners. I commend all those involved in the talks in bringing about a successful outcome to this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the high level trade union delegation that went to see the Taoiseach in the days before Christmas to try to persuade the Tánaiste not to publish a rate then, as she sought to do, betray some kind of lack of commitment in the Department to the very concept of a national minimum wage? Will the Minister of State not accept that the rate now proposed has long since been overtaken in the marketplace? Is he aware, for example, that McDonalds is advertising jobs at £5 per hour, yet the Minister purports to tell us that the Government's idea is that we will reach that figure in the year 2002? Surely the whole purpose of the national minimum wage is undermined if it is fixed at that level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept any of those criticisms or that there is any lack of commitment to dealing with this issue, when one considers the rates in the United Kingdom, for example. The best approach to this always was to process it through the system of social partnership and the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach are as committed to that system as is Deputy Rabbitte. The Deputy will be aware that my party introduced this system of partnership in 1987.</P>
      <P>It is a successful economy. The approach in the new agreement is to ensure that the fruits of this economy are shared by all. As far as I am concerned, I welcome the proposed treatment of low paid workers through taxation policies and the introduction of the minimum wage. Rates that rise from £4.40 per hour to £5 per hour on 1 October 2002, combined with other measures which will support lower paid workers, are appropriate. This is a successful economy and one should not discuss the minimum wage in isolation from the other supportive measures for lower paid workers.</P>

That led to a high level deputation from the trade union movement going to meet the Taoiseach which was, happily, successful in persuading her to back off.</P>
      <P>How can the Minister refer to criticisms when it is a matter of fact that the minimum pay commission set the rate of £4.40 19 months ago on the basis of what was then two thirds of median earnings? Two thirds of current median earnings is already in excess of £5. When McDonalds is paying £5 per hour, how can the Minister say that achieving £5 per hour in 2002 will be of benefit to low paid workers?</P>

      <P>Clearly, there were different views among the social partners on this issue. We heard the views of the SFA and I also listened to one debate between Deputy Rabbitte and Mr. Delaney and others. I will not accept that the Tánaiste was not in favour of this measure although we can argue all day about what the Tánaiste had in mind with regard to nominating or not nominating a figure, which is the Deputy's argument, prior to the matter going into the partnership system. It has gone through the system and the Government is committed to this process and will follow through on it. There are other measures where the Government is clearly shown to be supportive of lower paid workers and anxious to protect and improve their position in the next three years.</P>

      <askee>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
      <Quest> if she has satisfied herself that insurance costs are sufficient to ensure the competitiveness of Irish industry, with particular reference to public liability; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>In addressing this subject, it is important to state that the broader economic issue of the effect of liability insurance premium costs on the competitiveness of Irish industry cannot be assessed in isolation from the totality of costs borne by manufacturing enterprises located in Ireland and the trend in these costs relative to costs in competing economies.</P>
      <P>That said, the Deloitte &amp; Touche report in 1996 on an economic evaluation of insurance costs in Ireland found that premium rates in Ireland were higher than in other EU countries surveyed. It also found, in a survey of small and medium enterprises, that insurance premiums ranged from 1.4% of payroll costs in larger firms to 8% in smaller firms.</P>
      <P>The report found that the two major factors driving up the cost of personal injury settlements in Ireland were medical inflation and the high transaction cost of claims, particularly legal costs, including the cost of expert witnesses. In response to these findings, a special working group was established under the aegis of the Department. This group has recently completed a research based study of personal injury compensation systems in operation in other countries with a view to establishing if these provide a more cost effective basis for delivering personal injury compensation. The report by the group will be submitted to us shortly.</P>
      <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche report also identified improved health and safety measures in the workplace as a way of reducing costs. I regard the initiatives on the establishment of affinity schemes for small businesses, the development of a voluntary code of practice in safe working and accident prevention as significant and positive measures being taken by Irish business, through a social partnership approach, to reduce the cost burden of accidents in the workplace.</P>

      <P>Is it intended, in light of the Deloitte &amp; Touche report, to take any initiatives which will have an immediate and incisive impact on rising costs and their competitiveness implications for Irish industry <i>vis-à-vis</i> our competitors in the European Union?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of initiatives have been taken. Discussions have taken place between the insurance division of the Department and the various business organisations and associations. As a result, a number of affinity schemes have been put in place by the Small Firms Association, ISME, the Construction Industry Federation, publicans, restaurateurs and farming groups. The <Col N="84" /> result has been an equalisation or standardisation of the risks involved and, by making group applications for the cover, it has reduced significantly the cost of that cover and of the premia.</P>
      <P>In addition, we have developed a workplace safety group operation, involving IBEC, ICTU and the Health and Safety Authority in consultation with the insurance division of the Department. We have agreed a voluntary code of practice which should minimise and reduce the risks to ensure that the cost of insurance should not be as prohibitive as heretofore. We await the other report from Mr. McAuley and his team. When it comes to hand we will take whatever other initiatives are possible.</P>

      <P>Is it not the case that some months before the change of Government the McAuley group produced its first report on a tribunal type system where uncontested liability could be speedily processed at a fraction of the costs Deputy Durkan referred to in his question? Two and a half years later the Minister of State is still sitting on his hands and the experiment represented by the McAuley group has not been put in place.</P>

We have responded to the report and created the affinity scheme in co-operation with industry. We have put the work safety code in place in consultation with the McAuley group and we now await the group's final report. The first report presented a complex legalistic situation and we had to be certain that it would be operable and practical. We await the final report and the Deputy can be sure that we will react to it as soon as it is available.</P>

    <P>The Bill contains, <i>inter alia</i>, enabling measures which will allow me to introduce policyholder information requirements at both point of sale and on an ongoing basis in respect of both life <Col N="86" /> and non-life insurance. The disclosure regulations related to the sale of life assurance products will be introduced first. The objectives of the new disclosure regime for life assurance will be to simplify the presentation of insurance products to the consumer by the disclosure of relevant and appropriate information on the policy by the broker-intermediary or insurance company representative; minimise the scope for misselling, including &ldquo;churning&rdquo; of policies; and ensure transparency of all charges and expenses and also commission payments.</P>
    <P>In drafting the disclosure regulations on life assurance policies, prior extensive consultations with interested parties were engaged in by the officials in our Department. A similar extensive and comprehensive consultation process will be adopted in respect of the non-life regulations. However, the precise format cannot be finalised until after the final enactment of the Insurance Bill.</P>

Why does he not tell the House that, after coming into office, he made a public statement that he would not proceed with the disclosure requirements and that he has only recently been dragged kicking and screaming to the notion of disclosure?

      <P>The attraction of industry to certain counties is a day-to-day matter for the industrial development agencies and not one in which we have a direct function. The availability of suitable land banks is essential to the attraction of industry to the regions. There are a total of 15 IDA Ireland-owned land banks available for industrial development in County Cork comprising some 100 acres in total. IDA Ireland is in discussion with Cork County Council regarding a joint venture to provide a further 20 acres of land in Fermoy. In addition, there is a 28 acre privately-owned West Cork Technology Park at Clonakilty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>IDA Ireland continues to promote all its sites for suitable overseas and indigenous investment projects. Over the past year IDA Ireland has expended considerable effort on reviewing its role and on planning its future strategy to ensure it continues to meet national needs in the year 2000 and following. In this regard, I have ensured that the need for more balanced regional development has been brought to the core of the agency's agenda and it has now become the main focus of its activity. IDA Ireland's programme for regional development will continue to be geared towards a partnership approach between the <Col N="88" /> agencies, local authorities and infrastructure and service providers, including those of skills training.</P>

      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for his indulgence in this matter. I do not accept there is not a role for the Government because, where there are political sensitivities such as Fruit of the Loom, the Government becomes directly involved and directs job creation into certain areas. There are four land banks in my constituency owned by the IDA and not a single new job has been created on any of those in the lifetime of the Government. We in Cork North-West feel we live in the forgotten constituency. I appeal to the Minister regarding land banks in Charleville, Kanturk, Newmarket and Macroom to direct some inward investment and additional job opportunities there. The Celtic tiger may be running out of steam and many of the benefits of it have not been seen in Cork North-West.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Live exports are extremely important, especially those to Libya and Egypt because of the type of animals they buy. The Minister, Deputy Walsh, and the new Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, were very vocal in Opposition about having those markets opened. The Minister, Deputy Cowen, in his new position, must do what he said the former Minister, Deputy Spring, should do, namely, go to Libya, Egypt and Iran to try to open the markets. I spent seven years on the board of CBF and, together with An Bord Bia, it has done a good job in promotion, but neither is involved in direct selling and direct efforts to provide quality beef to quality markets.</P>
      <P>The Minister must examine the possibility of using a base such as An Bord Bainne, which has marketing powers, to make sure that our quality beef reaches quality markets at a price that will maintain an income for farmers. There is no doubt that a cartel has existed. I congratulate the re-elected president of the IFA, Mr. Tom Parlon, Raymond O'Malley and the ordinary farmers of Ireland on helping to break that cartel. The Minister, Deputy Walsh, has a major job to make sure the activities reported in this week's <i>Farming Independent </i>are not allowed to continue. It is reported that the prices promised to farmers are not being paid by the factories. The Minister must make sure that efforts are made to regulate this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without proper income, farm families will not be able to adhere to the new regulations. Without proper staffing, the Department cannot make the scheme work. Bovine TB and brucellosis are out of control and in many places, such as County Monaghan, this is because of lack of staff. A good <Col N="90" /> Bill was introduced in 1989 by the then Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, to deal with the problems of offal and meat and bonemeal. That legislation was not adequately enforced and six years later the industry was badly damaged by BSE. There is no point in introducing regulations which are not enforced. There is no point in passing legislation banning drink driving if the Garda Síochána do not check drivers. We must ensure that this legislation is enforced in a sensitive and reasonable manner. We do not wish to see officials of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development acting as overseers in a militant way. They must act helpfully and encourage farmers to do things properly, to ensure that our beef is traceable and to provide the highest quality beef for markets in Ireland, Europe and wherever else we send it. We must make sure that never again can a situation such as was reported to the beef tribunal exist when meat other than beef was sent to our marketplace and destroyed the prospects for our industry. The farmers of Ireland will produce the best if they are given the opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Minister, with the help of a strong and powerful Department, must make sure that our beef gets into markets at the right quality and the right price and brings a proper return to the primary producer, for whose benefit this legislation is to be enacted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a red letter day for me because it is the first time I have addressed the issue of agriculture since I laid down my responsibility as Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry more than eight years ago. Because of the purpose of this Bill those of us who have had some experience and responsibility in this area should make a contribution and it is in that light that I speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The beef industry is the single most important industry in Ireland. This is so often said that it hardly needs to be underlined again. It is a £1 billion pound industry on which many producers, workers and others depend and is inexplicably associated with Ireland in the export markets. I recall doing many promotions &ndash; even one with Luciano Pavarotti in Italy &ndash; when we tried to promote the idea that quality beef is synonymous with Ireland. Ireland's natural advantages of climate, soil and tradition should enable us to compete with and beat the best in any market. Because it is the most important single industry in Ireland, those engaged in the beef industry, whether as primary producers or processors, should ensure, in their own economic interest, that the standards required by consumers are maintained and enhanced. For that reason there should be no need for a Minister to police an enterprise that has the primary responsibility for satisfying consumers and for protecting the reputation of this country. There should be no need for a Bill of this kind. Those charged with responsibility should discharge that responsibility. There should be no need for supervision of <Col N="91" /> the activities of those involved in the beef sector. Ireland's name and Ireland's beef should always be recognised by the consumers of Europe and elsewhere as being of top quality.</P>
    <P>I support this legislation. It has to be introduced because over the years, those who have had the primary responsibility, particularly processors but also primary producers, have not respected that responsibility. They have transgressed their responsibility and brought the name of Irish beef and of Ireland into disrepute. Can one imagine people in the information technology sector, in which Ireland is so successful, having to be supervised and regulated to ensure that they do what is required in order to place their products in the world markets and maintain their reputation? Can one imagine this happening in any other sector of our economy? I regret it has proved necessary for the Minister to impose such supervision on the beef industry. Nevertheless, I welcome this legislation and I will support it vigorously.</P>
    <P>I have some experience in this area. Deputy Crawford was kind enough to mention that I introduced regulatory legislation in 1989. When the BSE crisis occurred we took immediate steps to ensure that the reputation of Irish beef would be protected. We introduced special slaughter premia at the highest level. We cleared out herds where even one case of BSE occurred. We had to do this to ensure that there would be no shadow of doubt over the Irish product on external markets when Britain was suffering an outbreak. As Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and as president of the Council of Ministers for Agriculture, I insisted that all European Ministers adhere to the same high standards. When so much was being done to protect Irish agriculture, it was regrettable that some people within the sector, because we were paying the top price for infected herds, saw the opportunity to make a quick killing by introducing infected animals into their herds.</P>
    <P>Is that not a terrible reflection on the nature of those who engaged in this activity and on their lack of awareness of their responsibility? I am glad only a very small minority were involved but it should not have happened and we should not have had to depend on inspectors of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to exercise control.</P>
    <P>This was followed by another outrageous distortion known euphemistically as 'angel dust', a term I did not use. I called it what it was &ndash; 'devil dust'. Those who engaged in this nefarious trade were a disgrace to Irish production at every level. It will not surprise the House to learn however, that when I introduced restrictions and penalties in 1990 to control veterinary medical products people said to me, &ldquo;Michéal [as I am known in my county] are you trying to commit political suicide by taking such strong action against those engaged in this nefarious activity?&rdquo; to which my response had to be, &ldquo;Don't worry about my pol<Col N="92" /> itical career, much more important is the success of this vitally important industry.&rdquo;  Again, only a small minority of primary producers were involved but they did untold damage to our reputation and the quality of our beef. This had to be eradicated and another reason those concerned, if they did not take responsibility, had to be regulated and controlled. For the first time I provided for terms of imprisonment but unfortunately the courts held that the heavy penalties prescribed which reflected my total revulsion for this activity could not be imposed in the District Court. As a consequence my successor introduced the 1993 legislation. Fifty seven people were convicted in 1996; 68 in 1997; 37 in 1998; 26 in 1999 and 1 so far this year in a industry which we all describe as our most important. This is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I had to promote the name and reputation of Irish beef wherever I went on promotions in the knowledge that some of those prominently engaged in the beef processing sector were encouraging farmers to use &lsquo;devil dust'. That was a disgrace, a let-down and a repudiation of any sense of national responsibility. On one occasion I called the entire sector together. They assumed that I wanted to talk to them about a new intervention protection mechanism but that was not what I wanted to talk to them about. What I wanted to tell them &ndash; this did not emerge until some years later and I feel free to say it now &ndash; was that they were not fit to be involved in the promotion of such an important sector. Ministers should not have to run a politburo or a police investigation for a sector which has a responsibility to itself. From time to time a Department and individuals within it may fail but the vast majority took their responsibilities very seriously. I vigorously support my successor who perhaps could not say what I have just said which is now history from which I hope we have learned. The vast majority of producers are honourable, genuinely concerned about transgressions and dependable in terms of the pride they take in what they do on their farms but there are others &ndash; when one lives in a rural constituency like the Leas-Chean Comhairle, Deputy Deasy, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, and I do one hears anecdotal evidence &ndash; who have no place in this important sector which they are seeking to undermine.</P>
    <P>Given the natural advantages we enjoy of climate and soil our beef sector is potentially the most cost efficient. We should be able to ensure the product we produce dominates every sophisticated consumer market in Europe and elsewhere, if necessary. Because of harsh winters the input costs of the Dutch, Danes and Germans are much higher, and they do not enjoy the same reputation or natural advantages. For this reason we should always be at the top of the league with the product we produce in constant demand.</P>
    <P>From what I had to say privately to the beef processing sector within the closed doors of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry about six months before I left it when I had to <Col N="93" /> dress down in the strongest possible terms those responsible for our single most important industry, one can imagine the constraints under which I was operating. I hope they have learned from it and we will never again hear about the need for a beef tribunal. Although investigations were being conducted at the time and there were consultations with the European Commission and the European Court of Auditors, someone somewhere had to find a political target even though everyone knew that was not the real target and despite the cost we are not very much wiser after the event. I was not in favour of the tribunal. I had my speech drafted in response to the motion tabled by Democratic Left in which I indicated the need to control, regulate, sanction and penalise, if necessary, and what we were doing to improve the position. About fifteen minutes before I went into the House I received a signal that if the Government was not to fall it was essential that there be a tribunal. I left my speech as it was but added two or three sentences, the first of which was, &ldquo;Nonetheless, lest it be suggested that I, as Minister, or the Government are in any way complicit in trying to cover up irregularities in the beef industry we have reluctantly agreed to accept this motion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My second sentence stated &ldquo;. reluctant, because tribunals have a habit of turning out very differently to what people expect of them&rdquo; which certainly proved to be the case. My third sentence stated, &ldquo;They last a lot longer and they cost a lot more.&rdquo;. I stated that I did not mind what costs were incurred provided the end result was a guarantee that the beef industry, of which we should all be proud and which many producers and some processors have worked hard to enhance and promote, would be vindicated.</P>
    <P>There is an old Irish saying, &ldquo;Go mbeadh toradh do shaoradh agat&rdquo;, that you may have the rewards of your efforts. Old Irish sayings often tend to be double-edged. If those efforts were positive, worthwhile and principled, the rewards would be great but if they were not, the rewards would be negative. I believe the majority of people in the sector, particularly at primary producer level, deserve to be treated better. I hope those engaged in the processing sector have learned a lesson. I am happy we now have a necessary level of transparency in the sector as a consequence of the Minister's intervention with the beef factories. If we are to have a healthy beef industry from primary producer level upwards, we must ensure producers are paid a fair and proper price at all times for their honest work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also prone to contributing to debates on agriculture, probably for the same reasons as those outlined by Deputy O'Kennedy. I feel I inhibit some of my predecessors and current spokespersons when I say we should take a more active part in these debates. It is unique to see two former Ministers for Agriculture speaking in succession and to see a Minister of the future sitting on the Government benches. <Col N="94" /> Deputy O'Keeffe has a wide experience of agriculture and is one of the most incisive individuals in the House. Doubtless, he will make the grade in the near future. I stated on local radio some weeks ago that many of the old hands should be dropped but that was not to be.</P>
      <P>Traceability is an important issue. If complaints arise about a product's origin, it is desirable that it can be traced. There is a raft of issues which must be addressed in the beef industry. This matter is complicated by the fact that Ireland is a major milk producer. Dairy herds create difficulties which are not readily recognised. With so much milk being produced, it is only common sense that the strain which enters the beef chain is often not a fully qualified beef strain but is intermingled with Friesian and Holstein breeds which do not produce optimum quality beef. We must recognise our shortcomings if we are to progress. I understand that only in the region of 30% of the beef produced in this country comes specifically from a wholly beef line. The remaining 70% is obviously of varying degrees of quality. That is a real difficulty.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinarily difficult to grade animals in Ireland. However, even where grading is in evidence, price differentials are not paid. People producing top grade beef cattle do not receive the bonus to which they are entitled. There are very few cattle in the U grade but even producers of the higher R grade do not receive the price differential. Until such time as we recognise the need to reward people for producing good quality beef cattle, we will continue to experience difficulties.</P>
      <P>The outcome of the recent dispute between the IFA and the meat processing plants may not be as clear-cut as it seems. The grading issue will become increasingly clouded. I envisage a situation whereby those with lesser quality animals will receive 90p per pound but producers of higher quality cattle will not receive any more than that. I fear meat factories will employ devices to ensure they retain the same level of profit by equalising the prices for various cattle grades. That is the type of activity of which the Minister and the Department should be cognisant. They must ensure there is no skulduggery when it comes to paying different prices for various grades of beef.</P>
      <P>There are many shortcomings in the beef industry and in farming in general. In many cases, these shortcomings have not been addressed. There is a high level of irregularities in the system and we failed to correct some of those when the opportunity existed to do so. I refer specifically to the beef tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The beef tribunal cost Irish taxpayers £40 million and resulted in a few managers and sub-managers of a meat plant in Rathkeale in County Limerick being brought before the courts and fined. I believe one person may have been imprisoned or may have received a suspended sentence. Major figures in the beef industry should have been severely penalised for the irregularities which were discovered during the course of that <Col N="95" /> tribunal. The tribunal's outcome was unsatisfactory as far as the public and many Members were concerned in that its findings were not decisive. Many of the ills currently besetting the industry could have been eradicated had the tribunal carried out the task it was supposed to by virtue of the motion tabled in this House.</P>
    <P>I recall a tribunal which followed the explosion of an oil tanker off Whiddy Island in Bantry Bay in 1979. The tribunal's chairman was Mr. Justice Declan Costello. After months of hearing evidence, Mr. Justice Costello concluded that the people who were supposed to be on duty protecting the terminal in case of accidents were not on duty, they were miles away. Mr. Justice Costello deduced that they had committed perjury. A number of them were convicted on that ground and one received a jail sentence. That was a decisive result.</P>
    <P>Such decisive action was lacking in the beef tribunal, which went to the core of the abuses occurring daily in the industry. There were no recommendations for prosecutions. There should have been prosecutions and long jail sentences, which would happen in any other country, but in Ireland we have the brilliant solution of getting away with it. That should not be the case. I hope that as a result of the McCracken tribunal, the Flood and Moriarty tribunals will be decisive and the guilty will pay the penalty. The issues should not be swept under the carpet. The public is fed up. The beef tribunal sickened most people and they will not stand for it again.</P>
    <P>The illegal practices to which I referred inhibit the proper organisation of the industry. These include the illegal of movement of cattle from infected herds, the switching of tags &ndash; which is commonplace &ndash; and shoddy testing. One of the most hurtful things I had to do when I was Minister for Agriculture &ndash; although one has to do one's duty for the general good, similar to a garda serving a summons &ndash; was to fire vets from the TB testing scheme because they were not testing properly and were arrogant. Occasionally they or members of their families would abuse me for the sackings. These matters must be kept under control. Officials in the Departments and vets are, by and large, brilliant. However, there is an element which bring practices into disrepute. Last week a veterinary official was convicted of malpractice. We should not tolerate anything which affects the quality of the herd. Such events are publicised and reported abroad. Embassies have attachés who report activities which are not above board to their ministries for agriculture and consumers.</P>
    <P>We have enough trouble with the countries with whom we are competing. Our beef industry has suffered considerably because of the BSE scare which began four or five years ago. Australia, South America and the United States have benefited enormously from our misfortune. Our markets in the Middle East have, by and large, been taken over by these countries. There should be more of a public debate on this. We have been <Col N="96" /> unjustifiably tarred with the same brush as others. The prevalence of BSE in our herds is so slight that it does not constitute a danger to the food chain, particularly to those eating beef. However, our competitors have taken advantage of this. We seem to have lost the four big Middle Eastern markets &ndash; Libya, Iran, Iraq and Egypt. I do not hear much about them. We are occasionally told they are being reopened.</P>
    <P>Poor quality livestock needs to be eliminated because it does not make the grade. It is also a serious problem for our beef industry. Another serious problem is the removal of export refunds and intervention &ndash; the two traditional safety nets. It is no longer as simple to sell meat to third countries which were once our major markets.</P>
    <P>Hormones are another area of abuse &ndash; angel dust has been referred to. The public will not appreciate the contradictory, and from our point of view, unsatisfactory, position. In the United States of America there is widespread use of hormones which are banned in the EU. These hormones, which naturally occur in cattle, particularly in bullocks and bulls, produce leaner meat. They can also be synthetically manufactured. The US has no quibbles about using such hormones, thereby producing much better quality beef than we can do naturally. It is unfortunate that because of the abuse of hormones on the Continent in the 1970s and 1980s, there is an antipathy towards them. I remember a German minister saying we could use them at our peril because he would tell his people not to eat our beef if we did so. They knew the US was using them but that was not their problem, they were in the EU. If we used them, our beef would not be welcome in their country. In Italy in the 1970s and 1980s, people were deformed because of the use of hormones.</P>
    <P>Beef treated with hormones is being imported into the EU. It is competing with our beef and we cannot use the same hormones which produce better quality beef. Where is the justice in that? The recent World Trade Organisation talks, which were known as the GATT negotiations, in Seattle were abandoned. Those talks mean we will be more susceptible to competition from world markets &ndash; beef from the United States, South America, Australia and New Zealand. They farm ranches of tens of thousands of acres and can produce huge quantities at a lower price than us. When the WTO talks conclude and we have, as I suspect, a level playing pitch, towards which we have been gradually moving since the talks in Uruguay ten years ago, we will be competing with people selling quality beef to Europe at 50p or 60p a pound. That is not readily recognised here.</P>
    <P>At Question Time about two months ago, I said that the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development should have attended those talks to fight our corner. If any country in the world has freedom of access to import goods we produce and upon which we depend, we should not be members of the EU. Our one major <Col N="97" /> advantage is that we have access to an enclosed market. We export 80% of the beef we produce. If there is open competition, we will be at a serious disadvantage. It will suit the British, French and Germans who produce consumer goods and will be able to sell more on world markets. They will not have any embargoes or tariffs but we will. We are not producing consumer goods.</P>
    <P>We will suffer because our agricultural products will be under siege from producers who have huge areas of land, produce huge amounts of beef and who are using hormones we are prohibited from using. This is very difficult. I read recently that the Department was sued for millions of pounds &ndash; it had to pay millions more because of its ineptitude &ndash; by a trading company in Dublin called Emerald. The High Court ruled against the Department which decided to appeal the case rather than pay the compensation. As a result the costs accumulated. Imported beef does not have to undergo the stringent tests our beef must undergo. We talk about the traceability of Irish beef but is there traceability of imported beef? I believe this traceability is nil, it does not exist.</P>
    <P>We have many inhibitions about our beef, much of which is too fat because of interbreeding of dairy herds. Many people will not eat fat meat. On the Continent people resist having any fat in meat. That makes it difficult to sell. There is the additional factor of heart disease and the medical profession advises people not to eat red meat, particularly beef. This makes it very difficult for beef farmers, therefore we need to ensure the skullduggery and malpractice is stamped out, whether within the factories, by jobbers, people who are moving cattle illegally and not testing cattle or by people who are selling low quality meat under the guise of good quality beef. There were many examples of this during the beef tribunal. Boxes of rubbish were being sold as prime beef, giving Irish beef a bad name. These are difficult times for the beef industry, therefore we must ensure that everything is done by the book and that there are not shoddy practices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Coughlan.</P>
      <P>It is timely to have a debate on this Bill which gives us an opportunity to discuss the beef industry in general. Over the past 15 or 20 years the beef industry has gone through a difficult and turbulent time. In the past we made a fatal error in that we depended too much on intervention and live exports. We are now suffering because we did not have a proper policy in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of factors must be borne in mind. We are mainly a dairy producing country and, by and large, the dairy cow provides the vast majority of animals taken into the beef farming sector and thereafter into slaughtering or for live export. This cannot continue in the same vein as at present. Dairy farmers must make a profit and one means of increasing their yield per acre and ensuring they are efficient is to introduce the <Col N="98" /> Holstein breed. This is beginning to happen throughout the country, particularly in the south. For this reason, we must be aware that a large percentage of our raw material is not suitable as high quality beef which the European consumer demands.</P>
    <P>We have been encouraging live exports and dumping beef on Third World markets. This is why we are in the present dilemma. The Bill will go a long way towards restoring confidence within the beef sector. However, if we do not have the proper raw material to market and sell abroad, this Bill will be just aspirations. There is an urgent need to address the problems of the basic raw material entering into the beef industry. Great efforts were made some years ago to increase the suckler herd. By and large, that has assisted, particularly in the western seaboard and midland areas where there is not large-scale dairy production, in ensuring that there is a raw material for dairy farmers. However, this is not enough. We must look at our breeding policy and address how we can get prime quality cattle. Deputy Deasy mentioned that up to 70% of the finished product comes from dairy herds. There is no doubt that the vast majority of that 70% would have a trace of Holstein type blood. This is one area which must be addressed, but it will be difficult. Perhaps we should have a slaughtering out policy or something to ensure low quality beef is not entering the market at the top end of the scale because this undermines producers of top quality beef.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to the grading of cattle. We must ensure there is a large discrepancy in the price paid to those producing top quality beef and those producing beef for the sake of it because they have the raw material on their farms. Grading and pricing of top quality beef must be addressed. I have noticed looking at the various grades from U to R to O, that very often the discrepancy is not large enough to encourage a beef farmer to pay the premium amount for a weanling or yearling, because they know they will not recoup the money when the product is finished.</P>
    <P>On marketing, if we are serious about obtaining a higher price for our beef farmers, we must go aggressively after the European markets. For too long our policy has been dependent on the third world market and on exporting on the hoof. Up to 80% of our steer beef currently goes to Third World markets. The projection is that beef consumption in the European Union will increase by between 1% and 1.5%. This is a golden opportunity for us. We will have the national beef quality assurance scheme in place. We will be able to guarantee traceability. We will be able to guarantee quality for a certain percentage of our product. The large conurbations of Europe are the markets we should be targeting aggressively where we will be able to convince these people that we have a quality product. If we are to differentiate between ordinary and quality beef in the market, we must ensure there <Col N="99" /> is a large-scale discrepancy between the price of U, R and O grades of beef.</P>
    <P>On the issue of traceability, at the end of the day we can have all the regulations and precautions in place but farmers have the ultimate responsibility in this regard. In the past we did untold damage to farmers as a result individuals being involved in illegal transportation of animals from herds infected with TB and brucellosis. They removed tags and sold the animals. There was the debacle in relation to &lsquo;angel dust'. I appeal to the farming community to report rogue elements to the relevant authorities, because until such time as we have stamped out any rogue elements within the primary production sector, there will always be headlines in the national papers about &lsquo;angel dust', BSE, TB and brucellosis. Farmers and farming organisations have a responsibility to ensure that they adhere to the National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill when it is enacted. If necessary, they should educate some of their members in this regard.</P>
    <P>We must look in-depth at the issue of slaughtering facilities. I have been of the opinion for a long time that we must rationalise, streamline and ensure there is an efficient slaughtering system in place. There are too many plants for too few animals.</P>
    <P>There is much leakage there and, at the end of the day, the primary producer picks up the cost of this inefficiency. There is much work to be done to ensure there is confidence, proper marketing and that beef farmers who produce quality beef have an opportunity to make a living from it.</P>
    <P>I wonder about the level of traceability in the rest of the European Union. I am deeply concerned that beef is coming from countries outside the EU into the United Kingdom in particular. What level of traceability exists in that regard? This issue must be addressed at EU level and at the world trade talks. If we are serious about protecting consumers and guaranteeing quality beef, irrespective of its origin, the primary option of anybody involved in the beef industry is to encourage people to eat beef. The market can be fought over among ourselves afterwards. If beef is coming in from the States or Argentina and its quality and traceability cannot be guaranteed, some consumers will always have concerns about beef. This will undermine confidence. This issue must be taken on board and addressed to ensure the origin of beef on European shelves can be traced. It must be possible to trace from where it came and from what type of animal and that no feed additives or hormones were used in its production.</P>
    <P>I was in a Chinese take away recently and I asked for a fillet of beef in black bean sauce and fried rice. I was told they did not have fillets of beef because they were too expensive. I inquired further and was told they used only ordinary beef now because the prices would have to be increased if they used fillets of beef. Farmers and <Col N="100" /> consumers cannot understand that. There is still a problem because consumers are paying top dollar for beef but farmers are receiving bottom dollar. Either somebody in between is making lots of money or the system is so inefficient that a large amount of money is being lost. This area must be addressed.</P>
    <P>There is much talk about the ability to trace from the stable to the table. However, there is a blockage in the system between the stable and the table. Rationalisation of slaughtering facilities would address some of the problem, but there is a difficulty with regard to the transparency issue that arose recently during the IFA blockade of meat factories. The prices were increased immediately and there were allegations of cartels and undercutting. It was also alleged that beef producers were dumping beef on Third World markets. I do not know the correct position but there is a definite problem with regard to the price paid to farmers and the price paid by consumers.</P>
    <P>There has been a large increase in the number of live exports, particularly yearlings, to Spain and elsewhere in recent years. At the final stage, their price is 10% to 15%, and in some cases 20% to 30%, higher than what farmers can get in Ireland for the same animals. The only difference is that their animals may have been fed in feed lots while the Irish animals have been fed mainly grass. However, the raw material is the same. There is much work to do in Ireland. The Minister is trying to develop markets in the European context and that is where he must be particularly aggressive. It is no longer acceptable to depend on the safety valve of live exports and hope a Third World market will take our beef for a reasonable price. We must guarantee quality and traceability. We must also guarantee that the farmer, who ultimately carries the can for everybody else, at least has an opportunity to make a living from this important industry which is worth more than £1 billion.</P>
    <P>Regarding the dairy herd, if we are ever to ensure that quality beef is exported to high paying consumer markets in Europe, we must consider some mechanism to get the Holstein type steer out of the equation. They are flooding the market and putting too much downward pressure on the price paid to suckler farmers who are producing high quality beef. Another aspect which will cause damage in the long-term is that the best yearlings and calves are leaving the country. High quality animals that can be taken to the slaughtering stage and onto the European market are not available.</P>
    <P>I raise these issues from my perspective as a dairy and beef farmer but also as a consumer and an avid supporter of the beef industry. The problem in Chinese take aways must be addressed because it is indicative of a larger problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Ms Coughlan Ms Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is an opportunity to <Col N="101" /> reflect on the industry and look forward to the challenges which face us, particularly in rescuing markets we unfortunately lost and trying to increase consumer confidence in the beef sector. The legislation is crucial to the future of the food industry and it reflects the commitment of the Minister, the Minister of State and the Government to quality and the industry.</P>
      <P>I am not a farmer but I represent a constituency with small farms. We have endured major losses in the last number of years because of the inability to export to third markets. This has had a detrimental effect on small farmers in particular. I agree with my colleagues' concerns about the breeding stock. Ireland must consider the future of agriculture. Increasing profits to the detriment of traditional farmers and consumers must stop. The dairy herd is not a beef herd and, therefore, I agree that something must be done to remove the dairy herd breed from the beef industry. It is not good enough to try to sell bad quality beef even to a third country. The industry should develop high quality beef production and sell it on that basis.</P>
      <P>The impasse in recent weeks involving the factories reflected the abject frustration of farmers. Obviously, there was not transparency from the stable to the table. As a mother who goes to the butcher every Saturday to shop, I cannot understand how the price of two or three pieces of beef almost equals the price of the animal at the mart. Something is seriously wrong in that regard and it must be addressed from the point of view of consumers and an economic perspective.</P>
      <P>The Bill will help credibility and consumer expectations which must be safeguarded. Ultimately, the health of the people must be safeguarded in addition to the economic aspects from a farming perspective. Unfortunately, there was a serious health problem in my county when a woman died from CJD. When one reflects on that, one sees the harm people have done to the industry through greed.</P>
      <P>It may not be malicious, but they have introduced hormones and bad feed through greed and people have died as a consequence. That has to be stopped and this is an opportunity to introduce safeguards through traceability and to encourage consumer confidence. This is the first Bill to give such assurance and similar legislation should be introduced throughout the EU, as we must have a level playing field. If the US and South America can use hormones and compete with our farmers we do not have a level playing field. Unless we have a quality mark and can make consumers aware of that quality we will not be able to compete with lower prices, as some people simply see it as a matter of having leaner meat. The challenges are there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Traceability, safeguarding consumer confidence and the other aims of the Bill will support an industry which will have to take a serious look at itself. It will have to work with Bord Bia and the Department to ensure there is quality control and that there is independence and credibility. <Col N="102" /> Only then will we be able to get a higher price for better quality in the marketplace. Last week I met people from abroad who only buy prime cuts &ndash; sirloin and fillet &ndash; from Ireland; they are not prepared to buy anything else. We must also look at accessing other markets, particularly in larger stores in the European Community. That opportunity has been lost due to the crisis in the meat factories. Assurances have been given by this legislation, though we need a more aggressive marketing policy and we must also educate the consumer, particularly in Europe. These are discerning consumers who will buy quality if it can be guaranteed. This legislation should be reflected in the other EU producer countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Perry and Farrelly. I welcome the general thrust of this legislation, particularly in an era when traditional agriculture, as we have known it for 30 years, is changing rapidly. It is no longer the case with traditional farming enterprises that a producer is guaranteed a solid income across the board in most enterprises. The Minister of State will know well that there are problems with the margins of profitability in most farming enterprises, apart from milk, that will have to be confronted. The beef industry has gone through a very difficult time since 1996, when the outbreak of BSE hit beef producers very hard and it is only now beginning to come back to an even keel. Bord Bia recently published figures showing food and drink exports amounting to £5 billion in 1999, representing an increase of 6.3% in the growth in value in the previous 12 months. However, looking closely at the figures, one notices that our beef consumer product exports to the UK, one of our biggest markets, have not recovered to the same extent in comparison with other continental markets and the 1995 figures. That is a huge consumer market of 60 million people on our doorstep and it is probably the cheapest market for us in terms of transport. We still have a major task to convince them that Irish beef is safe. I do not doubt that when an information campaign about the national beef assurance scheme is launched in the UK there will be a further recovery in exports.</P>
      <P>I welcome the thrust of the legislation, as the consumer will be king, whether we like it or not. Producers must face up to that. The process whereby producers could do anything in presenting their product or in sending it to the factory is no longer acceptable. Generally speaking, farmers have realised that in recent years and have been gearing themselves up for change with cattle breeds and in the way they have presented cattle to the factories. Matters have improved enormously in Ireland to meet that consumer demand, but the BSE crisis was an example of how matters can get out of kilter very quickly in terms of consumer confidence, as was the Belgian experience, where consumption of meat products was seriously affected by an outbreak of disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the role of the Irish European Com<Col N="103" /> missioner, David Byrne, as he can help this country when addressing the food and health authority issues with which he is charged. We are fortunate to have a Commissioner in that position, as we are an agricultural exporting country in which producers and others employed in the industry are very dependent on our huge amount of exports. The Commissioner can play a leading role in ensuring we find further markets and this legislation will be of assistance to him in saying that Ireland is leading the way in traceability from calf to the finished product &ndash; we will know exactly where the product has come from and how it has gone through the process. The roguery attached to a minority of cases over the years, whether at producer or meat factory level, is gone once and for all and we now have legislative teeth to deal with people effectively. The rogues in agriculture who gave the industry a bad name will no longer be with us and there will be penalties to deal with people effectively. A small number of people cannot be allowed to damage the good name of the beef industry or other agricultural product in the way some have tried to over the years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the transparency that will be required in all aspects of the industry. It is a price we must pay to keep the consumer happy. One matter that bedevils all of us is the question of why the price of beef in the butcher's is relatively high when the producer's price is going down. That matter should be fast tracked to the committee established to deal with the difficulties farmers had with the meat industry and a proper explanation should be sought. There should still be a margin of profitability for the middleman, and butchers in particular, but consumers are not benefiting to the extent they should.</P>
    <P>The provision whereby non-compliant farmers must go to the Circuit Court is a very draconian measure, as 99% of those in farming will want to do the right thing. The Circuit Court may ultimately just be a threat, but there should be an appeals system independent of the Department. I do not have great confidence in the manner in which the vets who operate for the Department will deal with an appeal by a farmer. They all know each other in the business and will not let down colleagues. Farmers will not be happy with a system whereby an appeal is decided by a Department vet in respect of a decision made by another Department vet. Effectively we are talking about putting a farmer out of business if he does not comply with the regulations and the law applicable under this scheme. We are talking about a licence to farm and it is a serious issue. If we are going down the road of putting a farmer out of business due to non-compliance with this legislation we must be satisfied that no collusion takes place in any sector of the agriculture industry, whether in the Department or in farming. There must be fairness and independence in the application of the decision. In the case of an <Col N="104" /> appeal, that should be decided outside the Department.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Connaughton who said animal inspections under this scheme should be carried out on the same day as TB testing. Farmers cannot have a Department vet carry out TB testing one week and a few weeks later be expected to do likewise in relation to compliance with the national beef assurance scheme. The Department should take that matter on board.</P>
    <P>On the question of traceability under the scheme, there is a huge problem with tags on animals. All public representatives dealing with various premia schemes come across a problem with tags. I hope a proper tagging system can be provided, otherwise the current tagging system will cause problems in regard to traceability.</P>
    <P>I welcome the thrust of the Bill, the purpose of which is to improve transparency in the scheme with a view to keeping the consumer happy. I hope the national beef assurance scheme will do that. I hope the Minister will take on board a few reservations on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Farrelly. I welcome many aspects of the Bill. However, recent events have undermined public confidence in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Minister's words alone are not enough. There must be a real effort by him and his Department to relaunch the image of the quality of Irish beef.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a few remarks from the point of view of the retailer, an area in which I have some expertise. I employ three butchers in our supermarket in Ballymote. Retailers are at the cutting edge of the meat trade. We meet the customer and have to make considerable investment to meet the ISO standards which the customer expects. We are acutely conscious of the need for consistency and quality in one of our main export products. There is also grave inconsistency. Due to the dairy based nature of the breeding herd, for whatever reason, the number of cattle achieving high grades in meat factories is appallingly low. This is reflected on the meat shelves abroad. We are dealing with a major wholesaler who has a niche market. He does not go to the cattle marts but has nominated suppliers. The feed which farmers give to their beef stock is totally regulated. On the question of fillet raised by Deputy Kelleher, in a 550 lbs carcase there would be about 10 lbs of fillet at most. Perhaps that explains its price.</P>
      <P>The low level of grading, particularly in factories, was part of the reason for the IFA protest over prices. I strongly urge the Minister to implement immediately a quality breeding programme to enable us promote the product the Minister tells the world we can produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the recent IFA protest it was alleged that farmers were being ripped off by meat factories and retailers alike. I cannot speak for the meat factories who are ably represented elsewhere but I wish to make it clear that retailers <Col N="105" /> operate on a modest margin given the amount of wastage and overheads which they carry. It may come as a surprise to the House that the average gross margin on meat for most retailers &ndash; from an opening stock and a closing stock at a meat counter weekly &ndash; would be very successful at 27%. That would be a satisfactory margin on a retail operation of any butcher outlet. There is a view that butchers are ripping off the system and that they are getting double the margin when beef is sold at 95p per lb. How can one equate that with sirloin steak at £3.99 per lb? It is very simple. Let us take the various cuts, from the cheapest at 99p per lb up to £3.99 per lb. On an opening and closing stock &ndash; I could show my books &ndash; we operate on a margin of 27% &ndash; many have a much lower margin. It is a very expensive business to run when one has to pay butchers from £300 to £350 per week. A major investment is required to run an efficient well-managed butcher outlet in a supermarket or as a separate stand-alone butcher shop. I am not complaining about the system but, on balance, the customer receives a good service from the victuallers. They are not being ripped off, they get a wide choice of product.</P>
    <P>Retail prices in Ireland for fresh meat are lower than inflation and are considerably lower than in the UK and Europe. The mergers review group has recommended the removal of the 1987 groceries order. That would be a major mistake and I appeal to the Minister to retain that order. It has allowed huge investment by butchers and retailers over recent years of £600 million. If we intend to promote the quality of Irish beef we must realise there is a considerable number of retailers who deal directly with farmers on agreed terms. Few butchers go to meat factories to buy beef for resale in this country. Several Deputies referred to the inconsistency. Butchers who want to retain customers do business with farmers on a niche market basis and Deputy D'Arcy will bear this out. A huge number of farmers who give the exact feed have joined buying groups and deal directly with a wholesaler. This ensures a quality product. If that type of control was introduced for meat factories and beef exports, the quality would be considerably improved. An Bord Bia is doing a considerable job but we must ensure the quality of beef heifers going into the factories is what is labelled on the box.</P>
    <P>I will be amazed if the Tánaiste's inquiry reveals higher margins than 27% for retailers, whether in supermarkets or butcher outlets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the beef industry. The introduction of a national beef assurance scheme is welcome. No industry has been spoken about more in the past ten years than this one. As one who has been in the business of finishing cattle, what has happened in the midlands is that the dairy herd owners who commenced finishing cattle in the late 1980s left a shortage of top quality product such as calves and stores for beef finishers. As a <Col N="106" /> result the beef finishers have gone out of business in recent years. If we are serious about improving the quality of beef, some of the following actions should be taken. In the past ten years the Minister and the Department have done nothing to improve it in any respect &ndash; I say that sincerely.</P>
      <P>The reform of the CAP and the negotiations on Agenda 2000 approving across the board subsidies for dairy type bull animals was the biggest mistake made in the EU. There should have been a subsidy to take those animals out of the system at an early age. The EU subsidy proposals, including the beef cow subsidy and the subsidy available to producers, regardless of whether they produce good or bad animals, are responsible for a major part of the problem we face today. The figure indicating that 70% of animals are exported to Third World countries proves that too many poor quality cattle are being produced and that the incentive is to produce numbers, regardless of the quality of the finished product.</P>
      <P>There is no incentive to produce good quality cattle and this state of affairs has left a huge glut on the market. In consequence, farmers get a poor price for their animals. A grant should be available to purchasers of top quality bulls and subsidies should not be paid to Holstein calves. The KK Club quality production methods, which are used in the Kepak plant, are very successful and they should be applied across the country. The producers involved are getting a high price for their top quality products.</P>
      <P>What guarantee have we that the beef imported into Europe is certified? We are not being given any assurances in this regard. The playing pitch is not level. Natural hormones, which remove fat, are used in other countries and I have not been convinced that their use in beef here has ever done any serious damage. The Minister should provide the House with a report on the effects of natural hormones if they were to be used here and throughout the EU. This is important, given that the beef produced from their use in other countries and in feed lots around the world is imported into the EU.</P>
      <P>There is a huge amount of work to be done. In conjunction with the beef factories and the producers the Minister and his Department should agree on and introduce a scheme that will eliminate a substantial percentage of the poor quality cattle produced in the country.</P>

      <P>This Bill was introduced on 29 June last year, yet almost eight months later it has not yet completed Second Stage in the Dáil. That hardly indicates any great sense of urgency. Since last June the full BSE figures for 1999 have been released. Unfortunately, they are the highest ever for a year, while the January 2000 figure appears to be the highest ever for a single month. This does not suggest that the problem is going away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The convention in the House is to describe Irish beef as of superb quality and a premium product fit for the gods. The truth is more mun<Col N="107" /> dane. There have been numerous rejections of Irish beef in foreign markets over the years, either because its quality was not up to the mark or because it did not meet the specifications contracted for. These deficiencies were, by and large, the responsibility of the processors exporting the meat.</P>
    <P>Another more general problem that we fail to recognise is that much of our beef is not of good quality because it is not bred for that purpose. A high proportion of our calves are born as a by-product of the dairy industry and, consequently, they do not turn into quality beef animals. One cannot win the Derby with a horse bred to win the Grand National.</P>
    <P>Last October, four months after the introduction of the Bill, what was described as &ldquo;canned beef in juice&rdquo; was put on retail sale here more than two and a half years after its &ldquo;best by&rdquo; date. I was informed by the Minister that this product was originally produced for the Russian market in 1993-94. It was apparently rejected there and sent back to Ireland. Several years later it was put on the retail market here. When this canned produce was analysed by the Teagasc laboratory it was found not to be beef but in excess of 98.5% pigmeat.

      <P>The can is marked &ldquo;Department of Agriculture, Ireland, inspected and passed.&rdquo; I quote from the label on the can.  This product is described as &ldquo;canned beef in juice&rdquo;, yet it consists almost entirely of mechanically retrieved pigmeat. In view of this could the certification on it be described as quality beef assurance?</P>
      <P>How could anybody rely on a Department that inspected and passed this so-called can of beef to operate a national beef assurance scheme? Apart from the damage to the home market, I invite the Minister of State to consider the damage done to the Russian market. Russia is a very large country with large Muslim and Jewish minorities of many millions of people. They are strictly forbidden by their respective religions to eat pork but they eat beef. If they bought this or similar cans produced for that market and relied on the certificate by the &ldquo;Department of Agriculture, Ireland&rdquo; they would have been very seriously misled. They would have been upset, not only from a food or health point of view, but in a far more fundamental way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither the Minister nor his Department exhibited any great public concern about this matter when it was raised publicly. The company which produced this canned pigmeat and described it as canned beef placed advertisements in the newspapers withdrawing it. As far as I am aware that is all that happened. I then wrote to the EU Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection in the hope the Commission would do something more about the matter than the Irish authorities. <Col N="108" /> The Commissioner replied to me by way of a letter dated 22 December 1999. It states:</P>
    <P>Dear Des,</P>
    <P>Thank you for your letter of 17 November 1999 concerning the placing on the market of a special meat product.</P>
    <P>Use of mechanically recovered meat is not forbidden in the production of meat products by Community legislation. Of course the product has to be properly labelled so that the buyer has a clear idea of what he is buying and is not misled.</P>
    <P>From the account given in your letter, it would appear that the marketing of the product violated the applicable rules and appropriate action should be taken by the Irish authorities. The eligibility of this product to payment of export refunds is also questionable in the circumstances outlined in your letter. I understand this is the subject of investigations by the relevant services in the Commission and that the Irish authorities have been contacted in the matter.</P>
    <P>Thank you for bringing this matter to my attention.</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P>David Byrne.</P>
    <P>I received that letter some time in early January. I understand from the Minister that export refunds were paid by his Department in a sizeable sum on these cans of pigmeat. The export refunds were paid on the basis that what was being exported to Russia was beef. I do not know whether the Minister has asked the company concerned to refund the export refunds or whether it has done so voluntarily now that it has been caught. I do not know what other action, if any, has been taken against the company concerned. Going on previous experience, I think it is extremely unlikely that action will be taken as beef processors are virtually immune from either prosecution or civil action by the Department when they break the law. Where the Department and the Minister have been shamed into taking action in a small number of cases, it has sometimes been as long as six years after the event before the action started. Truthfully, can we have any reliance that what is described in the Bill as a national beef assurance scheme will be properly and fearlessly implemented?</P>
    <P>Another matter has recently come to light which calls into question one's reliance on a beef assurance scheme of the kind envisaged in the Bill. That is the recent conviction in the Circuit Criminal Court of a senior veterinary inspector in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, who resigned from the Department and finally pleaded guilty to some of the charges against him. These included the fact that he sold, for £3,000, a full pad of signed and stamped blank veterinary health certificates which could be used to prove to a customer that animals exported were of Irish origin and in good <Col N="109" /> health. These certificates were to be used to export cattle of UK origin, the export of which was prohibited by EU regulations. The man concerned received a short prison sentence. The crime to which he pleaded guilty was of the utmost seriousness and was really an act of national treachery. Apparently, at an earlier stage, this man had resigned from the Department to go into the meat processing industry, but that venture failed. The Department was apparently unwilling to take him back, but was forced to do so by a ministerial order.</P>
    <P>We have never had a satisfactory explanation from the Minister or the Department about the appearance in a meat factory in Nenagh some time ago of cattle which the Garda were satisfied had come from across the Border. Earlier in the 1990s evidence was adduced at the beef tribunal about the larceny of beef, which was the property of the Commission, in Rathkeale in connection with a canning project on behalf of the Commission for free distribution of beef in Russia. The prime cuts were removed from the meat, which was the property of the Commission, and cheap hearts and other offal was substituted in the cans. The Department has still, apparently, not recovered the amount involved, which is approaching £2 million, that was the subject of this larceny by the company concerned, although almost nine years has elapsed since the time the beef was stolen.</P>
    <P>I would love to think that a scheme such as that envisaged in the Bill would actually work, but unless there is a marked change of heart I cannot be very confident. I keep reminding myself of the Department's attitude to the forgery of the Bureau Veritas certificates, their attitude to the forgery of the Hibernia health certificate, the fraudulent changes made in the CBF letter by an official in the Department, the forgeries by the Department in the Emerald Meats case and various other matters which one could set out at some length.</P>
    <P>When I consider all these in the context of the Bill I ask if the Minister can assure us that there will, at long last, be a change of heart and a change of policy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>As a farmer and a Deputy I cautiously welcome the introduction of this Bill which is aimed at ensuring a higher quality product is produced by beef farmers and a proper traceability mechanism is implemented for the industry. The beef industry has been through very difficult times in the past five years. Perhaps beef is the most crucial sector in terms of the survival of the agriculture industry, simply because so many farmers and families rely on beef for their income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="110" /> In order for the Bill to be successfully implemented, farmers must accept it as worthwhile and of benefit to them in the medium and long-term. Beef farmers have always been best at the technical side of farming and production &ndash;  grazing and feeding systems, animal husbandry, methods of production, grading cattle etc. In general, farmers have never been particularly good at considering marketing and its importance. The Bill will attempt to ensure that primary producers, that is, farmers and processors, will play a greater part in making the marketing of Irish beef as effective as possible abroad.</P>
    <P>A mechanism is being established which will reassure customers regarding the safety of Irish beef, which will hopefully lead to an increase in commercial trading in the product by opening new markets and expanding existing markets. In one sense it is not a particularly good time to be introducing new quality control and traceability measures as farmers are under enough pressure. However, to put off the introduction of the Bill for that reason would be very short-sighted and narrow-minded. If farmers are to receive more for their product, new and more profitable markets must be found. As the Minister is aware, we export the vast majority of the beef we produce and are, therefore, almost entirely reliant on export markets for the success of the beef industry. In 1996 the BSE crisis resulted in the loss of certain markets, as did the economic problems in Russia which followed. We have yet to recover many of the markets we lost over the past few years, particularly the continental markets where higher margins can be made and the live export trade to the Middle East, particularly Libya and Egypt.</P>
    <P>The basic principle around increasing value and sales of a product is to ensure that exactly what the customer wants is produced. Inside and outside Europe customers insist on quality, traceability and consistency of supply. I hope the Bill will ensure that traceability will be accurate and detailed. A buyer of Irish meat or live cattle should, if they wish, have the facility to examine the line of production back to the farmyard through the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. He should be able to look at the conditions of production and ask whether the animal was properly cared for, the environmental conditions in which it was raised, the medication used, feeding policy etc. This is about increasing the professionalism of beef production and building an international reputation for a quality product.</P>
    <P>Of course there will be pain before gain for farmers. In real terms the Bill must increase purchaser confidence. Libya and Egypt still refuse to buy Irish beef due to the BSE scare. Perhaps this Bill will ease their concerns. European markets, particularly in France and Germany, are also targets where higher margins can be made.</P>
    <P>So far I have complimented the Bill in many ways. However, I wish to point out some limitations and errors in it. First, I wish to stress that <Col N="111" /> the introduction of the Bill effectively means farmers will need a licence to produce beef. If beef producers do not comply with the beef assurance scheme their herd number could be withdrawn. We must ensure, through amendments if necessary, that farmers are not overly penalised in the Bill. There are farmers, particularly those who are elderly, who may have difficulty in adjusting to the new assurance measures, and this must be taken into account by providing an adjustment period for change in assurance requirements. If this does not happen we will be taking away an individual's licence to farm because of perhaps genuine mistakes.</P>
    <P>Second, we should not be under any illusions that the scheme will result in a dramatic improvement in beef quality. It is about traceability, not quality, and all of us are aware that to improve quality our breeding policy must be examined seriously and some tough decisions taken on it.</P>
    <P>The Bill must have a positive impact on the consumer, and not just on farmers, yet it completely fails to have such an impact. Several provisions and penalties which will be imposed on offenders are outlined. However, these only apply to primary producers. Consumer safety is imperative and, therefore, regulation must also apply to wholesale and retail trade. Regulating farmers and processors cannot guarantee a safe final product, particularly when others products can be imported, thus avoiding regulation, and the consumer cannot be sure about what he is eating.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much welcome the Bill. I am little worried, having listened to my good friend, Deputy O'Malley, about the performance of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. However, I have more confidence in it than he apparently does, and I hope that it will implement the Bill fully when it is enacted. Very little time has been allocated to debate the Bill, even though it was introduced last June. I do not relish speaking for only six or seven minutes, but we must operate within Standing Orders.</P>
      <P>We cannot lose sight of the fact that 80% of our beef kill is exported annually and we must gear ourselves towards that. Despite the turmoil in the beef industry in recent weeks and a downward spiral in beef prices since the BSE crisis, beef production continues to contribute significantly to overall agricultural production and to the economy. Over recent years Ireland has targeted the more lucrative European markets with its produce to avoid dependence on less stable world markets which also provide a lower return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, access to these lucrative markets, particularly in Italy and Holland, places high demands on the beef sector. To qualify for such markets Irish carcases need to grade E, U, R, 1, 2, 3 and 4L. In 1997 21.4% of the national kill met the demands of the European markets. This <Col N="112" /> figure reduced to 17.1% in 1998 and increased to 21.1% in 1999 and that is disturbing. The Italian market requires E, U, R, 2, 3, 4 while the Dutch market requires E, U, R, 2, 3, 4L. While it is heartening that there was an increase in the proportion of the national kill that met market requirements in 1999, the figure is still low. We need to plan to increase it to at least 50%. However, the short-term outlook for achieving this goal is not good because of live exports and flat rate pricing.</P>
    <P>Over the past two years there has been unprecedented growth in the export of quality calves, which contributed to the fall in animal numbers in 1999. This export of young stock will hit our ability to supply lucrative European markets in the future. There has also been a gradual shift towards paying for quality, which has resulted in the increased proportion grading well. However, the recent resolution of the farmers' dispute with the meat processors, which concentrated on achieving a minimum price for grade O, 4 cattle, may result in a return to flat rate pricing as factories try to offset the O grade price increase by reducing payments for better grades.</P>
    <P>Breed and slaughter weights will continue to be the main factors at our disposal for ensuring the production of lean carcases for the better priced markets in mainland Europe because a major move towards bull beef production is unlikely. An animal will not grade well if it has not got the proper genetic make up. A large proportion of the national beef cow herd is made up of Friesians and rapidly maturing Hereford and Aberdeen Angus breeds. The percentage of continental breeds in the herd needs to be increased.</P>
    <P>When selecting a sire for the herd, farmers need information, although they may not realise this. AI sires are genetically evaluated for the important economic traits of growth rate, conformation and calving and some are evaluated for their mothering ability and daughter fertility. This use of AI is essential if we are to rapidly improve the national beef herd and ensure that we have the quality of carcases that EU markets demand. Farmers need good quality dams and sires to maximise beef quality. The dam side has been neglected for years in Ireland, resulting in variable suckler cow quality. Over recent years, it has become apparent that to meet the quality demands of the European markets, the proportion of continental genetics needs to be increased in the suckler cow population. However, this has met with resistance among farmers due to concerns about poor mothering ability and milk production in the suckler cow population.</P>
    <P>The introduction of maternally tested sires from France should help overcome these concerns. Such sires have allowed farmers to increase the proportion of continental breeds in their suckler herds without affecting their mothering or milk production ability. Such sires as those available in the beef programme of AI studs, such as Ulysses and Aboukir, have undergone testing in <Col N="113" /> France for their maternal and beefing ability and present an ideal combination to farmers wishing to improve their herds.</P>
    <P>When selecting a sire in the suckler herd it is important that farmers pay attention to the requirements of the market. Hard facts were lacking about the genetic performance of available bulls. This is not the case with proven AI sires for which genetic data is available to give farmers the tools they need to breed in response to the requirements of the market. Farmers need to select sires that can improve conformation and growth in the suckler herd. It is only by attending to detail at the planning stage that farmers will be able to fill the orders for the more lucrative markets and benefit from the higher prices that are paid.</P>
    <P>There are currently ten licensed AI organisations in Ireland, but 50 cowboys are operating. The Department is careless in allowing such people to sell semen to other herd owners without any testing or inspection. I call on the Minister of State to ensure that when the Bill is enacted it is implemented at primary producer level. While such cowboys operate, it will not be possible to increase the proportion of national kill being exported to EU markets to 50%. It is already the lowest in Europe. The deregulation of AI was a disastrous mistake by the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>While most speakers welcomed the Bill and were cognisant of the fact that we need to address consumer confidence and provide support for the beef industry, there has been criticism of its detail and some doubts about the enforcement of its provisions. The Minister and his Department will be responsible for the monitoring and implementation of the Bill, which is aimed at consumers at home and abroad, not farmers, cattle traders, producers or processors.</P>
      <P>In March 1996, the BSE crisis exploded around us. Beef consumption fell at home and abroad. Damage was done to the reputation of Irish beef, whether we like it or not, and we failed to convince our major customers abroad that our methods of dealing with the problem were different from those in, say, the United Kingdom. Damage was done, consumption fell dramatically and a number of countries imposed restrictions on EU imports and on Irish beef. Many people will still not eat beef since the announcement of a possible link between BSE and CJD. Indeed, the figures for January saw an increase in the number of BSE cases reported, which is a disappointment for all those involved in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to point out a factor that will not go unnoticed by consumers. The purpose of the Bill is to integrate and strengthen existing controls of our cattle and beef. It aims to ensure that the origin and history of all cattle and beef entering the human food chain can be checked, verified and guaranteed to a required standard. We export to about 57 countries worldwide. Beef accounts for more than 40% of Ireland's agricultural output and I note from the Minister's figures that thein<Col N="114" /> dustry contributes to the livelihood of 250,000 people in this country, all of whom no doubt are consumers themselves.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to send out a clear message that we are serious about our beef industry, conscious of consumers' concerns and that we are putting in place a rigorous scheme which will ensure that a calf can be traced from birth, through every farm and movement, and that veterinary care, grass, etc. can all be accounted for. The Bill applies to all persons engaged in the primary production and processing of Irish cattle and beef &ndash; cattle dealers, exporters of live cattle, livestock marts, slaughtering premises and establishments which manufacture or trade in feeding stuffs. It aims to regulate primary production and processing as many of its provisions will not apply to food business in the retail sector. I note the Minister's comment that the retail sector is already regulated under the food hygiene regulations, which are under the control of the Minister for Health and Children. Supermarkets, grocery shops and butchers are all subject to inspection by the Department of Health and Children and I am concerned that a gap in control could be created at this point. That point was made by many speakers and I await with interest the development of the Bill as it goes to Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The recent White Paper produced by Commissioner David Byrne is open for discussion and people can make submissions on it. That is a step forward in terms of European integration and food safety, but there has been criticism that the White Paper is not sufficiently strong. We are one of five countries in Europe that has a food safety authority which serves us well. Patrick Wall has always acted in a professional manner and his comments have done a lot for consumer confidence. I am glad that the Food Safety Authority is seen as an independent body, responsible solely for food and food safety. I welcome the message the Bill will send out to consumers at home and abroad. We are serious about the quality of the products we are supplying on the markets.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford)</i>
        <b>: </b>I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister on recognising the importance of bringing forward a Bill such as this. The beef industry has gone through a very difficult period over the past number of years as a result of the BSE crisis, which caused a major upheaval in the industry and made us realise we were very much tied to the problems in the UK. Different Ministers found it difficult to separate the fact that there were few, if any, problems in the Irish beef industry from the major problems that existed across the water. I was baffled on occasions because, despite our State agencies and <Col N="115" /> our high powered delegation, we were never able to prove to people abroad that Irish beef was top of the range and that Irish farmers were producing the beef in practically organic conditions.</P>
      <P>This debate gives us an opportunity to reflect on and discuss the beef industry generally. Given that we export eight out of ten animals, it is vital that we have a proper traceability scheme in operation to prove to the consumer at home and abroad that our beef products comply with the highest standards. Whether we like it or not, the consumer is king and there are vast markets here and in Europe which present enormous opportunities. We are now part of an expanding EU and major opportunities are available to market our beef products to the European consumer. As a member of the Council of Europe, I visited supermarkets in some of the major European cities but there was no Irish beef on the shelves in many of them. There was beef for sale from all of the other European countries but it was difficult to find Irish beef for sale. Sometimes it was stacked away in a corner of a supermarket.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, travels abroad with representatives from An Bord Bia to promote both the beef and food industries, and he is doing an excellent job, but I wonder about the role of An Bord Bia and its effectiveness in promoting our beef products on the European stage. Are we getting value for money? Is an assessment carried out from time to time of the role of An Bord Bia? I understand the Minister and representatives from An Bord Bia tried to promote Irish beef during the beef blockade when markets could not be filled, but An Bord Bia could do a lot more on the European stage to promote our beef products.</P>
      <P>The beef industry has been rocked to the core in recent years due, in particular, to the BSE crisis, and has become entangled in all sorts of complications. There is no doubt that farmers suffered enormously because of the closing of the live trade markets. They had no alternative but to sell their product to the processors and we all know what happened with the cartel arrangements, the price fixing and the ripping off of farmers which brought about the recent blockade. I felt it was about time that the farmers decided to take action against the meat processors because there is no doubt they were not being paid a fair price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The green image of Ireland is no longer sufficient to sell our food products abroad, hence the need for the Bill. Consumer markets will only respond to the highest quality standards based on traceability, accountability, being hormone free, knowing where the beef products come from, how they are produced, and the legislative frameworks that are in place in other countries to ensure that standards are being adhered to. That is the deciding factor for companies abroad trying to sell their product. I hope we will always retain our green Irish image, but we must lay down stan<Col N="116" /> dards here for the future, and price is always important.</P>
    <P>There has not been a problem up to the farm gate because Irish farmers, with the exception of the odd cowboy, produce top quality produce in practically organic conditions. Over the years the farm organisations have condemned without reservation farmers who do not comply with the standards which will ensure that our farm product is of the highest quality. They have given a guarded welcome to the Bill and they were consulted when it was being formulated. They have reservations about some sections and have been in touch with Oireachtas Members to express those reservations. Perhaps the Minister would refer to those concerns, particularly those of the IFA, in his reply.</P>
    <P>This Bill is important. It is not over-bureaucratic and will not bog down farmers in regulation, as has happened with so much other legislation in this area. Basically, it informs farmers that if they comply with the regulations, the product from the farms will be easily marketable throughout Europe and further afield. I hope the farm organisations will ensure that when the Bill is passed its provisions are complied with. We can then safely claim that the produce of Irish farmers is top of the range and deserves to achieve the highest possible price. If there is a problem, it can be traced back to find out its origin and how it was produced.</P>
    <P>I am a little concerned that butchers, supermarkets and other retailers are omitted from the legislation, although the Minister said there is other legislation to deal with them. We are regularly told that the process from the farm to the plate should be all-encompassing and should be dealt with as one, so I hope the Minister will explain why those areas of beef production and sales are not included in the Bill. I believe it is a mistake but the Minister has other ideas and appears to believe that the existing legislation is sufficient.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. It is a step in the right direction and proves beyond doubt the commitment of the Minister and the Ministers of State to ensuring that the good image of Irish food is maintained and enhanced in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this important and necessary Bill. Its importance has been outlined by the Minister and other speakers in terms of the importance of the beef industry for the internal economy and for export earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this day and age, the consumer decides. This legislation is required because the market has so decided. Room for discretion no longer exists. In recent years the beef industry has been hit by a number of exocets. The BSE scare in 1996 hit it severely and had a disastrous effect on the income of farmers and others involved in the industry. Recently, there was a dioxin scare about food in Belgium which had serious repercussions <Col N="117" /> for the beef and food industries there and, indeed, throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>The high standards of public health protection proposed in the Bill will apply to livestock marts, abattoirs, slaughter houses and businesses engaged in food production and those which manufacture or deal in animal feedstuffs. This is important for restoring confidence in the industry. The implementation of the legislation can only enhance and strengthen the animal identification and traceability measures already in place.</P>
    <P>The provision to make regulations regarding the notification of animal movements is a key component of the Bill. It is particularly important when one looks at what happened with regard to brucellosis and TB in the past 40 years. Millions of pounds were spent in the fight against those diseases but lack of traceability and the abuse of the system by members of the various groups who were involved in trying to eradicate the diseases were among the reasons that fight was unsuccessful. Hopefully, this legislation will contribute to fighting those problems and finally get TB and brucellosis under control.</P>
    <P>The future of this industry depends on the confidence consumers have in the food they buy. If this confidence is eroded or destroyed, the industry will suffer. The producers, that is, the farmers, must convince the people of Ireland and in our export markets that they are serious about food safety. This is crucial to the economy and to the incomes of 250,000 people in this country. We can put as many regulations as we wish in place and enact Bill after Bill but unless the people on the ground comply with them, the confidence in the food industry which has been lost will not return.</P>
    <P>It is important that inspections are carried out by the Department to ensure the provisions of this Bill are complied with. There must also be scope for people to appeal against decisions which they consider unjust. The Bill provides for a procedure whereby a person can make application for an appeal to the Circuit Court. This should be examined again with a view to putting in place another appeal system. There must be an appeal system that is fair, independent and reasonable. People should be able to afford to make appeals and not be deterred from appealing a decision by its exorbitant cost.</P>
    <P>Marketing is vital. The best way to sell goods is to have a product that is easy to sell and, in the case of food, it must be top quality. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, and the Minister, Deputy Walsh, have travelled Europe in recent months in an effort to improve sales of Irish produce. If we have a top quality product, they will have no problem increasing our sales. Ultimately, it depends on people having confidence in the product being sold. If they are to have confidence in animal products, there must be a strict system of traceability in operation.</P>
    <P>That people must now have certificates to produce, sell and buy will help restore confidence and make it easier for the industry to place its goods on the domestic and world markets. We <Col N="118" /> met the Commissioner with responsibility for food safety, Mr. David Byrne, last week and we spoke briefly about the beef industry. He assured us that the highest standards will be put in place and enforced.</P>
    <P>We have nothing to fear if the regulations are adhered to and good practice is followed. I welcome the Bill because it gives producers the standards which must be complied with to have a successful export market, and we export 80% of our goods. If people comply with the Bill, the beef industry will attain the high standard we hear daily it has.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Gerry Reynolds. I compliment and recognise the work done on the Bill by the Minister of State and his civil servants. The need for traceability came about after the 1996 crisis. I was Minister of State with responsibility for food in the Department at the time. It was obvious when we travelled to Europe and places such as Sweden that this type of assurance was needed. The process was begun then, and it has taken a long time to produce a Bill. It is a complex area and it was not that simple. People talk about traceability as if it were a simple matter but it is a difficult process. It is very difficult and next to impossible to obtain perfect traceability for every bit of meat consumed. However, we must strive to attain as much traceability as possible. It depends on many factors.</P>
      <P>The debate is timely because I noticed that last week the first debate at ministerial level under the Portuguese presidency dealt with the issue. Unanimity was achieved at ministerial level on traceability involving an identification code for beef and another code for slaughterhouses. However, there was disagreement on certain aspects of identification and regarding country of origin and place of boning. Nevertheless, it shows that the Commission is taking this issue seriously. I was involved in a directive on novel foods some years ago but the process was very slow. I urge the Minister and the Minister of State to speed up the process at EU level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill deals with primary production. I have a letter from Mr. Don McNamara, the chairman of Kerry IFA who is also manager of A Taste of Kerry. He has pointed out what a number of speakers have said already: that the Bill deals only with the primary producer and that it should extend to transport, wholesale, retail, handling, the catering industry, etc. The Minister of State will probably say those areas are covered by other legislation, but there is no traceability in those areas. If I ask a restaurant proprietor from where his meat came, he can tell me if it came from the local butcher but he cannot if it came from a factory or from abroad. How can we then say we have a proper traceability system in the country if we cannot provide that information? We should not be too boastful or exaggerate about our traceability system. We are striving towards a high <Col N="119" /> quality system but it will be hard to achieve perfection.</P>
    <P>A Taste of Kerry was one of the first groups to seek traceability when it established a scheme for marketing Kerry beef under the brand &lsquo;A Taste of Kerry'. The organisation ensured farmers did not use hormones or other chemicals to boost cattle growth. The group is concerned about the Bill and I bring this to the Minister of State's attention because the people involved in the group have been active in this area. The Minister of State and his officials should take seriously the flaws in the Bill when it comes to Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not refer to the microbiological safety of the primary product. I have seen this in a few reports of hazard analysis and critical control points system, or HACCP. It is a major omission and Deputy Upton also pointed that out. Perhaps the Minister of State's officials might take that into account when he replies.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the recent report launched by the National Food Centre and I bring it to the Minister of State's attention because it is a State agency. The result of this survey shows that quality policy should distinguish more clearly between safety and sensory quality, both of which are important to consumers. Whereas it is essential to have mandatory safety controls, eating quality needs more emphasis in voluntary schemes. Consumers are concerned about safety and concern is greatest in the case of beef. There is a need to provide information on safety testing in clear and attractive forms. Meat labelling is not yet achieving the desired impact as a source of information about product safety or sensory quality. I hope the Bill can address some of the issues which were raised in the survey.</P>
    <P>I would outline the results if I had more time to deal with them. The main results of this survey by Teagasc was that the quality policy implemented in Ireland and EU countries fails significantly and falls short on meeting consumer needs in terms of reassuring consumers about the safety and eating quality of meat. We address the issue of traceability and safety in the Bill but we do not address quality. I am sure it is another question and it is something which will have to be addressed. It is fine to be able to trace from where an animal came and what food it was fed, but it is another issue to ensure that animal produces quality meat.</P>
    <P>When I was a Minister of State, I was responsible for establishing the National Cattle Breeding Federation specifically to produce better quality beef. It is a slow process to get the various societies to co-operate but it is progressing. Farmers and cattle breeding societies now realise that we must have a quality product and traceability. Once there was resistance to it but people realise now we must have it.</P>
    <P>The bureaucratic challenge to farmers is now onerous. Farmers at one time had to get someone <Col N="120" /> else to fill forms and hire people to do what would be seen as a simple job.</P>
    <P>Farmers are traditionally not good at filling out forms, although young farmers who have gone through the green certificate and other education courses have changed in that regard. The amount of form filling required of farmers is quite onerous and I fear their frustration will become a reason for wanting to get out of farming. Farmers tell me they are frustrated. I hope this system will not introduce yet another layer of bureaucracy for farmers.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and the Minister of State on this important legislation. I have no doubt the Bill will be discussed in depth on Committee Stage. I am sure the Minister of State agrees that the issue of quality must be addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Deenihan has drawn our attention to the increased bureaucracy associated with farming. If this legislation introduces another layer of bureaucracy, it will have the effect of taking farmers out of agriculture. The current level of form filling is extremely frustrating for farmers. Young farmers who have gone to agricultural college can contend with this bureaucracy but many older farmers who have been in the system for many years find it extremely difficult. They also have difficulty dealing with bureaucracy in the manner required by the Department. The Bill is not concerned primarily with record keeping, but if we wish people to remain in agriculture we must minimise the level of bureaucracy in farming.</P>
      <P>I support the proposal in Agenda 2000 to base cattle headage on area rather than on numbers of cattle. If we are to have a proper beef industry we must have quality rather than quantity. A major sea change is required in the agriculture sector regarding cattle breeding. If breeding continues as it is now, we will fail to gain markets in Europe, the UK and elsewhere. This will impact on the profitability of farmers. At present a top weanling, if exported, would make £150 more than an animal of the same weight which stays in the home market. If we cannot make up that difference we will not have a vibrant agricultural economy. The Department must lead by example and provide education and incentives for farmers to breed better quality cattle.</P>
      <P>Only 20% of our beef qualifies for the European market. That is an extremely small percentage. If 80% of our beef qualified for the European market it would make a great difference. Since the BSE crisis we have had great difficulty regaining our former markets. We are not succeeding in this regard, and all the legislation in the world will not resolve that problem. Leadership by the Department is called for to improve the quality of our beef. Traceability is important but it will be difficult to put in place a traceability programme. We must increase our markets in the UK and Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. N. O'Keeffe Mr. N. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the acting chairman for her co-operation and Deputies for their constructive contributions to the debate on this important legislation.</P>
      <P>Food safety and the protection of the consumer are very much the issues of the moment. In recent years there has been a justifiable increase in consumers' awareness of their legitimate rights and their expectations of assurances as to the safety of the food they eat. This is particularly the case in the beef sector. In my opening address I outlined the background to the introduction of this legislation, which is a direct response to the BSE crisis, and the importance of the beef industry to the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the national beef assurance scheme is to provide reassurances to consumers and customers regarding the safety of Irish beef. At the same time, the scheme will help to safeguard the multi-million pound Irish beef industry from the adverse effects of the inevitable food scares and help to maintain its competitiveness on domestic and international markets.</P>
      <P>The importance of providing systems of independent controls and assurances was underlined by the decision late last year of the Russian authorities to lift the ban on the import of beef from five counties in Ireland. This decision was made possible because of the high level of controls in place on the production of beef in Ireland, including the traceability system, which is a central element of the national beef assurance scheme. The scheme is clear evidence of the Government's commitment to safeguarding public health by ensuring the highest standards of food safety beginning with the beef sector. It is also evidence of the Government's commitment to the beef industry, which is of vital importance to our economy, and the resolve to provide the necessary regulatory framework to underpin its continued viability and capacity to trade.</P>
      <P>The State has already invested a large amount of money in the development of the computerised animal traceability element of the scheme. Some £4.2 million was expended last year in establishing computer links at marts and factories and in the supply of computer equipment and training. An additional £9.1 million will be spent this year in the further development and maintenance of this system and the associated development of a fully integrated animal health computer system. This expenditure, which is very significant by any standard, is a clear signal of the Government's commitment to delivering regulatory systems dedicated to ensuring the production of safe food products and the maintenance of a viable industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By enhancing the cattle traceability system and by introducing a mandatory registration and approval process, the Bill will deliver the additional assurances which will enable us to say Irish beef and beef products are safe to eat. The registration and inspection system will involve <Col N="122" /> individual producers and processors in a very concrete way in the delivery of a safe product. It will ensure that all persons involved in the primary production and beef processing chain know their responsibilities and are actively involved in fulfilling their functions in this chain. The proposed legislation will be an important marketing tool in the promotion of Irish beef and it will also provide a solid foundation upon which quality specifications tailored to individual customer needs can build.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have expressed concern regarding the scope of the Bill, particularly the fact that it does not apply in full to food businesses. Such businesses, which include supermarkets, grocery stores, restaurants and retail butcher shops, will not escape the net of the national beef assurance scheme because they are already covered by existing legislation on food hygiene and because their sources of supply will be controlled by the NBAS.</P>
    <P>At present these businesses are strictly regulated by the various health boards which, like my Department, are agents of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland in the delivery of food safety across the food chain. These existing provisions are very comprehensive and provide enforcement officers with powers of seizure, detention, withdrawal of product and the suspension, closure and prosecution of businesses. Accordingly, such businesses have been excluded from the registration, inspection and approval processes under the Bill. To include them would have been an unnecessary duplication and could lead to a two-tier, anomalous process of inspection and approval.</P>
    <P>However, by controlling primary production and processing, the NBAS will regulate the sources of supply for such businesses. Under the scheme they will be obliged to source their supplies only from approved participants. Failure to comply with this provision will constitute an offence for which rigorous penalties will apply. Furthermore, provision has been made in the Bill for the appointment of authorised officers by the health boards for the precise purpose of checking whether this provision has been complied with.</P>
    <P>Deputies have expressed concern regarding the non-application of the Act to imported beef, notwithstanding its application to imported animals. The purpose of the scheme is to provide additional assurance about the safety of Irish production. Thus, it would be contrary to the purpose of the scheme to include imported beef. It could also constitute a barrier to trade in contravention of EU legislation. However, animals imported into the State would have to be covered since they would be subsequently traded, slaughtered and processed in the same way as domestic production.</P>
    <P>Deputies can be assured, however, that all meat imported into the EU from third countries is subject to strict regulation. Meat may be imported only from third countries and establishments which have been specifically approved by <Col N="123" /> EU veterinary officials. In addition, the meat may be imported only through approved import points and it must be accompanied by animal and public health certification conforming with EU requirements. The list of countries and establishments exporting to the EU is subject to continuous monitoring and review.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies expressed fears that the additional costs arising from the scheme could impose a burden on small enterprises, particularly abattoirs and farmers. Any additional costs which may arise should not be overestimated. The standards which must be met are based largely on existing legislation. If producers and processors are already complying with these requirements &ndash; the vast majority are &ndash; any additional costs should be minimal. Any costs which arise, which should not be excessive, must be balanced against the very real gains which will ensue under the scheme in terms of reassuring consumers and customers, thus improving the marketability of Irish beef to the benefit of all producers and processors.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton raised a number of questions regarding the type, format and frequency of inspections of producers and processors. While the details of the inspection process have yet to be finalised, the principles of independent inspections and regular auditing will be applied. Only persons who are suitably qualified will be charged with the inspection of the different categories of participants under the scheme.</P>
    <P>As to farm inspections, a query raised by Deputy Connaughton, the rate of inspection fee will be a matter between the inspector and farmer. I understand this aspect is being discussed by the representative organisations with a view to agreeing a system which will not impose an undue burden on farmers. The Department's proposals that farm inspections be carried out by the veterinary practitioner at the time of the annual TB test will serve to ensure extra costs are minimised. There is nothing in the Bill which will prejudice the outcome of these discussions. On a related issue, the Department is always looking at ways to rationalise the inspection process to avoid duplication and the need for multiple farm inspections.</P>
    <P>Deputies expressed concern that the penalties provided for under the Bill are excessive and will be implemented in an indiscriminate manner, even for minor infringements of the legislation. The experience of farmers in relation to loss of entitlement to premia has been cited. The penalties provided for in the Bill are the maximum applicable and can only be applied if a conviction has been secured. The Department only enters legal proceedings when there has been a serious contravention of the rules and when all other remedial options have failed. It will not take proceedings against genuine minor infringements of the rules.</P>
    <P>The position is not comparable with the situation pertaining to the livestock and headage <Col N="124" /> schemes. In the latter case EU legislation clearly sets out the framework for the payment of premia and also defines the circumstances for loss of entitlement. There are no such automatic procedures under the national beef assurance scheme. The Department has discretion whether to institute proceedings and the courts decide in each case on the level of penalties if a conviction is secured. The courts have a responsibility to ensure the penalty fits the crime and in my experience they discharge this function with due care. That said I consider it essential to provide powerful deterrents in the Bill against the illegal activity engaged in by a minority of unscrupulous operators.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the Government in the context of the recent partnership negotiations has agreed to establish an independent accessible and properly resourced appeals unit to deal with complaints in relation to EU payments, including livestock and area aid premia. The establishment of this unit should address many of the problems raised by Deputies during the debate.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies expressed concern about the system provided for in the Bill against refusal or revocation of approval and sought the appointment of an independent arbitrator or separate appeals system. I am confident that the appeals mechanisms provided for in the Bill are comprehensive and sound. There will be continual dialogue between applicants and the authorities at all stages of the inspection and approval process and decisions to rescind or refuse approval will not be taken lightly. In the event that it is decided that refusal or revocation of approval is warranted the operator or person concerned will have two avenues of appeal &ndash; through representations and the courts. In these circumstances I do not consider that the appointment of an independent arbitrator or additional tier of appeals is warranted.</P>
    <P>Certain Deputies sought assurances that our newly developed CMMS system would work and that it would be capable of tracing animals and pinpointing animal locations with a high degree of accuracy. I am confident that this is the case. Since the beginning of the year all marts, factories, abattoirs and live export points are suplying information to the CMMS, some for much longer. A request has already been made to the European Commission for recognition of the database as fully operational. To date some three million individual animal movements have been recorded onto the system. This is only a minuscule part of the enormous bank of data held by the Department on computer in regard to Irish cattle. There are more than 40 million individual events on our database regarding animal births and locations. The CMMS will work to fill in the gaps remaining about animal movements, thus providing a comprehensive record of Irish cattle from birth to slaughter. The CMMS can only record movements notified to it. In this connection all participants in the industry have a duty to report cattle movements promptly and accurately. It is only <Col N="125" /> with the co-operation of the industry that we will have a comprehensive and credible traceability database.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies expressed concern that the traceability system does not extend from farm to fork. Nobody should underestimate the enormity of the undertaking to provide a traceability system for cattle from birth to the point of entry into the human food chain. It is a mammoth task involving the recording of millions of animal movements annually through 150,000 herds, 110 marts and 440 slaughtering houses and for export as well as monitoring and verifying the information collected and pursuing discrepancies. I am satisfied that the assurances provided under this system will provide very important additional guarantees regarding the safety of all Irish beef entering the food chain. Slaughtering plants will be required to operate a carcase identification system enabling the carcase to be correlated with the live animal. This is standard practice in most slaughtering plants.</P>
    <P>As regards informing participants about their obligations under the scheme, it is the intention to conduct a comprehensive information and advice programme for all participants. My Department will work with Teagasc and the industry to ensure all participants are fully aware of the importance of the scheme and of their rights and obligations.</P>
    <P>I note the points made by Deputy O'Malley which cover a number of issues. These have been raised and addressed on many occasions in the House and other fora. Specifically in relation to the cans of meat I can confirm that the cans in question were part of a consignment produced for the Russian market. In the event some of the product, including that found on sale in Dublin last year, was not exported and did not benefit from export refunds. The Department has asked the Revenue Commissioners to investigate the appropriateness of the tariff classification applied to the product which was exported. The Revenue Commissioners are the responsible body in this area.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the prosecution of a former Department officer. The officer in question took a career break from the Department and, as is normal under this arrangement, returned to the Department after this. There was no ministerial intervention. As regards the Nenagh incident, legal action is being taken.</P>
    <P>In general in any one year more than 500,000 tonnes of beef is exported from Ireland to over 60 countries worldwide. Our record stands up, as we have proven when markets were kept open despite concerns about BSE since 1996. I would prefer to concentrate on the positive aspects of the industry and to look to the future as this very important beef assurance measure does.</P>
    <P>Deputies Upton and Deenihan expressed concern regarding the absence of any reference to HACCP, microbiological testing etc in the text of the Bill. The standards to be observed by the various classes of participants, including slaughtering <Col N="126" /> and processing plants, animal feed manufacturers, etc are laid down in the legislation listed in the relevant part of the Second Schedule to the Bill. This legislation includes the official requirements in relation to the monitoring of critical control points, microbiological testing, monitoring of residue levels etc. In accordance with section 10(3) of the Bill only establishments complying <i>inter alia </i>with these requirements will be approved under the scheme. Under section 33(2) any new regulatory requirements introduced in relation to any of these or other matters will be added to the legislation listed in the Second Schedule. In this way it will be possible to continuously update the standards applicable to the various classes of participants under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton sought information on a number of specific issues in relation to TB<i> viz</i> a vaccination for badgers and a reliable blood test to identify infected cattle. As these matters are not specifically the subject of the Bill under discussion I undertake to take them up with the Deputy outside the House at an early date. Research is being conducted to devise appropriate strategies to reduce the incidence of TB in the cattle and badger populations. In anticipation that these trials prove conclusively a significant level of badger involvement a vaccination strategy has been devised which it is hoped will provide a solution to overcome the wildlife constraint. In this context a major badger vaccination development project commenced last year. A research group incorporating staff from the Department, the TB investigation unit, University College Dublin and University College Cork has been established. As a first step an island population of badgers has been vaccinated. Blood samples were taken at the time of vaccination and further samples will be taken at regular intervals over 12 months to establish the nature and level of any immune response to this vaccine. This project also involves collaboration with the Central Veterinary Laboratory in Weybridge in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Deputy Creed requested information on the progress achieved to date by the Irish Cattle Breeder's Federation. While this information is not the subject of the Bill I can state the following: the ICBF was established in 1997 with the objective of leading the development of cattle breeding in a manner which would best serve the national commercial livestock sector. Since its inception the federation has appointed a chief executive with considerable experience in this area and it has also engaged the necessary expertise to deliver efficient cattle improvement schemes for Ireland.</P>

      <P>The duplicity and evasion of Deputy Denis Foley has inflicted serious and significant damage on public life and politics. The arrogant and facile contributions by Fianna Fáil Deputies last night, and I am sad to say by the new Minister for State with responsibility for children, Deputy Hanafin, beggared belief. Deputy Hanafin and Deputy Pat Carey cynically attempted to use the critical situation in Northern Ireland as an excuse to deny parliamentary debate and parliamentary accountability. It was a cowardly and unworthy defence of an increasingly beleaguered Taoiseach and an increasingly beleaguered Government.</P>
      <P> We hear this evening that Deputy Foley is about to resign from the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party. Considering the fact that the Taoiseach's spin doctors have been peddling this story since the weekend, this can hardly be described as news. I am surprised that RTÉ has been running it as a top story all evening. Rather, it is an eleventh hour attempt at damage limitation, an attempt which will fail. In reality, Deputy Foley's fate has been sealed since these revelations first broke. His stage managed departure will not detract from the questions that the Taoiseach must answer about his role in this scandal. The Taoiseach has a democratic duty to be accountable to this House and to the electorate. Deputy Foley's exile in the Fianna Fáil sin bin is irrelevant to this critical matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that the recent revelations about Deputy Foley have seriously shaken public faith in the parliamentary process. When this House discovers that one of its members has been involved in tax evasion, illegal offshore banking and concealing information from a tribunal of inquiry, it is essential that serious questions are asked and that honest answers are forthcoming. Unfortunately, neither the Taoiseach nor the Tánaiste have answered these questions. This is part of a long established pattern on behalf of the Taoiseach but Deputy Harney's conversion to the tactics employed by Fianna Fáil when <Col N="129" /> important issues of standards in office arise is a more recent and regrettable development.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's partial account of his meeting with Deputy Foley, an account he did not give to this House in spite of repeated requests to do so, is frankly unbelievable. Information that Deputy Foley was being investigated by the Moriarty tribunal led the Taoiseach to call in Deputy Foley some time in December. Newspaper reports insist that this information came from the Tánaiste and this has not been denied by anyone within the Government. At the meeting Deputy Foley confirmed that he was being investigated by the Moriarty tribunal and he also informed the Taoiseach that the inquiries centred around investments he made through the late Mr. Des Traynor. The Taoiseach asks us to believe that he only realised Deputy Foley was an Ansbacher account holder when the tribunal made this public. That contention is utterly unbelievable.</P>
    <P>Given the central role of his former mentor, Charles J. Haughey, I presume the Taoiseach has read the McCracken report of August 1997. He will be aware of the contents of that report as they refer to the late Mr. Traynor, the person Deputy Foley revealed to him as having been his investment manager. The McCracken tribunal found that</P>
    <P>Des Traynor was one of the founders of Ansbacher Cayman Ltd. . he appears to have acted on behalf of a number of Irish persons who wished to deposit their money off-shore . In effect, Des Traynor was acting as the Irish agent of Ansbacher Cayman Ltd. . Mr. Des Traynor was the link man.</P>
    <P>The role of Des Traynor in Deputy Foley's financial affairs and the fact that he was being investigated by the Moriarty tribunal could have led the Taoiseach to one conclusion only. The Moriarty tribunal is specifically charged with investigating the links between Ansbacher and public office holders. That is the explicit import of the terms of reference, terms of reference the Taoiseach himself commended to the House in September 1997. Yet, the Taoiseach asks us to believe that he did not realise Deputy Foley was involved in the Ansbacher scam.</P>
    <P>The evidence that Deputy Foley was involved in Ansbacher was laid before the Taoiseach at the meeting in December. However, the Taoiseach chose to ignore this evidence and to turn a deaf ear to the truth. In spite of the information available to the Taoiseach in December and in spite of the involvement of Deputy Foley in Ansbacher, Deputy Foley remained as vice chairperson of the Committee of Public Accounts. The Taoiseach must account to the House for this bizarre decision.</P>
    <P>At least one Member in this House is aware of the Taoiseach's willingness to wield the knife when it suits his purposes. Deputy Albert Reynolds can attest to the devious manner in which the Taoiseach orchestrated his defeat in the Fianna Fáil presidential nomination contest. It seems that when his own electoral interests are <Col N="130" /> on the line, the Taoiseach will not hesitate to shaft one of his colleagues.</P>

      <P>However, when another of his colleagues was involved in the largest tax scam in the history of the State, that colleague was allowed to remain as vice chairperson of the Committee of Public Accounts. No action has been taken by the Taoiseach, nor has any been demanded by the Tánaiste. When the interests of Fianna Fáil are at stake, the Taoiseach is willing to take effective action but when the issue of standards in public office is at stake the Taoiseach assumes the role of a timorous mouse, afraid to ask the most obvious questions in case he might find out the truth.</P>
      <P>The Opposition motion being debated this evening requests parliamentary accountability. Since the Taoiseach refused to voluntarily provide information to the House on his December meeting with Deputy Foley, we were left with no option but to table a motion requiring him to do so. It is not the first time that answers have had to be dragged out of this Taoiseach, the Taoiseach who signed blank cheques for Charlie Haughey and did not even have the decency to identify his role in the affair when making a statement to the House on 10 September 1997.</P>
      <P>I remind Members of the thoughtful comments made by Deputy O'Malley last year on the Pádraig Flynn affair in which he outlined the necessity to take a stand on decency and good standards in public office. Deputy O'Malley staked a great deal on the maintenance of high standards in public office and paid a high personal price for doing so. I urge the Progressive Democrat members of the Government to reread those comments and ask themselves whether they are still true to the beliefs and principles outlined by their founder or whether they are so hungry for power that they are prepared to cast them aside and return to the bosom of Fianna Fáil?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was gravely disappointed to learn that a member of my own party in this House would be called to give evidence to the Moriarty tribunal. My disappointment deepened on learning that he had over a long period evaded his responsibility as a citizen to observe and fulfil his obligations under the tax code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first inkling I had of the possible involvement of Deputy Foley in the Moriarty tribunal was from the Government Press Secretary, who was picking up a report circulating among journalists. This was in early December. I subsequently checked the Ansbacher list that had been furnished to me, but found that Deputy Foley's name was not on it. I next had a report <Col N="131" /> to the same effect from the Attorney General. He had been informed by the Tánaiste, who had learnt from her officer, Gerard Ryan, that Deputy Foley was likely to be called before the Moriarty tribunal. At that time, the Public Accounts Committee sub-committee's hearings were complete, and the publication of their report was believed to be imminent.</P>
    <P>On Wednesday 15 December, the day before the House went into recess for the Christmas period, I asked Deputy Foley to come to see me so that I might question him about the matter. I wish to emphasise that I always regard such conversations with Deputies in my party as strictly confidential.</P>
    <P>However, given the circumstances involved, I will convey the essential and most relevant points to the House. It was a fairly short meeting. He admitted to me that he had been before the Moriarty tribunal in private session and that he was co-operating fully with the tribunal. I asked him what it was about, because he was not on the Ansbacher list that I had. He said it related to investments going back 26 or 28 years when he was involved in the hotel near his house in Tralee and not a Deputy at the time. He informed me that the accountant who then did work for the hotel was Des Traynor and that he was putting money that he was getting through this business into an investment account with Mr. Traynor.</P>
    <P>I reminded him that it was Fianna Fáil policy to co-operate fully with tribunals. I told him that the co-operation was essential and that total and full disclosure was critical. He assured me that he had already done that and would continue to do so. Deputy Foley also told me that he had been with his accountant and that they were in the process of making a full and voluntary disclosure to the Revenue Commissioners, with a view to settling his liabilities. I asked him whether he had considered his position on the Committee of Public Accounts. The DIRT sub-committee's work had finished, and its report had been published that day. He informed me that he would resign from the committee. He said that he would do this at the earliest appropriate opportunity, which he thought would be prior to his scheduled public appearance at the tribunal, which was due early on the tribunal's resumption after the Christmas break.</P>
    <P>Deputy Foley has since stated that he believed, until recently, that his offshore account did not create a conflict of interest, <i>vis-à-vis </i>either his membership of the Committee of Public Accounts or the DIRT inquiry. This view failed to exercise the political judgment that would be expected of him after long years in this House. The Tánaiste and I discussed the fact that Deputy Foley was facing difficulties and was to appear before the Moriarty tribunal. We did not have any detailed discussion on the matter because we both respect her statutory role in relation to the investigation of the Ansbacher and related accounts. As reported in newspapers recently, I informed the Tánaiste that I had spoken to Deputy Foley and that he had assured me that he intended to resign from the PAC.</P>

      <P>On a previous occasion in this House, in the case of another Deputy who admitted to having an offshore account and evading tax, the then Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, said on 3 December 1996, Dáil Official Report, volume 472, column 463, that nobody is above the law and that:</P>
      <P>There is not, and never will be, a system of conviction by denunciation. Independent authorities, not rivals nor those with an axe to grind, made judgments as to culpability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us in this House are concerned about the standing of politics. I have on many occasions over the past three years, and from both sides of the House, set out my views on what constitutes acceptable standards for a public representative. I have stressed the fundamental issue of public trust and above all our duty to respect the rules which we ourselves legislate for. The work of the Committee of Public Accounts and its report on <Col N="133" /> the operation of DIRT tax have been highly praised on all sides. It is, apart from any other consideration, deeply disappointing to find that a Member of the House, and a vice-chairman and past chairman of the Public Account Committee, was<i> prima facie</i> conducting his financial affairs in a manner analogous to that being investigated by the sub-committee.</P>
    <P>In light of these circumstances, Deputy Foley has properly informed me of his resignation from the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party. He has also today informed me of his decision not to contest the elections to the Fianna Fáil National Executive. He is now, in effect, an Independent TD.</P>

It is better from every point of view if the individual can be brought to understand the action that is required, and that they acknowledge the justice of it, by taking the necessary steps themselves. On occasion, a little space may need to be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not consider that in this instance the public interest suffered in any way by the short delay that occurred over the Christmas recess. It has been beneficial that many of the questions raised by Deputy Foley's conduct could be put to him as soon as possible thereafter in the tribunal, even if not all questions have necessarily received completely satisfactory answers. I believe that the proper course of action would have been for <Col N="136" /> Deputy Foley to absent himself from membership of the DIRT committee altogether.</P>
    <P>Members of this House, and those who aspire to take part in political life, will, I hope, have taken note once again of the high standards expected of those in public life, which the Government has shown a determination to uphold. Seamus Heaney's new translation of <i>Beowulf</i> contains the lines, &lsquo;Behaviour that's admired is the path to power among people everywhere'. We need hardly remind ourselves that the converse is especially true in a democracy.</P>

There is not much else I can say about his speech, certainly nothing complimentary. Deputy Quinn commenced his speech with a personal attack on the Taoiseach. He then went on to make what I thought was a very good contribution technically. He addressed the motion and while I disagree with Deputy Quinn's analysis, his speech certainly kept one interested. Deputy Gormley also made a personal attack on the Taoiseach and went on to say, &ldquo;the gombeen culture still flourishes in this pathetic little country of ours.&rdquo; I am sure the voters of Dublin South-East will appreciate that. Fair dues to Deputies Rabbitte, Michael D. Higgins and tonight to Deputy Shortall, none of whom made a personalised attack on the Taoiseach. Deputy Rabbitte began with a five minute parsing and analysis of the speech of the Minister <Col N="137" /> of State, Deputy Hanafin, and then he could not see the wood for the next five minutes because he was up a tree in North Dublin.</P>

      <P>I will not repeat the scurrilous remarks but suffice to say they were totally out of order. I have known the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, since 1985 when I was first elected to Dublin County Council and he was elected to Dublin Corporation. He was also elected Lord Mayor of Dublin that year. I have never met a politician more competent and dedicated than the Taoiseach. He is the captain of a team that is bringing to this country the greatest increase in the quality and standard of living ever achieved in the history of the State. As charisma is not a quality that anyone on the other side of the House has in abundance, it is now deemed politically incorrect to have natural charisma. I make no apology for it, the Taoiseach has charisma. The Taoiseach is liked by his colleagues on all sides of the House. He is loved by hundreds of thousands of people outside this House. Despite the comments of Deputies John Bruton and Quinn, he will, with the will of the people, remain Taoiseach, health permitting and if he slows down a little bit, for many years to come.</P>

In Dublin South-Central we have in my colleagues, Deputies Gay Mitchell, Briscoe and Upton, following in the footsteps of her brother, Pat, as fine a group of political representatives as there is in any constituency. Yet at the last by-election in 1999, the numbers voting was most disappointing at approximately 30%. There is no evidence that the voters of any particular party are not voting. In fact, recent opinion polls confirm this. The whole body politic is affected and our relevance to the people and our credibility is at a low ebb.</P>

Nor do I think that this debate will go very far towards restoring the faith of the Irish people in politics and politicians. This is an exercise cobbled together by an Opposition desperately trying to make an impact on the public.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Opposition want this, they are entitled to a little media coverage. Last night we were not dealing with the issue of tax evasion, we were dealing with an Opposition attempting to blacken the character of the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Party generally. The Irish people are too discerning to be taken in by this production. The discerning Irish media will surely spot this naked attempt by the Opposition to fling mud in the vain hope that some of it will stick to the Taoiseach and the Government.</P>
      <P>The Opposition called for clear talk yesterday. I have no problem with that. So let us make a few things abundantly clear. Tax evasion by anyone, inside or outside the Houses of the Oireachtas, is wrong. Tax evaders deserve to be identified and to enjoy the full rigours of the law. However, we all know that tax evasion was rife in this country; it was almost worn as a badge of honour throughout the eighties. Who set about dealing with tax evasion? Galling as it may be for them, I remind the Opposition that it was the Finance Act,1992 which progressed anti-avoidance and anti-evasion measures in the teeth of ferocious opposition</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Act, 1992, cut back on numerous business and other tax reliefs and shelters. These measures comprised the largest package of cutbacks on tax shelters used mainly by the better off and companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only was a Fianna Fáil led Government in power, but the then Minister for Finance was the Taoiseach, the man whose reputation the Opposition is trying desperately to smear in this debate. Much as the Opposition may wish to deny it, Fianna Fáil led Governments have made real progress on stamping out tax evasion. In stark contrast, the rainbow Government's performance in relation to tax evasion was like its name &ndash; up in the air with no real substance.</P>
      <P>As one who has bought into political life with my heart and soul, I am dismayed when a fellow politician is accused of being less than 100% committed and honest. This is because I believe in the importance of politics and standards of individual integrity no matter which side of the House one may be on. Politics is about public service. It is about what can be done for others. It is about making difficult choices and giving leadership. Ultimately, politicians gain the trust of the electorate and that must never be abused. We as politicians have a responsibility to act with the utmost integrity. We discuss and ultimately make the law. If we break the law or condone law breaking, we do our profession and our country a severe disservice.</P>

      <P>Reference by supporters of the amendment to the fledgling peace process in Northern Ireland is not only reckless, it is unbecoming. It is unstatesmanlike and short-sighted to introduce such an amendment to this motion. This motion relates to accountability and in any real parliamentary democracy a Prime Minister would make a detailed statement to the House and take questions, such as when he learned about this affair, who told him and whether the Tánaiste is using officials and inspectors to trawl confidential information for political advantage. How come such a prominent Fianna Fáil name was left off the earlier list, when the names of people associated with other parties &ndash; people, it transpires, who do not have quite as much to answer for &ndash; were leaked publicly? Did he advise Deputy Foley to resign from the Public Accounts Committee and/or Fianna Fáil, or did he ask him to stay on? It seems to me that the timing of the departure of Ministers, the Cabinet reshuffle and the vote of confidence in a Minister were staged to precede the information about Deputy Foley becoming public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is about transparency and accountability, not personalised innuendo. It is not about accountability to a series of tribunals which will report at some safe point in the future, but accountability to this House for the actions of members of the Government as the Constitution <Col N="146" /> requires. Part of the reason for the sleaze factor in Irish society is that those in the know are well aware that their chances of being caught are slim because there is a conspiracy against accountability and transparency. That conspiracy involves members of the Government itself not being transparent and accountable and it is our duty as the Opposition to point that out.</P>
    <P>Contrast the treatment of two members of the Judiciary with the way a Member of this House, whose vote is badly needed to prop up the Government, has been treated. The two members of the judiciary, one of whom was in line to become Chief Justice, have had their careers ended and been pensioned off for a much less serious offence than that with which a Member of this House is charged. It is not just a matter of tax evasion, but he sat on an inquiry when he knew the position he was in. What would we say in this House if a judge sat on a tribunal or in court in those circumstances? </P>

What is good for the Legislature should be good for the Judiciary and what is good for the Judiciary should be good for the Legislature. We should not have double standards. Members who have pointed this out in a way that is not personalised but in a proper and dutiful way should not be treated to the kind of personal abuse we heard earlier.</P>

      <P>That is the point. Last night the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, cut her teeth as a Minister of State by throwing in the ball and moving an amendment to the motion. She spoke eloquently in soccer parlance and I cannot resist the temptation to respond in soccer parlance. It seems to me that the Government, when replying to the debate, might tell the House and the country why someone who has received more than two yellow cards &ndash; Deputy Foley's case has been before five different bodies between tribunals and committees of the House at once &ndash; is still on the pitch. This person's participation in the Committee of Public Accounts investigation is the exact equivalent of handling the ball in the penalty area. Why has that not resulted in the goalkeeper, the Taoiseach, coming in here to face penalties from the penalty takers? Why has he cried &ldquo;No foul&rdquo; although a capacity crowd of 3.5 million people outside this House have clearly seen the foul with their own eyes? Why has the fact that the referee, the tribunal, has booked a Fianna Fáil Deputy for questionable behaviour not resulted in the team manager condemning the offender and explaining his actions to the supporters and the wider public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Fianna Fáil Deputies have been <Col N="147" /> caught miles offside, some while serving as Ministers. Why has the Taoiseach sought to pretend it has nothing to do with team tactics? Why have lager lout tactics and behaviour replaced decent, open parliamentary action as an acceptable standard in the eyes of some Members? The Minister of State had her first throw-in as an officeholder, but it was a foul throw. I wish her well in her career and hope she has better success in the future.</P>
    <P>In former Deputy Ray Burke's case, the Taoiseach said he was up every tree in north Dublin. There are no banana trees in north Dublin or anywhere else in this Republic, but one would easily believe, looking from the outside, that this was a banana republic. In former Commissioner Padraig Flynn's case he was told: &ldquo;Don't tell me, tell the tribunal.&rdquo;  In Deputy Foley's case we do not know what was said &ndash; the Taoiseach will not explain. In 18 months at most the Government will have to face the electorate and I predict that the Government's self-flattery will come to naught.</P>
    <P>As the saying goes &ldquo;You can fool some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time&rdquo;. They are waiting out there in the high grass. They can see what is going on in this House. They can see the Government is refusing to answer parliamentary questions. If Members make an application under the Freedom of Information Act they can get information, but if Members ask a question on the same matter in the House Ministers evade responsibility. Ministers will try to refuse to come to the House for debates on unemployment and the regions when we have traditionally had such debates on a regular basis. Tribunals costing huge sums of money are examining certain matters, but if the Taoiseach and his Government had answered questions properly about the same matters they would not need to be examined by tribunals. Ministers will not answer to Parliament, but they will have to answer to the people. They can run but they cannot hide.</P>
    <P>This motion is not about personalised attacks. It is about Parliament having the right to get information and replies from the Government of the day. The 1937 Constitution is a finely balanced document that sets up different institutions of the State. It shared out the responsibilities of the State among the President, the Executive with a head of Government called Taoiseach, a Parliament with two Houses and the courts. That Constitution is being bypassed by the failure of this Executive &ndash; like no other &ndash; to come to the House and answer simple, straightforward questions. The Constitution also charges this Assembly with the primary responsibility for holding the Executive accountable. That is all we seek to do with this motion.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Mitchell for sharing his time. I had not intended to speak on this <Col N="148" /> issue until I heard the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin's statement, which saddened and depressed me.

      <P>She used those tragedies and the memory of those tragedies to cover up for people going about unlawful business. I expected more from the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin. I wish her well but she has got off to a wrong start. She is suffering from the malaise that afflicted the Fianna Fáil Party when I came into this House. Suffering from the malaise of self-denial and weakness, she was not prepared to stand up and speak for herself but read a speech which was prepared for her. I would like to know who prepared it? Whose bidding was she doing? It is sad to see a young person used in that manner. That is the malaise.</P>
      <P>We know what Charlie Haughey was involved in and there were people close to him who knew what he was involved in. Ray Burke and P. Flynn knew what he was involved in. To quote Denis Foley at the tribunal, &ldquo;They were in denial&rdquo;. They did not want to know and pretended nothing was wrong. They decided to take a slice of the action and have brought disgrace on their families who are decent people.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach was involved in the funding and financing of the Fianna Fáil Party at Fianna Fáil headquarters. He signed the blank cheques. As one Fianna Fáil member said to me, they were lying around Fianna Fáil headquarters like confetti at a church gate for anybody to pick them up. He is the man who is now in charge of running this country. How would my business or yours operate if we were throwing blank cheques around for anybody to pick up. Does it make sense? There are questions to be answered. Ray Burke and P. Flynn have questions to answer. Those questions will not be asked by the Taoiseach. He will not face reality.</P>
      <P>Deputy John Bruton faced reality. There was reference here to a Minister in the coalition Government that he led with style and dignity. He removed the then Minister, Deputy Lowry, from office.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I thank Deputy Mitchell for sharing time. It should not have been necessary for Opposition parties to table this motion to get an explanation from the Taoiseach, in so far as he did when he came in here and gave some more information. The Taoiseach heard rumours in early December that Deputy Foley might have been involved in shady offshore accounts and I am stunned he waited until 15 December before calling the Deputy in to get the full story. I am astounded that on hearing the stunning story Deputy Foley had to tell, the Taoiseach waited another six weeks until Deputy Foley was flushed out on the eve of the Moriarty tribunal hearings. If the Taoiseach was serious and genuinely outraged at the incredible actions of Deputy Foley involving offshore scams, while he was sitting on the sub-committee of the Committee of Public Accounts investigating the major banks on the same issues, he would have called him in within minutes of hearing the rumour. The Taoiseach does not seem to know the telephone has been invented or what it is for. He should have called a press conference immediately and announced the dismissal of Deputy Foley from the Committee of Public Accounts and the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party and apologised to the people that a member nominated by his party to the Committee of Public Accounts had behaved in this fashion.</P>
      <P>I am amazed at the Taoiseach's tolerance of the outrageous swindling behaviour of certain former leading members of Fianna Fáil. Even tonight, in relation to these people who have done wrong, he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;.where action is required it should . be done in a humane way, with some compassion for the feelings of the individual concerned. It is better from every point of view, if the individual can be brought to understand the action that is required, and that they acknowledge the justice of it, by taking the necessary steps them<Col N="150" /> selves. On occasion, a little space may need to be given.</P>

        <b>:</b> There will be space for her in the Bridewell overnight and space before a District Court judge in the morning and there will be space, for a few months perhaps, in Mountjoy for the crime. If an unfortunate heroine addict steals a bag containing less than £1,000 he or she will have loads of space &ndash; six years in Mountjoy, reduced on appeal from nine years. The Taoiseach came in here and appealed for compassion for millionaire swindlers while the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform sat poker-faced beside him. There is one law for the banks and another for the poor.</P>
      <P>This morning we had notification of a massive bank robbery carried out not with a syringe or a gun but with the weapon of the Irish Constitution by some of the most powerful bankers in the country. Bunreacht na hÉireann is rapidly becoming an overcrowded refuge for scoundrels. We have heard about the flag being the last refuge for scoundrels, but Bunreacht na hÉireann is now the refuge for scoundrels under which they want to save themselves hundreds of millions of pounds that should be paying to make up for their crimes of tax evasion in the past.</P>
      <P>The banks are not the only ones I could mention. The abolition of ground rents is prevented according to the Constitution. Rampant speculation in building land is banned according to the Constitution and control of the power of private landlords may not be possible. The Taoiseach pleaded for compassion for these people.</P>
      <P>It was incredulous to listen to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government minimise the seriousness of tax evasion by saying it was the badge of honour at an earlier time, presumably in the 1970s and 1980s. It was no badge of honour for the PAYE worker who paid through the nose for every penny earned while some earned the badge of honour by massive swindling. This same Minister has no compunction in imposing extra taxation on PAYE workers who are already badly hit. In the past few weeks in Drogheda thousands of people have been taking to the streets in opposition to a new local tax in the form of a refuse charge. The council wants to impose £110 on them for the first time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has taken away the minor concessions granted to low paid workers in the budget and, apparently, has no compassion for the hard <Col N="151" /> pressed PAYE workers and the lower paid, whom he is happy to see carry this extra burden of taxation while he sits on thousands of millions of pounds of an Exchequer surplus.</P>
    <P>The Ansbacher list of names should be published. It is held in secret by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and is, no doubt, known to some of their advisers. It is capable of being used as a weapon as they choose to damage others politically in a dishonest fashion. The list raises the link between big business and politics, which involves many of the establishment parties in the House, but that is another day's work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion because the questions it raises are reasonable and should be answered by the Taoiseach. This is not about hounding a Deputy or badgering a Taoiseach. The case of Deputy Foley is very serious because of his membership of the Committee of Public Accounts, which has investigated the type of activities in which he is now implicated. The tribunal is doing its work and should be allowed to continue, but the House also has the right to demand accountability and if legitimate questions cannot be asked and answered forthrightly in the House then Deputies have very little function here.</P>
      <P>In opposing the motion last night a number of Government Deputies referred to the peace process and criticised those supporting the motion for doing so at a time when the peace process, and all its difficulties, is currently in crisis. I reject this spurious argument. It ill serves the peace process for Government Deputies to attempt to use it as a means of avoiding legitimate questions and castigating those who raise them.</P>
      <P>Equally ill served by such spurious arguments are the majority of Fianna Fáil Deputies and Senators who are without question honest in their dealings. Members and supporters of Fianna Fáil are disgusted by the succession of revelations and the conduct of senior members of their party, including a former Taoiseach and a former Minister. They are also deeply unhappy at the manner in which these matters have been handled by the leadership of their party.</P>
      <P>Last week the Flood tribunal heard how Mr. Oliver Barry contributed £35,000 to former Deputy Ray Burke, then Minister for Communications, in the wake of a succession of actions and decisions by him favourable to Mr. Barry's Century Radio. Not long ago this in itself would have constituted a major scandal, but the public and the media are so jaded with the tide of sleaze that it is regarded as just another day at the tribunal. In some measure this mood is exemplified by the attendance in the Press Gallery this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand Deputy Foley has resigned from the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party. There was no other course open to him, given his evidence at the Moriarty tribunal. This is a difficult time for the Deputy and his family. I have no doubt that at a personal level he has the sympathy of <Col N="152" /> people inside and outside the House and on that level I empathise with those feelings.</P>
    <P>However, the motion is not addressed to Deputy Foley. It concerns the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and the issue of accountability. The Taoiseach's words in the Dáil on 3 June 1998 are in the motion. His key point on that occasion was that full and frank explanations should not have to be extracted by tribunals of inquiry from people who have enjoyed trust and responsibility in public life.</P>
    <P>The facts in Deputy Foley's case had to be extracted by a tribunal. There were no full and frank explanations. The question is what did the Taoiseach ask of the Deputy or what information, if any, was given to the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste? These are legitimate questions. I have no hesitation, therefore, in supporting the motion.</P>
    <P>If these questions are not dealt with in a full and frank way in the Dáil, the perception will grow that public accountability for public representatives can only be guaranteed when they are hauled before tribunals. That would be an appalling judgment on the condition of politics in the State and on the dominant political culture, not of one party, but of those parties who have formed successive Governments. It is time to discard that legacy once and for all.</P>

      <P>Ethics in this country are strange in that they appear to focus entirely around finance. There are, of course, other ethical issues facing the State. I find it odd to be lectured on ethics by the last speaker, but that is an issue for another day.</P>
      <P>Many years ago I was given a gift of a book entitled <i>The Devil in Massachusetts</i>, the subject matter of which subsequently became the basis of another great work of literature, <i>The Crucible</i>. The books dealt with witch hunts and a society which was consumed on the issue of the search for scapegoats. In recent years reports of Dáil debates have increasingly read like early drafts of either of these works.</P>

      <P>I realise that listening to others is foreign to Members on those benches with the Deputy, but I ask him for five minutes of his time. I have no time for tax dodgers, irrespective of their political hue and I am disappointed, saddened and let down by the recent issues involving Deputy Foley. I have already said this to my party.</P>
      <P>Throughout my life I have been a compliant PAYE taxpayer and like all other compliant taxpayers I am angered at the incidence of tax dodging, dishonesty and the willingness of large sectors of society to apparently accept these activities. For far too long tax dodging has been a national pastime in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts did us a considerable service in revealing the existence of <Col N="153" /> almost a quarter of a million bogus DIRT tax accounts. These investigations also revealed the willing, at times more than willing, compliance of the banks and financial institutions in that tax dodge. The Ansbacher revelations show another dimension to this issue, namely, the extent to which the once respected professions have now allowed themselves to become involved in the tax dodging industry. However, rather than focusing on the extent of tax dodging, Members of the House and the media are daily seeking scapegoats. In doing so we are allowing the major issue to be obscured and are behaving in a manner that would do justice to the burghers of Salem.</P>
    <P>There is a problem with tax compliance in this country. There is a also problem with people who dodge or deduct their tax and then refuse to pay their fair share. Indeed, there are people in this country who do not pay for anything. The 200,000 DIRT dodgers were not all politicians, nor were the politicians involved all members of Fianna Fáil. The same can be said about the Ansbacher accounts.</P>
    <P>At this stage we should be seeking solutions, not scapegoats. However, before turning to solutions, I wish to touch further on the matter of Deputy Foley. We in this State pride ourselves on being both a Christian nation and one that respects the rule of law. The law that applies in the State is not that of the lynch mob. An essential part of a civilised society and law is that we observe due process. Deputy Foley, like Deputy Lowry and other Deputies who have found themselves in difficulties in this House over the years, is entitled to due process. Indeed, other Deputies have been in difficulty for matters I would regard as more serious and more heinous than tax dodging. However, irrespective of how we may feel individually &ndash; I feel a sense of personal anger about tax dodging &ndash; every Deputy is entitled to the benefit of due process.</P>
    <P>The last speaker said he had some sympathy for Deputy Foley. I am sure Deputy Foley will take comfort in this. In the past 72 hours the Deputy has been hounded, humiliated, has apologised for his conduct, has resigned his membership of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party, which is dear to him, and will resign his position on the party's ard comhairle. In due course he will pay the debts which are due. I do not know what more can be expected of him. However, I expect the House to expend its energy in preventing further recurrences.</P>
    <P>Instead of the endless efforts at scapegoating, the House and the political parties should be seeking solutions to problems. Fianna Fáil has just concluded an internal ethical code which will shortly be endorsed by the Ard-Fheis. It has produced some mirth on the Labour benches &ndash; let them produce a better code of ethics. It is reasonable to ask other parties what they are doing and when we will see their ethical codes. However, I do not want to develop the issue of scapegoating as I find myself slipping into the train of thought I find so odious.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="154" /> It is a matter for each party to decide the rules which will govern the internal behaviour of their members. The vast majority of people who have served in the Labour Party, Fine Gael and the other political parties and the Independents are honourable and decent people doing their best. We may not always reach the high standard expected of us, but at least it can be said that we are doing our best to make some contribution.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas to put in place mechanisms governing overall behaviour, something we have started to do. The first steps are in place with the Ethics in Public Office Act, which has flaws, and the electoral legislation which has also gone some way in this direction. As far back as December 1994 the necessity of putting in place an ethics commission was explored. The idea has been in the air for a long time &ndash; it has been gestating for five years. We are all to blame for the fact that the necessary legislation in this regard has not been enacted. The major parties have been in office at one time or another over the past five years. I prepared the original draft of the proposals for an ethics commission in those heady days at the end of November and early December 1994. I think the proposals were endorsed &ndash; certainly the Labour Party was very pleased to accept them as they were in line with the party's thinking. The proposals were also in line with Fianna Fáil thinking.</P>
    <P>None of us have the right to claim a monopoly on moral standing in any of these issues. To the extent that Members in my party have let the House down, they have also let the tradition of the party down. The party was born out of austere honesty &ndash; that is what attracted me most to Fianna Fáil. Unlike many people, I was not born into a political party, but rather chose to join a political party because of the contribution it had made and because of my personal admiration for those who founded it. This is not to say I had less than admiration for the founders of other parties, but I found an intellectual resonance in what the founders of Fianna Fáil sought to do.</P>
    <P>I believe the party has been let down and politics is let down by the manner in which we are now behaving. It would be a better service to people, the nation, politics and democracy if we invested our combined energies in shaping the future rather than trying to put a political spin on the past. The legislation for an ethics commission is, I understand, making progress and I wish it speed. We can expect to see it within months &ndash; I hope we see it within weeks. Is it too much to expect energies to be focused on producing good legislation which can become a model, as has our Freedom of Information Act, rather than on the endless, spurious and ultimately pointless motions which are tabled in the House which ultimately get us nowhere?</P>
    <P>At the end of the day all Members are human beings and are no better or worse for that. They are fallible and, sadly, Deputy Foley has not met the standards we require on this side of the House. He is now going to pay for that, which is <Col N="155" /> not an easy thing. Rather than endless recrimination we would serve the nation better if we made progress in the manner I have identified.</P>

      <P>It is clear from the speeches from the Government benches that Members opposite did not read the terms of the motion and did everything in their power to avoid answering any of the questions put by the House last night. This debate is about the Taoiseach's and the Tánaiste's state of knowledge regarding Deputy Foley and his questioning by the Moriarty tribunal. The House is entitled to answers and it is an insult for the Taoiseach to come before the House and refuse to give answers. Tonight he continued to fudge the issue. As Deputy John Bruton said, he loves leaving smudges. When I was Minister for Justice I launched AFIS, the automated fingerprint investigation system, a magical new system. It would be needed here to find the Taoiseach's fingerprints on anything to do with his party.</P>
      <P>Once again the assassins have struck and a Fianna Fáil member has left the parliamentary party. The Taoiseach appears shocked and surprised, as if saying it has nothing to do with him and asking how it happened. He got an &ldquo;inkling&rdquo; in early December &ndash; gossip from the Attorney General which presumably was gossip from the Tánaiste who was told by Gerard Ryan. We were not told how Mr. Ryan came by this information and are left with no answers to the questions Deputy Bruton raised last night.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach implied he met Deputy Foley after the launch of the Public Accounts Committee report. Surely, the Taoiseach must have known, when he saw Members of the Committee of Public Accounts walking across the plinth carrying copies of the report, including their great Chairman, Jim Mitchell, all taking the praise of the land, that Deputy Foley's participation in that launch was a hypocritical farce of huge proportions. Yet on 16 December, the day after he met Deputy Foley, the Taoiseach congratulated the sub-committee of the Committee of Public Accounts for its DIRT report in this House. He praised the members' dedication. Yet at the same time he knew that the vice chairman of the committee, who paraded across the plinth beaming with the other Members, was fatally flawed. However, the Taoiseach did nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach's statement confirms that he never asked Deputy Foley a single question that might have given him information. If he had information he would have had to do something about it &ndash; a position it seems into which the Taoiseach could not be put. He never asked Deputy Foley if he had an Ansbacher account, but rather asked &ldquo;What is this all about?&rdquo;  He never asked him if the account he had with Des Traynor was held offshore or what his tax liability might be. Yet the Taoiseach was able to tell the House that Deputy Foley told him he was getting his affairs in order. The Taoiseach did not ask the <Col N="156" /> questions because, in typical style, he did not want to know the answers so that he could go around saying &ldquo;I know nothing, I never heard it, nobody told me&rdquo;. He is the Taoiseach and how could he be expected to be distracted from opening barber shops in his constituency, a coffee shop in Limerick or a pig sty somewhere else. The Taoiseach seemed to be saying that his charisma was built on such things and that he could not be asked to puncture it by daring to ask a Deputy to say what was going on and how serious matters were.</P>

      <P>It is mind boggling what the Taoiseach expects us to believe. I am sure Deputy Foley was not a constant visitor to the Taoiseach's office. I never saw him going over there. He was a backbencher, although a senior one being vice chairman of the most senior committee in the House. He did not go on many walks to the Taoiseach's office. However, on 15 December he was invited to the Taoiseach's chamber, probably his first time in that hallowed office.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach did not ask him whether he had an account, owed tax, broke the exchange control laws or what discussions he had with the tribunal. I can understand somebody saying that the tribunal must make the final decision on this, but that the Taoiseach is the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party. A member of his party sat on the Committee of Public Accounts Sub-committee on Certain Revenue Matters and he knew that its report would be published the following day. He also expected that in the weeks following the publication of this report much praise would be heaped on the sub-committee for its excellent work, yet he sat idly by and did nothing.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach told the House that Deputy Foley was thinking about resigning from the Committee of Public Accounts. Leadership required the Taoiseach to ask him to resign from that committee immediately and if it transpired that what was alleged did not occur his membership of that committee could have been considered again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was the Taoiseach's prerogative to appoint Deputy Foley to the committee and it was also his prerogative to ask him to resign. Earlier we were informed that Deputy Foley tendered his resignation from membership of that committee. It appears that every time the Taoiseach did not want to know what was happening he sent three or four intermediaries, including the Government Chief Whip, the Minister of State, Deputy Séamus Brennan &ndash; the great nanny of our time &ndash; to do his business. He did not ask Deputy Foley what was happening at the tribunal, whether he would leave the parliamentary party or resign from membership of the committee, but instead asked some backbenchers who were friendly with the Deputy to ask him what he intended doing. These people were asked to tell <Col N="157" /> Deputy Foley that he was not wanted in the parliamentary party and it would better for him if he left. The picture painted is mind boggling.</P>

      <P>The Government will be compromised by having to depend on the support of a man whose reputation is seriously flawed and who has serious questions to answer about tax evasion and the breaking of exchange control regulations. The Government will depend on his vote to continue in office. We are entitled to know what promises have been made to Deputy Foley in return for his undivided support for the Government. The Government will fall if the Deputy is absent for a vote, and that is a clear indication that a deal has been struck with him to ensure his support.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach told the House that when he met Deputy Foley, who was probably completely overawed in his hallowed chamber, he reminded him that it was Fianna Fáil policy to co-operate with tribunals. Is the Taoiseach not aware that under our laws people must co-operate with tribunals and that it is not a badge of honour exclusive to the Fianna Fáil Party? Deputy Foley is obliged by law to co-operate with tribunals and it should not be a matter for the Taoiseach to tell him that he is obliged to do so.</P>
      <P>The bizarre account by the Taoiseach of his meeting with Deputy Foley does not answer several of the questions raised in the motion, which was not as broad as the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science or the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, who had his £600,000 PR look about him, sought to imply. It is a specific, targeted motion which seeks to obtain information because the House has been denied it. We are aware of where the denial of information has led us on previous occasions. Bad replies were given to parliamentary questions and as a result the beef tribunal, which cost approximately £30 million, ensued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, one of the longest serving Members, should know better than anybody how to answer questions and provide information. He has hidden behind the rulings of the Ceann Comhairle, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the tribunal and the Attorney General with no thought of his own or sense of responsibility. He did not say, as he should have, that he was the Taoiseach, the leader of the country, and that he would be <Col N="158" /> not be made to look small by shoving around at the edges and leaving smudges.</P>
    <P>Did anybody else attend the meeting between the Taoiseach and Deputy Foley? Did the Taoiseach communicate the details of that meeting to anybody? Did he keep a note of what transpired for his memoirs? The Taoiseach is aware of how serious it is not to keep a note of what takes place at such meetings. He told the House that he discussed the fact that Deputy Foley was &ldquo;facing difficulties&rdquo; with the Tánaiste. An example of a person &ldquo;facing difficulties&rdquo; is a nasty county councillor trying to take the Deputy's seat in his constituency. Deputy Foley faced questioning by the tribunal and had already been questioned by its lawyers in a private session. He knew at that stage the range of questions he was likely to be asked at a public hearing. He may not have had all his answers ready but he certainly told the Taoiseach that he had already attended a private session with the tribunal's lawyers. There is no doubt that he knew of the seriousness of issues he would be questioned on, yet all the Taoiseach told the Tánaiste was that one of his members was &ldquo;facing difficulties&rdquo; and that they did not have a detailed discussion with that person. He also told her not to worry about it.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach then said that he respected the Tánaiste's statutory obligations. Did she have the Ansbacher list? Did the Attorney General have the second list? Who gave the list to the Tánaiste if Padraig Collery gave it to the tribunal? Does she or the Attorney General have a special link with the tribunal whereby information is fed to them and she decides which bits to tell the Taoiseach? The Taoiseach was listed in the Companies (Amendment) (No 2) Act, 1999, as one of a group who would receive the Gerard Ryan report. Even if the Tánaiste was providing the Taoiseach with information about the tribunal or the investigation into the Ansbacher accounts, he still had a statutory function. It is hard to believe that they did not ask each other what else they knew about this matter because the Taoiseach was entitled to that information. The Tánaiste included a provision in the Companies (Amendment) (No 2) Act, 1999, under which the Taoiseach would receive a copy of Mr. Ryan's report in July 1999. Why was she suddenly coy about providing the rest of the information she had in her possession? Is this the list that is being touted by journalists? One television station has stated that it has another list in its possession.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis is approaching. The party will take out the file entitled &ldquo;Ethics&rdquo; and dust it down. Party members will scratch their corporate heads and wonder what they will do about it next year. The ethics commission is a mirage and neither sight nor light of it has been seen. It was promised throughout 1999 and we think that it will be ready later this year. Deputy Foley has resigned from the Fianna Fáil Party. What has the nanny of all nannies been told about his role in minding the Deputy? We will table parliamentary questions to ascertain <Col N="159" /> whether the Independents' room has been made bigger to accommodate Deputy Foley when they meet the Government Chief Whip every Tuesday. What will Deputies Healy-Rae and Fox think about the newest member of their special club?</P>

      <P>It was interesting to note those who contributed to the debate. The Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, in 1997 at a time when she did not have a hope in hell of becoming a Minister of State, quoted the following conclusion by Mr. Justice McCracken:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite unacceptable that a member of Dáil Éireann, and, in particular a Cabinet Minister and Taoiseach, should be supported in his <Col N="160" /> personal lifestyle by gifts made to him personally.</P>
    <P>She further stated:</P>
    <P>Our conduct as Members of the House and in matters which relate to our membership must always be open to public scrutiny. Of necessity, that means as public representatives our affairs must be open to a greater public interest .</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach flattered us with a quote from Seamus Heaney's <i>Beowulf</i>; he is terribly intelligent, our Taoiseach. Let me remind the Taoiseach of the end of another great piece of literature, <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, which is also appropriate to him and his party. It states: &ldquo;So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>In my contribution last week I dealt with some of the frustrations experienced by applicants as a result of delays in dealing with planning applications. I hope these can be addressed in the Bill, particularly delays in relation to planning applications for single houses. In many cases these are straightforward but on the day or the day before the two month period expires further information is generally sought from the applicant. This delays the applicant getting planning permission for at least another two months. This should not happen in planning applications, particularly straightforward, once-off single house applications.</P>
      <P>The maximum period in which further information should be sought after an application has been lodged should be two weeks. If further information on a planning application is required, it is as easy to seek it or to discover that further information is required in the two weeks after the application is lodged as in the two months. The resulting delay can cause great frustration because the applicant might have a builder and other tradesmen lined up to build the house. It is unnecessary.</P>
      <P>There are also delays at An Bord Pleanála level and these should also be dealt with in legislation. Currently, An Bord Pleanála can take three months to deal with a planning application. If at the end of that period the board is not ready, has not made a decision or is overworked, it can extend the time to a further three months. This should be dealt with in the Bill. The maximum time for An Bord Pleanála to deal with an application should be three months and there should be no option to extend it.</P>
      <P>Planning offices should be provided with the necessary staff to carry out their functions. They are often required to deal with numerous new Government and EU directives which add more to the burden of planning staff. Staff are periodically moved from one section to another to deal with these directives, yet the planning office is not allowed to recruit additional staff. This must be examined and addressed by the Minister and the Department.</P>
      <P>I foresee a difficulty with section 34, which deals with the £20 fee for appeals, in that appeals to An Bord Pleanála will only be accepted from someone who has originally appealed the decision at local level. A person may examine a planning application and decide there is no need to appeal it, yet the granting of the permission may be with conditions which might not be acceptable to the person who did not appeal. One cannot know that until a decision is made at local level, so it is unfair to debar a person from appealing a decision to An Bord Pleanála on the grounds that he or she did not lodge an appeal at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some councils allow for what is known as a prior notice on an application whereby, if a prior notice is placed on a file, the person who placed <Col N="163" /> it will be advised two or three days before the decision is made if there is difficulty with the file. He or she will not be advised if there is no difficulty because it is unnecessary. Some councils implement the system. Is it at the discretion of the council or is it a legal requirement for councils to implement the prior notice system?</P>
    <P>A section deals with permission for building and development by local authorities. It is a matter which can be dealt with on Committee Stage by an amendment, but I would like clarification on it now from the Minister. If a local authority carries out a local authority development in its own area, is there a provision in the Bill whereby this decision can be appealed to An Bord Pleanála? If there is, it is a dangerous and unusual development. At present, if a local authority builds a housing scheme in its area, it must undergo something similar to a planning application. Naturally it cannot apply to itself for permission, but it undergoes a public notice process and invites submissions. The decision goes before councillors who decide to sanction or not to sanction the permission. That is a much more democratic way of dealing with permissions than the normal way of dealing with them. It would be unnecessary and frustrating for local authorities in their house building programmes if third parties could appeal to An Bord Pleanála after such a democratic process had been undergone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister in his presentation of the Bill. It fulfils the specific commitment given in the programme for Government and it will address many matters which have needed attention for a long time. It contains radical new measures for housing supply. I wish it had gone further in certain respects but I am sure any shortfalls which become apparent when it is enacted will be addressed in future legislation.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Bill, statutory recognition is given to regional planning strategies undertaken by regional authorities. This represents a significant empowerment of those bodies. For the first time ever, the Bill allows for structural ranking of plans from national to local development level. The Ireland of the new millennium needs planning laws to take account of the unprecedented growth which has taken place, particularly in the past few years. The Bill not only addresses matters relevant to local planning authorities in their current roles, it also allows matters to be tackled on a regional basis. It enhances the powers of regional authorities in terms of strategies for the regions they represent. These changes are long overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cork Corporation's local authority area is greatly in need of expansion. It is severely limited by the reluctance of the neighbouring authority, Cork County Council, to allow for the extension of the city boundaries. Cork city is corralled by Cork County Council and is hemmed in on all sides. The area neighbouring the city should be under the control of a greater Cork city and <Col N="164" /> county planning authority which would take into consideration areas from the centre up to a six to 12 mile area limit. This would allow for the growth which is inhibited at present. Any developments at this stage are done piecemeal and that is not the way local authorities should do their business. To be cost-effective, they must plan and work together.</P>
    <P>All city services reach out to the edge of Cork city and development in a greater Cork city area would be considerably enhanced by the availability of those services. It would be of immense benefit to Cork County Council as well as to Cork Corporation but the council insists on &ldquo;greenbelting&rdquo; the entire ring of Cork city and allowing for its own developments in satellite towns around the city. It would greatly enhance the possibility of providing additional housing for an authority which is rapidly running out of land for the essential needs of those who wish to be housed. Land must be made available to all city authorities so that they can address the pressing need to acquire land to develop sites and estates to reduce the spiralling waiting lists for local authority housing and private housing. There is also a great demand for land for private building and commercial development which would generate employment in the areas where businesses are located.</P>
    <P>Another matter which needs to be addressed is the restrictive nature of A3 zoning in county authority areas. This planning rule is unconstitutional. I cannot accept that persons can be lawfully forbidden from building a home where they can purchase a site. The stipulation that they can be refused planning permission on the grounds that they have not lived in close proximity to the site for seven years is unlawful. What would be the reaction of county authorities and those who live in rural areas if urban authorities such as Cork Corporation placed similar restrictions on persons wishing to build within the city boundaries? I would anticipate an outburst on the grounds of human rights being violated. I will never understand why this ruling has not been challenged in the national courts or in the European Court. Cork County Council has this policy in place.</P>
    <P>Public representatives are often faced with the problem of seeking information about planning decisions. They regularly meet with prospective home owners who have chosen a site on which to build their future home. In the event of their application for permission to build being refused, they normally go to a public representative to seek advice. They ask how they might resubmit an acceptable proposal or they seek a logical explanation for the application's rejection. The decision is often based on density of housing, road access, land drainage and other excuses or reasons. The normal response to any representations is that the planners must adhere to the guidelines imposed on them by a development plan. When the unsuccessful applicants are told this, they invariably quote instances where the <Col N="165" /> exception seems to be the rule. They bring the local representative on site to show examples of recent planning permission decisions in the neighbouring locality which seem to contradict the reasons given to them for their refusal. Planning decisions appear to be arbitrary and this is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that, in the Bill, compliance with a housing strategy is part of the proper planning and development of an area. Under section 86, housing strategies may be drawn up jointly by planning authorities. I proposed this recently at a meeting of Cork Corporation but nothing meaningful arose from it. It will only work if Cork Corporation and Cork County Council co-operate and work together, and I fear they will not. Local authorities throughout the country jealously guard their areas and will not co-operate with other local authorities.</P>
    <P>Under the new housing strategy, local authority housing must be available to those who qualify for it. Some who need housing may not qualify for social housing but they may not be able to afford their own homes.</P>
    <P>There is provision for as much as 20% of land which is being developed to be made available for local authorities. This proposal is causing contention with the CIF and other development agencies but the Minister is determined to proceed with it.</P>
    <P>Building more homes means that there will be more local authority and private housing estates. The taking in charge of estates is causing a great problem in many local authority areas, particularly in the Cork County Council area. There has been blatant neglect of this matter by Cork County Council. The large number of estates not taken in charge is unacceptable. Many of these estates have been waiting for far too many years, some as many as 21 years. The inordinate delays are not acceptable and the reasons given for the dragging of heels do not stand up to scrutiny. I understand that £1 million would be required for Cork County Council to take in charge estates at the edges of towns which have been waiting for the past 15 or 20 years. We in Cork Corporation put £250,000 from our revenue account into a fund to complete unfinished estates which were left uncompleted by builders who went into liquidation or otherwise.</P>
    <P>The abuse of the right of persons to make third party objections to planning applications causes major problems. It is totally unacceptable that persons living up to 100 miles or more away can lodge objections to applications for planning in an area in which they do not reside and which is far removed from their own homes. I commend the Minister for making the relevant changes. The right of objection should apply only to persons or bodies that are locally based. Objections should be accepted only if they are based on logical and sustainable grounds. Far too many objections are made in the name of the environment when the real motivation is jealousy and begrudgery. We have all seen the &ldquo;thou shalt not have&rdquo; mentality <Col N="166" /> in action. The Bull McCabe was not the only man to begrudge his neighbour her land. John B. Keane made a very shrewd analysis of a facet of our Irish character when he wrote his classic, <i>The Field.</i>We are all aware of the underlying reality in relation to housing. Planning is the key issue. Until such time as this problem is tackled, nothing will change. For many years we have been tinkering at the edges of problems created by the current planning laws. We are now introducing positive measures to help An Bord Pleanála deal with rezoning appeals. Unfortunately, such measures only partly alleviate the problem and other changes must take place. A number of complaints have been made about the time limit for planning decisions. Many people have complained that planners seem to look for loopholes to enable them to delay planning decisions that they cannot resolve because of a heavy workload. I have seen offices in planning departments where applications sit on the floor in bundles, identified by date tags. I was told this is due to the lack of personnel to tackle the backlog. The staff involved should not be working in pressurised conditions caused by staff shortages. The public deserves a better service than this. Both public and staff deserve better.</P>
    <P>The Bill addresses the matter of the time allowed for planning decisions. The maximum period of waiting for confirmation of planning has been reduced from eight weeks to seven weeks. Where the planning authority requires further information on the application, the additional period during which a final decision must be made has been cut from two months to four weeks. This is a step in the right direction that will be welcomed by those making planning applications. I note some of the changes being introduced to streamline the planning system. I welcome the fact that pre-planning discussions are provided for. Revised outline permission proposals will give a greater guarantee of the granting of full planning permission and those who apply for planning permission will be pleased with the change in the Bill that stipulates that a local authority cannot refuse full planning if it is sought within three years of a successful application for outline planning permission. There is also a stipulation that third parties must initially lodge their objections locally, prior to submitting them to An Bord Pleanála. I agree with this and disagree with Opposition speakers and with those who have given media interviews tonight on this matter. Fees must now be paid for the submission of observations on planning to the planning authority. I agree with this also. Development plans will now be up to date, speedier procedures will be in place for varying and amending development plans and a person must prove a substantial interest before taking a judicial review of a planning decision.</P>
    <P>I express my satisfaction with all these measures, particularly the provision regarding judicial review. This will ensure that persons or <Col N="167" /> bodies not affected directly by planning decisions will find it harder to make objections just for the sake of it. There is no use in setting planning targets unless the plans are dealt with effectively. They must also take into account the radically changed economic, technological and environmental conditions of today's Ireland. We must adopt and enforce a strategic approach that will enable our development aims to be achieved in relation to local, regional and national objectives. The role of the public in this regard is of prime importance. Prior consultation with the public is vital but it must be enabled to contribute in a positive way to the preparation of our development plans. This will help us to avoid the confrontation and delays which occur when major changes are introduced at the end of the preparation process. It will also help to ensure that plans will be prepared and adopted within specified time limits and it is vitally important that all elected representatives are involved in the policy making function of planning.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out the development plan system. This provides the framework within which decisions are made and incorporates a control system for decision making on planning applications and on provisions made for the preparation of housing strategies. This will ensure that adequate land is zoned for housing and the emphasis is to be put on the provision of sufficient social and affordable housing. The Bill has comprehensively addressed the many issues that needed to be addressed under this heading.</P>
    <P>The Bill's provisions are directed at the need for streamlining and greater speed in dealing with planning of public and private developments. There is a growing need for greater efficiency in the process. There will be a welcome for the move to ensure that administrative fees in relation to submissions on planning applications will be at a low level. This will ensure that persons will not be deterred from making submissions on cost grounds.</P>
    <P>The Bill further sets out the grounds for development contribution costs. This is very important. Local authorities must set out the basis for determining the levy. They must give a breakdown of the contribution in regard to the services &ndash; roads, community facilities, water and ancillary services. I wholly endorse and welcome this provision.</P>
    <P>The mobile phone has taken the country by storm. There are now more than one million mobile phone users in Ireland. We cannot ignore the importance of this development and the impact the next generation of mobile phones &ndash; the third generation &ndash; will have on our daily lives. Through this technology we will have high-speed access to the Internet via our mobile phones. In addition, we will have the mobile video phone; its palm size will let us see who we are talking to and allow us to make electronic transactions, e-mail people, browse the Internet, organise our diaries and recognise handwriting on <Col N="168" /> a larger screen. In addition, the mobile phone will have many business applications in the future. Within a few years there will be hundreds of millions of mobile phones capable of accessing the Internet and processing electronic transactions. Already e-commerce transactions are estimated to be worth more than $100 billion per year. By the year 2003, the number of transactions will have risen to one trillion.</P>
    <P>As an economy heavily dependent on high technology, we must prepare for this development. Ireland is poised to be at the forefront of this revolution. To achieve this a proper up-to-date infrastructural network must be provided nationwide. I understand from the mobile telephone utility companies that up to 300 new base stations per annum will be required for the next five years.</P>
    <P>In its present form the Bill could potentially thwart rather than encourage this key development. The third generation mobile phone system will have such a revolutionary effect on our lives that it needs to be treated as an essential utility which will support our social and economic development. The national development plan clearly states that future public policy will be designed to increase the capacity of the economy and that the lack of telecommunications services will hinder business in the new e-commerce area. The plan specifically refers to the importance of a modern and efficient telecommunications network. The telecommunications-electronic commerce sector has a key input to make to our continued economic development. The development of this infrastructure must commence soon; otherwise Ireland will fall behind other industrialised nations and many parts of the country will be further disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>The Bill will give effect to the 1996 telecommunications planning guidelines of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. A number of deficiencies have emerged, particularly in relation to how they apply to residential areas, temporary permissions, local authorities creating exclusion zones and monitoring of emissions. The Bill risks perpetuating these deficiencies and giving them the force of law. Its proposals do not adequately reflect the country's needs in the area of telecommunications and mobile telecommunications in particular. I ask my colleague from Cork to look at this matter with his officials.</P>
    <P>New developments in antenna technology have given us structures which look like standard street lamps. The ugly mast on the mountainside, overlooking large urban areas will soon be extinct. These installations offer great opportunities to local authorities to combine the various utility requirements and there is a window of opportunity to create a revenue stream from these structures. To provide for this, an appropriate clause or section should be inserted in the Bill which should have regard to the strategy on telecommunications outlined in the national development plan. I understand antennae between 500 <Col N="169" /> and 600 metres apart will be required to cater for the third generation mobile phone system.</P>

      <P>This is of one of the key Bills which will determine our quality of life well into the new century. It will determine whether individuals will be in a position to access jobs and services in the areas in which they live in the next ten, 20 or 30 years. Following initial perusal, however, it appears that it lacks sufficient vision to ensure planning in the future will take account of the need to integrate housing with services and adequate infrastructure. My constituents sit in traffic jams for anything up to one hour to get to and from work. This journey can be prolonged for those who have to access child care services en route to their place of employment.</P>
      <P>The huge struggle which has to be endured is not all down to planning. Resources and inadequate public transport provision also have a bearing on the accessibility of services and employment. I hope my criticisms of the Bill and those of my party will be adequately addressed on Committee Stage. Nevertheless the planning process has a major role to play in the development of the environment in which we live and work.</P>
      <P>As it stands, the Bill fails to address the serious quality of life issues which are under severe strain because of the pressure being placed on existing infrastructure. During the past 40 years or so we have moved from a predominantly rural based to an urban based society but we have failed to put in place structures which adequately support a heavily urbanised society. The Bill does not provide safeguards to ensure communities can live in a clean, safe environment in which there is complete integration of the services and leisure facilities they require.</P>
      <P>The constituency of Dublin South Central presents some glaring examples where there is a clear failure to integrate housing with appropriate services and facilities. The result was the emergence of disadvantaged communities which have been characterised by problems of drugs, early school leaving and unemployment. The lessons of these poorly planned housing developments have not been sufficiently learned as is evidenced in a Bill which will allow more factories to be built and more shopping complexes to appear on the horizon. It also provides for some new housing. What it does not provide for is a definite commitment to green spaces, transport facilities and overall integration plans to bring work and home together in an acceptable integrated format.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today a campaign was launched to highlight the danger the Bill poses to the democratic process. I am happy to say that the Labour Party supports this campaign and will vigorously oppose the Government's proposal to introduce a £20 fee for objecting to planning permission. The Bill seriously erodes the rights of the public because for the first time citizens are being asked to pay a fee if they wish to submit an opinion or comment or objection to their local council about <Col N="170" /> a planning application. This proposal to charge ordinary citizens who wish to take an active part in the planning process makes the Bill highly anti-democratic and unjust. It effectively makes the planning process a commodity which will only be available to those with the money to pay for it. Will the Government include a new provision in the Social Welfare Bill which is to be published next week to allow hard-pressed social welfare recipients claim an extra £20 whenever they wish to avail of their democratic right to make an objection, comment or appeal in the planning process? </P>
    <P>It is often the most disadvantaged communities which have suffered the brunt of poor planning decisions. The Minister should be warned that these communities are now highly motivated and are prepared to take a stand in their development and will resist any attempt to mute their voices in the planning process. This is simply unacceptable. The planning system has been designed in such a manner as to allow the public to participate. Development plans must be publicly advertised and site notices placed for individual planning applications. The introduction of a fee will damage public participation in the planning process and most definitely discriminate against those who can least afford to pay.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes a range of other barriers to public participation in the planning process. The introduction of a fee to appeal planning decisions is another attempt to undermine democracy. The public can easily miss planning permission notices. Not everyone purchases newspapers every day and even if they do, not everyone will read the planning notices daily. Instead of penalising individuals if they miss the deadline for objecting to planning permission we should be seeking to make the process more transparent and democratic. The Bill seeks to do the opposite.</P>
    <P>The attempts to undermine democracy in the planning process do not end there. The Bill also attempts to limit a judicial review of a planning decision to those with a substantial interest in the development. Does this reference to substantial mean money, profits or property? If so I would not be surprised.</P>
    <P>Another significant element of the Bill is housing. The housing boom has been characterised by soaring profits for landowners and developers while the citizen in search of public or private property is expected to pay exorbitant prices for a home. If he cannot afford to pay he must join the housing waiting list which effectively means he must do without, because even the public house building programme over the next three years will hardly absorb the numbers currently waiting for housing, never mind the expected growth in the numbers seeking local authority housing.</P>
    <P>The Government lacks an overall strategy on housing. Only now, thanks to the Labour Party's initiative on a housing commission, have we arrived at a point where the Government is beginning to accept the notion of social housing <Col N="171" /> allocations. While the Bill provides for a 20% social housing provision, a provision largely motivated by Labour Party policy, I am concerned there will be a time lapse before the Bill is enacted which will allow landowners to dodge their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The housing crisis is bursting at the seams. Local authority waiting lists are completely out of control and, to date, the Government's programme for local authority house building has been inadequate. Our homelessness figures make us the disgrace of Europe. We may have the fastest growing economy in Europe but the economy is growing in a way which excludes vast numbers of people, including children, from the basic right to a roof over their heads. For those who have always assumed that at some point in their lives they would own a home, the new reality is that they must do without. They must continue to exist in the private rented sector which is completely unregulated and in which rent costs are highly unrealistic. I do not see how this Bill can rid our society of these problems.</P>
    <P>We must secure new land banks, particularly in urban centres, which are placed securely in the ownership of local authorities and which will provide housing based on access to services and adequate infrastructure.</P>

        <b>:</b> I welcome the Bill which allows us to put on record our views on planning delays, An Bord Pleanála, development plans etc. The Minister has invested a great deal of time and effort into bringing together all aspects of the planning process. The Bill, which runs to more than 200 pages, was significantly amended in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I have concerns about some of the provisions we are being asked to accept. The Minister wants to speed up the planning process and introduce affordable housing in order that people on local authority waiting lists and others who cannot afford to build their own houses can be housed as quickly as possible. I refer to a case in regard to Dúchas, the national heritage service, which is currently causing major building delays. I am aware of one builder who had to let 60 workers go in recent days because he was unable to obtain a licensing system from Dúchas.</P>
      <P>On 18 January, Dúchas issued a letter to people who had obtained planning permission but who required a licence to fulfil the conditions of the permission. The letter reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, there is a serious backlog of archaeological excavation licence applications waiting to be processed. The problem is compounded by an inability to update our essential database or to maintain our archive applications and incoming reports. In such a way, the professional integrity of the archaeological licensing system is undermined and urgent measures are required to resolve these problems. Therefore, no excavation licence applications will be processed from Monday, 17 Jan<Col N="172" /> uary for a period of eight weeks. Furthermore, we would recommend that no licence applications are forwarded to this office until further notice.</P>
    <P>According to people in the building industry, some 200 major developments are dependent on these licences being issued. In this era of computerisation, it seems strange that Dúchas is not in a position to deal with the applications which come before it efficiently and as a matter of urgency. I have already written to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in regard to this issue in reply to which I received some kind of holding letter recently. I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, to use his good offices to address this issue. While the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is attempting to speed up the process, another arm of Government is seriously delaying it. It is disgraceful that people are being advised not to forward applications to the office and that builders have had to let workers go because they are unable to obtain licences.</P>
    <P>I live in a county in which there has been a major increase in the number of planning applications over the past three years. The figure has risen from 1,400 to 3,500 in a three year period, thereby placing major burdens on the planning office and creating problems and delays in regard to planning decisions. There seems to be a great reluctance in County Wicklow to grant any planning decisions, as a result of which we are witnessing an influx of people from Dublin and Wicklow into Wexford.</P>

        <i>(Wexford)</i>
        <b>:</b> We have been trying to increase staff levels in Wexford County Council for the past year but it is very difficult to get qualified, experienced staff. People take up the positions for a month or two but then move into the private sector in which salaries and working conditions are far better. In some areas, as many as five different planning officers have been employed in a one year period. If the Minister is serious about dealing with planning issues, he must look at providing planning officers and technical staff with proper remuneration in order to encourage them to stay in local authorities.</P>
      <P>There does not appear to be any consistency among planning officers. There is not a problem obtaining planning permission for a two storey house, a red brick house or a house on a half acre site in one area of the county but similar applications are refused in another area. That is causing uproar in County Wexford and I am sure the same situation obtains elsewhere. If the Minister does not urgently address the remuneration issue, we will continue to experience difficulties in regard to planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Planning decisions must be granted within eight weeks but more often than not, planners will request additional information at the end of <Col N="173" /> the eight week period, prolonging the process by a further eight weeks. People may still have their applications refused at the end of the 16 week period. Even if permission is granted, major delays will have been experienced. Most people do not expect to have to wait such a long time for planning decisions. If people intend to build a house, they draw up their plans and apply for planning permission having done a deal with their builder to commence construction within a three month period at the latest. The delays incurred through the requests for additional information result in builders moving on elsewhere. The planning system is being clogged up as a result of planners seeking further particulars for the most flimsy reasons. Planners are often afraid to make decisions. They cover every angle and as a result there are major delays.</P>
    <P>An Bord Pleanála is probably the greatest delaying factor in the development of the building industry. I do not say that lightly. An Bord Pleanála wants extra time to deal with even the slightest of appeals &ndash; four months is turning into eight months. It is time to seriously look at its staffing levels, how it operates and perhaps the establishment of regional offices. It is hidden in Dublin, away from the hub of planning applications &ndash; there are another 25 counties which must be dealt with. Appeals are made to the board in Dublin. It is becoming a nightmare for developers and almost every application for large housing developments is being appealed. I am not questioning the right of people to object. However, I am questioning the long delays in An Bord Pleanála. Some say this is because of staffing levels and others say there is no great urgency to deal with appeals. The area needs to be seriously looked at. The establishment of regional offices, based on existing regions, should be examined.</P>
    <P>The previous Deputy mentioned the £10 fee for an appeal. I welcome that because there are many cranks and others who object for little reason. The Deputy mentioned poor people. In County Wexford, very few poor people object. It is usually people from bigger cities who build big houses and as soon as they are completed, if anyone else applies for planning permission to build beside them, more often than not they object. They seem to think that not only have they bought half an acre or an acre site but they also have a monopoly on the adjoining land. The £10 fee is not enough to deter some of these people who wish to deprive local people. They feel they have a divine right to live in an area without anyone else living beside them. The £10 fee is not enough and should be looked at again.</P>
    <P>Sustainable development is a term frequently used in Bills and by every Department. Proper planning and development of areas is the way of the future. There has been an increase in planning applications in many counties, particularly in seaside resorts. I am sure Deputy Timmins and others living in coastal counties find there is a huge demand for holiday homes. The Celtic tiger <Col N="174" /> has ensured people have a few bob to spare. The best place to invest one's money is probably in a holiday home or some kind of property. It is important there is proper planning. In Wexford and other counties there are development plans for many of the seaside villages.</P>
    <P>About 1,500 houses and apartments have been built in Courtown Harbour in the past three years. In Blackwater, a small village not far from Enniscorthy, about 1,000 applications for houses have been made and they have all been sold. There is major demand in Curracloe, Blackwater, Courtown, Coolgraney, Castletown and other seaside areas. It is important to have proper development plans to ensure villages are preserved and protected. Given the massive increase in applications for development in these areas, it is important there are proper sewerage and water schemes and that we are not overstretched. I welcome the Minister's provision for proper planning and sustainable development. I hope all councillors will take this on board, as most have already done.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the local authority remains the key decision making body in relation to planning control. I hope this will continue to be the case. We may not always agree with the decisions of planning officers, many of whom refuse permission. It is important that local authorities continue to have the main planning function. All the decisions are local and it is important that councillors are, in conjunction with the county manager, to the forefront in the proper planning and strategic development of counties. I welcome the clear provision in the Bill for the continuing involvement of local authorities.</P>
    <P>Housing supply and the building industry have been mentioned a great deal in this debate. The building industry do a reasonable job dealing with the demands of the Celtic tiger. House prices are now beyond the reach of some people. It is up to the Government, local authorities and the building industry to put forward proposals to deal with this. Housing development needs to be speeded up and more lands must be made available to builders and councils. The Minister is proposing a partnership between local authorities and builders to provide affordable housing. None of us expects builders to give away houses. However, we would expect the building industry, which is experiencing a boom, to go along with the Minister's plans to make a certain amount of affordable housing available on major developments in towns, villages and cities.</P>
    <P>If 40 or 100 houses are being built, it is more important to get a builder to agree to sell a percentage at an affordable price rather than making land available to local authorities. In many cases, particularly in rural areas, local authorities have enough land but they find it difficult to get builders. The Labour Party shout for more housing allocations for local authorities. However, I know that if the Minister announced in the morning that he was going to allocate 1,000 local authority houses to Wexford, there would not be a hope in <Col N="175" /> hell of getting enough builders to build them. I am sure that applies in many other counties also. We are at the limit as regards finding builders to build present allocations. It is important that some means is found through legislation or by way of goodwill to make a percentage of houses available at affordable prices to people on the housing list, that the council, in turn, would make shared ownership loans and the banks would make low interest loans available to people to buy their own house. It is only through a combination of local authority house building, affordable housing, private sites and sites made available at a reduced price by the council that inroads will be made into the numbers on the housing lists at present.</P>
    <P>It is true that the numbers are increasing and that the Government is trying to do something about it. The previous Government, which was in power two and a half years ago when the Celtic tiger was beginning to roar, made no plans to deal with the problem that lay ahead for people trying to obtain housing. This Minister is moving in the right direction in this area. I ask the building industry not to take all. It is making a lot of money on housing sales at present but it is important to recognise that it will not augur well in the future if significant numbers of people who cannot afford houses are living in flats, hovels and bad conditions generally while certain sectors get richer. From talking to those involved in the building industry generally, I believe they want to play a part in partnership with the local authorities and not be bullied into anything. They want to do things correctly and they are prepared to get involved in building affordable housing if encouraged to do so.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. It is important that the Minister should include all the different strands of planning in one Bill. However, he must look seriously at some of the problem areas such as the lack of proper salaries for technical, engineering and planning staff in local authorities. He must endeavour to deal with the major problems in An Bord Pleanála at present and look at the possibility of setting up regional Bord Pleanála offices rather than having this monstrosity, An Bord Pleanála, hidden in Dublin, away from the real problems in rural Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Deputy Browne's point regarding the proposed fee for objectors because generally it is wealthier people who object. In relation to all the non-planning permission applications from Wicklow being sent to Wexford, this has been done at the request of Deputy D'Arcy who wants his base around Killinierin built up. I was going to tell Deputy Browne how to do this but, regrettably, the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, came to the House. However, I am sure the Deputy will eventually get them up to Vinegar Hill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill. I welcome the Bill <Col N="176" /> and the time and effort put into it by all sides since its publication, particularly by Members of the Seanad. It is one of the most important Bills to come before this House in recent years. It is of extreme importance that the measures it seeks to implement will have the desired effect. The Bill has a very strong social element and I am sure the Minister is well aware that it has stirred much emotion. He very wisely went on tour with the Bill and, unlike some other legislation, this will definitely impact on all of us. Planning takes up an inordinate amount of my time as a politician. While I do not believe this is correct, it is an indication of the depth of concern among the public, whether in relation to one's planning permission for a house or concern about a telephone mast or impending landfill site.</P>
    <P>At the coalface the local authority takes all the hits. While I am conscious of the amount of time, effort and sacrifice most officials apply, I regret they have been starved of human and financial resources over a long period. Due to this shortage, it is difficult for members of the public to elicit information and very often planners can make decisions without referring to the human aspect. In Wicklow this can manifest itself in the local occupant being stuck in a hollow, praying the water table does not rise lest he must leave his house, while the visitor is afforded unimpeded views as he drives along the N11 or N81. I realise this is outside the scope of the Bill and the responsibility of the Minister, but it is something which needs to be addressed at local authority level. Nevertheless, planning and its many related aspects often make their way back to central Government.</P>
    <P>An increasing level of frustration with the planning system, aligned to the crisis in the provision of public housing and the affordability of private housing, are the catalysts for the Bill. It is presented as the most fundamental reform of planning in Ireland since the enactment of the Planning Act, 1963, and it has been preceded by a two year review of planning law. We all appreciate that the Bill is very extensive, running to over 200 pages. The Minister stated that it would be impossible for him to go into detail on Second Stage. Notwithstanding that, I hope the points raised by many Members on Second Stage will be taken on Committee Stage and the relevant points addressed.</P>
    <P>In the time available to me, I would like to take a brief look at some sections. Part I deals with what development is, what is exempted, the powers of examination and an obligation to give information. I mentioned previously that the Bill will impact on all citizens. Hardly a day goes by that I do not receive a call inquiring whether planning permission is necessary in a particular case. Due to the pressure on the building industry, one is often tempted to let the builder build, change or extend, if one is lucky to get him or her on site. This could lead to undue hardship and difficulties in the future. While many masquerade as innocents abroad, on occasion they actually <Col N="177" /> are, as there is a lack of knowledge as to one's obligations. As this is a large Bill, it would be difficult to produce a small booklet on the main points. I ask the Minister to examine the feasibility of publishing a short and simple guide which could be distributed or put on sale at a nominal charge to the general public if the Bill is eventually passed. This small gesture might save a lot of difficulties in the future. Equally, I would like copies of the development plan to be made available for a nominal sum as opposed to the present glossy version which normally retails at £10 or £20.</P>
    <P>Part II deals with the provision of development plans. This concept is admirable, as an obligation is placed on the local authority to produce a development plan every six years. After four years, notice of intention to review the plan must be given and the process will recommence. However, every local authority is starved of qualified planners. The Minister, together with the Minister for Education and Science, will have to address this issue. At the end of July last year, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government launched a renewal scheme for smaller towns. In most counties, five to six towns would qualify and the relevant local authorities were required to prepare and submit town renewal plans to the Department by 1 November 1999. To make such a request at the beginning of the traditional summer period, and with such a short timeframe, was a clear indication that this was a Department without a plan. However, the submission date was extended to 31 December 1999. In addition, a change of policy was implemented when the guidelines on the new Bill were changed to allow a maximum of three hectares in all qualifying towns, irrespective of population. A directive on the restraint of application of section 23 designation may also have been issued during the process. In Wicklow, as I am sure was the case in many local authorities, staff could not cope with this request. As a result, the work was farmed out. Within the timeframe, it proved most difficult for private consultants to familiarise themselves with the relevant areas. While excellent work was carried out, I am concerned that these plans may cause difficulty in the near future.</P>
    <P>Despite my criticisms of the logistics of the scheme, I am convinced it is an excellent development and I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, on its launch. I realise that one of the main aims of the project is to encourage people back into town centres which may have become night time vacuums. In small towns, it is a fact of life that much of the property is owned by a few individuals and, as the scheme is aimed at owner-occupiers, many areas may not benefit fully as the current owners will be reluctant to part with their long held holdings. I realise that a special group comprising civil servants and others from the private and public sectors is currently examining approximately 100 town plans. I encourage the Minister to take a hands-on <Col N="178" /> approach as it may be necessary to change the policy direction of the section 23 designation to ensure that certain works are done. While I appreciate that the scheme was not put in place to make the rich richer, it is much more desirable that people who have the wherewithal to carry out the developments do so and make much needed rental accommodation available rather than leave the areas derelict. I realise this is not directly related to the Bill but I cannot over emphasise the concern I have with respect to the points raised. I hope the Minister of State will raise this matter with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government as the reports may be finalised by the end of next month.</P>
    <P>Section 2 also deals with public rights of way. This area is fraught with danger because many rights of way have been interfered with in recent years. The town renewal scheme will ensure that many rights of way will become the topics of conversation in the months ahead. It is also important that many old mass paths and so on are preserved because, due to public liability and a lack of available open spaces, the number of areas where one can go for a casual walk has greatly reduced.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation to prepare a local area plan for towns with a population of more than 1,500 within two years of the making of the development plan. This calls for more resources and while I agree with the principle, will this section outlive itself if the current pressures recede, particularly in areas where the population may be relatively stagnant? In the future it may give rise to an unnecessary process and perhaps a certain flexibility should be built into the section on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Part III deals with one of the most important areas, planning applications. For almost all politicians in County Wicklow, the planning department is like a second home. Many hours are spent poring over files and putting forward constituents' points of view. At best, one is a step ahead of the posse, but often one is way behind as the dreaded refusal notice arrives in the post.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes spoke in a colourful manner about the wrong James Byrne getting a midnight call seeking further information. This scenario is familiar to all Members. Local authorities, to fulfil their statutory obligations and through no fault of their own, often send out unnecessary further information requests which afford them some breathing space. However, the knock-on effect can be dramatic for the applicant as time clauses and building costs come into play and the prospect of moving in with the future mother-in-law is not too welcoming.</P>
    <P>A common sight around the highways and byways of Wicklow on a Monday afternoon or a Tuesday is a head planner in a car laden down with files who, due to a vigilant group of planning observers, must examine all sensitive applications. Late at night he writes up reports and the clerical staff are on a continual deadline to catch the carrier pigeon.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="179" /> It is an unnecessarily stressful atmosphere in which to work, particularly when they know there is some hostility towards planning authorities. I compliment all those involved in the planning section of Wicklow County Council and I hope this plug will assist me in the many differences of opinion we have. It is a thankless job which is not helped by the unrecognised fact that, while no two planning applications are the same, the concept of precedence is often used as a battering ram.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, the time consideration for planning will be eight weeks as opposed to two calendar months. Requests for further information will have to be dealt with within four weeks. This is a welcome development but the provision needs to be more explicit to cover the working day aspect and deal with permissions that may be due on a bank holiday Monday or over a holiday period. In some cases, due to holiday periods, the eight week period may be reduced to seven weeks. The Department should address this aspect <i>vis-à-vis </i>the working day concept.</P>
    <P>Section 34(7) deals with the concept of a section 4 motion. Unfortunately, this provision is dear to my heart. In a single local electoral area, it must be signed by not less than three members of the local authority concerned. To initiate a section 4 motion in an electoral area of greater than three members, three quarters of the number is needed with any fraction above that number disregarded &ndash; the number is rounded down. Therefore, in an electoral area of seven, the number of supporting members required to initiate the section 4 is five. There was a basic flaw in section 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, and this has been repeated in the Bill. If one member in an electoral area of only three members has an ideological difficulty with a section 4 motion, which is one of the few powers of a local councillor, the electorate in that area can be disenfranchised to a certain extent.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that this power should be used sparingly. In addition, if this measure remains, it can place too much power in the hands of one individual. This should be amended to permit two members in a three member electoral area, plus four or five other members, to initiate a section 4 motion as this would restore equity. I hope this matter can be addressed on Committee Stage and that the Fine Gael Party will table the necessary amendment.</P>
    <P>The measures that dealt with previous compliance are welcome. It is a common complaint that many developers do not finish off relevant developments. In addition, there is a worrying trend where some developers during the construction process ride roughshod over the community by using routes and work practices which were explicitly excluded in the original permission. Many local authorities have been weak on enforcement, giving the impression that some <Col N="180" /> groups are above the law. Any progress in dealing with this unsavoury aspect is welcome.</P>
    <P>Section 36 deals with the appeal process and I also welcome the development whereby a submission or observation must be made in writing in the first instance to the relevant local authority. This is desirable because I have often encountered situations where an applicant whose application has received a positive outcome is then faced with the difficulty of a hitherto unknown objector making an appeal to the board. During the initial stages the appellant may have only made verbal objections in the hope of remaining anonymous or may have used his or her local representative to do so.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with somebody making objections or observations &ndash; it is a basic right &ndash; but an individual has the right to know who is objecting. Unfortunately, in this self-proclaimed era of openness and transparency, this is not always the case. I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle remembers the Latin phrase that an accused should know his accuser but I cannot recall it. There may be some scope for extending this section and insisting that all representations from elected members or the public have to be recorded. This should be done in the interests of fairness.</P>
    <P>Sections 44 and 47 are welcome. The provision of open spaces has in general been loose, with no overall plan for development. To ensure this is no longer the case, local authorities must ascertain the extent of a developer's land to enable him to plan a proper lay out for the total area. Ireland has been weak on the provision of parks and correctly managed open spaces. Local authorities should have a parks section and I hope the Bill will encourage them to create such sections.</P>
    <P>Many small towns are contemplating future development projects. Many of these towns have few facilities. This applies to Delgany, Dunlavin, Blessington, Baltinglass, Greystones and Newtownmountkennedy among others in County Wickow. I hope section 47 is used wisely and I look forward to many fine community centres in these areas. I trust the temptation to use the levies collected as a prop, due to a lack of central Government funding, is resisted. The section leaves that open and perhaps there is a case for an amendment to ensure the levies are put into community facilities.</P>
    <P>Part IV deals with architectural heritage. In the context of Deputy Browne's comments, Dúchas has adopted a policy of requesting archaeological digs and surveys on many individual planning applications. While I do not necessarily believe this is a bad thing, it adds an extra cost to an already expensive business. A young couple starting out may have to pay £2,000 for the necessary requirements to be fulfilled. I have tabled parliamentary questions on this matter in the past and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands should discuss it with the Minister for Finance with a view to having the cost of such sur<Col N="181" /> veys allowable as a tax relief because, in many cases, they provide valuable information.</P>
    <P>Other aspects of the Bill are welcome. The restructuring of An Bord Pleanála is required and the measures to make decisions more open and visible are a timely development. The disclosure of interests is imperative in an age of suspicion and it is desirable as local authorities as currently constructed can assist in shielding corruption. There is much work to be done in this area and the long awaited Bill relating to the reform of local government will be expected to deal with these matters. Due to the lack of reform over 100 years, the checks and balances in place are inadequate and archaic.</P>
    <P>Part V deals with housing supply, which is perhaps the most important and emotive part of the Bill. I welcome many aspects of the Bill, but this section is its Achilles heel. Our housing policy has remained basically unchanged for many decades and, regrettably, it has now only become a major political issue for the first time in three decades because affordable housing has become a middle class problem. Due to the interaction of socio-economic and demographic trends, there was a dramatic increase in the need for housing in the mid-1990s. We should have seen it coming. The baby boom of the late 1970s, allied to increased wealth, decreased unemployment and emigration reversal have brought us to the stage we are at today, where it is almost impossible for first time buyers to make a purchase in the greater Dublin area or in the surrounding areas of most large Irish cities. The downward trend in interest rates fuelled the incentive for higher borrowings and there has been a huge increase in new loan approvals. In the early 1970s there was a demand for mass housing which was solved with a combination of flexible planning policies from local authorities, which led to the suburbanisation of towns and cities, the easier availability of mortgages, as developers establish links with building societies, and an increase in public housing output. In 1975 there were 8,794 local authority completions and 18,098 private completions. Yet in 1997 private completions had almost doubled to 35,454 while local authority completions had decreased by more than 60% to 2,632. We must be honest and acknowledge that over the past 30 years there were times that public housing stock was increased partly by Government desire to assist the then hard-pressed construction industry. It is hard to visualise that today.</P>
    <P>This Government has taken some measures to address the crisis by following the Bacon recommendations and many investors were removed from the market. However, the Minister has not warmed to the concept of a housing commission and he now discovers the crisis continues. A helpful measure such as Deputy Hayes' anti-gazzumping Bill was knocked on the grounds that it was unconstitutional. This is incorrect, as Article 42.2 of the Constitution refers to the exigencies of the common good over individuals' rights.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="182" /> The provisions of Part V will not work in relation to the 20% proposal. It is an abdication by the Minister of his responsibilities to provide funding to local authorities. At present, developers are dictating to local authorities what land should be sold by virtue of the fact that all suitable land is in their possession. Local authorities zone the land, place a levy on the developer and everything is rosy. However, in most cases this land has been purchased some years before at a relatively low price. In addition, the cost of providing the services are merely passed on to the house buyer. The proposed measures is a penal tax that will ultimately filter down to the house buyer. The local authorities should be funded to enable them to purchase the necessary land. Then, and only then, will the local authority be able to compete and set the agenda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been widely welcomed. Given the broad consultation the Minister has encouraged, I welcome his attitude to consultation. He has also said that he is open to further alterations to continue to improve the Bill. This Bill comes after a two year review of planning law, European directives and other related items that date back to 1963. Its touchstone is proper planning and sustainable development and it proposes to consolidate existing legislation, change some current planning procedures, introduce new arrangements for drawing up development plans and facilitate the provision of more affordable and social housing. It is all-embracing.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that it covers a structured hierarchy of plans, from the broad national picture to the local development level and vice versa. Co-ordination is badly needed from the bottom up. As I understand it, the national development plan will have a national spatial strategy to which regional guidelines and the development plans must have regard. At the regional level, population trends, housing strategy, location of development, transport, waste and the protection of the environment will be dealt with. On a local basis there is the development plan which looks at land zoning, infrastructure, conservation of the environment, regeneration, accommodation for travellers, amenities and community facilities. The status the local development plan is given by the Minister is seen by his acknowledgment of it as the anchor of the planning system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that the Bill gives statutory recognition of the local area plans, I was happy the National Heritage Council has asked the Minister and other authorities to consider the work of Donegal County Council with its Taobh Tire project as an example of how to engage maximum public participation and valued community opinion. I hope the Minister takes that recommendation on board. The Bill addresses the need for more public consultation and a more defined role for elected members of local authorities, something with which all Deputies who are members of local <Col N="183" /> authorities will be pleased. As a councillor in Donegal, planning matters are among items most regularly brought to my attention by locals, returning emigrants or strangers looking for planning permission for family or holiday homes. The level of applications has mushroomed. It seems the drafting of the new county development plan has sparked off what can only be called hysteria in Donegal, but I suppose it is also a vote of confidence in our region from those who wish to settle down there. The rising national debate County Clare has helped to generate means many of the issues Donegal County Council is trying to grapple with are getting a substantial airing in other fora.</P>
    <P>There is a difficult balance between encouraging people to invest in our county and maintaining the beautiful countryside. There is also a difficult balance in making our limited infrastructure cater for existing settlement while providing funding for new, large-scale developments. There is a difficult balance between sustaining a vibrant rural countryside and becoming a seasonal holiday village for the rich, Northern, foreign or urban dweller who can avail of the present advantageous exchange rates. There is a difficult balance between enabling landowners to supplement their incomes from the poor fishing and farming that prevails in Donegal by selling off sites and the issue of keeping site prices within the scope of the local person, no matter how one defines local people.</P>
    <P>Given that the Inishowen area is an area to which one third of all planning applications for Donegal apply, these balances are rightly of great concern to those living in the peninsula. The work of finalising the county development plan will have to take into account each of the concerns. While I commend Donegal County Council on its high level of interaction with the community, the debate in other counties will be helpful when we return to the local community for their thoughts on the revised draft development plan in coming weeks.</P>
    <P>The Bill will make many improvements to the system and I ask the Minister to look at resourcing the planning offices. It is important that decisions can be made speedily on applications, but this cannot be done without adequate resourcing. Pre-planning should be encouraged, particularly with multiple developments, given the cost of plans. This week I met someone making a large scale application who had spent £5,000 on plans and application fees, only to be refused and to be told that he would never have a case for the site he had chosen. A pre-planning inquiry would have cut his costs substantially. Architects also have a duty to digest the development plan and make an effort to work in tandem with the views of all those who had an input on the plan, which usually means the general public and local public representative. I would not like to tie the hands of an architect or applicant, but there is a need for a level of co-operation once one has <Col N="184" /> decided on a county development plan. Similarly, it is important that those who are building without permission can be challenged in an effective and efficient manner and their affairs put in order. The Minister should, when considering the whole issue of retentions, look at the cost to the councils of taking legal action. In our council we have had cases whereby the council has taken out injunctions against offenders and yet it is the council which has had the initial expense. While understanding that a person is innocent until proven guilty, the injunction costs, should they be attributed directly to the offender, particularly where there is a clear breach of planning permission or a blatant lack of an application, would be a deterrent. A fund or float that could help the council take such actions would also send its own message. A strong issue which I am glad to see will be dealt with in the Bill pertains to retention. Too often it is found that some judges let building continue until the retention application has been dealt with which enables the offender to &ldquo;spin the process&rdquo; out to his advantage. In certain cases when it is not a house but a commercial venture on which retention is sought, three or four months of spinning the process out can lead to their having made enough money to give up until they are refused and can start something else.</P>
    <P>I was going to ask the Minister for his thoughts on the need for a directive that there should be no discretion available to a judge to allow an unauthorised development to proceed and that such development would have to be stopped until a decision on the retention was forthcoming, but I understand the matter is addressed. I note the maximum fines have increased to £10 million and that it will no longer be possible to use retention permission as an escape hatch when enforcement action is threatened. A planning authority can seek a court order to refuse permission based on a developer's past record where that developer has been in breach of a planning permission. Conflict may arise where a developer says he has cleaned up his act and does not want to be branded. The branding is in their hands if they can abide by the regulations and the planning permission.</P>
    <P>It is important that these ideals in relation to how applications can be made, followed or pursued, are not just words on paper but are resourced in a manner that these speedy turnovers of work can realistically occur. One of our greatest difficulties in County Donegal is the sheer turn-over of planning officials. The Inishowen region has been one of the hardest hit. During the four or five years I have been a member of the council we have had 14 or 15 planning officers in that region. This can be attributed to many factors depending on who one speaks to, but in reality it is the sheer volume of work that has been the culprit and the proximity to an easier alternative in the Northern offices. No region can develop a consistent planning policy or deliver an adequate service in terms of unauthorised development follow-up, etc. without a con<Col N="185" /> sistency of personnel. I trust that simultaneous to new time limits will come new bodies.</P>
    <P>It is great to see the amount of development in one sense. It is important that in any development or multiple developments, which are taking place in the Donegal County Council area, there is provision for a green space. People do not realise there is an absence of green space until they are in a house for a number of years and have children. They then go to a local authority member and complain that the development does not have this or that facility for their children, adequate footpaths and lighting, and is not connected to the town. Various problems emerge after a developer has left. That a green space should be mandatory in large developments is common sense. It remains a difficulty for local authorities and voluntary groups to obtain land. The Bill addresses the issue in a manner that helps to overcome the huge prices paid for land. Accessibility of land is vital if the targets set in the national development plan are to be met. I note in the national development plan an additional 35,000 local authority units, an increase in the voluntary housing sector provision from 500 a year to 4,000 a year and an increase of 2,000 units per year under the current local authority affordable housing and shared ownership schemes.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate the many voluntary housing groups for the very significant and worthwhile work they are doing in the provision of housing for the most needy. I trust the support for their endeavours will continue. I ask that in this increased allocation within the voluntary groups policy they deal with the issue of providing a single house for those who for one reason or other are not receiving priority from the local authority. The need for flexibility in the work of the voluntary sector is an extra recognition of the value of its contribution.</P>
    <P>Each development plan must now contain a housing strategy that looks not only to the present but to the future needs of the population in the area. Land is to be zoned appropriately and should cover the needs of all types of household. The Minister has earmarked that up to 20% of land zoned for housing in any case should be reserved for social and affordable housing. The 20% maximum would ensure there is not a disproportionate impact on landowners, developers or the market. When a country has 40,000 households in need of local authority housing there is a need for substantial measures to address the issue. This will be an aspect of the Bill to which people may pay positive lip service and then battle against on the ground.</P>
    <P>Outside the land issue is the issue of water and sewerage services. I congratulate the Minister on the progress being made nationally on both issues but suggest he take a look at the Donegal programme where there is action on the Carndonagh sewerage scheme and completion of the major Pollan Dam project but there is a desire for some new starts. Declaring an interest, in my home <Col N="186" /> town, Moville sewerage scheme has been prioritised as the first and the Malin town scheme is also in the top three priorities, as agreed by the council. I hope funding will be made available in the immediate future to commence these schemes and thus move other long awaited and very necessary projects, such as the Buncrana phase V, up the list. These resources are vital in the proper planning and development of housing or industry. As I come from a county and a part of a county that has serious difficulties in attracting employment, I hope the infrastructural deficits that exist will be addressed under the national development plan and Objective One focus.</P>
    <P>While the increase in affordable housing is important, I am glad the Bill not only deals with housing <i>per se</i> but there is a positive development in relation to aspects of the national development plan and particularly the roads programme. With the local authority's power to acquire land clearly stated with compulsory purchase orders and responsibility passing to An Bord Pleanála, the implementation process has to start within 18 months of the order being confirmed. The board must decide appeals and referrals within 18 weeks. These provisions will reduce the time taken to complete statutory approval procedures for roads projects. Projects which had taken more than five years to start will be in a position to start within three and a half years of initial planning. This has obvious implications for the major road improvement programme that is foreseen in the years up to 2006.</P>
    <P>In this context I assure the Minister that the engineers, particularly in the Inishowen area, are eager to follow what he is endeavouring, that is, they would like to develop large stretches of road, be it from Buncrana to Bridgend, Muff to Moville or Quigleys Point to Cardonagh, three important arteries. In Inishowen there are no regional, primary or secondary roads. Therefore, the Minister should not be shy in allocating suitable large amounts of moneys to these non-national roads. I am confident our engineering staff would rise to the challenge of ensuring that it was properly spent in an appropriate manner. I look forward to their getting a chance to prove me right.</P>
    <P>The role and make-up of An Bord Pleanála is changing. Its membership is increasing and it will operate in divisions which maximise its efficiency. Functions that were previously in ministerial hands are being moved to the board. It is important, therefore, that decisions and procedures that lead to decisions are transparent and consistent. It is good that there will be an obligation to explain decisions to the public. I firmly believe in a person's right to appeal but I also believe it is in everyone's interest to have a timescale and whichever way the decision goes it can be outlined.</P>
    <P>I note that the Bill establishes statutory recognition for submissions and observations made by the public and that the right of appeal to An Bord Pleanála is reserved to those who made an initial observation on the application to the local auth<Col N="187" /> ority. This is an interesting alteration. Some people will argue that it is possible that planning permission can be obtained without anyone knowing about it. I assume the Minister is confident the statutory notices in papers and on site are adequate.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives the Minister new powers to dismiss appeals made with the intent of extracting money from a developer or solely for the purpose of delaying a project. On the question of delaying a project, locally I have encountered situations where planning permissions have been granted by the council but where, out of the blue, objectors have appealed to An Bord Pleanála and have often been successful. In terms of the rights of objectors, what are the Minister's views on whether those who own holiday homes in an area are able, by appealing to An Bord Pleanála, to prevent a local person building a permanent family home on virgin ground, given that the local authority granted the application?</P>
    <P>A vital issue for every councillor is the provision which obliges councils to respond to genuine concerns. In this regard the Bill deals with the ongoing and longstanding difficulties of unfinished estates. Many such estates now seek to prevent others from getting planning permission and this process delays what should be a straightforward procedure. Many people feel their concerns are not being taken seriously and that there is foot-dragging by councils in dealing with these estates.</P>
    <P>In the past, councils have taken a relaxed attitude to developers and as a result many estates have been left in various stages of disarray. As residents who buy houses in such estates realise that nothing further will be done as the developer has left, or as neighbouring residents realise that the one storey house, for which planning permission was granted, has now turned into a two storey building, the problem is soon left with the council to resolve. In many cases answers are still waiting to be found 20 years later.</P>
    <P>With the significant increase in building activities recently, there is a greater need to become focused on compliance with planning regulations. Again, part of the problem here has been the issue of staffing in the enforcement section of the planning process. It is a resource that can no longer be done without. The current message is to say &ldquo;not to worry, they will never come after you or force you to do x, y, or z&rdquo;. It is important, therefore, that the Bill sends a different message and that developers acquire a sense of responsibility with regard to how they complete their developments and comply with best practice. Councils also need the power to help members of the public understand that their concerns are genuine and are being pursued.</P>
    <P>I was asked to raise the issue of wildlife and hedgerows. Many developments currently under construction are replacing hedges with one or two trees and a much greater area of concrete and/or grass. There is concern that apart from the visual <Col N="188" /> aspect, we are also losing essential locations for certain species of birds in which to nest. At times the criteria regarding screening has been a factor in the granting of planning permission, yet natural screening has been uprooted and inadequately replaced.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister considered including representatives of the Heritage Council and/or the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands on the newly constituted board? The issue warrants the inclusion of the Heritage Council on the list of representatives on the committee for the purpose of appointing the chair of the board. As an organisation concerned with the preservation of the national heritage and having a strong ethos for nature conservation and protection of the countryside, it is appropriate that it should have an input.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the efforts the Minister is making to deliver a planning system with quality development plans, quality and timely decisions and an accessible and transparent planning service and proper enforcement. I also appreciate his determination to assist people in retaining their aspiration to own their homes and I trust the resources necessary to make these aims a reality will be provided. I wish the Minister success in achieving his aims.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The consolidation of the various Acts and regulations under which planning matters are decided is to be welcomed. The ongoing delays and difficulties experienced by all within the planning process must be addressed when the supply of new affordable, compatible housing designed to meet the needs of modern society is so fundamentally important. The requirement that all development plans be renewed within a six year timeframe is a positive advance, as is the outline of the proposed consultation process, which now forms part of the review, with its built in time schedule for each phase. It also forces the issue with members of local authorities to deal with the matter.</P>
      <P>It is now more appropriate that given the fast moving economy and the levels of growth we currently enjoy, to put in place the requirement for a ten to 15 year plan with five yearly reviews to moderate the flow of development land onto the market. If such a timeframe were used it would provide an element of certainty with regard to the planning of required services, while addressing the question of speculative profit, with the landowners afforded an opportunity to assess the real value of their holding and pricing their acres accordingly. This policy, taken in conjunction with the withering of development zoning would make communities far more proactive, ensuring a vibrancy to maximise the shape of community developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should consider providing for an extension of the current requirement that the publication of planning applications in one newspaper which circulates in the area be extended to require that the notice must also be published in <Col N="189" /> the local journal or paper. This will ensure that local residents are properly informed. It is insufficient to place an advertisement in<i> The Irish Times</i> or the <i>Irish Independent</i> and, perhaps, the <i>Evening Herald</i> while excluding journals and newspapers which circulate locally, such as <i>The Northside People </i>and<i> City Wide News,</i> two very good local papers in my constituency. The local council could take a page per month or per fortnight in these publications and advertise, or make applicants advertise, the proposed planning developments. This would ensure that all people in an area were properly informed of the applications before the council.</P>
    <P>This method of communication should also be prescribed with regard to the draft and review of the development plan. Every effort must be made to engage the people in the process of the shaping of their communities. I recently attended a public meeting concerned with Grange Abbey, an estate within the Dublin Corporation area beside the M50, which is almost complete. The residents were promised that on completion of the M50, Grange Road and Grange Abbey would be turned into a cul-de-sac and that they would not have to put up with bumper to bumper traffic, with which they have had to endure for years, obliging them to live as virtual prisoners within their homes. However, since Dublin Corporation rezoned part of these lands, the proposed developer, who plans to build 2,000 units, wishes to use their road to access and exit his development, despite the fact that there is a way for him to enter and exit on the other side. Developments such as this are unfair to communities. In this instance it arose because when the draft development plan was under consideration by Dublin Corporation the residents were not properly informed.</P>
    <P>When Fingal County Council was examining the draft development plan of the Baldoyle Racecourse beside this development I ensured that the plan was available in my office and that a letter was circulated to all households informing them it was on display and that part of their area was due to be considered for rezoning. The council also liaised with the community by placing advertisements in the local papers and by ensuring that meetings were held to inform the local community of what was proposed and how they could interact with local representatives and the local authority. This is the way matters should proceed, but in the case of the Grange Abbey estate people feel it was rezoned behind their back because they were not consulted. They are most unhappy about this. They require that the new development should not access onto their roadway and I support them on this.</P>
    <P>The concept of the promotion of sustainability through local area plans is very important. It will afford people the opportunity to share their views and dreams with those who will decide how their local community will live and grow. While this consultation is important, it is no reason to take away the citizen's right to comment on and, if <Col N="190" /> necessary, object to local development. My colleague, Senator Coogan, raised this issue in the Upper House. A family may live in an area and be happy with the surroundings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I represent the most talked about region in the country. I have almost lost track of the number of new reference titles which have been bestowed on the north-west during the life of the Government. The most recent, the BMW region, is probably the most inappropriate if it is supposed to refer to the type of car most frequently seen in the Sligo-Leitrim area. It does not matter which acronym one chooses for the north-west region, it does not change the fact that despite all the talk about regional development, not one finger has been lifted to practically assist the economic regeneration of that part of the country.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that the only announcement concerning jobs in the north-west in the past three years referred to job losses? At a time when every other region has been lamenting the difficulty in filling job vacancies, the employment levels in the north-west have fallen by almost 1,300. The roar of the Celtic tiger has not been heard in Sligo-Leitrim because the Government has refused to make any practical investment in the region.</P>
      <P>The Western Development Commission, despite having wonderful ideas and plans for the area, finds its hands are tied. While the national development plan may promise much needed finance, the real challenge is its efficient allocation and administration. The much hyped spatial plan offers only a further two year wait for strategic decisions to be made concerning the north-west.</P>
      <P>My real reason for raising this matter is to find a replacement employer for a fully serviced 24,000 square foot modern factory located on a two and a half acre site in the industrial estate in Tubbercurry which has been vacant for almost two years. It is vital that the Minister and his office enter immediate discussions with IDA Ireland to find a new employer for this major facility in south Sligo. The facility is in a tax incentive area and has huge potential. It is 130 miles from Dublin, 110 miles from Shannon and 130 miles from Belfast.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>While there are job losses in the region this facility is standing idle. I know IDA Ireland hopes to get an employer, and I am certain the Minister will do his utmost in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does Objective One status mean when there is no money available to make improve<Col N="191" /> ments to infrastructure and living standards? If the north-west is allowed languish in the doldrums much longer it will be too late to hope for rehabilitation. No strategy committees or working groups will be able to fill the void left by the lack of planning and investment in the region.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to help with this very important development in south Sligo and want to know what he will do to ensure we get an employer in this area which has huge potential. Tubbercurry is included in the upper Shannon renewal scheme which offers a huge opportunity for employers to set up and create jobs in an area where they are badly needed. The facility is state of the art with access to huge ESB capacity. It is a crying shame that this facility has been lying idle for over two years. I make a special appeal to the Minister, who is from the west and whose opinions I value, to make a special effort in this regard. I can provide the Minister with details on this unit located in Tubbercurry, a growing town. Currently up to 100 houses are being built in the town through the upper Shannon scheme, for which the Government deserves credit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The management of the industrial property portfolio is a statutory function of IDA Ireland as laid out in section 16 of the Industrial Development Act, 1986. In this regard the provision of industrial development sites is a day to day matter for IDA Ireland and not one in which we have direct functions. IDA Ireland is allocated Exchequer moneys each year which it uses along with its own resources to purchase strategically located sites for industrial development purposes. This activity comes within the remit of the agency's day to day functions. IDA Ireland is involved in the provision of industrial property for the purposes of achieving economic growth nationally and in regional and peripheral areas. Scarcity of land for industrial purposes would inhibit industrial development. Consequently, the agency buys and develops land to ensure there is adequate supply to meet the emerging demand. Essentially, its involvement in the provision of industrial property arises from market failure and relates to the achievement of its core job creation objectives.</P>
      <P>No new factory space is provided directly by IDA Ireland. The agency relies instead mainly on private developers and grant assistance to industrial investors to provide their own premises. However, IDA Ireland still plays a crucial role in ensuring adequate land is zoned and developed for industrial purposes in the regions which it serves and I am assured by IDA Ireland that industrial property is being provided in order to assist industrial development in the Border region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, it is IDA Ireland's aim as part of its new strategy to deliver half of all new green field jobs into the Objective One regions in the coming years. This has been agreed by IDA <Col N="192" /> Ireland, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Government. This is a challenging objective and to achieve this goal the agency will continue to work closely with the providers of infrastructure to ensure they are focused on the needs of each region and also with the educational and training bodies so that they may deliver improved facilities for industry.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives include a greater focus on the marketing of the regions geared towards specific sectors and the improvement of marketing material for the regions. Specifically in the Border areas IDA Ireland is building up significant land holdings in Letterkenny, Sligo and Dundalk and currently there are factories and offices in the course of construction in these towns. In addition, factories are planned for other regional centres, including Monaghan, Carrick-on-Shannon and Ballyshannon.</P>
    <P>In Carrick-on-Shannon, IDA Ireland has been granted planning permission for construction of a 25,000 square foot facility. Negotiations are in place with developers and a decision on this option will be made in the immediate future. Both this proposed facility and the existing land bank have been marketed to potential clients and all options are being aggressively pursued. In the case of Monaghan, planning permission for an advance factory has already been obtained. In the case of Ballyshannon, IDA Ireland is in the early stages of factory design. A factory has also been completed in Cavan and is being actively promoted.</P>
    <P>In the Finisklin Business Park in Sligo, an advance factory is now complete and IDA Ireland's new office facility is well advanced. In addition, IDA Ireland continues to market facilities that are developed by private investors. These include new industrial units under construction in Cleveragh, Sligo, and vacant buildings, such as the former Westpack building in Tubbercurry. This has been referred to by Deputy Perry, whose colleague, Deputy Matt Brennan, is constantly representing the case.</P>
    <P>The employment base in both Sligo and Leitrim increased during 1999 to a combined total of almost 3,000 permanent jobs in IDA Ireland client companies. The presence of existing strong companies like Abbott and the excellent contribution of the Sligo Institute of Technology are key factors which will underpin continued growth in this region.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the new strategy adopted by IDA Ireland, with its focus on provision of property for industrial development, will bring benefits to the Border region. I am sure the Deputy will agree that as a result of the inventory of locations and investments already made this region is ready to capitalise on the huge investment in the national development plan for the Border, midlands and western region. I am confident that in this Objective One area we will be able to locate much foreign direct investment to supplement the tremendous work of Enterprise <Col N="193" /> Ireland and the county enterprise boards in terms of indigenous industry.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - National Disease Surveillance Centre.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Disease Surveillance Centre was established in Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital in November 1998. The NDSC is being developed as a centre of excellence for the surveillance, prevention and control of infectious diseases. In the 12 months following its establishment, specialist trained staff to enable it fulfil its functions were head hunted and recruited. As part of the staffing process in recent weeks the Department of Health and Children approved the recruitment of a microbiologist jointly by the NDSC and by James Connolly Memorial Hospital.</P>
      <P>The centre was set up on an interim basis pending the enactment of legislation to give it an independent statutory remit. It was proposed that its staff complement should ultimately expand to 20 and that it should be based permanently in Blanchardstown. Its work requires it to maintain close and frequent liaison with other national organisations such as the Royal College of Physicians, the Irish College of General Practitioners, the National Virus Reference Laboratory and also with academic libraries and university departments. The NDSC has been requested by the Department of Health and Children to develop guidelines on issues such as anti-microbial resistance, viral haemorrhage disease and has been asked to review infectious disease legislation.</P>
      <P>The scientific advisory committee, through its sub-committees, has more than 50 professionals who have given their time freely to develop these guidelines. Membership of the sub-committees comprises professionals who voluntarily give their time and who are dependant on them meeting in Dublin. All of those head hunted and employed by the NDSC reside in Dublin and were recruited on the basis that it would be based there. One day prior to the appointment of Deputy Cowen as Minister for Foreign Affairs, the chairman of the board of the NDSC received a fax from the Department of Health and Children informing him that a decision had been made by the Minister to transfer the centre to Tullamore Hospital. A public announcement of the Minister's decision was not made, and an explanation has not been offered even since I first raised this matter a week ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no scientific, medical or rational basis for transferring the NDSC from Dublin to Tullamore. While the Government may lamely attempt to justify the proposed transfer on the basis of its commitment to decentralisation, it is clear that the only reason for the transfer ordered by Deputy Cowen derives from his perception that it will result in some political advantage both for him and Fianna Fáil. His decision is a classic example of the worst type of parish pump politics. Such conduct results in Ministers and politicians being held up to public ridicule. It is conduct that <Col N="194" /> substantially undermines the Government's professed commitment to a new form of ethics in politics.</P>
    <P>If the Government persists with implementing this proposal, it is likely that most, if not all, of the staff recruited to the NDSC over the past 12 months will seek other positions. Those who remain, instead of devoting all their time to the important work in which the centre is engaged, will regularly spend between three and four hours per day driving to and from Tullamore for the purpose of engaging with various institutions in Dublin which collaborate in the centre's work and in order to participate in essential committee meetings which will inevitably be held in Dublin and meetings with officials in the Department of Health and Children. Prior to making the decision to transfer the NDSC to Tullamore the previous Minister for Health and Children refused to meet those employed there. In recent days it has been reported in the newspapers that the new Minister is agreeable to meeting them and that is welcome. However, unquoted sources have also indicated that there is no question of changing Deputy Cowen's decision. I welcome the fact that the new Minister is present and I challenge him to explain what national benefit can result in implementing his predecessor's decision. I call on him to have the courage to reverse it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to clarify the position regarding the future location of the National Disease Surveillance Centre. In November 1997 the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, approved the establishment of such a centre, which was to provide a comprehensive broad-based approach to the prevention of disease. Initially, the centre is concentrating on the surveillance of communicable diseases, for example, meningitis, tuberculosis, food-borne diseases and MRSA.</P>
      <P>The centre was established on a non-statutory basis for an interim three-year period under the aegis of the Eastern Health Board to enable it to get off the ground quickly. It is intended that the centre will become an independent statutory body once the necessary legislation has been enacted. The director of the centre took up her appointment on 19 October 1998 and a further eight staff have been recruited. All of the staff are employed on three year contracts and are on secondment from other health agencies. It is envisaged that the centre will employ 30 to 40 staff when fully operational.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NDSC is currently located in Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital and it is accepted that the accommodation is inadequate. The centre submitted proposals to the Department of Health and Children to lease accommodation in Blanchardstown. The Department had concerns about the costs involved and the capacity of the centre's budget to absorb the costs. The total annual costs, which included rent of £176,000, would have been <Col N="195" /> £380,000. Once-off costs were identified as £1.1 million. This included fit-out and furniture costs amounting to £700,000 and VAT on the lease totalling £400,000. VAT is payable up front on leases of more than ten years. Correspondence was exchanged between my Department and the NDSC and this continued up to October 1999.</P>
    <P>During Private Members' business on 2 February, Deputy Shatter made some outrageous allegations about my predecessor's conduct prior to his departure from the Department. He implied that the decision to relocate the NDSC outside Dublin was first conveyed to it one day prior to Deputy Cowen's departure.</P>
    <P>I will outline the sequence in which the matter evolved. On 29 October 1999 the matter was discussed by my predecessor and his officials. He expressed concern about the high costs of the proposed accommodation and decided that the centre should be relocated in the midlands as part of the decentralisation process. He also requested that his officials meet the chairman and director of the NDSC to convey his decision to them. Due to other commitments, the parties involved were unable to meet earlier than 12 November. At this meeting, it was explained that in line with the Government's commitment to decentralisation it was the Minister's intention to relocate the centre to the midlands. It was also pointed out that the high cost of accommodation was a factor in the Minister's thinking.</P>
    <P>A further meeting took place between the Department and representatives of the NDSC on 30 November 1999, during which the centre's representatives outlined their views on why it should remain in Dublin. These related to personal inconvenience and the perceived difficulties in setting up a national centre of excellence outside the capital. The representatives indicated their intention to seek a meeting with the Minister to discuss their concerns with him. The NDSC wrote to the Minister on 9 December outlining its concerns about the proposed location but did not request a meeting. On 21 December the NDSC indicated to the Department that its chairman would write directly to the Minister as a follow up to the letter of 9 December and request a meeting as soon as possible. It was decided to postpone responding to the letter of 9 December pending receipt of this request. As no further letter was received the letter of 24 January was prepared and issued. The only new piece of information in this letter was where in the midlands the centre would be located.</P>
    <P>I will outline the context in which the decision to relocate the NDSC to the midlands was taken. The national development plan, published in November 1999, recognised the need to achieve balanced regional development. In particular, the NDP recognised the Border, midlands and western region, BMW, as disadvantaged. It outlined Government policy to pursue a more balanced regional development to reduce the disparities between the BMW region and the southern and <Col N="196" /> eastern region. In An Action Programme for the Millennium the Government reiterated its commitment to achieving balanced regional development and the provision of State services at local level through decentralisation. On 1 December 1999 the Minister for Finance outlined the State's role in the development of the BMW region in his Budget Statement. It is the Government's intention to transfer the maximum number of public service jobs from Dublin.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the personal concerns of the director and staff of the NDSC about the proposed location. I acknowledge that individuals may not wish to relocate and, they will be accommodated. This has been conveyed to the NDSC. Other points have been made which are not insurmountable. Tullamore is only some 60 miles from Dublin. The development of the NDSC in Tullamore will not compromise the development of a first class centre, to which I am committed. If there are problems, the scientific advisory committee and its sub-committees can continue to meet in Dublin even with the headquarters located in Tullamore. The NDSC can develop as a centre of excellence in a location outside Dublin. I do not accept that the personal inconvenience of public servants should be allowed impede the implementation of Government policy in relation to decentralisation.</P>

I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and I am pleased to have had the opportunity to put on record the position regarding Deputy Cowen's decision to transfer the centre to the midlands in line with Government policy.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Figures published today in one of our newspapers indicate a high incidence of food poisoning despite the recent sustained efforts by the Food Safety Authority to highlight the risk of food-borne illness at all points in the food chain, from production to consumer. The consequences of food-borne illness range from mild symptoms, including symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting which, although debilitating, are not life-threatening in most cases, to severe cases where the infected person may actually die. The very <Col N="197" /> young and the elderly are particularly at risk and other vulnerable groups, such as the immunocompromised and pregnant women, may be at greater risk than the rest of the population.</P>
      <P>Statistics on cases or outbreaks of food poisoning will never be complete, accurate or up to date but the responsibility for collection and collation of the data currently rests with the Department of Health and Children. Many types of food poisoning, however, are not even notifiable. Incredible as it might seem, e.coli 0157:H7 is not yet notifiable in this country. This particular micro-organism was first associated with food poisoning in 1982. Its symptoms are well defined. Among other symptoms, it may cause severe kidney damage. There was a huge outbreak in Scotland just over two years ago when 20 people died. Many other outbreaks have been recorded throughout the world. A very small infective dose will cause illness and we know that here in Ireland at least one child, sadly, died from an infection with this bacteria a few years ago. We also know that it has been isolated from an increasing number of patients in Irish hospitals in the past few years, though these cases were not necessarily traced to a food source. Clearly its incidence is on the increase. It is life-threatening. We have a number of dedicated funded research programmes in our universities and research institutes, so the awareness level is high yet it is not notifiable. It is totally unacceptable that this particular food-borne illness is not notifiable.</P>
      <P>Another food poisoning bacterium that we know is very common is campylobacter. In the United Kingdom and the United States, it is the single most common cause of food-borne illness, well ahead of salmonella, and yet campylobacter is not notifiable here either. The incidence of food related illness from campylobacter has been widely documented since the late 1970s. It has to be admitted that the symptoms are not nearly as serious as those caused by e.coli 0157 but, nevertheless, they are very unpleasant and debilitating for the unfortunate victim. It seems that Ireland is lagging behind in a big way in relation to notification procedures. The cost of this lethargy is borne by the unfortunate consumer who falls victim to the illness and, in both the cases I have just mentioned, they do not even become a statistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the fact that a number of food-borne illnesses are not notified, there are many pitfalls in the notification system as it exists at present. In the first instance, the patient must go along to his or her general practitioner, and many people who experience mild symptoms of food poisoning never even get to the reporting stage. According to the infectious diseases legislation of 1981, the requirements for notification currently remain with doctors, environmental health officers and directors of community care. Reporting from laboratory confirmed infections is voluntary at present, and while any data is useful, what is currently available is far from complete and it is widely recognised that a high level of under-reporting exists, particularly for mild ill<Col N="198" /> ness. Incidentally, this is true for other countries as well as Ireland; it is not peculiar to Ireland. A co-ordination of the various sources of data collection through one recognised agency and with a standardised questionnaire would do much to simplify the system and, at the same time, improve the level of awareness of the real incidence of food-borne illness.</P>
    <P>In addition to the cost in terms of illness that I have outlined, and the attendant human suffering, there are many other costs also associated with food-borne illness. These include medical expenses, loss in productivity and the possible recall of a product from the market. That would include the subsequent financial cost and the cost of the damage done to the perception of our quality and safe food industry.</P>
    <P>The recent figures for food-borne illness and the associated costs suggest that the Minister needs to provide additional resources as a matter of urgency, especially in data collection, the inspectorate and the laboratory area. The Food Safety Authority has been very proactive in attempting to raise the level of awareness in relation to food poisoning. It seems, however, that much greater resources need to be concentrated in this whole area if we are to have confidence in it.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy, without exception, who spoke on the national beef assurance scheme referred to food safety as a matter of priority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Upton for raising this matter on the Adjournment. Under the provisions of the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981, a number of categories of food poisoning are statutorily notifiable by medical practitioners to the health boards. The health boards in turn make weekly returns of infectious disease notifications to my Department. The figure of 2,233 cases referred to by Deputy Upton does not accord with the provisional figure of 2,140 cases for 1999 notified to date by the Eastern Health Board to my Department. We are in contact with the board with a view to finalising the 1999 figures.</P>
      <P>In 1998, 2,678 cases were reported in the Eastern Health Board area. However, there is no room for complacency. We are aware that the reported figures are really only the tip of the iceberg and that the actual figures are likely to be somewhat greater. The diseases that can cause severe illness &ndash; for example, salmonellosis &ndash; are most likely to be notified by clinicians, but people who suffer from food poisoning, where the symptoms are clinically mild &ndash; for example, small round structured viruses &ndash; may not seek medical care. It is estimated, therefore, that there is a high incidence of under-reporting, the extent of which varies from year to year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both globally and in Ireland there has been a trend towards an increase in the reporting of cases of food poisoning. The reasons for increased reporting are many, and I would like to <Col N="199" /> outline some of those. First, with improved food-borne disease surveillance being carried out by the health boards, in co-operation with the National Disease Surveillance Centre and the Food Safety Authority, the figures are likely to increase in coming years rather than decrease. This is a trend not only for Ireland but is the case for many other countries.</P>
    <P>Second, we have seen over the past few years an increase in the reporting of food-borne illness because of increased consumer awareness. Consumers are now more aware of food-borne disease because of the educational consumer focused campaigns carried out by public health departments of the health boards, the food unit and the health promotion unit of my Department, and by the newly established Food Safety Authority of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Third, we have seen an enormous increase in the market for convenience foods associated with a change in lifestyle of Irish consumers. More and more people are eating out, which has resulted in the rapid expansion of fast food outlets. Some staff working in this area are untrained and inexperienced in food hygiene practices. It is imperative that employees know the causes of food poisoning and what they must do to prevent it. The responsibility for good food hygiene practices rests firmly on the owners of these food businesses.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland, which has been in existence on a non-statutory basis since 1997, was formally established by the Government in January 1999. This honours the commitment contained in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium that an independent, science based statutory agency with responsibility for food safety be set up. In July last year the Food Safety Authority took over responsibility for the enforcement of all food safety legislation which, prior to that date, had been the responsibility of a range of State agencies. The primary function of the Food Safety Authority is to ensure that food produced or marketed in Ireland meets the highest standards of food safety and hygiene. The authority also has a statutory function to foster at all stages of food production, from primary production through to final use by the consumer, the establishment and maintenance of high standards of food hygiene and safety.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Authority is not solely concerned with the compliance of food safety legislation and it places great emphasis on the creation of a culture of food safety in Ireland. In this regard, we must be conscious that the responsibility for food safety lies at all levels, producer, retailer and consumer. While it is not possible to completely prevent food poisoning, the work of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland should help to minimise outbreaks in the future by developing a food safety culture. Already the Food Safety Authority has provided a guide for takeaway <Col N="200" /> premises because of the relatively high risk associated with ready to go meals.</P>
    <P>Another major initiative relates to the use of eggs in the catering sector. Eggs have been associated with outbreaks of salmonella food poisoning.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Authority has collaborated with the egg association and An Bord Bia in developing a quality assurance scheme that incorporates strict disease control and monitoring measures in flocks.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Authority has also had major initiatives focused on the control and prevention of e.coli 0157 in the food chain. This has involved working closely with the food sector in developing codes of best practice for reducing contamination of meat products during processing and the safety labelling of minced beef products with consumer instructions for preparation and cooking of these foods. I also note the reduction in the reported incidence of e.coli 0157 infection from 76 cases in 1998 to 51 cases in 1999.</P>
    <P>I am aware that e.coli is not at present a notifiable disease under the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981, although an informal reporting mechanism is in place. However, the current list of notifiable diseases under these regulations is being reviewed by the scientific advisory committee of the National Disease Surveillance Centre as part of a process of review of the regulations. I will ensure that campylobacter is included among the diseases.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue on the Adjournment.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Area Development Management Scheme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the extension of the area development management scheme to County Laois in the context of the national plan's proposed allocation of funding and projects to the Border, midlands and western counties.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State will be aware that a total of £15 billion is available for infrastructural developments, employment and social inclusion in the Border, midlands and western region. Much of this will be channelled through the ADM partnership boards. The area development management scheme was established some years ago and has been successful in many parts of the country. Reading through the annual report of the ADM partnership groups some weeks ago, I noted with dissatisfaction and surprise that the only county in the Border, midlands and western group that does not have a partnership board is County Laois. This will have to be put right by the Government by way of remedial action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Western Development Board and voluntary and community groups throughout Connacht have been most successful in recent years in making a case for the allocation of funding for the provision of infrastructural development and jobs in the area west of the Shannon. The voluntary and community groups and the area development <Col N="201" /> management partnership boards in the Border group of counties have also been successful. As a result of the peace dividend and funds from INTERREG and the United States, there will be substantial investment in the Border area in years to come.</P>
    <P>My plea tonight is on behalf of the midlands. The Minister of State will be aware that there is a jobs deficit in the midlands. A number of task forces are in operation, some of which have been <i>in situ</i> for some time but they have reported little progress. I am referring not only to Longford, Mullingar and Westmeath but also to County Laois where a jobs task force has been in operation for a year since the loss of 370 jobs at Avon Arlington in Portarlington. Unemployment figures for Laois are higher than the national average and in recent years, despite the economic boom about which we hear so much, job figures for the county show a net loss in industrial and manufacturing jobs in 1998 and 1999. The towns of Portlaoise, Portarlington and Mountmellick still have higher unemployment rates than the national average.</P>
    <P>The local infrastructural sub-programme in the national plan will see a massive investment of £294 million for rural water programmes. How much of this will go to areas which do not have ADM partnerships? The total sum allocated for investment in waste management is £240 million, a staggering sum. The plan proposes to allocate £31 million for urban and village renewal; £156 million for culture, sport and recreation; £59 million for tourism; £54 million for micro-enterprise measures and £94 million for rural development. The sub-programme for social inclusion for the Border, midlands and western counties is allocated the huge sum of £220 million. That funding is expected to deal with the consequences of poverty in the area in terms of its impact on the environment and on rural areas.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to level the playing pitch. County Laois will not get its fair share of funding without the extension of the ADM.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Ryan, regrets he cannot be present to respond on this matter. Area Development Management Limited, ADM, the independent company set up jointly by the Irish Government and the European Commission in 1992, has direct responsibility for the management of the sub-programme Integrated Development of Designated Disadvantaged and Other Areas, which formed part of the EU co-financed Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development, 1994-99.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1994, the Government designated, on the basis of objective indicators of need, the specific areas of disadvantage to participate in the sub-programme. The indicators of deprivation used to determine the areas included: unemployment levels, proportion of persons in small farming, age dependency levels, percentage of persons leaving school under 15 years of age, percentage of persons with third level education, proportion of <Col N="202" /> home ownership, home size &ndash; average number of rooms, percentage of lone parents and car ownership.</P>
    <P>When these indicators were aggregated, County Laois ranked better than the national average and it is one of six counties where no areas were designated as disadvantaged for the purposes of the sub-programme. The Deputy will be aware that parts of Counties Offaly and Louth are in a similar position. However, this did not mean that County Laois was ruled out for support under the sub-programme. The community group strand was developed to provide support for ADM selected groups working outside the designated areas. This strand operates parallel to the disadvantaged areas/partnership strand of the sub-programme.</P>
    <P>The aim of the community group strand is to support the 33 selected groups throughout the country in the implementation of their integrated plans that were designed to reverse local decline and animate economic and social regeneration. The groups vary in size, focus and experience. Some had long experience and established track records in their areas, others were newly formed.</P>
    <P>There are two ADM supported community groups operating in County Laois. The Mountmellick Community Development Association was formed in 1982 and secured more than £400,000 from ADM for its 1996-99 plan. Portlaoise Community Action Project was formed in 1997 to counter marginalisation, exclusion and disadvantage in Portlaoise. It was approved for funding of £365,000 from ADM.</P>
    <P>The national development plan has provided over £400 million in the regional operational programmes for social inclusion measures that fall within the ambit of my Department. About 50% of this will be available under certain measures to continue and augment the valuable work carried out by the area-based partnership companies and ADM-supported community groups.</P>
    <P>Any adjustment to existing local development structures can only be made in the context of the recommendations of the task force on the integration of local government and local development systems to which the Government is fully committed. This task force was established by the Government under the chairmanship of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, to examine the issue of better linkages within and across publicly-funded programmes to provide a cohesive framework for the delivery of local services. The task force published its recommendations in August 1998. Central to its recommendations is the establishment of county-city development boards whose primary functions will be to draw up a comprehensive strategy for economic, social and cultural development within the county-city and to work towards its implementation. The boards are expected to be in place by the end of March 2000.</P>
    <P>Existing local structures will continue broadly as they are, pending the completion of the county-city development board plans. It is fore<Col N="203" /> seen that the partnerships, ADM-supported community groups, Leader groups and other local agencies will work with the local directors of community and enterprise and county-city development boards to bring about an agreed realignment of boundaries and work focus to comply with the recommendations of the report of the <Col N="204" /> task force. In light of the ongoing integration of local development and local government systems, it is not proposed to adjust existing area based partnership structures at this time.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.12 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 10 February 2000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the House on 7 December, the National Centre for Partnership, established under Partnership 2000, has undertaken a significant amount of work in the past year.</P>
      <P>In December 1998, a training programme for the development of partnership in the public sector workplace was launched. The programme, entitled Working Together, is designed to help managers, trade union representatives and employees to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to develop a partnership approach at the level of the workplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="208" /> It is of use to trainers-facilitators who are working with partnership groups and in particular with groups that are getting started. The programme is available without charge from the NCP by attendance at half-day briefings on the materials and their usage. To date approximately 100 organisations have attended these briefings.</P>
    <P>For the private sector, a 13 module joint partnership training programme together with a supporting 25 minute video is available. This programme was developed jointly by the NCP, IBEC and ICTU as a very substantial contribution to enterprise level partnership.</P>
    <P>A business plan, which has been approved by the board of the centre, for the joint delivery of this programme is being implemented at present. The business plan sets out clear parameters for joint delivery of this programme, together with a monitoring system to measure progress.</P>
    <P>The programme is still at a pilot stage and is co-ordinated by a steering committee comprising senior representatives from IBEC, ICTU and the NCP. This committee meets regularly to review progress against agreed objectives set out in the business plan. The steering committee reports progress to the liaison group and the board of the centre. There is a provision in the business plan for an independent evaluation to review the overall effectiveness of the public and in-company pilot phase of the programme.</P>
    <P>As I have previously mentioned, in addition to the ongoing work of the NCP, an evaluation of the progress made on partnership in both the public and private sectors and the associated role of the NCP is being undertaken in my Department and is nearing completion.</P>
    <P>As set out in the programme for prosperity and fairness, it is proposed to enhance the role of the National Centre for Partnership to support the deepening of partnership in the public and private sectors. Following consultation with IBEC and ICTU, proposals will be made to Government on the detailed arrangements to be put in place to give effect to the strengthened institutional structures required.</P>

It met again yesterday evening to consider,<i> inter alia</i>, the launch of the Intergovernmental Conference on 14 February, and the co-ordination of Ireland's approach to the Lisbon Special European Council on Employment which will take place on 23-24 March.</P>
      <P>I spoke to the Portuguese Prime Minister, Mr. Antonio Guterres on Sunday, 30 January, about the proposed composition of the Austrian Government. Mr. Guterres was making contact with member states of the Union in relation to their individual bilateral responses. An agreed approach was developed by the Portuguese presidency on foot of these consultations and after it had been conveyed by Prime Minister Guterres to the Austrian President it was made public.</P>
      <P>Following this statement I spoke to PM Guterres again. In addition, my office has maintained continuing contact with the Portuguese Prime Minister's office on this issue. I also received a phone call from the then Vice Chancellor and acting Foreign Minister Mr Wolfgang Schüssel on 2 February on the proposed programme of the new Austrian coalition Government. I took the opportunity to stress the essential importance of the common european values of democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the need for a clear reaffirmation by the new Austrian Government of its intention to honour these values and its adherence to its international obligations both within the Union and other international fora.</P>
      <P>The statement from the 14 member states relates to the broad conduct of bilateral relations with Austria. It will, of course, remain to individual member states to determine the operational application of the measures in the statement and it is the Government's intention to examine each proposed contact on a case by case basis.</P>
      <P>Importantly, as Commission President Prodi has made clear, the work of the EU in its institutions is not affected.</P>

      <P>The Government has had meetings recently in Ballaghderreen, County Roscommon and at Knocknaheeny in Cork city. These meetings, were planned in association with meetings between the Government and the regional assemblies and regional consultative fora organised by the Department of Finance on the operational programmes being prepared under the national development plan.</P>
      <P>The additional costs in the Government secretariat relating to the two Government meetings held as a result of this initiative are estimated to be modest, comprising mainly travel, the cost of refreshments and subsistence allowances paid for staff involved in planning and servicing the meetings. These costs have yet to be assessed but are expected to be in the region of £2,500-£3,000 for each meeting.</P>
      <P>The effort to undertake these regional Cabinet meetings has been worthwhile. I also believe this initiative was generally welcomed and I intend to have further such meetings in due course.</P>

      <P>I utterly condemn the appalling attack on Mahon's Hotel in Irvinestown, County Fermanagh.

They will not succeed in their objectives and we will do everything we have to do to ensure they do not succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British and the Irish Governments received a report of the International Commission last Monday week, in line with an undertaking by the commission in its previous report of 10 December. In the light of ongoing and intensive consultations between the two Governments, and with the parties, it was decided not to publish the report at that time. I thank General John de <Col N="212" /> Chastelain and his colleagues Ambassador Andrew Sens and Brigadier Tauno Nieminen for their continuing dedicated work.</P>
    <P>As I said last week, it is clear that we are at a crucial stage in regard to the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. Having regard to the circumstances, Deputies will understand that I am not in a position to elaborate further or to speculate on any possible scenarios at this time. We are engaging intensively and Deputies will understand the need for further consultations.</P>
    <P>As I indicated yesterday, there will be an opportunity for these matters to be addressed in the House when the outcome of current contacts is clear.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 to 39, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The negotiations on a new social partnership programme concluded on Monday evening last with the launch of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness by the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and myself.</P>
      <P>This new programme sets out a very ambitious agenda. It outlines a comprehensive series of integrated economic and social objectives and sets out clear pathways through which they will be pursued.</P>
      <P>At the launch of the negotiations on 9 November last, I set out the key challenges, from the Government's perspective, facing the social partnership process. These were to ensure that everyone can feel the benefit of social partnership recognising that, for many people, poverty and social exclusion are still a stark reality; to bring about real tangible improvements in living standards, not only in terms of income but also across the issues affecting the quality of people's lives, such as housing and transport; and to master the challenges posed by the information revolution, globalisation and EU enlargement, which dominate our changing world.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness will not only address these challenges, but will also provide a solid basis for moving forward, in both economic and social terms. That captures the core objective and overall thrust of the NESC strategy report, which underpins and sets the context for the new programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="213" /> The pay elements of the new programme acknowledge the enormous contribution which tens of thousands of employees have made in building the success which has been clearly self-evident throughout the past few years. It is proper and fair that this should be the case, so that all may experience in a meaningful way the benefits of economic growth.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>The National Millennium Committee was set up to advise the Government on projects for inclusion in it's millennium programme. A total fund of £30 million was allocated to this programme, covering the period 1999 and 2000. Following a national advertising campaign, more than 2000 proposals have been submitted to the committee for consideration. In the past 12 months the committee has considered the proposals received and has made recommendations on projects to the Government on a regular basis. The recommendations of the committee reflect particular themes, for example, children, youth and the elderly, the environment and the celebration of christianity. In addition the committee has also endeavoured to ensure a wide geographic spread of projects.</P>
      <P>To date the millennium committee has made recommendations on projects amounting to nearly £29 million. This figure includes £3 million for 193 locally based projects around the country under the millennium recognition awards, an initiative administered by Area Development Management Limited. It also includes £3 million for 1,959 millennium events awards, administered by local authorities. To date just over £6.4 million has been drawn down in respect of the millennium programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Millennium Committee is supported by a small millennium office, the operational budget of which is included in the overall millennium fund. At this stage millennium funding is virtually fully committed. The National Millennium Committee is now in the process of finalising consideration of outstanding projects with a view to allocating the remaining funds available. The committee is approaching this final task with due regard to ensuring a broad thematic <Col N="214" /> and geographic spread, consistent with its previous recommendations to the Government.</P>

      <P>The Irish Organisation of Market and Street Traders has written to me conveying its views on various aspects of the operation of the Act. However, as I have explained to them, the local authorities are now the relevant competent authorities for this activity.

The decision on the making of by-laws is one for the elected members of local authorities and the Act provides an appeal system for those aggrieved by the by-laws.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 114 together.</P>
      <P>Since the announcement of redundancies in Fruit of the Loom at the end of 1998, Enterprise Ireland has approved investment assistance towards projects that have the potential to create approximately 250 jobs throughout the county. In addition, a medical equipment company from Malaysia is expected to commence production in Dungloe later this year with assistance from Udarás na Gaeltachta. This project will provide initial employment of 75, rising to more than 300.</P>
      <P>The immediate priority of the Donegal employment initiative was to facilitate re-entry to employment or retraining for all those who lost their jobs in Fruit of the Loom and other plants in Donegal in recent months. A programme of registration interviews was organised by FÁS and all of the redundant workers were offered re-training opportunities. FÁS has recently completed a review of more than 1,000 redundant workers who had been registered under this programme. A total of 22% of those who responded, 477, indicated that they had signed off the live register to take up a wide variety of new employment opportunities. A further 16% indicated that they had signed off to take up training.</P>
      <P>Fruit of the Loom's parent company, Fruit of the Loom Inc., recently filed a petition for a re-organisation under chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code while it prepares for a financial and operating restructuring. As part of its re-organisation, one of its bank lenders agreed to provide a new $625 million credit facility. Fruit of the Loom Inc., stated that this facility will ensure that it has the short-term capital necessary to continue normal day to day operations. The company also stated that the chapter 11 filing should have little impact on customers and employees.

      <Quest> the measures, if any, which will be implemented to ensure a better distribution of job creation throughout the country in view of the needs of the Border region and the need to attract inward investment to County Cavan; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <P>The Government, through its enterprise support agencies, is committed to ensuring the most equitable distribution of job opportunities. The development agencies are now strongly focused on achieving this aim and resources are being deployed to reflect this new focus. In this regard, the Border region, including Cavan, is a particular priority location for promotional purposes by the agencies.</P>
      <P>The agencies' focus on regionalisation ensures that an attractive financial package will be made available to any appropriate project, which may choose to locate or expand in the regions.</P>
      <P>IDA lreland as part of its new focus on the regions, is seeking to deliver more than 50% of all newly approved greenfield jobs to the Objective One region, which includes Cavan and Monaghan. As a direct result of this increased marketing focus, there is a strong flow of potential clients visiting the advance factory in Cavan. IDA Ireland's objective is to secure a client for this facility at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland's regional strategy includes the establishment of its new Border headquarters in Cavan town where the agency's area director is based, together with newly appointed staff for this office. Internally, IDA Ireland has been restructured to support this strategy. Staff resources in the agency's offices for the Border region have been increased by one third, giving greater focus on the entire area.</P>
      <P>However, the new IDA Ireland strategy, is not merely a question of jobs dispersal, it also aims to bring a better mix of industry sectors and higher value industries to locations around the country, in particular, to locations that have not seen the emergence of the more modern industries. The agency's new strategy also addresses the need to increase the value and sustainability of overseas companies already established or about to establish in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland is also committed to developing indigenous industry and to regional dispersal. In addition to working with its core client base, the agency, because of its involvement in all aspects of business development &ndash; finance, technology, human resources, etc &ndash; works closely with all development organisations in the region as well as the third level educational institutions, local development bodies and other industry to pro actively facilitate an integrated approach to development in the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Complementary measures in the national development plan, recently announced, will also help to underpin IDA Ireland's regional strategy since it will provide the infrastructure necessary for the attraction of overseas investment currently lacking outside the major urban areas. The plan envisages spending a higher amount per <Col N="217" /> head of population in the largely rural Border, midland and west regions.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the co-ordinated efforts being made by the development agencies will advance the further economic development of the region.</P>

      <P>Since 4 November last, a significant development in relation to our Department's company investigations has been the commencement of section 53, of the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1999, on 21 December 1999. This brought into effect the amendment of section 21 of the Companies Act, 1990, which was debated at length in this House.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the revised section 21, we have disclosed to the Moriarty Tribunal on 24 January last, the Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited report, the Garuda Limited report and a portion of the Faxhill Homes Limited report, all of which were prepared by or on behalf of our Department under section 19, of the 1990 Act. We also referred the Garuda Limited report and part of the Faxhill Homes Limited report, to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, on 31 January last.</P>
      <P>For the reasons advanced in our earlier reply, we transmitted the Garuda Limited report back to the DPP on 31 January last also. This brings to three the number of company investigation reports, currently in the possession of the DPP, as the reports on Bula Resources (Holdings) plc and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited (NIBFS) were transmitted to him, in mid-1998.</P>
      <P>Following a recent request from Mr Justice Flood, we disclosed to the Flood Tribunal yesterday, a copy of the interim report of Mr Martin Cosgrove of our Department, into NIBFS. We have also decided to forward a copy of the Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited report to the tribunal, and the necessary arrangements are being made to give effect to this decision, in the next few days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday, the Supreme Court issued its judgment in respect of the judicial review proceedings, launched by Dunnes Stores against our decisions in July of 1998 to examine, pursuant to section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990, the books and documents of Dunnes Stores (ILAC Centre) Limited and Dunnes Stores Ireland Company. The House may recall that last July, the High <Col N="218" /> Court held that these decisions were properly made, but that the demand made by our authorised officer for books and documents, was not of a sufficiently specific character. However, the Supreme Court has held that the High Court did not determine, a number of other matters in this case. Consequently, it has set aside the High Court order in its entirety and has remitted the proceedings back to the High Court, for a fresh determination of the issues at stake. We will be seeking an early date for a re-hearing of the case in the High Court.</P>
    <P>The six examinations of the books and documents of Celtic Helicopters Limited, College Trustees Limited, Guinness &amp; Mahon (Ireland) Limited, Hamilton Ross Company Limited, Irish Intercontinental Bank Limited and Kentford Securities Limited are ongoing. The same applies to the three company inquiries, being undertaken under the auspices of the High Court, into National Irish Bank Limited, NIBFS and Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited. I have no significant developments to report with respect to these investigations, since 4 November last. I am aware that our authorised officer is currently finalising one of his remaining reports, which we expect to receive in the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>Flair Plastics, a Dutch company, manufactures a range of plastic garden furniture at Tallow, County Waterford. The company currently employs 12 people.</P>
      <P>I was originally advised of a crisis at the company in October 1998. By that time, the company had been experiencing difficulties since June 1995 when the parent company went into receivership. Another Dutch investment group, Badine BV, then acquired Flair Plastics. The owner of Badine BV died in October 1998, which in turn led to a series of financial complications for the company. This resulted in a critical cash flow position and this ultimately led to a series of takeover attempts to maintain employment.</P>
      <P>Flair Plastics is now in the course of winding down its operations following the failure, in late 1999, of a potential rescue through a takeover by a Canadian company. The company also failed to respond to an IDA effort to resolve its financial difficulties. There is little prospect of successfully continuing operations and IDA is now seeking full recovery of its grants from the company.</P>
      <P>The IDA will continue to work with the existing owners in an attempt to maintain employment for as long as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 117 together.</P>
      <P>In general, conditions of employment, including compassionate leave provisions, for the vast majority of workers are matters for negotiation between employers and employees.</P>
      <P>There is currently no entitlement under employment protection legislation administered by my Department that provides specifically for compassionate leave for a worker to care for an elderly relative. EU Directives, to date, are silent on this issue.</P>
      <P>However, my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, recently announced a proposed carer's benefit scheme which will provide financial support to employees who leave work to look after a person in need of full-time care and attention for a period of up to 15 months. Employees who leave their employment to take up caring duties will be entitled to the protection of their employment rights and it is my intention to introduce legislation to provide for such protection under a proposed carer's leave Bill. I hope to bring this legislation forward as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Parental Leave Act, 1998, administered by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, provides that an employee is entitled to limited leave with pay from his or her employment, known as <i>force majeure </i>leave, where for urgent family reasons, owing to the injury or illness of a close family member, the immediate presence of the employee, at the place where the injured or ill person is situated, is indispensable. Entitlement to <i>force majeure</i> leave is limited to three days in any period of 12 consecutive months or five days in any period of 36 consecutive months.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 110 together.</P>
      <P>I do not have any plans for changing the new three year limit on participation in the community employment programme which is considered essential to address the previously identified pattern of repeated participation on the programme, rather than it being used as an active labour market measure encouraging transition to employment in the open labour market.</P>
      <P>The following revised implementation guidelines have been agreed with FÁS following the restructuring of the programme approved by Government in July 1999: the eligibility age for participation has been raised from 21 years to 25 years with effect from 1 January 2000; the following exemptions will apply for persons under 25 years of age &ndash; Travellers, ex-offenders, refugees, people with disabilities, people referred under drugs task force, offshore island inhabitants, 18-24 year olds, referred through EAP, who are 18 months or more unemployed; duration of participant breaks between schemes to be increased from six to 12 months with effect from 3 April 2000; offshore island residents will be exempt from this change; future participation by an individual will be capped at three years with effect from 3 April 2000; an individual's previous participation on the programme will not be taken into account; offshore island residents will be exempt from this change; the number of places on the programme will be reduced over a five year period to 28,000. There will be synchronisation to the greatest degree possible between the introduction of the new social economy programme and reductions of community employment places; eligibility to participate in the programme has been extended to qualified adults and widow's-widower's with effect from 15 September 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out that, subsequent to the information contained in answers to previous oral Par<Col N="221" /> liamentary Questions on this issue, Question No. 33 dated 4 November 1999 and Questions Nos. 68 and 98 on 30 November 1999, the date for introducing the new eligibility age limit of 25 years and the three year cap has been postponed to 3 April 2000. This postponement has been requested by FÁS for operational and administrative reasons.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the operation of the community employment programme in 2000 will continue to be monitored closely by my Department in consultation with FÁS. In addition, it is my intention that there will be close consultation with the social partners regarding the future provision of key essential services currently provided under community employment.</P>

I would also point out to the Deputy that the 1995 construction regulations require that a preliminary safety plan should be produced at the project design stage for all but the smallest developments.

    <P>I would also like to inform the Deputy that I have recently secured Government sanction to allow the authority to increase its staff numbers by 25 in 2000, thereby bringing its total staff complement to 160. These additional resources will be a very valuable asset in targeting high-risk sectors such as construction, in the context of inspection and enforcement activities.</P>
    <P>I would stress, however, that a reduction in accidents and fatalities in any sector will not be brought about simply by the provision of extra inspectors. Inspection is, but one element, in the drive to improve safety standards in all sectors of employment. While the primary statutory duty of care to ensure a safe place of work rests with the employer, joint responsibility, commitment and participation, from all sides, is necessary to foster safe work practices at ground level. Nowhere is this more vital than in the construction sector.</P>
    <P>A good example of a partnership approach to workplace safety is the construction safety partnership which I launched in October of last year. The report of the partnership is currently being finalised and is due to be submitted to me later this month. This report will include actions, agreed by employers and workers in the industry, aimed at bringing about major improvements in health and safety in the construction sector.</P>

On 26 July 1999 the Government decided to grant the right to seek work to asylum seekers who had been in the country for 12 months or more and who were still awaiting a determination of their application for refugee status.

      <Col N="224" /> More recently, in response to the identified needs of this group, the Government decided to allocate IR £0.5 million each year for the years 2000 and 2001 to establish a dedicated unit within FÁS to assist eligible asylum seekers to find employment through placing them in contact with relevant employers. This unit is currently being established. I can assure the Deputy that the ongoing needs of this group remain under review in my Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 112 together.</P>
      <P>Workplace is an initiative designed to prevent the drift into long-term unemployment of persons who are unemployed six months or more by placing them with employers for a five week trial period. FÁS does not keep a record of the number of employers participating in the programme. However, information on participants is available.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,769 participants started on the workplace programme in 1999 at a cost of £221,000.  The projected cost of workplace in 2000 is £300,000. There are 5,000 places available on this programme. However, the unprecedented level of jobs growth and competition from other programmes has resulted in a lower than anticipated uptake of places on this programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt);</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 111 together.</P>
      <P>In December 1999 the Government, in the context of its consideration of the national minimum wage, NMW Bill, approved the allocation to the labour inspectorate section of my Department of the following additional staff for enforcement activity: 7 labour inspectors, 1 executive officer, 2 clerical officers.</P>
      <P>The seven additional inspectors, together with the existing inspectors, will perform, in addition to NMW enforcement duties, the full range of duties as otherwise currently applicable to the post of labour inspector.</P>
      <P>The grading level of a labour inspector is that of executive officer. The appointees will be expected to acquire a detailed knowledge of employment rights and NMW legislation and of the pay rates and other conditions of employment specified in employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements. They will also have to become familiar with the general role and functions of the various adjudicating bodies involved in the process of employment dispute settlement. They must be capable of working responsibly and efficiently on their own initiative and of delivering relevant enforcement targets and objectives.</P>
      <P>Last month applications were sought within my Department for appointment to the post of labour inspector. The new inspectors will be appointed before 1 April 2000.</P>
      <P>It is hoped, too, to have the additional executive officer and clerical officers also appointed by 1 April 2000. These officers will be engaged in general administrative duties resulting from the increased casework. The duties involved will be non-specialised and, as such, the officers involved will be expected to have the normal range of qualifications relevant to their grade.</P>

      <Quest> if her attention has been drawn to the fact that unemployment levels in Waterford are at 14% or almost three times the national average and will be further increased by the announcement of the considerable reduction in staff in the Ray Ban division of Luxottica; and the proposals, if any, she has to address this problem. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Unemployment is measured by the quarterly national household survey undertaken by the Central Statistics Office. The latest figures for the third quarter June &ndash; August, of 1999 show that the unemployment rate for the south east region, which includes Waterford, was 7.9%, while the figure for the State was 5.7%. The CSO does not publish figures on a county basis.</P>
      <P>Industrial development in particular areas of the country is a day to day matter for the industrial development agencies and not one in which I have a direct function. However, the Government, through its enterprise support agencies, is committed to ensuring the most equitable distribution of job opportunities.</P>
      <P>Over the last year, IDA Ireland has expended considerable effort on reviewing its role and on planning its future strategy to ensure that it continues to meet national needs in the years 2000 and following. In this regard, I have ensured that the need for more balanced regional development has been brought to the core of the agency's agenda and it has now become the main focus of its activity.</P>
      <P>Luxottica, which is involved in the manufacture of Ray Ban sunglasses in Waterford, recently announced that is it to restructure its Irish production plant. This restructuring will involve the transfer of frame production from Waterford to Italy and reduce the Irish workforce by 165 to 95 employees. The company hope that this reduction in numbers will be achieved mainly through voluntary redundancies.</P>
      <P>The key objective now is to ensure that alternative employment is found for those workers who are to lose their jobs at Luxottica. Prospects for attracting new industry into the Waterford region are excellent and in this regard, NTL, the company which bought Cablelink last year, announced on 7 February that it is to set up a customer management centre in Waterford city. The project will employ 250 customer-service, tele-sales and technical support staff and recruitment is to start immediately.</P>

      <P>The report from the high level group, which included representatives from ICTU, IBEC, Government Departments and State agencies, was received last year and work on the legislative proposals is at an advanced stage.</P>
      <P>The general scheme of a Bill to amend the 1946 Industrial Relations Act was agreed by Government recently and the text is currently being drafted. The main features of the legislation are to give the Labour Court new disputes settling powers in cases where an employer has failed to follow agreed voluntary procedures, where negotiating procedures are not in place and collective bargaining is not taking place, and where there has been no recourse to industrial action by the trade union or employees.</P>
      <P>The proposed legislation follows very closely the recommendations of the high level group and will enable the Labour Court to investigate a dispute, issue a recommendation on pay and conditions of employment and if necessary issue a binding determination on pay and conditions. I hope to be in a position to publish the Bill before Easter and introduce legislation in the House shortly thereafter.</P>

      <P>The Third WTO Ministerial Conference, which took place in Seattle from 30 November to 3 <Col N="236" /> December 1999, was not successful in reaching agreement on the launch of a new round of trade liberalisation negotiations for a variety of reasons. It is now clear that more preparations are needed before a new round can be embarked upon.</P>
      <P>The existing WTO agreements pre-commit members to certain follow-on reviews and negotiations across the so-called built-in-agenda topics covering services, agriculture, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, intellectual property, TRIPS, technical barriers to trade, government procurement, investment measures, TRIMS and textiles, 2001 and 2004. Negotiations in these areas have to take place, beginning in 2000, and, in line with the general philosophy of the WTO, should result in increased liberalisations.</P>
      <P>In the absence of a general round of trade negotiations, the immediate focus within the WTO will be on these built-in-agenda issues. Negotiations in these areas will be conducted through the existing WTO groups in Geneva under the direction of the WTO General Council.</P>
      <P>Ireland, in association with our European Union partners, will be participating fully in the Geneva process. We continue to remain committed to the launch of a comprehensive new round involving a broad range of issues. It is our belief that this is the best way to address the challenges resulting from rapid and far-reaching economic changes, to manage properly and effectively the globalisation process, to promote equitable growth and development and to respond in a balanced manner to the interests of all WTO members, in particular the developing countries.</P>

      <P>: The report of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry, which was published in June 1996, made a number of recommendations which concerned the functional responsibilities of a number of Government Departments. In November 1996 the then Minister presented an <i>aide memoire</i> to Government on the recommendations contained in the report. The Government decided that each Minister upon whose area of responsibility the recommendations impacted should revert to Government in relation to any necessary action. As regards my Department, I have referred certain <Col N="237" /> of the recommendations to the group for advice as to how best to implement them into law. This issue forms but one part of the work of the group which has published four discussion papers, including one on this aspect of their terms of reference. When the review group have considered all the comments of interested parties on this and all the other issues they are considering, they will prepare their final report and submit it to me.</P>
      <P>One of the recommendations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry was that an independent Ombudsman to investigate complaints of breaches of press standards be established. The commission was clear that this Ombudsman should be appointed and funded by the newspaper industry. I support the recommendation regarding the establishment of an Ombudsman and I also agree that it is for the newspaper industry to regulate itself in this regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 72 and 107 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government decided on 29 March 1999 to implement new operational arrangements for the management, development and delivery of the national employment service function. These included: &ndash; the assimilation of the local employment service, LES, under FÁS, as a discrete component of a more integrated, dual-stranded national employment service, the other component being the existing FAS employment service; the establishment of an employment service advisory committee within FÁS which will have responsibility for advising the FÁS executive on the operation and development of all components of the national employment service function, including the LES; membership of the advisory <Col N="238" /> committee to comprise the following representatives drawn from the main FÁS Board: one Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, one Department of Finance, one Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, one Department of Education and Science, one IBEC, one ICTU, and one worker director; together with a representative each from INOU, PLANET the representative body of the partnerships, ADM and the LES Co-ordinators.</P>
    <P>It was also agreed that the advisory committee will include a representative from the FAS executive, most likely from the employment services side.</P>
    <P>This integration between the FÁS employment service and the LES, apart from having been advocated in various evaluation reports in recent years, has been endorsed in the current new social partnership agreement.</P>
    <P>If the benefits of assimilation are to be fully secured there must be clear lines of responsibility and authority. Also it must be recognised that the situation and capabilities of the partnerships vary from area to area. I have instructed FÁS to consult with each partnership with a view to putting in place the administrative structures which will achieve co-ordinated transparent and accountable management of the service so that the LES can deliver an effective and efficient service to its clients.</P>

      <Quest> the number of accidents reported in the construction industry in 1999; the number of deaths and the number of people injured as a result; the steps, if any, being taken to deal with the unacceptable level of accidents, injuries and casualties in the sector; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The administration, enforcement and promotion of occupational health and safety legislation is a day to day matter for the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health, known as the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
      <P>Statistical information concerning the number of fatalities and injuries in any work sector is collected by the Health and Safety Authority and is therefore obtainable directly from the Authority at 10 Hogan Place, Dublin 2.</P>
      <P>I have, been informed by the authority that a total of 18 construction-related fatalities were reported to the authority in 1999, and 973 non-fatal accidents involving more than three days absence from work were reported to the authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proper management of workplace health and safety in all sectors of employment is based on the principles of legislation, enforcement, information and partnership. The Safety, Health <Col N="239" /> and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, the 1993 general application regulations and the 1995 construction regulations all provide a strong legislative base by which safety standards in the construction sector can and should be managed. This legislation is enforced in a targeted and pro-active manner by the authority and the additional resources which I recently secured for the authority will enable it to increase its inspection activities, particularly in high-risk sectors such as construction.</P>
    <P>However, a stronger partnership approach by all parties is essential to bring about greater improvements in the construction sector. The report of the construction safety partnership, which I launched last October, will be based on an agreement between both sides of industry. The report is currently being finalised and is due to be submitted to me later this month. This report will include actions, agreed by employers and workers in the industry, aimed at bringing about major improvements in health and safety in the construction sector.</P>

      <P>In the three-month period from 1 November 1999 to 31 January 2000, a total of 3,268 proposed redundancies were notified to my Department under the Redundancy Payment Acts, 1967 to 1991. Notifications in that period included eight closures involving the loss of about 800 jobs.</P>
      <P>In responding to closures, the State development agencies under the aegis of my Department work closely with local interests to attract replacement projects, assist in the expansion of existing industry, identify alternative job opportunities and provide re-training, where appropriate, for workers affected.</P>
      <P>Apart from ongoing efforts to find a replacement project for the Hawkesbay facility, IDA is also actively pursuing a greenfield project for Ardee and discussions with the promoter are continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the impending closure of the Barbour Threads plant in Longford, I would point out that Longford continues to be a focus of high priority by the development agencies. In this context , the Longford inter agency group, which I established following the closure of Atlantic Mills, is actively promoting the county as a base <Col N="241" /> for new and expanding industry. There has been a large number of visits by potential investors to Longford resulting in a number of new projects including Century Homes, timber-framed housing, and Lacemont, a food project, which have a combined job potential of 220 jobs.  The Government is committed to ensuring a policy of more balanced job creation on a regional basis and resources are being deployed for this purpose by the development agencies, local authorities and other interests.</P>

      <P>The terms of reference of the independent group to examine allegations of anti-competitive practices in the beef industry are: to examine allegations of anti-competitive practice in the beef industry; to establish why there is such a large differential between the producer and the prevailing consumer price, and, to make any appropriate recommendations in the matter.</P>
      <P>This group was set up by the Government following its its meeting on 19 January and has already begun its work. It is chaired by Mr. Kevin Bonner, former Secretary General of my Department and also comprises of Professor Seamus Sheehy and Mr. Colm McCarthy. I have asked the group to report to me by 28 April 2000.</P>
      <P>I understand that, in 1997, prior to this Government taking office, the Department of Agriculture and Food requested the Director of Competition Enforcement to conduct an investigation into alleged anti-competitive practices in the beef processing industry. I understand that this was one of a number of complaints relating to the meat plants received by the director which are currently under investigation by him. The director and the competition authority, of which he is a member are independent in the exercise of their statutory functions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77, 115 and 122 together.</P>
      <P>Apprentices are recruited directly by employers in line with their present and projected needs and for this reason it is not possible to quantify what the intake will be for any given year; there are no indications so far this year, however, of a decrease in apprenticeship intake.</P>
      <P>I have not been made aware of difficulties in obtaining apprenticeships, the numbers taking up apprenticeship have almost doubled since 1996. This unprecedented increase in numbers, has created capacity problems in off-the-job training phases &ndash; two, four, and six &ndash; resulting in delays in scheduling training provision. for apprentices.  FÁS and the education sector have been significantly expanding their capacities to address this issue and there are proposals in train to reduce the current bottlenecks.</P>
      <P>At the end of January 2000 the population of those in apprenticeship was 21,194. The numbers in the various phases are as follows: phase 1 &ndash; 6,290; phase 2 &ndash; 2,461; phase 3 &ndash; 5,106; phase 4 &ndash; 1,282; phase 5 &ndash; 3,569; phase 6 &ndash; 814; phase 7 &ndash; 1,672.</P>
      <P>My Department is working closely with FÁS and the Department of Education and Science to monitor the situation and put in place the measures necessary to respond to the current unprecedented demand for apprentices.</P>

      <P>I strongly support the inclusion of trade and labour standards on the agenda of the World Trade <Col N="243" /> Organisation &ndash; WTO. The topic has proven to be a very sensitive one which has caused considerable controversy between developed and developing countries as the latter fear that protectionist reasons underlie requests for WTO work on the issue. These differences continued to be obvious during the recent WTO ministerial meeting in Seattle.</P>
      <P>Because of these sensitivities it is essential that any WTO initiatives should involve the widest participation of WTO members and should also have regard for the existing role and responsibility of the International Labour Organisation &ndash; ILO.</P>
      <P>As part of a comprehensive agenda for WTO new round negotiations and in association with our European Union partners, Ireland has supported a proposal for the establishment of a joint ILO-WTO standing working forum on trade, globalisation and labour issues. This would aim to promote a better understanding of the issues involved through a substantive dialogue between all interested parties, including governments, trade unions and other international organisations.</P>

      <P>There have been two assessments of the effectiveness of the local employment service conducted in recent years &ndash; a Forfás evaluation entitled initial review of the Local Employment Service, January 1997, and a Eustace Clarke evaluation entitled Evaluation of the Local Employment Service, June 1998. Aspects relating to the functioning and organisation of the Employment Service &ndash; both the FÁS and LES components &ndash; were also addressed in the 1996 White Paper on Human Resource Development, the 1998 OECD examination of the public employment service in Ireland, in a statement in December 1998 from the National Competitiveness Council on Skills Needs, and in the ESRI's Report on National Investment Priorities for the period 2000-2006, March 1999.  All of these evaluations and reports are available in the public domain. A key and consistent issue raised in almost all of these reports is the need to integrate the FÁS employment service and LES as a single integrated body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government decision of 29 March 1999 which followed a lengthy and wide ranging consultation process, decided to implement new operational arrangements for the management, <Col N="244" /> development and delivery of the national employment service function. Under these new arrangements the local employment service  &ndash; LES &ndash;  is to be assimilated under FÁS, as a discrete component of a more integrated, dual-stranded national employment service, the other component being the existing FÁS employment service. An employment service advisory committee has been established within FÁS which will have responsibility for advising the FÁS board on the operation and development of all components of the national employment service function, including the LES. Membership of the advisory committee is to comprise the following representatives drawn from the main FÁS board: one Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, one Department of Finance, one Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, one Department of Education and Science, one IBEC, one ICTU, one Worker Director and one FÁS executive representative; together with a representative each from INOU, PLANET, the representative body of the partnerships, ADM and the LES co-ordinators. Practical operational arrangements to assimilate the LES into FÁS will shortly be put in train.</P>

      <P>The great majority of the some 140 reinsurance companies, which are registered in Ireland are either subsidiaries of major international reinsurance groups, or &lsquo;captive' reinsurers of multinational companies. All these companies, which are based in the IFSC, have been carefully vetted, before being granted IFSC tax status, and contribute positively to Ireland's international reputation, as a high quality financial services centre.</P>
      <P>One reinsurance company, not based in the IFSC, has been the subject of unfavourable reports for some time, including reports, in the Irish media. We are also aware of a number of IRNR companies registered as reinsurance brokers, whose activities have also given rise to concern. As far as we are aware, the companies concerned operate exclusively outside of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have taken the following steps to address any damage to Ireland's reputation which could be caused by such companies These are in addition to the company law measures which have been taken to address the general IRNR issue: regulations under the Insurance Act, which came into effect at the end of December 1999, <Col N="245" /> prescribe a detailed form of notification, which must be completed by new reinsurance companies; the arrangement whereby the Companies Registration Office will not register a new reinsurance company until it has been vetted by our Department's insurance division has been reinforced; the new insurance Bill, which is currently before the Dáil, provides that the information in reinsurance notifications, must be updated annually. It brings reinsurance brokers, within the new statutory system of supervision of insurance intermediaries. It also makes provision for the possible introduction, at a future date, of a statutory system of authorisation and supervision of reinsurance companies on the lines of the system that currently applies to insurance companies.</P>
    <P>The new measures have been introduced following extensive consultation with the insurance industry and with others concerned to protect Ireland's reputation as an international financial services centre. We are satisfied that the package of measures described above strikes the right balance between protecting Ireland's international reputation and avoiding the imposition of excessive regulatory requirements on industry.</P>

      <Quest> if her attention has been drawn to the recent quarterly report of the ESRI which suggests that low paid workers have lost out in spite of recent national agreements; the steps, if any, she will take to deal with this problem; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>An integral part of addressing the issue of low pay is the Government's commitment to introduce a national minimum hourly wage. I have recently published the National Minimum Wage Bill, 2000, which delivers on the Government's commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As identified by ESRI's quarterly economic commentary of December 1999 low paid employees have not benefited equally from our <Col N="246" /> recent economic success. I believe that the introduction of a national minimum wage heralds a new era for employees subject to low pay, so that they get a better share of the fruits of our economic growth. It is estimated that some 160,000 low paid employees will benefit from the national minimum wage.</P>
    <P>The issue of low pay has also been one of the main concerns addressed by the recent negotiations on a new draft national agreement, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The agreement provides for pay increases of: 5.5% of basic pay in year one of the agreement; 5.5% of basic pay in year two of the agreement; and 4% of basic pay in the following nine months, or in respect of low paid employees at least £12 in the first phase; £11 in the second phase; and £9 in the third phase where the above amounts are greater than the amounts obtained by reference to the relevant percentage pay increases.</P>
    <P>As stated in the review of An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government aims to complete the implementation of the specific and ambitious aims as set out in the programme, through a balanced strategy of removing more of the low paid from the tax net altogether, by reducing tax rates and by ensuring that a large majority of taxpayers are subject to no more than the standard rate of tax.</P>
    <P>The aim of improving the position of the low paid is given further emphasis in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The Government and the social partners have confirmed their support for further tax reform and tax reductions to improve the position of all taxpayers, increase the real take home pay of those covered by the agreement, especially those with below average earnings, and develop the structure of the tax system to deliver benefits and focus resources in an equitable manner.</P>
    <P>I believe that the implementation of the provisions of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and the introduction of the national minimum wage legislation will ensure that low paid employees benefit to a greater extent than in previous national agreements.</P>
    <P>My colleague the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs yesterday announced a number of additional measures in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill aimed at improving the position of low paid workers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 101 together.</P>
      <P>The Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, sets out the statutory rights for employees in respect of holiday entitlements. The Act provides for the following nine public holidays per year: &ndash; 1 January (New Year's Day); St. Patrick's Day; Easter Monday; the first Monday in May; the first Monday in June; the first Monday in August; the last Monday in October; Christmas Day; St. Stephen's Day.</P>
      <P>The average public holiday entitlement in the EU at present is approximately 11 days annually.</P>
      <P>The Government recognises and values deeply the great contribution rendered by women to the betterment of society both in Ireland and throughout the world. Accordingly it welcomes the designation by the UN of International Women's Day on 8 March 2000 as a day on which to call world attention to, and to celebrate, that great contribution. However, there are no plans to mark International Women's Day or 1 February, or indeed any other days in the foreseeable future, as public holidays.</P>

      <P>The special working group on a personal injuries tribunal, chaired by Mr. Dan McAuley, published its first report in May 1997. In that report the special working group set out two alternative structures, for a mediation board for occupational injury claims &ndash; the first to operate within the courts system, and the second, an alternative mediation structure, to be established on a greenfield basis, outside the ambit of the courts system and operating initially, on a two-year pilot basis.</P>
      <P>A majority of the working group had reservations about the cost effectiveness of a greenfield mediation board and recommended a mediation system to be established within the courts system, having regard to assurances given to it, about the rapid pace and scale of the on-going reform of court procedures and elimination of delays. The special working group recommenced its work in September 1998 investigating issues surrounding alternative or complementary systems for delivering personal injury compensation in Ireland. It has recently completed its research into personal injury compensation systems in operation in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Canada, New Zealand and the USA, in the areas of occupational injuries and motor accident injuries.</P>
      <P>The special working group's consideration of the results of this research and its relevance to the possible improvement of the systems for delivering personal injury compensation in Ireland will, of necessity, involve a re-appraisal of the recommendations in its first report on the establishment of a claims mediation system.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>Late last year I met with representatives of the social partners to clarify the Government's decision on the restructuring of the community employment programme. Following these meetings a set of clear implementation guidelines was adopted which is currently being introduced on a phased basis by FÁS. These guidelines are: the eligibility age for participation has been raised from 21 years to 25 years with effect from 1 January 2000. The following exemptions will apply for persons under 25 years of age: Travellers, ex-offenders, refugees, people with disabilities, people referred under drugs task force offshore island inhabitants, 18-24 year olds referred through EAP who are 18 months or more unemployed; duration of participant breaks between schemes to be increased from six to 12 months with effect from 3 April 2000, offshore island residents will be exempt from this change; future participation by an individual will be capped at three years with effect from 3 April 2000, an individual's previous participation on the programme will not be taken into account, offshore island residents will be exempt from this change; the number of places on the programme will be reduced over a five year period to 28,000; there will be synchronisation to the greatest degree possible between the introduction of the new social economy programme and reductions of community employment places; eligibility to participate in the programme has been extended to qualified adults and widows-widower's with effect from 15 September 1999.</P>
      <P>In addition the new programme for prosperity and fairness makes specific provision in regard to community employment as follows: a special working group, comprising the social partners and representatives of Government Departments, will be established early in 2000 to identify the key essential services currently being provided through CE; and assess the implications of those services for CE in terms of : budget; number of places; having regard to the planned reduction of 4,500 places, as per the Government decision; and the objectives of community employment, including the provision of community services.</P>
      <P>The findings of the special working group will be considered by Government. I can assure the Deputies that my Department will participate fully and constructively in these discussions in order that any issues arising can be resolved as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Over the past decade, consistent industrial and economic policies have helped shape and sustain a supportive and encouraging environment for enterprise. Over time, these policies have been refined both to reflect changes taking place in our economy <Col N="255" /> and to enable enterprise respond to regional and global competition. Their success in helping business create jobs is obvious. For example, the latest quarterly national household survey indicates an increase of 96,600 in the numbers at work between the second quarter of 1999 and the corresponding quarter in 1998. This achievement has been made against increasing competition from globalisation, newly industrialising counties, and increasing competitiveness in our main competitors &ndash; all challenges from other economies with which we have successfully coped.</P>
      <P>Recognising the importance of Ireland's international competitiveness, the Government established the National Competitiveness Council in 1997. The council monitors the country's international competitive position and in its annual reports makes recommendations towards improving our relative performance. These reports have made a significant contribution towards informing Government action aimed at ensuring a competitive economy in both the short and longer term.</P>
      <P>Key objectives of the national development plan are to upgrade economic infrastructure, significantly improve our human resource and skills base thus improving Ireland's international competitive standing. Together with investments in research and innovation, including a more enterprise friendly environment of personal and corporate taxation, I am confident that we are reinforcing our competitiveness and laying the foundations for a sustainable improvement in competitiveness relative to competing economies. These policies will ensure that Ireland remains a competitive economy from which to do business, especially in the high technology growth industries on which the knowledge economy of the future will rely.</P>

      <P>On 29 December last, I announced the establishment of a Review Group on Auditing with the following terms of reference: whether self-regulation in the auditing profession is working effectively and consistently; whether any new or revised structures and arrangements are necessary to improve public confidence, and if so, what form should they take; the role of the external auditor in providing other services to the same institution; the impact of other functions such as tax advice and consultancy on the external audit process; the determination of fees, bearing in mind shareholder <Col N="257" /> interests; the relationships between an external auditor and the management that appoints and remunerates him; the statutory provisions on auditing in the Companies Acts and related codes; the role of the external auditor in ensuring compliance with statutory provisions; the possible role of the Central Bank in regard to management letters issued by external auditors to financial institutions; the possible strengthening of audit standards relating to financial institutions; the suitability of having joint auditors to financial institutions with one being appointed by the Central Bank; the possible introduction of a maximum terms of five years for an auditor to a financial institution; any matters directly related to the foregoing.</P>
      <P>These terms of reference are broader than that recommended in the PAC's DIRT inquiry report to the extent that the review group has also been asked to evaluate self-regulation in the auditing profession.

      <P>In reply to the Deputy's question, one of the most important steps taken in this regard was the establishment of an EMU business awareness campaign, which forms an integral part of the National Information Programme on the euro. The campaign has been managed by Forfás since 1996 and the primary aim of this campaign is to ensure that business operations in Ireland are in possession of all the information necessary to fully prepare them for the introduction of the single currency, euro, throughout participating states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To this end, the campaign has harnessed the support and co-operation of all the main business, trade and professional organisations together <Col N="258" /> with the relevant State development agencies that are in close contact with firms of all sizes in all sectors of the economy. These are represented on the campaign's consultative committee that provides a forum for co-ordination, co-operation and information exchange. In particular, the members of the committee act as information multipliers in terms of disseminating material to their respective members.</P>
    <P>On a strategic level, this campaign has produced, or is currently preparing the following: a study has been produced on options for company strategy in the event of euro/sterling fluctuations; the primary objective of this study was to identify a range of specific actions that companies can adopt to reduce the competitive impact of sterling exchange rate fluctuations; the checklist of possible actions for companies to consider was incorporated as a new document in the campaign's information pack, What about Sterling? Actions for Companies; a business strategies study has recently been undertaken to explore the strategic options available to Irish companies, particularly SMEs, in order to take advantage of the opportunities EMU has created in completing the single market; arising from this study, guidelines and recommendations appropriate to Irish companies wishing to start or increase their business links with other EMU countries are in production as three new inserts to be included in the information pack as well as a more comprehensive booklet on the key issues; a study of the software industry in Ireland is currently being completed which will seek to determine the level and extent of euro-compliant software solutions that are currently available to facilitate Irish businesses in making the changeover; this will include recommendations for appropriate action, if required, to address any potential difficulties identified by the study.</P>
    <P>Under the campaign to date a comprehensive range of publications has been produced and widely disseminated to the business community together with a number of media campaigns. These include: &ndash; 60,000 copies of the campaign's information pack, which is a comprehensive guide for business on all the relevant issues; 143,000 copies of a short, user-friendly brochure summarising the key issues for SME's in relation to EMU and the changeover to the euro; 28,000 copies of a guide to facilitate those involved in cross-Border trade; 94,000 copies of an initial guide for retailers Is your Retail Business Ready for the euro?; 45,000 copies of comprehensive guidelines on the IT issues that need to be considered by companies regarding the changeover to the euro; a regular newsletter, EuroChange, of which twelve issues have been produced to-date, with over 25,000 copies of each issue distributed.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the information and supports which Irish businesses require to make the necessary preparations is widely available through the Forfás EMU business awareness campaign and other business sources. I would emphasise, however, that the final responsibility for prepar<Col N="259" /> ing for EMU and the changeover to the euro ultimately rests with each individual business firm.</P>

      <P>The immediate priority of the Donegal employment initiative was to facilitate re-entry to employment or retraining for all those who lost their jobs in Fruit of the Loom and other plants in Donegal in recent months.  A programme of registration interviews was organised by FÁS and all of the redundant workers were offered re-training opportunities. FAS has recently completed a review of over 1,000 redundant workers who were registered under this programme. Some 22% of those who responded  &ndash; 477 people &ndash; indicated that they had signed off the live register to take up new employment. A further 16% indicated that they had signed off to take up training.</P>
      <P>The longer-term priority of the Donegal employment initiative was to draw up a set of recommendations for establishing Donegal as a prime, competitive and attractive location for job creation. The report of the task force presents a detailed analysis of the development challenge facing the county and recommends a seven-year development strategy to implement the investment priorities identified. On receipt of the report, the Government decided that all relevant Departments should examine the report and consider the investment priorities it proposes in drafting the operational programmes of the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met with the chairman and members of the task force on 23 November 1999 to discuss follow-up action arising from their report. We agreed that an appropriate mechanism is needed to oversee the implementation of the priority actions identified in the report and to liaise with Departments and State agencies in advance of setting up the operational programmes to implement the national development plan. We further agreed that the proposed county development board provides the framework within which such follow-up mechanisms can be readily devised. Accordingly, the chairman of the task force will establish a framework aligned to the structure of the county development board which will enable the various agencies which were involved in the work of the task force to meet and co-ordinate their efforts at local level. I will be meeting with the task force again next week <Col N="260" /> in Donegal to review progress on implementation of these arrangements.</P>

      <P>The administration, enforcement and promotion of occupational health and safety legislation is a day-to-day matter for the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health, known as the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Health and Safety Authority that the construction sector continues to be treated as a priority high-risk sector. In 1999 over 40% of the inspections carried out by the authority's inspectors were on construction sites, although only 10% of the total labour force is employed in that sector. This involved over 4,000 inspections. A considerably increased level of inspection is planned for the current year and additional staff are being recruited for that purpose.</P>
      <P>These inspections will concentrate on the main causes of fatal and serious injury such as; safety management systems; training of operatives; scaffolding; overhead power lines; working at a height; roof work; adequacy of welfare facilities.</P>
      <P>The additional resources which I recently secured for the authority will enable it to increase its inspection activities in all sectors, but particularly in high-risk sectors such as construction. I would stress, however, that a reduction in accidents and fatalities in any sector will not be brought about simply by the provision of extra inspectors. Inspection is, but one element, in the drive to improve safety standards in all sectors of employment. While the primary statutory duty of care to ensure a safe place of work rests with the employer, joint responsibility, commitment and participation, from all sides, is necessary to foster safe work practices at ground level. Nowhere is this more vital than in the construction sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Concerns about the level of premiums for motor insurance have caused our Department to examine the factors contributing to the relatively high level of those premiums with a view to determining whether there is any action which can be taken to effect a reduction in them. This has focused on a number of the key cost elements including the levels of personal injury compensation and the costs associated with settling compensation claims. Concurrent with this examination, efforts are being made to identify measures which both individually and cumulatively could have a moderating effect on insurance costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1996 Deloitte &amp; Touche report on the economic evaluation of insurance costs found that the main contributory factors to rising pre<Col N="262" /> mium costs were the high legal costs component of small claim settlements, the faster rate of medical cost inflation, and the high level of general damages awards relative to special damages in smaller claims. Following consideration by Government of the consultants' report and recommendations, a special working group was established to advise on the establishment of a personal injuries tribunal and to examine issues surrounding alternative systems of personal injury compensation in operation in other jurisdictions. The group will present its final report shortly. In the light of its report, I will consider what follow up to the work of this group is necessary.</P>
    <P>The Motor Insurance Advisory Board, which I established last year to provide information and advice on trends in motor insurance costs, is progressing well with its work.</P>
    <P>Greater attention to safety on the roads can further reinforce insurance cost reduction measures at Government level. A number of initiatives are in place and are being taken, to improve driving standards and safety awareness among all drivers, including young drivers. The Irish Insurance Federation, in conjunction with the Driving Instructors' Register, has introduced a scheme of insurance premium discounts for the young driver on completion of a required number of driving lessons. The National Safety Council, in co-operation with the Garda, continues to promote anti-speeding and anti-drink driving media campaigns including road safety educational programmes for secondary school students.</P>
    <P>The most effective way of ensuring that the Irish consumer is getting the most competitive quotes from insurers, is to have as many insurers as possible competing on the Irish market. It would appear that the implementation of EU legislation, opening up the EU market to competition from all European insurers, has had a beneficial effect on competition in the Irish market. More recently, the abolition of the cap on brokers' commissions should introduce further competition into the market.</P>

      <P>The point raised by the Deputy concerning the inequality of treatment of certain categories of participants on community employment is one which has concerned me and my Department for some time. This issue was addressed in the report of the working group examining the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent families under the tax and social welfare codes. The group considered a number of options for reforming the manner in which lone parents participating in CE are treated <i>vis-à-vis</i> other participants. However, they did not arrive at an agreed approach.</P>
      <P>The one parent family payment was introduced in 1997 by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and allows claimants earn up to £115.38 per week without affecting their social welfare entitlement. This means-tested payment recognises that lone parents often face particular difficulties and costs, especially for child care, in trying to access training or the labour market. When combined, CE earnings and the OPFP does give lone parents a financial advantage over other welfare recipients participating in the CE programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Employment Equality Act prohibits my Department from taking any action in respect of programmes such as CE that would be seen as <Col N="264" /> discriminating against categories of individuals on the grounds of marital status and I do not propose to make any changes to the present system of CE payments.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is currently reviewing the OPFP and may deal with the impact of OPFP on CE participation. I await the outcome of this review with interest.</P>

      <P>Fair and equitable access to world markets is a dominant issue for Ireland in the context of EU Internal Market and WTO trade liberalisation negotiations. We consistently seek to ensure that the interests of Irish exporters are taken fully into account in the development of international trade regulations.</P>
      <P>Ireland's trade performance in recent years has been exceptional, based albeit on rapid growth in a relatively small number of sectors. The establishment of EMU since 1 January 1999 and the advent of enlargement of the European Union have served to intensify competition both at home and abroad. These factors also provide our exporters with new opportunities.</P>
      <P>The diversification of our exports both by country and by sector remains relatively narrow and there is therefore scope for focusing our efforts on emerging markets; both in central and eastern Europe and in Asia as well as expanding our exports of internationally traded services.</P>

      <P>The principal raw material for the foreign-owned textile companies based in Ireland is a chemical polymer which is 100% imported for the production of polyester and nylon fibres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The indigenous textile industry is an industry that is based on traditional strengths. The changes within the industry have been market driven. In recent years the market has been a niche one supplying top end manufacturers and designers with wool and linen products. This market still remains <Col N="265" /> but customers within it have become more demanding in terms of design and finishes.</P>
    <P>In response to these market demands, Enterprise Ireland in conjunction with the industry identified a number of areas that could be improved in design and finishing. A number of initiatives to improve these areas have been undertaken recently and they include: trend forecasting twice yearly; market study visits abroad; new product development support and design improvement incentives.</P>
    <P>Most recently, a joint North-South initiative has been undertaken involving Enterprise Ireland, Industrial Development Board, Northern Ireland, Irish Linen Guild, the International Fund for Ireland and nine participating companies, four from Northern Ireland, five from Republic of Ireland. This initiative, Fabric Ireland, is being launched at Premiere Vision &ndash; leading world textile show &ndash; in Paris on 2 March. The objective of this promotional initiative is to increase sales among the participating companies by 30% over two years.</P>
    <P>The Irish leather industry is focused on the manufacture of wet blue hides which is an intermediate raw material sold to leather finishers outside the country. There is little if any production of finished leather in Ireland suitable for conversion into clothing, footwear, upholstery, etc.</P>
    <P>Leather conversion and finishing operations have in general moved to low cost countries in the far east due to lower labour costs. Primary processing of hides is tending to follow the conversion and finishing sectors to developing countries where, in addition to lower wage rates, environmental regulations tend to be less demanding.</P>
    <P>One exception to this is the production of finished automotive and furniture upholstery. This is a very difficult market to break into because of the tendency of the automotive industry to work with a limited number of proven suppliers of finished leather. A few Irish companies here have developed outlets to these markets for wet blue raw material. Competition, however, is intense with major integrated US beef processors with large-scale operations dictating the economics of the business.</P>

      <P>Industry can meet its skills needs through training existing staff and by recruiting new employees. In both cases, <Col N="266" /> employers have an important responsibility to ensure that they source and upskill staff to meet the competitive challenges facing the business. Equally, the State has a vital role to play in supporting employers in terms of both pre-entry and in-firm training.</P>
      <P>Providing training opportunities for unemployed people, as highlighted in the Deputy's question, is particularly important. In that regard, the Government has in place a wide range of programmes and policies to enhance labour supply and the skills of the unemployed which are set out in the national employment action plan. The process of systematically engaging with unemployed people and supporting them into employment through, for example, the provision of training opportunities by FÁS, is of particular relevance to ensuring that unemployed people have access to training.</P>
      <P>This preventative approach under guidelines one and two of the EAP is supplemented with supports to help the long-term unemployed re-integrate into the open labour market. These supports are provided within the framework of the FÁS action plan for the long-term unemployed. The most recent data available for participation by the LTU in mainline FÁS training programmes during 1999 show that up to the end of November, the LTU represented over 22% of all new starters on these programmes, thus exceeding the 1999 commitment of 20%.</P>
      <P>As regards the broader issue of skills provision, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the work of the expert group on future skills needs. The group has ongoing responsibility for reviewing skills requirements and the adequacy of training and education provision required to meet existing and anticipated demands.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 129 and 130 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="267" /> The dynamic inherent in an enterprise-driven international market economy can result in the movement of firms between different regions and national economies. Ireland has benefited from such movement to a greater extent than we have lost. Our losses have tended to be in lower productivity firms. Changing market circumstances will challenge both indigenous and foreign firms alike to look at market-driven solutions to business issues. Not only will indigenous Irish firms locate in other economies for reasons of cost but also to be closer to customers or to gain access to relevant distribution networks.</P>
    <P>The thrust of enterprise policy is increasingly to provide firms with relevant support to radically improve their productivity and ability to compete. To be competitive, firms must develop the technical capability and management skills to move up the value-chain into more profitable markets and products. Building Irish firms with competitive scale and strong positions in international niche markets often require that they not alone build up competence and capability at home but also make strategic investments in other economies. Such investments can be of long-term benefit to Ireland and have not so far been shown to restrict economic or employment growth at home.</P>
    <P>The changing nature of competition for foreign direct investment projects is reviewed on a regular basis. Policies are being pursued to maximise the continued attractiveness of Ireland as a competitive and desirable location for investors in high technology and high growth sectors and to increase overseas companies' commitment to the economy.</P>
    <P>Ireland is particularly strong in the electronics, software, pharmaceutical and health care sectors where our competitive advantage is a highly educated workforce, a supporting infrastructure of universities and technology institutes, advanced global communications links and an attractive taxation environment. These attributes will be reinforced by further significant investments, through the national development plan, in human resources, skills, research and development and infrastructure which will underpin our competitive position as a location for high technology and high value added enterprise. Wage costs, while important in the overall competitiveness context, constitute one element in firms' overall cost structure and decision making process.</P>
    <P>In working with overseas firms that have located here the emphasis will be on encouraging their operations to move into higher value activities, to encourage them to develop in Ireland strategically important operations for their world-wide corporate structure and to increasingly deepen their activities within our country by establishing such critical business functions as research, development and innovation.</P>
    <P>The availability of high quality business parks, industrial estates and advance building in key centres is necessary to attract greenfield investment, particularly to the regions. IDA Ireland is <Col N="268" /> working to provide these facilities in partnership with local authorities and the private sector.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the thrust of the national development plan towards infrastructure and skills will make a very strong contribution towards the competitiveness of enterprise in Ireland in the years ahead.</P>

      <Quest>the initiatives, if any, Ireland has taken with the Ugandan authorities in regard to the ethnic violence resulting in 8,000 deaths among the Bahema people in a portion of the Congo occupied by Ugandan forces; and, if so, the results of his representations in the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is aware of an outbreak of ethnic violence in the north-east region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, an area under the control of the Ugandan People's Defence Force, between the Bahema and the Balendu people and of reports of more than 10,000 dead. Ireland, with its EU partners, raised its concerns about this situation with the Government of Uganda earlier this month. The Ugandan Government indicated that it shared the concerns about the conflict, which may have arisen over land issues, and stated that extra troops had been sent to the area to try to calm the situation. The commitment of the Ugandan Government to the Lusaka Accords was reaffirmed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government remains deeply concerned at the situation in the Great Lakes region and at the slow pace of implementation of the Lusaka Accords, signed in July 1999 by the Governments of the six countries involved in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo: Uganda, Angola, Namibia, Rwanda, Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Two rebel groups, the MLC, Movement for the Liberation of Congo, and the RCD, Congolese Rally for Democracy, signed the ceasefire agreement in August. We continue to underline our readiness to provide <Col N="271" /> full political, diplomatic and resource support for the implementation of the agreement, which offers a realistic prospect of lasting peace and security in the region, and have pledged financial assistance to the process, provided that the parties show the necessary political will to implement the agreement.</P>
    <P>During his visit to Uganda last November, my predecessor, Deputy Andrews, had detailed discussions with President Museveni regarding the situation in the region and reiterated Ireland's support for the peace process in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</P>

      <Quest>if human rights activists in Kenya are under threat; if the Release of Political Prisoners Organisation in Nairobi continues to be harassed by the authorities following the death in suspicious circumstances of its secretary general some years ago; and the approaches, if any, made to the Government of Kenya bilaterally or through the EU in relation to its human rights record.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government attaches particular importance to the right of individuals or groups engaged in the defence of human rights to conduct their work without fear of harassment or persecution. Many human rights organisations are active in Kenya and are able to function normally and, in 1999, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch were permitted to visit Kenya unimpeded. However, there are disturbing reports of periodic harassment of some organisations by official bodies.</P>
      <P>The Release of Political Prisoners Organisation is a human rights NGO based in Nairobi which conducts research and public campaigns on torture, ill-treatment, prison conditions, land rights, death penalty and political prisoners. According to Amnesty International, police surveillance on the office of the RPP has increased since last October. I am also aware of reports of the disruption of RPP workshops by the police.</P>
      <P>The Government and our EU partners remain concerned about the human rights situation in Kenya. My predecessor paid an official visit to Kenya last November and during a meeting with President Moi discussed human rights problems in Kenya. In co-operation with our EU partners we will continue to monitor closely the human rights situation in Kenya and, in particular, the position of human rights activists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from An Post that there is no backlog of mail in the postal system at this time. An Post has indicated that, in the first two weeks of January 2000, the standard of mail deliveries in the Dublin postal districts was adversely affected by an unusually high level of sick absence among delivery staff, and by unofficial industrial action by delivery staff represented by the Communications Workers Union at certain Dublin delivery offices between 4 and 11 January. The company has stated that all Dublin deliveries were back to normal on 13 January last.</P>
      <P>With regard to cross-channel mail, I understand from An Post that some despatches of second class mail from the UK in the first three weeks of January were found to include approximately 50,000 items in respect of which insufficient postage had been paid. These were mainly Christmas cards posted at the UK domestic first and second class rates as opposed to the appropriate UK to Ireland rate. In addition, 4,000 social security cheques posted in Newcastle-upon-Tyne as first class items were mis-sorted in the UK as second class items. All of these items had been posted in the UK in early to mid December 1999, but only arrived in Ireland during January 2000 because of a backlog in the UK. This backlog in the UK was finally cleared by the British Post Office on 21 January, and An Post has assured me that services have been fully back to normal since then.</P>

    <P>In so far as Aer Lingus is concerned, the Government has authorised the Minister for Finance and I to appoint appropriate advisers for the purposes of an initial public offering of shares in the airline. In this regard, a notice was placed in the main national newspapers and the Official Journal of the European Communities seeking tender proposals for the provision of advice and assistance concerning all aspects of the preparations, procedures and implementation in relation to arranging and executing an initial public offering of shares in Aer Lingus. The deadline for receipt of tender proposals was 12 noon on 21 January 2000. The tenders received by the deadline are being evaluated by a steering committee <Col N="275" /> comprising officials from my Department and the Department of Finance. I expect to be advised as to the outcome of this process shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 144 and 145 together.</P>
      <P>I have not yet received a report from the chairmen of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta on the work of the task force established by the chairmen to examine concerns which have been expressed to me by a number of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta pensioners about the Irish airlines (general employees) superannuation scheme. Accordingly, it would not be appropriate for me to comment in advance of the chairmen's report on this particular matter.</P>

      <Quest>if she will give an update on the proposals to amend the CIE pension scheme for regular wages staff in relation to increasing the retirement gratuity; the timetable for completion of the process; if the benefits of the increase will apply to those who retired since amendments commenced; the date in this regard; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with section 44 of the Transport Act, 1950, as amended, CIE has submitted proposals to my Department for improvements in the lump sum gratuity which is payable to members of the pension scheme for regular wages staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="276" /> The proposals, including the proposed operative date for the improved measures, are currently being considered by my Department in consultation with the Department of Finance. It is intended that any revised conditions would apply to all members of the scheme who retire after the operative date. While I am not in a position to state, at this stage, when the process will be completed, I assure the Deputy that the matter will be dealt with expeditiously.</P>

      <P>The Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan (1996-1998) &ndash; which was approved by Government in March 1996 &ndash; provides for a special study of the Reserve Defence Force, which consists of the First Line Reserve made up of former members of the Permanent Defence Force, An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil and An Slua Muirí, to be undertaken during the lifetime of the plan. Accordingly, in November 1997 I announced the setting up of a joint civilian-military steering group to carry out this examination. As part of the examination process, the chief of staff established a military board to conduct a study of the reserve. Part of the function of the steering group was to oversee and guide the military board in its task.</P>
      <P>In May 1999 the military board presented a copy of its final report to the steering group for consideration. In September 1999 when the steering group had completed its review of the reserve, including consideration of the military board report, it submitted to me a draft report which I am currently in the process of examining.</P>
      <P>Pending completion of consideration of the draft steering group report I do not intend to make any comment on the findings or recommendations contained in the report or on the procedures that will be necessary to implement such findings or recommendations. As I have indicated previously I plan to publish the steering group report in due course.</P>
      <P>As I announced recently, I have allocated an additional £1.5 million in this year's Vote for Defence towards the cost of providing extra training and courses of instruction for members of the FCA and An Slua Muirí. The increased allocation will permit an increase in the training days from the current level of 63,000 days annually to 84,000 days approximately this year. The additional training days are regarded as an important means of facilitating the future development of the reserve.</P>

    <P>Following an incident involving the Garda helicopter which occurred on 12 May 1999 over Crusheen, County Clare, an investigation was carried out by the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise. One of the recommendations of that investigation was that night operations in rural areas should be suspended with immediate effect until an effective programme of extra night flying training is completed by Garda air support unit pilots. This <Col N="278" /> recommendation was accepted and is being acted upon. There are restrictions on night flying in rural areas. It has been decided to confine night operations to the greater Dublin area, where most operations arise in any event, subject to the normal limitations which apply to all air operations.</P>

All of these aircraft undergo regular maintenance and scheduled overhauls to ensure they are fully airworthy and meet the certification standards laid down for the aviation industry. The position in regard to the investigation of the accident at Waterford last year was indicated by me in reply on 8 February 2000 to a question from Deputy Fitzgerald.</P>

      <P>The person named was paid his full entitlement of £144.00 under the 1999 cattle headage scheme on 8 December 1999.</P>
      <P>The person named did not submit an application in respect of the 1999 suckler cow premium scheme and therefore he has no entitlement to payment under this scheme for 1999. He applied on fifteen hogget ewes under the 1999 sheep headage scheme. At an inspection carried out on his flock on 2 March 1999, seven of these animals were found to be over-age for the scheme. Consequently, as the number of animals rejected exceeded 20% of the animals claimed, he was advised by my Department by letter of 3 June 1999 that in accordance with clause 10(i) of the terms and conditions governing the scheme he was not eligible for payment under this scheme in 1999. He was given the opportunity to have this decision reviewed by writing to my Department within 21 days setting out any facts which he wished to put forward to support his case. He contacted my Department by telephone on 2 December 1999 regarding his 1999 sheep headage application and he was again advised about the review procedure. He wrote to the Department on 3 December 1999 but did not request a review. The person named confirmed by telephone on 10 December 1999 that he intended to seek a review but to date no further information has been received by my Department from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1999 ewe premium scheme the person named was paid the first and second advances of £707.92 on 9 December 1999. Under the 1999 special beef premium scheme the person named was paid advance payments of £308.19 on 16 Nov<Col N="280" /> ember 1999 and of £154.10 on 3 February 2000. Any remaining balancing payments due under this scheme cannot be made until all 1999 applications have been examined and processed and the position regarding usage of Ireland's national beef premium quota has been determined.</P>

      <P>Following the BSE crisis, my Department has been involved in direct negotiations with the authorities in those traditionally important markets which had concerns about imports of beef from Ireland. These negotiations, with the assistance of both the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bord Bia, have secured unhindered access for Irish beef to worldwide markets. I am satisfied that the necessary conditions have been secured to enable Irish beef exporters to exploit all available market opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there was no ban placed on Irish beef by any EU member state, there was a loss of market share due to an increased consumer preference on some of those markets for their own, domestically produced, beef. The move towards <Col N="281" /> renationalisation within EU markets was one of the issues addressed by the beef task force. Considerable progress to date has been made in regaining these markets. Last year beef exports to EU markets grew by 15%, while exports of young cattle more than doubled to over 320,000 head. It remains one of the major priorities for the Irish beef industry to further recover and consolidate its presence on EU markets. In that context I have visited Italy, France and the Netherlands in the past couple of weeks specifically to promote the consumption of Irish beef in those markets.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that application forms for the heifer slaughter premium scheme were not available from the commencement of the scheme in autumn 1999; if farmers who sold heifers to private butchers at the end of 1999 will receive this premium; the procedure, if any, they should follow to obtain this premium; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme referred to is the new slaughter premium 2000 scheme. Under this scheme a slaughter premium is payable, not only on heifers but also on bulls, steers and cows slaughtered in local abattoirs or licensed meat export premises within the EU or exported live to non-EU countries in the period 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2000. The scheme commenced on 1 January 2000, not the autumn of 1999.</P>
      <P>The procedure is that application forms are not required for animals slaughtered within the country or exported live to non-EU countries as this information will be captured by the cattle movement monitoring system &ndash; CMMS. This information will assist my Department in determining the eligibility of these animals for premium. Payment will issue automatically where these animals are deemed to have met all the requirements of the slaughter premium scheme.</P>
      <P>Application forms will only be required for animals exported for slaughter in another EU member state. These forms will be available shortly and a helpsheet detailing the operation and terms and conditions of the slaughter premium 2000 scheme will issue to all registered herdowners. Payments under this scheme cannot commence until 16 October 2000 at the earliest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where animals have been sold to private butchers at the end of 1999, they will qualify for the premium if slaughtered on or after 1 January 2000. This premium will be payable to the producer who has held the animal for a minimum of two months ending less than one month before <Col N="282" /> the date of slaughter-export. The procedure for obtaining the premium is as outlined above. Animals slaughtered on or before 31 December 1999 will not qualify.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 161 to 163, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The multi-functional role of agriculture is the basis of the Agenda 2000 agreement which was finalised by the EU Heads of Government in Berlin in March 1999. At that meeting, the heads of Government also decided that the Agenda 2000 agreement would constitute an essential element of the EU's negotiating position for the WTO negotiations and the negotiating mandate given to the European Commission by the Council of Ministers reflects that decision. The EU is therefore committed to safeguarding the multi-functional nature of European agriculture. Moreover, in fulfilling its mandate, the Commission has been developing support for the concept among other members of the WTO and in particular among majority world countries, to many of whom the concept is important.</P>
      <P>While I would be open to consultative mechanisms with farming organisations and other appropriate bodies in the majority world, the most appropriate means of consultation on majority world issues is at intergovernmental level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="284" /> As far as technical assistance for the majority world is concerned, the WTO will be examining ways of enhancing its technical assistance capacity. Ireland has been involved on a practical level on this issue through its financial contribution for the establishment of the advisory centre on WTO law. Ireland has provided an initial contribution of $1 million, with $250,000 a year for a minimum of five years. This advisory centre will provide much needed advice and expertise to developing countries, in particular, on their rights and obligations under WTO Law. Technical assistance for the majority world is also provided by other international organisations such as the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, FAO. In 1996 the World Food Summit, WFS, underlined in its conclusions the importance of trade issues to food security. The Government fully shares that perspective and participates actively in the follow-up process to the WFS, which provides a mechanism for international consultation on food security.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 165 and 167 together.</P>
      <P>I am currently considering proposals, which I expect to bring to Government shortly, in relation to a new and extensive programme of decentralisation which I announced in my Budget Statement in December last. Until then no decisions will be taken in relation to which Government Departments-offices will be included in the new programme nor in relation to the centres to which they will be relocated. I cannot, therefore, comment on the likelihood of any particular Department-office being relocated to any specific centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until the matter has been considered by the Government I cannot give the Deputies details of an implementation timetable, other than to say that I would expect that decisions about those Departments-offices which will be decentralised and the centres to which they will be relocated should be taken by mid-year. Thereafter it will be <Col N="285" /> in the region of two years before the first of the staff involved will be relocated.</P>
    <P>In relation to determining the centres to which Departments-offices will be relocated the Government will take a number of considerations into account. These will include the infrastructural capacity of prospective locations; communications and transport links; the benefit to the local economy to be achieved by an injection of a number of public sector jobs the desire to establish a more even spread of public sector jobs around the country and the extent to which the centre would be likely to attract sufficient number of staff, most of whom would have to relocate domestically, including the availability of housing and the proximity to third-level education. I can assure Deputies that no particular locations will be ruled out in the consideration of decentralisation centres.</P>

      <P>Precise evidence relating to the country of origin of such lambs is not available but the bulk of the lambs in question are understood to have been imported from Northern Ireland. Investigations in respect of a number of slaughter houses have been completed and underpayments of VAT of the order of £340,000 have been agreed with the traders concerned. Investigations are ongoing in other plants.</P>

      <P>It is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation. In line with this principle, the majority of social welfare payments, including invalidity pension are reckonable as income for tax purposes. Invalidity pension has been taxable since its introduction in 1970.</P>
      <P>The extent to which taxation actually arises in a given case depends, of course, on the amount of other income that the social welfare recipient, or the recipients spouse has in the particular tax year. If there is no other income in addition to the social welfare payment, the existing exemption limits and allowances can be expected to ensure that there is no tax to be paid on the social welfare income itself.</P>

      <P>The evidence available to my Department indicates that lack of ownership of a toothbrush is not a significant problem regarding children's oral hygiene practices. The real problem is that children do not brush their teeth often enough. In a recent international survey of health and health behaviour among young people carried out by the centre for Health Promotion Studies, National University of Ireland, University College Galway it was found that less than 50% of Irish schoolchildren brush their teeth more than once a day. Children and adults need to brush their teeth at least twice a day with a pea size amount of fluoride toothpaste to ensure optimum oral health. The Irish Dental Health Foundation is piloting a number of projects to establish best practice for promoting oral health in schools throughout the country. The results of these studies will assist in developing an oral health promotion strategy for schools that will deal with the issue of the need for free toothbrushes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The general medical service scheme provides a wide ranging treatment and curative service for medical card holders. The position is that while screening services are not, at present, provided generally under the scheme, such services, for example, cervical smear testing, are available under the GMS to medical card holders where they are required in the context of an individual patient's medical examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should add that phase 1 of the national cervical screening programme will commence in early summer of this year. This will involve approximately 67,000 women aged 25-60 in the Mid <Col N="289" /> Western Health Board area. Cervical screening will be provided free to women involved in phase 1 of the programme initially and to all women, in that age category, on the extension of the programme to the rest of the country. Such a measure means that women, regardless of means, will benefit from this service.</P>
    <P>The issue of whether a wide range of preventative measures should be available universally to medical card holders under the GMS scheme would have major implications for the operation of the scheme, its resourcing and its cost. For those reasons, the structured introduction of preventative services, in the manner of the national cervical screening programme, is a better way to proceed in meeting the needs of all persons in our society, and is the best way to encourage persons on low incomes to avail of these services.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My predecessor, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, announced on budget day last that additional funding would be made available from 1 January 2000 to support the application of the domicilary care allowance scheme introduced by way of Circular No. 24/73, dated 23 September 1973, to eligible children under two years of age. This modification was <Col N="290" /> notified to the health boards on 8 December 1999 and again on 10 January 2000. I am informed that all health boards have indicated that the domicilary care allowance scheme, including the 1999 modification, is being implemented.</P>
    <P>The modification was confined to the age eligibility criterion only. Other criteria, as outlined in Circular No. 24/73, have not been altered. It should be noted that the circular also points out, <i>inter alia</i>, that</P>
    <P>The fact that a severe handicap is present does not automatically justify the payment of an allowance. It is not intended that the scheme should apply to short-term illnesses or disabilities &ndash; the handicap must be present at the time of application, have been present for at least six months prior to that date, and be likely to continue to last for at least a year. It is not visualised that any particular condition should be debarred from consideration &ndash; each case can be considered on its merits.</P>
    <P>I am assured that the health boards consider each case on its merits. If the Deputies have specific instances where this has not occurred, then I will, following receipt of such information, bring it to the attention of the relevant chief executive officer.</P>

      <P>The new drug payment scheme, with a threshold of £42 per month per individual or family, was introduced on 1 July 1999 and replaced the drug cost subsidisation scheme &ndash; DCSS &ndash; and drug refund scheme &ndash; DRS. The primary aim of the new drug payment scheme is to bring about important improvements over the previous schemes and the scheme is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines. With regard to the increase, I point out that there has been no increase in the thresholds for the DCSS or DRS since 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A common list of reimbursable items was introduced for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme to ensure equity in relation to the products reimbursed by the State under both schemes. The list of reimbursable <Col N="292" /> food items to which persons registered under the drug payment scheme are entitled is therefore in line with those items available to medical card holders and includes breads, bread mixes, flours and pizza bases. It is considered that the range of such items available under State reimbursement schemes provides a reasonable choice and persons requiring items which are not reimbursable would be expected to meet the full cost of such items. There are no plans to include other coeliac foods in the common list.</P>
    <P>People who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the local health board has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 188 and 189 together.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for each local authority to determine its own expenditure requirements in the context of its annual estimates. Expenditure arising on the issues referred to by the Deputy would be dealt with by local authorities in this estimates context. Such expenditure is funded from a variety of sources including the local government fund and other State grants, rates and fees and charges.</P>
      <P>Grants totalling £339.3 million have been allocated to local authorities from the local government fund in respect of the year 2000 as a contribution towards their general purposes needs, including county-city development board &ndash; CDB &ndash; related expenditure.</P>
      <P>Work is progressing on the development of a needs and resources distribution model by a project team from Galway County Council in conjunction with my Department. The model will be used as a basis for allocating funds from the local government fund in future years. It will take into account the needs and resources of all local authorities, including expenditure needs in relation to CDBs.</P>
      <P>In the main representation on the CDBs from State and other sectors will be at senior official level. These officers will be expected to bring their expertise in relation to their agencies to the table. Local authority representation will be predominately at elected member level. I have put in place a comprehensive programme of training for councillors which encompasses, among others, the chairs of SPCs who will be CDB members. This training will greatly facilitate their participation on the CDBs.</P>

      <P>I assume that the question refers to the provision of smoke detectors, the importance of which in giving early warning of fire is widely <Col N="296" /> recognised. While the primary responsibility for ensuring safety from fire rests with individual tenants, my Department has suggested to housing authorities that they should, as part of their maintenance and management responsibilities, consider providing smoke alarms and taking the necessary steps through guidance etc. to ensure that these alarms are properly installed and maintained in the dwellings of their tenants generally. The management, maintenance and improvement of their rented dwellings, including the provision of such systems, are the responsibility of local authorities to be funded from their own resources. However, where capital funding is made available under the remedial works scheme to assist authorities in carrying out major essential works to designated housing estates, the carrying out of fire prevention works may form part of the works undertaken.</P>
      <P>All new local authority houses are provided with appropriate smoke detectors in accordance with the building regulations and the cost is met from the funding provided for these houses under the local authority housing programme.</P>

Where a claimant is in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment, child dependant allowances are payable where children are in full-time education up to the age of 22 years, or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday.

      <P>Since 1996 my Department has operated a scheme of community support for older people the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grants to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those older people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a condition of this scheme that detailed accounts of grant aid expenditure be submitted to the Department within three months of its receipt. In 1998 the group indicated in the Depu<Col N="300" /> ty's question submitted an application for grant aid of £444,499 on behalf of 1,556 clients. Grant aid of £264,476 was approved to this organisation a figure which represented 59.5% of the total amount applied for.</P>
    <P>As a result of numerous inquiries made by individual older people during the course of 1999 to the Dublin North Regional Office of my Department it became apparent that socially monitored alarm systems and other security devices for which this group had received funding in 1998 were still being installed in the homes of its intended beneficiaries. Accounts in respect of 1998 grants were finally furnished to my Department on 2 December 1999. An examination of the accounts raised a number of issues. The group submitted some additional information in relation to these and examination of the accounts is ongoing.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that this scheme continues to address the security needs of the most vulnerable older people in our society. However, in administering this and other grant schemes which are funded from public money, my Department must ensure that all criteria are adhered to, including the provision by funded groups of satisfactory accounts in respect of previous grants. As soon as the examination of the 1998 accounts has been satisfactorily completed, then the grant application submitted by this group in 1999 will be processed.</P>

      <P>Pre-retirement allowance is a means-tested payment which allows a person aged 55 or over to retire from the labour force and receive a weekly allowance. To qualify, a claimant must be in receipt of a long-term unemployment payment, or be no longer entitled to one-parent family payment or carer's allowance or be separated from his-her spouse and have not engaged in employment or self-employment for the preceding 15 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The community employment (CE) scheme, which is operated by FÁS under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, aims to re-integrate the long-term unemployed into the active labour force. Accordingly, <Col N="301" /> persons in receipt of PRETA are not among the categories eligible to participate in the scheme.</P>
    <P>In general, the CE allowance is paid <i>in lieu</i> of a social welfare payment. In the case of claimants of the one-parent family payment, however, income arising from participation on CE is treated in the same way as any other income from employment in the means-test which applies to that scheme.</P>
    <P>Eligibility to participate in CE schemes has recently been extended to claimants of widow/er's contributory and non-contributory pensions. In the case of claimants of the widow/er's contributory pension, the CE allowance may be paid in addition to their existing welfare entitlements.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 200 and 201 together.</P>
      <P>Submissions on hydrogeology were given in evidence to the High Court in 1999 during a judicial review action concerning the proposed road-widening scheme through the Glen of the Downs. My Department's officials met with Wicklow County Council officials and with engineering and hydrological consultants to address the concerns which were raised in court and modifications were made to the drainage system for the road. Among other measures a permeable layer will be included in the road construction to ensure that groundwater flow is not impeded. They were satisfied, as was the High Court, that the road design scheme will take proper account of all concerns raised and at this time have no plans to seek further advice on the matter. The High Court was satisfied that the issues relating to hydrology were properly addressed in the environmental impact assessment and that a valid environmental impact assessment has been carried out for the proposed road scheme. This position was further vindicated by the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>No additional studies or investigations in relation to this topic were carried out by my Department since that date but they will continue to monitor the scheme during the construction phase and will liaise with Wicklow County Council to ensure construction impacts on the Glen are minimised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Director General of the Prisons Service that the person referred to by the Deputy was committed to Mountjoy Prison on 22 October 1999 to serve sentences for various offences of ten months, six months and three months, the sentences to run concurrently. Allowing for standard remission &ndash; one quarter of his sentence &ndash; he was due for release on 8 March 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regrettably, due to an administrative error, the prisoner was initially informed by the prison authorities that his release date was 2 February 2000. This misunderstanding arose because the wrong release date had been entered on his computer record. As soon as the problem came to <Col N="305" /> light the prisoner was informed by prison staff that his release date was 8 March 2000. He was, as it happened, considered for temporary release on 2 February 2000 and was refused. His case was further reviewed on 3 February 2000 and he was granted full temporary release at that stage.</P>
    <P>I am informed that errors of this nature, regrettable though they are, occur very rarely. They must be put in the context of more than 11,000 committals annually. However, because of the upset and disappointment caused to the prisoner and his family in this case, I have asked that the procedures in the prison be examined to avoid a reoccurrence.</P>
    <P>Work on a new £6 million information technology programme for the Prisons Service is well advanced. As part of the programme a comprehensive prisoner records database will be deployed across the prison service later this year. I am informed that the new prisoner record database will include enhanced verification procedures which should serve to reduce the possibility of a recurrence of this type of error.</P>

    <P>On 11 May 1999, during an operation at night in the Clare-Galway region, the Garda air support unit helicopter inadvertently entered cloud. Contact was lost with the ground target, the mission was discontinued and the helicopter proceeded to Shannon Airport. The incident was the subject of an investigation carried out by the air accident <Col N="307" /> investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise.</P>
    <P>On 26 August 1999 the air accident investigator issued an interim safety recommendation that &ldquo;the Air Corps should suspend GASU night operations in rural areas with immediate effect until an effective programme of extra night flying training is completed by GASU pilots&rdquo;. This recommendation was accepted and complied with.</P>
    <P>The final report into the incident was published on 4 November 1999 and included this same safety recommendation. This report also included a number of other recommendations and these are currently being acted upon by officials from my Department and the Garda authorities, in conjunction with officials from the Department of Defence and the Air Corps. I am advised by the Garda authorities that there are no restrictions on night operations in the greater Dublin area, apart from those that apply &ndash; weather, visibility etc. &ndash; to all operations.</P>

      <P>As I have indicated to the House on a number of occasions, the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, which is in the course of being drafted for publication in this session, takes into account the report of the Oireachtas Committee on Liquor Licensing, the report of the Competition Authority and submissions received from the public and interest groups, including the night club sector.</P>
      <P>The provisions in the Bill on the extension of licensing hours and a range of other matters, including the removal of the restriction on the granting of a special exemption for any time on a Sunday and the obligation to provide a meal as part of the condition for the grant of a special exemption, will have implications for the night club sector. A standard late closing time for night clubs without the need for special exemptions is not among the matters which have been in contemplation for inclusion in the Bill. However, the details of some issues continue to be considered and developed in the context of further drafting of the Bill. The full details, subject to Government approval, will be announced by way of publication of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am also having the shortage of technicians addressed through the recruitment of 27 additional staff &ndash; 26 of whom have taken up duty. These technicians are being trained and I am advised they will become fully operational as quickly as possible.

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that provisional figures for 1999 indicate that in excess of 210,000 ecstasy tablets were seized and over 4,800 grams of ecstasy. The number of cases involving ecstasy where proceedings were commenced was 475 in 1997 and 439 in 1998.</P>

      <P>Legislative policy regarding guardianship and custody of and access to children is as contained in the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, the Status of Children Act, 1987, and the Children Act, 1997. The policy in these areas was the subject of review in the course of preparation of the Bill which led to the Act of 1997. That Bill was the subject of detailed debate in the course of its passage through the House.</P>
      <P>The Act of 1997, which came into force in January 1998, makes it possible for a father who has not married the mother of his child to acquire joint guardianship rights by agreement with the mother of his child without having to go to court. In addition, it inserted new provisions in the Act of 1964 to specify that the court has discretion whether or not to order joint custody.</P>
      <P>In the course of passage of the Bill, I strengthened it in the area of guardianship, custody and access with a provision that the court, in settling disputes in relation to children, must have regard to whether the child's best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with both his or her father and mother on a regular basis. That provision was inspired by a provision in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</P>
      <P>There are no further proposals to amend the law in this area, although its operation is being kept under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department, in conjunction with a firm of occupational psychologists, has redesigned the process for promotion from prison officer to assistant chief officer, which is the first promotion grade for prison officers, to that of a competency-based one. This redesign has been implemented in the current competition which was advertised on 21 December 1999.</P>
      <P>The new system is based on the results of a job analysis of the role of assistant chief officer which was conducted by the firm in question. The analysis identified the key skills which are necessary for effective performance in the role and the new promotion procedure has been designed to assess these skills. A similar analysis was carried out for prison officer recruitment, which is handled by the Civil Service Commission, and for promotion to assistant governor. All of these processes are now competency based and provide for feedback to all candidates.</P>
      <P>For the competition for promotion to assistant chief officer, there are two stages in the process. The first stage involves a series of tests, visual, procedural and a job scenario exercise. All of the skills required for the position of assistant chief officer are assessed through these tests. Candidates are required to reach a minimum standard for each test and I am assured that they will receive feedback regardless of their results after stage one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Should a candidate be called to stage two, he or she can expect to sit an interview which again <Col N="313" /> will focus on the skills required for the job. It will also comprise of a group exercise where a number of candidates work on a project together under the observation of trained assessors. Part of the overall process involves the completion by each candidate of a self-assessment form. In this, a candidate is required to illustrate examples of occasions where he or she demonstrated some of the skills required for the job. In addition, the relevant governor will also be asked to complete an assessment form and to give examples of times the candidate has demonstrated some of the skills required for an effective assistant chief officer. Prior to interview stage, a candidate will have an opportunity to discuss the completed form with the relevant prison governor and to sign off on this. This form will not be considered by the interview board until after the interview and the group exercise have been rated. The final outcome will be determined by an integration of three factors &ndash; interview, group exercise and the Governor's assessment.</P>
    <P>My Department is committed to the principles of best recruitment and selection procedures. It is proposed, therefore, to extend the competency based system, incorporating feedback to candidates, to the other grades in the prison service in due course. My Department endeavours to be as transparent as possible in the area of promotions and to provide as much feedback as possible. If any officer wishes to raise any matter relating to promotions, he or she can do so through his or her governor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the period referred to by the Deputy, this Government has taken a series of important measures to assist children with disabilities in the education system.</P>
      <P>In September 1997, the pupil-teacher ratio for a wide range of special needs pupils was reduced by one unit. These improvements have continued and since September last the pupil teacher ratio for all special needs categories has been reduced to the level recommended in the report of the special education review committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In November 1998, a major initiative for integrated education for children with special needs was launched. This initiative provided the first ever automatic supports for many children with <Col N="316" /> disabilities. The measures involved are aimed at ensuring that all children with a special educational need, irrespective of their location or disability, will receive the support they require to participate fully in the education system.</P>
    <P>The measures extend right across the entire spectrum of special needs and deliver extra teaching and child care services to special needs children, whether in groups or in individual isolated settings.</P>
    <P>The key measures in the initiative included the introduction of a formalised system of special teaching support for all children attending school on a fully integrated basis who have been assessed as having special educational needs; and the introduction of a formalised system of child care support for all children with special needs, including those in special schools, special classes and ordinary schools, who have been assessed as requiring such support.</P>
    <P>The level of response in each case has regard to the number of children and the severity of the disabilities involved. Where a group of special needs children attend an ordinary school or adjacent schools, the support may take the form of full-time resource or child care posts or both. Where individual or small groups of children are involved, the support may take the form of part-time teaching hours or part-time child care support or both. The level of support has regard to the number of children and their particular assessed needs.</P>
    <P>Already, as a result of this development, my Department has allocated an additional 225 resource teachers and 642 special needs assistants to support children with special needs in the primary system.</P>
    <P>Other measures by my Department and which will have a significant effect on provision for children with special needs include the enactment of the Education Act, 1998, the provision of a remedial teaching service to all first and second level schools, the establishment of the national educational psychological service, and publication of the White Paper on Early Childhood Education.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy of my commitment to ensuring each child with special needs will receive the support he or she requires to fully participate in the educational system and reach his or her potential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 228 and 229 together.</P>
      <P>The recent £4.5 million initiative to extend the teaching in second level schools of Spanish, Italian and Japanese will use a number of approaches. One of these will be to encourage schools which do not teach any of these languages at present to do so. Another will be to identify teachers in the category mentioned by the Deputy and to put in place the in-service provision needed to make them competent and confident in the use of the language they will teach.</P>
      <P>In the case of Spanish, much of this work of identifying dormant capacity for the teaching of the language has already been done as part of a feasibility study carried out in the summer of 1999. The results of this study give me confidence that there are a number of teachers, and of graduates in Spanish who are not currently teaching, who will be eligible for inclusion in this initiative.</P>
      <P>My Department will place advertisements in the national press in the very near future seeking applicants for the post of national co-ordinator of this initiative, and inviting applications from teachers who once studied Spanish, Italian or Japanese but would now require inservice support to be able to teach one of them.</P>
      <P>Spanish is currently being taught in 53 primary schools. One of the criteria used in choosing these schools was that continuity of study of Spanish could be assured at post-primary level. One of the tasks of the national co-ordinator of the post-primary initiative will be to make contact with the project leader for Spanish at primary level to ensure that this continuity is facilitated.</P>
      <P>An advertisement will shortly appear in the national press inviting applications from primary schools where there is a teacher who would teach Spanish or Italian in this context, given the necessary training. My Department will provide this training for suitable teachers in primary schools who reply to this advertisement. This advertisement, and that for the co-ordinator of the post-primary initiative, will make explicit reference to the need to create links between what is happening in the area of the lesser taught languages across the two sectors.</P>

      <P>My Department allocates a second deputy principal, on an ex-quota basis, to second level schools in the free education scheme with enrolments of 1,000 or more pupils or to designated disadvantaged schools with enrolments of 900 or more pupils.</P>
      <P>As the school in question does not satisfy these requirements, it does not qualify for the allocation of a second deputy principal post in the current school year. The position will be reviewed for the 2000-01 school year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. This scheme is, however, being phased out as posts become vacant.</P>
      <P>Arising from the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, a second scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional capitation grants for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. Under the PESP scheme, schools receive grants of £30 per pupil, based on their enrolments, which are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grant.</P>
      <P>With effect from January of this year, all primary schools with 100 or more pupils have become eligible for a grant towards secretarial and caretaking services under this scheme. Costing £2.7 million, this improvement of the scheme will benefit approximately 650 schools serving 90,000 pupils. My Department is currently making arrangements for the issuing of these grants to schools.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I have secured an additional £9 million in the recent budget, over the next two years, which will enable me to extend and improve the supports available to all primary schools. Details of the implementation of this will be worked out in the near future following consultations and will, when taken together with the earlier move, make a major contribution to assisting schools.</P>
      <P>The position of schools such as St. Fergal's will be borne in mind in working out details for the implementation of the additional £9 million referred to above. However the first priority will be to provide for secretarial and caretaking assistance for those schools that are currently not assisted.</P>

      <P>The person to whom the Deputy refers <Col N="324" /> is seeking to purchase service which was given in this State as an unqualified teacher and service which was given in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>None of this service comes within the terms of the purchase scheme which has recently been introduced. This scheme enables a teacher to purchase, for pensions purposes, service which was given in this State as a fully qualified teacher.</P>
      <P>Service given in other areas of the public sector may, in accordance with the public sector transfer scheme, be reckoned as pensionable under the teachers' superannuation schemes. The transfer scheme enables service given in any participating organisation, and which was pensionable in its own right when given, to be transferred to the teachers' superannuation schemes.</P>
      <P>While there are no arrangements at present for the transfer for pensions purposes of service given in Northern Ireland, this question is currently being considered in the context of North-South co-operation.</P>
