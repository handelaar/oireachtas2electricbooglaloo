      <P>On the last occasion I stated that it is sad that the scheme outlined in the Bill will have a fragmented impact on townscapes. The terms and criteria which apply to the scheme appear to have been borrowed from the urban renewal scheme. As a result, many small towns will not now be upgraded or refurbished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will there be unlimited access to incentives relating to refurbishment projects? I am aware that restrictions will be imposed on new buildings, which must be designed in proportion to the size of the town in which they are being erected. If unlimited access to assistance for the refurbishment of townscapes is permitted under the <Col N="2" /> scheme, it will have a larger impact on and will be of greater benefit to towns in general.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, assessments will be carried out by local authorities. This will place an additional burden on staff who are already obliged to deal with the massive workload associated with planning matters, etc. These people will not be able to dedicate adequate time to fully appraising towns and identifying the areas of greatest need. For example, most local authorities have already requested that the Minister allow them to appoint additional professional staff to deal with the huge number of applications for planning permission they have received. It is a mistake to impose on local authorities the responsibility for administering this without providing them with additional resources and professional personnel.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that a total of 102 towns throughout the country will be designated under the scheme. However, there is a perception abroad in many areas that it was because of the intervention of the local Minister or Government representative that certain towns were included while others were not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace) Mr. D. Wallace)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that. However, some people are of the opinion that the inclusion of certain towns came as a direct result of the intervention of Government Deputies or Ministers. We accept that this is not the case because the towns included in the scheme had to be assessed before being granted a designation.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State indicate if local authorities will be given additional resources and personnel to allow them to implement the scheme on a wide scale? I hope that all towns of a particular size and with a certain level of population will be included in the scheme in the future.</P>
      <P>There is a downside to the scheme in that certain developers have moved into towns and identified and acquired sites which may be derelict or semi-derelict. These individuals do not have any intention of proceeding to develop these sites until the incentives on offer under the scheme become available. That is a pity because it will reduce the possibility that local heritage and historical groups which, against all the odds, have sown the seeds of redevelopment in their towns will be able to proceed with their work. These groups have identified buildings which have been upgraded through community fundraising and national lottery funding provided by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation. It is important we regularise the situation at a national level, rather than proceeding on a piecemeal basis. In that way, derelict buildings which are in need of a necessary facelift could receive that quickly, thereby avoiding developers sitting on them because of their development potential. Developers are entitled to receive assistance in the same way as anyone else but if they acquire properties solely for the purpose of sitting on them to increase their value, that is a retrograde step.</P>
      <P>Some of the consultants who have presented reports on designation within certain towns have missed out to a large extent on many of the towns' special features which local area engineers or local authority officers could readily identify because of their familiarity with a town's buildings, streetscapes and needs. Local personnel should be appointed instead of consultants who merely breeze in to a town for a quick look around and produce a report for the relevant local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has provided for wide-scale consultation under the Bill. Consultation has been identified as a very important element in the eventual identification of the areas to be designated. It is important that consultation should occur, particularly with the local groups to which I referred previously. It might prove more beneficial and less costly if the plans prepared by many competent local groups, often with the assistance of professional people be they members of the community group or <Col N="4" /> hired advisers, could be submitted in a formal manner to the Department for assessment. These groups have identified many worthy projects within their areas.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that many public buildings have been excluded from designation. Many smaller towns in rural Ireland have fine public buildings such as courthouses. These buildings have deteriorated over the past 25 years and many are now in a shambles. Some District Court judges have refused to sit in the courthouses because of their condition. The basic structure and fabric of the buildings are intact and they merely require refurbishment. In the past, the responsibility for such refurbishment lay in the hands of the local authorities but they did not have the resources. The responsibility to refurbish these buildings has now passed to the Department of the Environment and Local Government which will act in conjunction with the local authorities. Greater flexibility should have been provided to make courthouses and similar buildings eligible for grant assistance. Some such buildings are no longer in use or perhaps, more appropriately, should no longer be in use.</P>
    <P>There are abandoned cinemas in most small rural towns in Ireland. These buildings are boarded up and are usually a target for vandalism. It should be possible to refurbish such buildings quickly. Old churches are a further example of buildings which offer a magnificent opportunity for development and should be refurbished. However, these buildings seem to be excluded from the terms of the Bill in many instances.</P>
    <P>One of the objectives of town renewal is the restriction of movement from the inner parts of a town to the surrounding countryside. While that is a very laudable ambition, we must be conscious of the need for rural renewal. If rural renewal is to mean anything, we must bring people back into rural areas. The flight from the land is rampant. It is regrettable that local authorities are restricting people from building houses in the countryside. Initially, restrictions applied to building along national primary routes and we accepted that as being necessary. The restrictions were subsequently applied to national secondary routes. Where sons or daughters of a landowner were previously allowed to build along such routes, most local authorities are now imposing restrictions on them too and are asking them to build at the far end of their parents' farms. That is unfair. If we are serious about rural renewal, we must encourage people to live in the countryside.</P>
    <P>We are talking here about renewing town centres, bringing them alive and stopping people leaving towns to live in the countryside. That is all very well but how are we to implement a realistic rural renewal scheme in parallel with that if some of the current restrictions are not relaxed? Certain local authorities, such as Clare County Council, are imposing building restrictions on outsiders or non-nationals who come <Col N="5" /> into the area. We are very close to that point in County Galway. Aside altogether from the restrictions imposed along primary and secondary routes, the prevalence of SACs, NHAs and high amenity areas means that certain areas are being totally blacked out for housing development. We have passed the desirable limit in regard to restrictions.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will indicate at the earliest opportunity his intention to include all towns for designation, rather than proceeding with the current selective nature of the designation. Some small towns feel they are being left behind once again and that will create a bad atmosphere. This Bill is a very welcome development which will enhance the townscapes of many small towns but all towns should be included.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this legislation which offers tax incentives to smaller towns with a population between 500 and 6,000 people. Such towns are dotted throughout the country, particularly in County Cork. Many of them were vibrant market towns some 20 years ago and were the economic centre for the surrounding agricultural hinterland. These towns have suffered greatly from industry, service and shop closures. This town renewal scheme is twofold. It will encourage residential as well as commercial and industrial development in town centres. This is to be welcomed. Similar tax incentive schemes have encouraged investment in urban and rural communities throughout the country. Investors from the farming community in the west and south have invested heavily in tax incentive schemes in the greater Dublin area. This has drawn finance from rural areas into urban areas where it gained a greater return. I welcome this initiative to help small towns in rural Ireland. The scheme is designed to encourage investment in derelict and decaying infill sites. It could be argued that the scheme is too confined but, despite its faults, it is welcome and will encourage investment in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>County Cork is divided into the three administrative areas of north Cork, south Cork and west Cork. When the scheme was announced by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government last July I suggested that Cork be divided into the same three areas for the purpose of the scheme. Of the 24 towns in County Cork which are eligible for inclusion, seven have now been designated under the original criteria. Had the county been divided in three it would have been possible to designate 12 towns. A precedent for this exists in the housing and sanitary budget which is drawn down from the Department of the Environment and Local Government and is divided among the three areas. It is too late to <Col N="6" /> include this proposal in the Bill but it might be considered in the future.</P>
    <P>County councils appointed consultants who visited the towns to be included in the scheme. They corresponded with local people and various interest groups and drew up plans. This was a worthwhile exercise because it encouraged people to think about what could be done with their towns or villages and brought a variety of ideas to the surface. It is now 12 months since the scheme was announced; these developments take time. I hope the Bill will be enacted before the summer recess and that the scheme is operational soon afterwards.</P>
    <P>Although the national economy is buoyant there are rural economic blackspots of which Duhallow, the area I represent, is one. It includes the market towns of Millstreet, Kanturk and Newmarket and Kanturk, the capital of the region, has been included in the scheme. The 1997 tax designation scheme for the upper Shannon region has been worthwhile and beneficial. We will fight for a similar tax designation for our part of the country and I ask the Government to bear Duhallow in mind when the relevant decisions are made.</P>
    <P>The future of life on the land is not promising and the draw to urban areas is strong. The way to fight back is to loosen planning regulations in rural areas and provide meaningful employment by attracting industries to the rural periphery. I realise this is not easy and that the IDA's priority is to attract industry to Ireland, wherever it is located. This is as it should be. However, we must examine ways of attracting employment to rural areas. In rural areas which have succeeded in attracting industries new houses are being built. Rural areas do not have the problem of housing density. We have plenty of room for new houses. Planning regulations are important but some leniency would be helpful. Problems sometimes arise when people submit plans for enormous houses to be built in the countryside. The planning process would be easier if people planned houses of a reasonable size.</P>
    <P>I would have preferred County Cork to be divided into three administrative areas to ensure 12 towns could be included in the scheme. Discussions on this matter are ongoing between Cork County Council and the Department of the Environment and Local Government but I do not expect my proposal to be accepted. I welcome Government action to deal with the decay of small market towns which were once supported by a vibrant agricultural economy. The Bill will ensure money which exists in rural communities will be invested locally. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Moynihan for affording me the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I compliment the Minister, his Department and the advisory panel who did a great deal of work on this subject in the past few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not think further legislation would have <Col N="7" /> been necessary. The 1998 Bill was recently enacted. However, this Bill is worthwhile and will revitalise towns and villages. This is necessary because small towns and villages, especially in the west, are in terminal decline. Many small towns and villages in the most scenic parts of Ireland do not have a basic sewerage system. It is an indictment of several Departments that places such as Carrigaholt, Cooraclare, Labasheeda, Mullagh, Broadford and O'Brien's Bridge, which are located in the most scenic parts of Ireland and attract many tourists, do not have a sewerage system.</P>
    <P>Raw sewage is entering some of our most important waterways such as the Shannon Estuary and some of the smaller river catchments. This needs urgent attention, which I would like to see coupled with renewal. There should be some new vigour in the Department of the Environment and Local Government and in the local authorities with regard to expediting some of these small schemes. For many years, we did not have the finances for this, but the money is available now and people are willing to become involved in these schemes. The rural population has been mentioned by previous speakers. It is desirable that we revitalise the towns and villages. We cannot do that without putting in some of the basic infrastructure so necessary to enable that to be done.</P>
    <P>This legislation is a renewal Bill. The examples of renewal in Temple Bar, Ennis, and Limerick will give a major incentive to these areas to develop and expand. Apart from the villages I have mentioned, there are important villages in every county, with historic links to people. An example is Liscannor and its connection with John Philip Holland who invented the submarine. Huge arrangements are being made in the United States currently to commemorate John Philip Holland. We do not have any similar type of effort being made in counties such as my own, especially in towns like Liscannor. This legislation will encourage this type of activity, because its mandate is to develop our heritage and cultural sites. Further down the west coast, Doonaha has connections with Eugene O'Curry and the important cultural work done by him. There is a very small memorial in Doonaha, at the birthplace of Eugene O'Curry, but other than that, there has been very little, if anything, done by way of commemoration of some of these important people who made a major contribution to our culture, heritage and inventions over the centuries.</P>
    <P>This legislation can afford the opportunity to undertake some of these projects. I would like to see a scheme of grant assistance coupled to this legislation. This is being planned under a different Department but one of the difficulties in this area over the years is to marry together the operations of one Department with another. The Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the <Col N="8" /> Islands runs one set of schemes, the Department of the Environment and Local Government does something else and the Department of Finance is very careful in saying, as it has with regard to this scheme, that it does not expect to spend excessive money on it. That is the wrong attitude to take at the outset. If there was one handicap with the urban renewal scheme at Shannon in 1998, it was that the areas were so restricted in Shannon that the opportunity to do any worthwhile development was hampered from the very outset. While we have work going ahead now in the area designated in Shannon, the area was so small that it made little or no significant impact on the overall development of the town in its amenities, facilities and the opportunities it gave to the community in Shannon to expand and develop further.</P>
    <P>If the Department of Finance initially adopts the attitude that this will not cost very much, as indicated in the last section of the Bill, then it is adopting a penny-pinching and wrong approach to this whole area. Many developments would not have occurred were it not for the incentives provided to them. I see glaring omissions here on which I need to get some replies from the Minister before we conclude the debate on this legislation.</P>
    <P>For instance, the 1998 Urban Renewal Act in section 10 outlined a very clear mandate relating to rates remissions connected with the designated areas. There is not a similar provision in this Bill. Perhaps it is not necessary. Perhaps section 10 of the 1998 Act can be used to cover these areas or is rates remission deliberately left out in these developments? If it is, then some of these towns and villages are already at a disadvantage as against the areas which have that provision under the earlier legislation. If the Minister can assure me that the rates remission applies in this area, I will be satisfied, but it looks very sinister if a provision similar to what was provided for in the earlier legislation is not included in this Bill. There are sections in this legislation relating to taxation similar to those included in the earlier legislation, but I will not go into these now. They are all spelt out in the legislation here. It is necessary to get some clarification from the Minister on the provision relating to rates remissions and whether that will apply.</P>
    <P>There is also an omission in this legislation in that it does not provide for any kind of appeal mechanism whereby people aggrieved by the decisions can apply either to the local authority or to the Minister with regard to the designation of certain areas. There are great expectations relating to this scheme. There is an expectation that this will revitalise the towns currently in terminal decline and put them back on a firm economic and social footing again. If, at the start &ndash; as is indicated by this Bill when we say it will not cost the Exchequer very much &ndash; we restrict the areas for inclusion in the town plans which are currently being examined by the advisory panel, we will defeat this scheme before it ever starts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="9" /> I intervene here today to appeal to the expert advisory panel, to carefully examine the plans submitted by the various local authorities and to think very carefully before they decide to exclude part of the areas which have been included in the overall scheme of things. The people who know best about these issues are the members and executives of the local authority who have a first hand knowledge of these towns and villages.</P>
    <P>Before the expert panel of the Department decides to exclude from the scheme, any area submitted as part of a plan, there should be very careful consideration and some mechanism of appeal.</P>
    <P>I make one final appeal to the Department relating to many disused farm buildings that now are a blight on the landscape, especially in the scenic areas. There is scarcely a village in the areas of the country that I know, where one would not see disused haysheds, the roof half hanging off, alongside new modern facilities. There is not any real incentive for people to remove these derelict buildings. There is power under the Derelict Sites Act to do these things, but local authorities will not use it. Local authorities have enough problems without getting involved in disputes with local landowners and farmers in particular, and some of these buildings may have sentimental value and so on. However, in every town or village in Ireland one will see four or five structures, the removal of which could make a major improvement in the environment of the village. There should be some kind of grant incentive to enable that to be done. These places could be identified through the local authorities and it would be easy to deal with them. It would not cost a huge amount of money but some incentive should be given to take down disused, rusting haysheds or haybarns which will not be used again but are nevertheless left there to fall into decay and destroy the appearance of a place.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Department to look again at towns such Lisdoonvarna, Tulla and Killadysert and some of the smaller ones which have been left out of this scheme and not to wait for a three year period before they are included in a scheme. These schemes should be run together to include as many of these villages as we can into this scheme. We need an effective scheme that will make a major impact on the development of the towns in rural areas.</P>

        <b>: </b>Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille mar tá sé thar am dúinn tacaíocht a thabhairt do na bailte beaga ar fud na tíre. Tá sé deacair go leor dóibh bheith i gcoimhlint leis na bailte móra agus ní chóir go mbeadh an <Col N="10" /> donas ar fad ag titim orthu toisc go bhfuil lucht na ngnó móra sna bailte móra.</P>
      <P>It is important for that reason that something is done to help small towns compete with larger ones. I am glad to have the opportunity to discuss this because rural Ireland must survive and this debate provided me with another opportunity to read Goldsmith's <i>Deserted Village</i>. All of us know about the village schoolmaster and parson. Some 250 years ago Goldsmith was worried about the decline of rural Ireland and its population. He wrote:</P>
      <P>E'en now the devastation is begun,</P>
      <P>And half the business of destruction done,</P>
      <P>E'en now, methinks, as pond'ring here I stand,</P>
      <P>I see the real virtues leave the land,</P>
      <P>There should be an Oliver Goldsmith every decade to write about rural Ireland and to remind us of its importance.</P>
      <P>Planning is a problem in rural areas. Small towns depend on people coming in from the surrounding areas to spend their money. Everything possible should be done to prevent them from driving to the nearest big towns and cities to do their shopping. If planning permission is not granted in the countryside, the population will decline and schools, football teams and so on will suffer. I know a balance must be struck but it has tilted radically in favour of lovely countryside with pasture land and trees. Tourists tell us it is beautiful driving through our countryside but that very few people live there. The balance must be right and the number of planning applications being refused is over the top. The concept of sterilisation has been introduced for the granting of planning permission. When a site is sold, the landowner is asked to sign a sterilisation order. I have fought this to the bitter end at local authority level and even though the period involved has been reduced to seven years, such orders should not be necessary.</P>
      <P>Dúchas has an important role to play but it must also get the balance right. It can request a survey from an archaeologist even for a planning permission for a house. This creates great expense and causes major delays because archaeologists are not plentiful. Archaeologists must provide surveys on urban renewal and obtain licences but there are not enough of them, even though extra appointments were made. Such hold-ups give rise to problems. Dúchas must protect our heritage and so on, but it must speed up its work. Applicants are often asked to obtain a report from an archaeologist who might take six weeks even to reply, not to mention carry out the survey. The process can take a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This scheme will enable people in small towns to renew buildings and improve their appearance and that, in turn, will increase business. People are not interested in investing in dilapidated towns. I welcome the tax concessions introduced under the scheme. I hope they are significant enough to encourage people to invest in small towns. If they are, towns such as Tullow, Muine <Col N="11" /> Bheag and Borris in County Carlow, which could do with a boost, will be able to compete with bigger towns and cities in the region, such as Kilkenny city, which is still a city. My colleague, Deputy McGuinness, would not like me to forget it is a city. Carlow is not a city but I am sure it will become one in time.</P>
    <P>Shops in towns such as Tullow and Muine Bheag must purchase goods at higher prices and compete with bigger places, such as Carlow and Kilkenny, which have all the major supermarkets. It is difficult for such small towns to survive and, for that reason, I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <P>If small towns are modernised they will attract industry. Some towns depend on shops for employment and commercial activity and they need factories to generate employment and business. Small towns need these schemes. Investors will be encouraged to participate in them, but they must get a return. I quoted Oliver Goldsmith, whose philosophy in life related to the decline of rural Ireland. The present generation must make sure small towns and villages are not forgotten as a result of the provision of increased grants for bigger towns with more facilities to attract industry. I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill because I have been interested in town renewal for many years. It is an important area and 13 minutes is not enough to encompass everything I would like to raise. However, I will refer to a few fundamental matters.</P>
      <P>Many of us who live and work in rural Ireland meet local development associations which represent small towns. Many of them, despite the Celtic tiger economy, genuinely believe they are not being assisted. This is not a political point as they made the same comment when we were in Government. As Deputy Daly stated, if a town or village does not have a sewerage scheme and has a bad water supply, investors will not be interested in investing there. Such villages are not suitable for the construction of new houses and any potential commercial activity in the town would be restricted. Investment in infrastructure is important for such towns and the money is available now, which was not the case in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Small villages will be revitalised as a result of this legislation. There is another major change in this scheme. Urban renewal schemes were successful and dramatic improvements were made in some towns and cities as a result. They were developer-driven and most rotated between a number of developers. There was nothing wrong with that because they came up with the goods. Given that strict building specifications were outlined, the result has at least been orderly and well planned. The problem for small towns is that, despite the financial aids which are in place generally, unless there is a commercial aspect to a scheme it will make no appreciable difference. This may even apply to towns included in this scheme. I am not saying the Minister is wrong <Col N="12" /> because the scheme is in place and all towns will have an opportunity to develop.</P>
    <P>Galway County Council employed consultants to select the towns that would qualify under the scheme and Portumna, Headford, Loughrea, Clifden and Ballygar were chosen. They deserve an opportunity to develop. There is nothing wrong with that, but I have a bee in my bonnet about the fact that my own village of Mount Bellew has been left out. I held the county council meeting up for half an hour over the matter because no matter what criteria were used, it should have been included, yet it was not. All we can hope for is that it will be included the next time.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been most anxious to get a spread of fairly big towns and smaller villages included in the renewal scheme. Naturally, if one takes a big town that is not far from Galway, it will have a better chance of making a go of things than a small town 30 or 40 miles from the centre of activity that is Galway city. We are very lucky in the west to have such an anchor city. Many people say, however, that Galway has sucked everything into its own urban area and there is a certain degree of truth in that, but how much worse off we would be in the west if we did not have that anchor? We now want to suck the activity back out again into the surrounding areas, or at least stop too many people wanting to live and work in Galway city. The same problem exists in Cork, Limerick and elsewhere, but how does one tackle it?</P>
    <P>The Bill tries to give a hand to developing towns. For whatever reason, there can be huge differences between towns and villages. It is difficult to understand why sometimes a small village can do very well while five miles away another village is dying. Even before the town renewal scheme commenced, some smaller towns in the west had been doing well. One feature of that success is that on weekday mornings and evenings, particularly on Fridays, there are traffic jams one would not have thought possible before. The problems are similar to those of Dublin at the moment because so many people now have cars and they tend to congregate in towns and villages at the same times.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of Galway County Council for some time but I would not claim to have all the answers as regards the factors that influence growth in towns and villages. Until recently, it appeared that the speed limit sign &ndash; or the lollipop as I call it &ndash; was the determining factor in what happened in a town or village. In other words, if one was living within the speed limit area, one could nearly build what one wanted, including an incinerator but if one was outside the speed limit area there were huge problems obtaining planning permission for development. That does not represent good planning.</P>
    <P>The Galway county manager has always said &ndash; and I think it is a view shared by most council members &ndash; that the sooner we get to the stage <Col N="13" /> where we have a plan for individual towns the better. We already have such plans for some of the bigger towns, but I am referring to smaller towns. Such a plan should envisage what will happen to planning in a town over the next ten, 15 or 20 years. It may not bear any relationship to the speed limit area, so that development could take place either within or outside that limit but the town plan would include all the necessary infrastructure, including the renewal scheme which would become part of the plan.</P>
    <P>In order to do this, however, one would have to undertake extensive local negotiations. In recent years I have seen a dramatic change with local people wanting a greater input into the development and planning of their own areas. While it is difficult enough to achieve a local consensus, I hope it will materialise over the next few years. If the matter is approached in that manner, we will have the unique towns and villages people want and deserve.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see a sameness about every single village, although we are moving towards that sort of scenario. One would like to think that when we modernise the heart of a rural village, which is its square, it will bear some resemblance to the history and character of the area. Unfortunately, there is a huge degree of sameness which may be due to the fact that the country's limited number of design engineers and consultants are all feeding out of the one pot, so to speak. To avoid that sameness in local development projects, our town developers and chambers of commerce should become much more integrated in the planning process. That would present a greater chance to achieve a degree of uniqueness in rural development.</P>
    <P>Traffic has become a major problem in bigger towns. More particularly, since the housing crisis hit us, there are several small villages and towns in my county, and I am sure in every other county, where rented accommodation is not available for newly married couples. Such accommodation is needed, yet it is not being provided. The town renewal scheme envisaged in the Bill should help to rectify this problem by encouraging business people to examine the commercial aspect.</P>
    <P>Some towns are able to spark off themselves and they develop a good community infrastructure in which people become involved by taking their responsibilities seriously. Towns such as Kiltimagh in County Mayo have been transformed and people come from all over Europe to see what the local community has achieved there. The Bill represents part of that renewal programme whereby people can achieve such things under proper supervision and direction while basing development on the character of a town that its inhabitants desire.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes provision for expert advice with regard to town development projects. I do not know whether such advice will be free through local councils, or through consultants as we planned it on Galway County Council. There we hired consultants to examine the various parts <Col N="14" /> of towns we thought would meet the criteria of the previous Bill. Such professional advice is useful for small communities. Perhaps the Minister could elaborate on that point when he is summing up. As the Minister knows, the problem with a local community is that one can have all the ideas in the world, but the minute they are committed to paper the process becomes costly. I hope people will be able to tap into a cheap, or free, reservoir of expert advice when planning local development schemes. There is a big gap between what people want and the plans that will ultimately be agreed.</P>
    <P>While I wish the legislation well, I assume that some changes may be made to the Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State on introducing this legislation which will provide new tax incentives to rejuvenate our towns. There is a need to address the issues of social and economic under-development in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>Politicians are often asked what Governments can do to provide rejuvenation and employment in smaller towns. The debate about decentralisation is growing and many smaller towns are considering that issue in the context of renewal and development. There are many spin-offs from decentralisation, including the employment of local people in national bodies. I hope the Minister will refer to this in his reply given that the Minister for Finance said that up to 70% of civil servants could be located outside Dublin by 2003.</P>
      <P>There is a particular emphasis on small towns in the Bill. The Minister mentioned a population level of between 500 and 6,000. In the context of decentralisation, there has been too much emphasis on Dublin for too long. There is a need for more decision making at local and county council level by people who are involved in voluntary work in towns. The town renewal scheme involved the preparation by county councils of renewal plans which were submitted to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. The Minister can make recommendations to the Minister for Finance in relation to the application of town renewal tax reliefs.</P>
      <P>Five towns in County Galway &ndash; Portumna, Headford, Loughrea, Ballygar and Clifden &ndash; were selected and the Minister will shortly announce the various designations. It is important that this scheme is put into operation in County Galway because no part of the county was included in the upper Shannon tax relief designation. This was a disappointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Galway city is one of the most expensive areas for housing. Many smaller towns and communities are considering the provision of housing and I am glad that the mix takes account of younger <Col N="15" /> families, the elderly and single people. However, there have been many difficulties in relation to those plans. For example, in Turloughmore and Newcastle near Athenry, planning permission was granted by the county council but this was overturned by An Bord Pléanála. One of the reasons given for the refusal was that the county development plan needed to be amended. Some of the schemes were perhaps too big for the villages but they should be reconsidered, particularly in relation to sewerage schemes which are much needed. They should be advanced so that services are available for small housing schemes. I agree that building inside speed limits is not always the answer. Other issues are involved and they should be considered.</P>
    <P>The urban renewal scheme was successful in Galway city and towns such as Ballinasloe and Tuam. I hope this scheme will also be successful. There are great opportunities in the western region where hopefully natural gas will be brought ashore and a new gas fired generation station will be built. The ESB is currently exploring ways of improving the electricity service in County Galway, including a new line from Portumna to Athenry. All those issues, in addition to the fact that the region has been granted Objective One status, should ensure development.</P>
    <P>Many small towns are suffering because the commercial banks have decided, without any consultation, to close branches in communities. They are leaving behind a large customer base. The banks may now see the advantage of town renewal and get involved in negotiations. In Great Britain, negotiations are ongoing with the Royal Mail in relation to post offices. Negotiations with An Post should be opened with a view to providing banking services and ATMs so people have financial services in their towns.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism of the small number of towns which qualified. In larger counties such as Cork and Galway, people made the case for a bigger number. There has also been criticism of the population of 500 yardstick. I hope the Minister will consider those issues because we all thought Mount Bellew, which Deputy Connaughton mentioned, would be included but that was not the case. It will be included in other schemes such as the green town awards, but it would be suitable for inclusion in the town renewal scheme.</P>
    <P>A total of 102 plans have been received in the Department. I hope these towns which are already working to improve their education facilities and health services will get the go-ahead from the Department. I hope also that they do not become dormitory towns. There is a danger that towns within a 20 mile or 30 mile radius of a big city such as Galway will become dormitory areas. These towns need to be developed. They need a boost and they will receive it under the Bill. I congratulate the Minister and welcome the Bill's introduction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EddieWade" hpid="Mr. Wade Mr. Wade">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wade</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and his <Col N="16" /> officials on this important initiative which will undoubtedly contribute to the revitalisation of many small to medium sized towns. Many important lessons have been learned from the Government's experience of tackling the problems of urban decay in major city centres and larger towns. Many smaller towns have also suffered from the problems associated with dereliction and the Bill's provisions will enable many small rural centres to regenerate themselves along lines that will make a contribution to rebalancing development in a way that takes the pressure off major urban centres.</P>
      <P>Small towns have a right to the same type of development that many major urban centres have enjoyed over the past decade. The Bill contains a number of important principles relating to the physical renewal and revitalisation of towns, the promotion of towns as cultural, commercial, residential and social centres and the enhancement of existing amenities, heritage, the environment and the promotion of sustainable development patterns. County councils have an important role to play in this area and I am pleased that my council in County Limerick has taken an active interest in the scheme.</P>
      <P>The towns of Castleconnell, Abbeyfeale, Kilmallock, Croom and Rathkeale have been already submitted by the council for designation under the redevelopment incentive package. Charleville, which straddles the Cork-Limerick border, is an important focal point for south Limerick. It is also included on the designation application list. Bruree, the birthplace of de Valera, is also set to double in size in the coming years. It is good that his vision of Ireland is being recreated in a slightly different form but which provides work and housing at home for anybody who wants it. I am confident that under the Bill's provisions the adjoining councils can work in harmony to develop these towns and serve the population in two counties. The Bruree/Charleville area will be a good example in that regard.</P>
      <P>The current national development plan sets out a comprehensive and practical philosophy as well as a huge range of detailed measures and programmes to address the various issues arising from the unprecedented economic and social development that society has undergone over the past five or six years. It also provides a framework to develop our economy and society in a balanced and caring way for the next decade or so. The town renewal scheme is another element of the integrated plan the Government is preparing for the development of our society and economy over the next decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has a responsibility to ensure that the benefits of the current economic boom are spread as widely as possible. It is also concerned that smaller communities get the opportunity to build themselves up as part of the new found prosperity. The Government's White Paper, a Strategy for Rural Development in Ireland, published last year, provides a coherent strategy to address the problems of social and <Col N="17" /> economic development in rural Ireland. It must not be forgotten that although County Limerick has a major city in its boundaries, it also contains many towns and villages which have yet to benefit from the boom in recent years.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides the framework for the development of these towns and villages and I hope that the towns for which applications for designation have been made will be supplemented by additional areas in my native county, and particularly villages such as Caherconlish which was not included earlier. Its inclusion should be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>Regional development is important for rural Ireland. The national development plan is the first to address the regionalisation concept with regional development operational programmes for the Border, midlands and western regions as well as the southern and eastern regions. I do not have time to make further points but I welcome the Bill and I am confident it will work well for rural Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the content of the Bill and the general concept of tax designation and town renewal. Kilkenny city was included in the earlier tax designation scheme. I hope we have learned something from that scheme. However, there were downsides to the tax designation scheme in places such as Kilkenny city. The efforts of the local authority in Kilkenny over the years were set to one side by An Bord Pleanála when planning applications, which were refused by the local authority, were subsequently passed by An Bord Pleanála. This left a trail of destruction in the city. Part of its medieval heart was destroyed because of the insensitive way An Bord Pleanála dealt with the planning applications.</P>
      <P>We have seen in Kilkenny some of the worst examples of pastiche and facades. I hope this will not be repeated in the town renewal scheme. Some of the finest buildings in Kilkenny were torn down and all that was left were the facades. The backs of the buildings are now presented as modern buildings. It is a disgrace that some of the finest features in those buildings &ndash; such as period fireplaces &ndash; were torn out and sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Towns and villages are not only threatened with neglect but with road programmes. I do not disagree with the manner in which we are developing our country but we must be more sensitive about towns and villages. In Piltown, for example, the motorway runs within two feet of a man's farmyard. His rights were ignored by the National Roads Authority. He was not given an opportunity to defend his position and his family are suffering as a result. Building a 12 or 14 feet wall outside their back door is not the way to accommodate their needs and rights. I often wonder if such bodies are accountable. If parliamentary questions are tabled on this issue, they are <Col N="18" /> disallowed because we do not have a direct input into what the NRA does, yet we fund it.</P>
    <P>Another example of how a local village or town was destroyed is in Milltown in County Kilkenny where a local community was divided in two by the construction of a bypass. I accept the motorway was necessary but we must learn to find some way to ensure that the rights of farmers, landowners, householders and communities are looked after. It cannot always be a victory of Pythagoras over Picasso. Local authorities and the NRA must learn to accommodate towns and villages when planning roads rather than adopting a straight line policy. Road construction is a continuous and serious threat. This House must have more control over what is happening in our countryside.</P>
    <P>I welcome the town renewal scheme because it gives towns and villages outside the main urban centres the opportunity to participate in our continued growth. We must ensure through the planning process that the streetscapes, character and general history of these towns and villages are maintained. Other speakers referred to the fact that most parts of the country look the same because they all have cobblelock paving and Victorian type street fixtures. Local authorities should be encouraged to ensure that the character of buildings in villages is maintained. Local materials or similar type materials should be used in the construction of infill sites.</P>
    <P>In one submission from Carlow and Kilkenny the areas designated in Tinnahinch and Graiguenamanagh did not include the riverside area which was the main trading area in Graiguenamanagh for many years ago. Yet there is a large number of derelict buildings along the river. It should have been included to improve the streetscape in that area. Arguments were made about excluding sites. I ask the review group to use its discretion when considering the applications to include sites which are not included. An appeals system should be put in place so that decisions can be appealed if people are not satisfied with them.</P>
    <P>Castlecomer, Thomastown and Graiguenamanagh in County Kilkenny are designated as high priority towns on the county council's list for sewage treatment plants. Planning permission cannot be granted because the infrastructure does not exist for housing projects. It is time for the Department to provide sufficient funding to ensure that a system to deal with the sewage problems in these towns is put in place. If that does not happen and the planners continue to refuse to grant planning permission, the town renewal scheme will fail.</P>
    <P>Planning sections of almost every local authority must ensure that a number of disciplines are represented. The engineering staff, for example, should be complemented by architects and town planners. However, that is not the case in some local authorities, including my own. Qualified people cannot be found. Many employees in the public sector are leaving for the private sector <Col N="19" /> because remuneration and the prospects for promotion are better. Local government faces many challenges. The Planning and Development Bill and this legislation will place further pressures and demands on local government employees. We must ensure proper funding is provided to increase staffing levels. I appeal again to the Minister to examine the role played by An Bord Pleanála in relation to this development and to ensure it conforms with the county development plans in these areas.</P>

      <P>I welcome the principle and the thrust of the Bill. It is designed to try to revitalise town centres and is aimed particularly at refurbishment and some small new building projects. This is an issue I have followed closely since it was initiated last July.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGuinness hoped that we have learned from the mistakes of the past. The Bill is welcome but it will be a disaster. The people who drew up the Bill and who will have to implement it are the local authorities which, particularly my own local authority in Wicklow, are under-resourced. They do not have the time to deal with routine matters as opposed to getting innovative projects off the ground.</P>
      <P>In his contribution Deputy Dukes mentioned that the Bill should have come before the House in February or March. I disagree with him. The Bill should have been before the House this time last year.</P>

      <P>That delay will cause untold trouble.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGuinness talked about Kilkenny. I am familiar with the streets off High Street, including Evans Lane and Butter Slip, and they are a disaster. Every corner of the place is built up. There is no space and no sunlight. Developers are selling property for astronomical sums to people who are benefiting from the tax reliefs. Those properties are being rented out at a very high price to young people, most of whom are being subsidised by the health board. It is a national scandal and we are not addressing it because we are too concerned with pushing through legislation containing nice ideas which look good on paper but which turn out to be a disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last July a circular was sent to the local authorities requesting them to select a certain number of towns in each county. Various criteria were laid down &ndash; I think the population figure was between 500 and 6,000 people &ndash; and submissions had to be made by the end of October. Most members of local authorities were not even aware <Col N="20" /> that this development was taking place until a few weeks before the submission was ready. Fortunately in Wicklow, the county manager and the management team had selected five towns following discussions with people, and in my view the correct five towns were selected, but the difficulty was in preparing the submission. They did not have the resources to do it themselves. They had to get a private consultant, whom I met. I should say, given the current climate, that members of my family have property in the designated area. However, it was not possible for the consultant to examine even one town in the minute detail that was required to make this scheme successful.</P>
    <P>Members of the community received a circular stating that there would be a public meeting and inviting them to the discussion if they had any ideas for their property. There are many derelict buildings in the centre of every small town because families have died or moved away or the people who own them might be out of the country or in Dublin. I know from the submissions received in County Wicklow that many of the buildings that should have been included in schemes were not included because a submission was not made by the owners of the property. I realise the Department officials will say they had adequate opportunity in that they were sent a circular but that argument does not hold up when one examines the facts of the case.</P>
    <P>I put forward a motion at county council level that all the buildings in the town with which I am most familiar, my home town, be included for refurbishment. I am aware that the policy of the Department is that we cannot put a blanket designation on the area. However, I ask it to examine this concept because in a year or two from now, somebody might notice that their neighbour is refurbishing a building and that they got certain tax reliefs and the individual who has got nothing will probably be in a far worse position. That will give rise to a lot of friction. This Bill should have preceded the developments that have taken place over the past nine months and local authorities should have been adequately resourced. Local authorities are familiar with the towns but the planning and engineering staff did not have time to address the everyday problems, let alone draw up any schedules.</P>
    <P>There is another weakness in the Bill. The directive which came out stated that the section 23 provision should be used sparingly and I can understand the principle behind that, but in many of these towns one or two individuals own much of the property. Owner-occupier benefit is no use to them because they can only live in one property. I know many of them have sought the section 23 option, and the principle that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer is not something I would be in favour of, but if we are trying to get the buildings refurbished, we will have to examine the possibility of being more generous in regard to granting section 23 provisions. If the Minister decides that he does not want to make people richer, let him suffer the consequences <Col N="21" /> that the buildings will remain dilapidated. Those are the facts of the matter. These people will not sell the property on to other people who can benefit from the owner-occupier measure.</P>
    <P>Initially the scheme was to be implemented on a pro rata basis, starting at three hectares per 6,000 people, but a directive was issued during the period that every town could have up to three hectares. I have seen the submissions that were made. Those of us who grew up in small towns spent a lot of time playing in back gardens. We will now have more development in and around town centres but that will be at a cost. There will be no green spaces or back gardens. That applies across the board to all our housing and no one is more at fault than local authorities. They build estates without providing green spaces. We are talking about increased densities. I do not know if Deputy Dukes agrees with increased densities but when I drive from west Wicklow to Greystones I come to the top of a hill overlooking Kilpeddar and the amount of building I can see is minuscule. There are thousands of acres of green space yet we have to have higher densities.</P>
    <P>There is a social cost because children have no where to go. They sit in front of the video or play with their Pokémon cards but they never run around a field because there is no space. They cannot do what children did years ago because there is so much difficulty with public litigation and the fear that it is not safe to let children wander, yet we are going to cram these buildings into town centres.</P>
    <P>This scheme will cause many difficulties. I realise there is a three or four year time-span and that previous designations were always extended but a major difficulty in the town renewal scheme is that in addition to the scarcity of builders due to the current boom, disputes will arise over rights of way, ownership of property, etc. It can be difficult to say in small towns who owns what piece of property at the back of a building, so there will be a lot of litigation and disputes. I do not know how the scheme will work out but we will have to be flexible with a view to extending the time limit on the scheme.</P>
    <P>The scheme should be extended to include some theme villages. Abbeyleix and Lismore have benefited from their heritage town status. There are many other small villages with a population below 500. I am thinking specifically of Ballyknockan in Wicklow, probably the only granite village in the country, which has many dilapidated buildings. It need not necessarily be Ballyknockan &ndash; I am sure there are many other small villages around the country with which people can identify that should be designated as theme villages. That will help to revitalise our tourism industry. People who have these properties are not wealthy, there is no incentive for them to refurbish them and they will not sell them.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGuinness alluded to An Bord Pleanála, the NRA and Bord Fáilte. I realise I am digressing a little but Bord Fáilte employed Fitzpatrick consultants to carry out a survey in <Col N="22" /> January 1999 with a view to examining the regional tourism structures. I have tried to get a copy of that document from the Minister and Bord Fáilte, which must contain recommendations detrimental to Bord Fáilte. I have been unable to get a copy of that document, a year and a half later.</P>
    <P>We, as politicians, created the monsters that are An Bord Pleanála, Bord Fáilte and the NRA. There were created out of fear of the great modern day concept of political interference. At least politicians are answerable to the people. If we do something that dissatisfies them, as we witnessed, they can give us a good kick, and that is how it should be, but we should not be afraid to accept responsibility. We should not hand over responsibility for virtually all areas to other bodies. It will be the case soon that when one tables a question to a Minister &ndash; as it is the case with some Ministers &ndash; it will be difficult to know the area for which he or she is responsible. That is not the fault of this Government but of successive Governments and we should try to address it.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte, the NRA and An Bord Pleanála should be disbanded and the relevant Ministers and Departments should be made responsible for those areas. We have enough civil servants who are answerable hiding behind such bureaucrats.  Young people living in their local areas who have sought planning permission from Wicklow County Council and appealed their applications to An Bord Pleanála have been refused permission by that faceless body. The position is crazy. That comment is not a reflection on the staff in An Bord Pleanála. We must remember they are human beings and subject to the same prejudices as I am.</P>

      <P>The urban renewal scheme has been welcome and, on the whole, successful. It has helped to breathe new life into towns and has been especially beneficial to counties, such as the Border counties, which have not benefited from the economic upturn to anywhere near the same extent as other regions.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the successor to the urban renewal scheme, the town renewal scheme, which this Bill places on a statutory basis. However, I share with other Members a deep sense of frustration at the Government's approach. We are being asked to legislate in retrospect for a scheme that is already at an advanced stage with towns currently awaiting approval of their schemes from the Minister for Finance.  We are asked to deem that sections 3 to 6, inclusive, have come into operation as from 16 February 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State spoke of town renewal as an important element in the Government's planning policy and spatial strategy. When the Government cannot properly plan its business in the Oireachtas, what faith can we have in its ability to plan for the country? In this case, the cart is literally miles ahead of the horse. As a local authority member and a Teachta Dála who has been involved in the town renewal process, <Col N="23" /> I deeply resent the way this legislation has been literally turned on its head. We, the legislators, should have been given the opportunity to shape the legislation long before the scheme was put in place. Instead we are asked to rubber stamp the existing scheme. I would like to know why this approach was adopted. I hope the Minister of State will elaborate on that in his reply.</P>
    <P>In my home county of Monaghan four towns were short listed, three were selected for submission and the fourth, Carrickmacross, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will know, was left, to all intents and purposes, to fend for itself. Two of six towns were dropped from the list for County Cavan, Kingscourt and Virginia. Those and other provincial towns should be given every assistance and equal access to all supports.</P>
    <P>I wrote to the Minister for Finance in February asking him to state the Government's intent towards those towns that were eliminated in the initial selection process, penalised in many instances and, as in the case of Carrickmacross, for the go-ahead energy of many in its business sector and the positive community impact on that town's appearance as a result of much hard work by a dedicated Tidy Town's voluntary effort. The Minister for Finance replied explaining the selection process. He concluded that designations in the towns selected will apply for a period of three years, after which the designation of further areas will be considered. I would like the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to explain this. Is it the case that, after the initial three year period of first designations, further areas in the already designated towns will be considered or that towns not included in the initial selection can be considered? These are matters that could have been teased out if legislation had been introduced initially followed by the implementation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>There remain many questions to be answered, not least when a final decision will issue on the proposals submitted for the 102 towns short listed. There is much anxiety in urban centres throughout the jurisdiction. It is my earnest hope that all proposals included in the plans currently under consideration will be approved and that, following the three year period of designation, new and further proposals within those towns and towns not included in the current short list will be afforded the same, or preferably improved, incentives and supports.</P>
    <P>It is my view that the scheme has a number of deficiencies and can be improved. We could have addressed them if the opportunity for a proper debate had been provided. The potential impact of a dynamic town renewal scheme and of urban centres, particularly in the Border, midland and western regions, must be apparent to all. Promising decentralisation of Departments and services and urging industrial investors to site in underdeveloped areas and yet, at the same time, operating what is, in the final analysis, a begrudg<Col N="24" /> ing and minimalist approach to urban renewal, points up the inconsistencies in the Government's approach. The so-called loss to the Exchequer that the measures contained in the current scheme represent pale into insignificance when measured against the potential economic upturn that must result from the rejuvenation of long neglected rural towns.</P>
    <P>I strongly commend to the Ministers for Finance and the Environment and Local Government the specific proposals contained in the overall plan submitted by the towns of Cavan, Ballyjamesduff, Bailieborough and Cootehill at one end of my constituency and the towns of Clones, Ballybay and Castleblayney at the other. I hope that no one in those deserving communities will be disappointed when the final approvals issue.</P>

      <P>This Bill is welcome and timely. It is important for us, as a society, to ensure that the benefits of the Celtic tiger are distributed throughout the country. The small rural town will be afforded the opportunity to develop and prosper without being swallowed up by large urban settlements. It will retain its uniqueness while being able to offer its business people and inhabitants incentives to live and work within the community.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill for a number of key reasons. Small towns will now be able to compete with large towns as good places to establish businesses. Economic prosperity will be brought to towns that have fought decline for decades. Local authorities will focus on those small towns for strategic planning. It will offer a meaningful tool for those working within community development. There are incentives that will remove the fear of town closure, so to speak, with towns close to Dublin becoming merely dormitory towns.</P>
      <P>Models exist to ensure the experience in small towns is positive, given that the urban renewal scheme has worked well in larger urban centres. I recognise the benefits this Bill will bring to my constituency by developing towns like Oldcastle and Kells. It has already brought welcome changes to towns such as the central town of Navan. The opportunity exists to make a meaningful contribution to those living in small rural towns. We hear the language of decline, closure, transfers, rationalisation, but none of those terms takes into consideration the unprecedented economic prosperity this country is experiencing. The Bill seeks to address this imbalance and to share the wealth and success. The Government is ensuring that the prosperity is shared and that those who need help are given support in a meaningful way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economic benefits will be measured but there are factors which cannot be measured, such <Col N="25" /> as the quality of life for those living in towns such as Oldcastle and Kells. In my constituency I am aware of the hard work done by communities as they try to promote development and maintain services in small towns. The Bill gives those communities real opportunities to make a difference. These communities can now grasp the opportunity to encourage inward investment by making it attractive to establish a business and set up home in the designated towns, provide a viable alternative to those who do not want to set up business in Dublin and afford people the opportunity to make a living in their own home town, thereby removing the necessity for people to commute to larger urban centres. This in turn will take pressure off the roads. Facilities and services, including child care, will be developed locally so that parents are not seeking services in an already over-stretched Dublin. Town centres will have people living over their offices and shops. This will bring a new vibrancy to towns and help entrepreneurs to keep overheads low. The benefits will be enormous &ndash; jobs, investment, services, consolidation of communities, etc.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken an important first step through this legislation. The new business community should be encouraged to continue to get involved in all aspects of development in these towns and should try to identify opportunities which will bring prosperity to the towns. In the case of Oldcastle and Kells there is an opportunity to exploit the proximity to Dublin but there is also the benefit of not having to overstretch infrastructure. There are real advantages in being located outside the city. I look forward to the ideas and partnerships which will evolve as part of the process of renewal. We must not see the passing of this most welcome Bill as an end in itself. It is important that local communities and local authorities respond to the partnership provision contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and his two Ministers of State for the work they have done, for introducing the Bill and bringing urban renewal to some of our smaller towns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill. I have seen the benefits of the urban renewal programme initially in the town of Portlaoise. For many years, we in Laois saw the benefits of certain inward investment in the adjoining counties of Kildare and Offaly. Unfortunately we in Laois were deprived of such benefit. While Portlaoise has reaped the benefits of urban renewal I welcome the fact that town renewal is coming to smaller towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ó Caoláin said the Government had put the cart before the horse. I see this as an opportunity for small towns such as Mountmellick, Mountrath, Rathdowney and Portarlington to get away from the days of the horse and cart. This is the first time we have seen private interest in the smaller towns. While there are some flaws in the Bill, we must look at the role of the smaller community in the smaller town. It was difficult to <Col N="26" /> hold small communities together by virtue of the fact that there is little private investment in those towns. This Bill will certainly provide the incentive for investment. For the first time in my 21 years as a member of a local authority I have watched with interest developers come into Mountmellick and recognise the possibility of investment in a small town. Taking Mountmellick as an example, it must auger well for the future of small towns.</P>
    <P>I recognise that it will promote economic prosperity in small towns and will give them a new lease of life. That will be confirmed as the Bill clears the way for local investment. An important aspect of the Bill is that small towns will now become part of the local authority development plan. In other words it will give the local authority the incentive to instigate development plans for smaller towns. That in itself will encourage developers to prepare their plans for a five-year period, it will enhance the ability of those small towns to take advantage of the rapid change taking place in the economy and it help prevent smaller towns from becoming dormitory towns. Those who live in small rural areas will recognise the importance of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The concepts have been tried and trusted in the larger urban areas and I believe revived derelict areas inject economic life into those towns. We shall also reap the benefits of learning from the mistakes of the larger towns when we come to develop those areas. We are aware of the enormous pressures on the planning departments and we must ensure sufficient staff is available in these departments to provide the necessary climate for the Bill to impact positively. The Minister is aware of this problem and is doing everything in his power to address it. There are serious backlogs in the planning departments.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister is commissioning the national spatial strategy which will streamline the work carried out by planning departments. While the planning departments need extra staff there is also a need for clear guidelines which can only be given after well researched strategic thinking.</P>
    <P>The local authority of which I am a member is carrying out extraordinary work under difficult conditions and particular credit must be given to the staff. As legislators, we must ensure that every possible assistance is given to them. A recent initiative which increases the size of a development before planning permission is required is an effective way to reduce the number of applications before the local authorities. Communities in smaller towns work hard to hold their communities together and to promote development to sustain a certain quality of life. I welcome the Bill because it gives this hard work and determination some real teeth when addressing the difficulties in applying experience in rural towns. It will encourage inward investment by making it attractive to establish a business and set up home in the designated towns. It will also provide a viable alternative to those who want to set up <Col N="27" /> businesses in local rural areas. It will afford people the opportunity to make a living in their home town, thereby removing the necessity to commute to larger urban areas. Many facilities and services, including child care, are available and are not as stretched in towns such as Mountmellick where a purpose built child care facility is about to be developed by a local development association to meet the needs and demands.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the possibility of investment in the small towns to sustain and retain the local communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill seeks to address a decline in the core area of many smaller towns. This is in contrast with rapid development in some others, particularly in the county towns where the previous renewal scheme has been successful. Undoubtedly there have been other factors as mentioned by other speakers. Some people in the Department were concerned that some of the towns that might be designated now might not have had the critical mass to benefit from the scheme. There may be a case for putting more emphasis on housing rather than on commercial activity in some of these areas. It would be beneficial if that were the case. Sometimes the lack of development comes down to a lack of infrastructure. That issue is being addressed in many towns and many water and sewerage schemes are under way. In many instances local authorities and developers are co-operating to provide some of these services. Unfortunately, there are indications from speakers from various parts of the country that lack of progress is due to hold-ups in the planning process. In many instances the issue of planning is a negative force. It certainly impacts negatively on rural development, as has been mentioned by almost all speakers.</P>
      <P>The success of this scheme will depend to a considerable extent on the residential incentives element. The scheme can make a huge impact in this regard if it is adventurous enough. In particular, there should be encouragement of residential development in smaller units in some of the towns.</P>
      <P>There also has been confusion regarding the three hectare maximum area for inclusion under the scheme. There was a view that this was the maximum area for towns with populations of 6,000 and that it would be reduced proportionally for smaller towns. In theory that might have meant a town with a population of 600 would have had only one third of a hectare or a little more than half an acre designated. However, I understand a distinction is being drawn between refurbishment and new building. That was not clear to many local authority planners and senior county council officials at an earlier stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They were informed to some extent by experience under the last urban renewal scheme. Shannon was the qualifying town in County Clare and the modest proposals made by the county council <Col N="28" /> were deemed excessive by the expert advisory panel which was in place at that time. The scheme originally submitted by the council could have had an enormous impact but the one finally adopted is so insignificant that it will be disappointing in terms of benefits. If the same criteria are applied to this scheme by the expert group, it will be an unmitigated disaster.</P>
    <P>I compliment Clare County Council, the council about which I have most knowledge, on the quality of the plan it submitted for the towns under the scheme and for the level of consultation it achieved in a relatively short timescale. We regularly hear about lack of resources and manpower. However, when the local authority put its mind to it and had the co-operation of local communities, a huge amount of consultation was possible. The local communities were also not found wanting in terms of preparing plans and lobbying for the inclusion of their towns. One of the encouraging aspects was that they were led mainly by people who did not have a personal interest in properties but who had a vision for their town and wanted a say in its development.</P>
    <P>It would be helpful if the Minister would indicate an intention to include all eligible towns for the duration of the scheme. There are several cases of towns being left off the list by narrow margins. I am thinking of towns such as Lisdoonvarna, which is the town in Clare most in need of the capital the scheme will generate. I am also thinking of Newmarket-on-Fergus which is due to be bypassed and might suffer as a result. The lower population level left out many towns which could benefit enormously from the scheme and some of which would meet the criteria if the most recent figures rather than the 1996 ones were used.</P>
    <P>I was particularly impressed with the preparation of the plan in Ennistymon. The level of community involvement was great.</P>

      <P>I unequivocally support this Bill. Its provisions will enable small towns to be given a facelift. I am aware of the benefits of the rural renewal scheme in my constituency. It has been of great benefit to the towns of Tubbercurry and Ballymote. Among the few remaining areas in Sligo which were not included in the rural renewal scheme were the village of Ballaghy, which includes part of Charlestown in County Mayo, Strandhill and Rosses Point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Strandhill and Rosses Point are seaside resorts and they will benefit greatly from this scheme. I recall the introduction of the seaside resort scheme by the former Minister, Deputy Kenny. Enniscrone was included in that scheme and it has benefited tremendously from it. A large number of new houses have been built and the num<Col N="29" /> ber of visitors to the town has increased enormously.</P>
    <P>The objective of this scheme is to improve the quality of life, services, amenities and employment opportunities for residents in small towns and villages. I compliment the Minister and the Ministers of State, Deputies Dempsey, Wallace and Molloy. In particular, I compliment Deputy Molloy on the flexibility and understanding he has shown in my constituency by making special provision for the inclusion of Ballaghy in conjunction with Charlestown in this scheme.</P>
    <P>The young and energetic county councillor, Aiden Collery, made an excellent submission at a meeting I attended in Ballaghy. The village of Ballaghy has a population of less than 100. County Mayo had already filled its quota of towns for inclusion in the scheme and although Ballaghy is in County Sligo and Charlestown is in County Mayo the Minister found a means of including them. I sent Mr. Collery to meet Deputy Molloy in Galway and Mr. Molloy included the towns in the scheme. I thank him for doing that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes is listening to my contribution. I often thank him for the support he gave Fianna Fáil when it was a minority Government which resulted in this Celtic tiger. When former Deputies Ray McSharry and Charlie Haughey were on this side of the House, the Deputy helped them. There is no question about that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">

I mentioned Strandhill and Rosses Point earlier and they, too, will benefit from this legislation. My favourite beneficiary, however, is the little village of Ballaghy on the borders of Mayo. It has always been neglected but will now benefit a great deal from inclusion in the town renewal scheme. I am delighted about that and I am happy for the people of Ballaghy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>When considering legislation such as this it is important to examine the issue of planning. Planning cannot be about the short-term or ten years into the future. It must be about future generations and how it will impact on the <Col N="30" /> community. It cannot be carried out in isolation but must be integrated and holistic.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers have referred to the provision of child care, schools, infrastructure and so forth and I agree with their comments. When discussing legislation such as this, we must look at precedents, both the successes and the failures. I have direct experience of the docklands scheme which was heralded as progressive. However, it has not enhanced the community or benefited local people. There have been high rise developments and other development schemes, some of which were architecturally good and some quite inferior. Many people have moved into these new apartments but they have not integrated into the local community.</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes refurbishment of residential accommodation which I fear could result in similar developments. The problem with the docklands and urban renewal in Dublin is that it did not enhance the local community because it did not encourage families to live in these areas. What we got was a transient population, people who moved into the area for a few years and moved out again. We need to take measures to ensure this does not occur under this scheme. What we are now getting is the development of what some people refer to as the tenements of the future. Populations are moving into the area and some are having their rents paid for by the local health boards. This has led to a certain resentment because large gates are erected around these developments and there is no integration whatsoever.</P>
      <P>The local community which, in a sense, is under siege is trying to deal with local problems, yet the people who have moved into these developments are not participating in the community. They are enclosed and insulated. More people will come in from outside to the Ringsend, Pearse Street and docklands area and, therefore, the indigenous population will be outnumbered. That may seem like a very tribal notion but it is the reality. I hope we have learned from these mistakes and from the debacle in Courtown which Frank MacDonald has gone into in great detail.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that we are debating this Bill on the day the ESRI released its quarterly report which deals with the notion of community. We need to get back to this. The report goes into some detail about what has happened in relation to developments outside of Dublin. Due to the escalation in house prices and rents, people are now going out to the towns to try to obtain cheaper accommodation. The outer suburbs of Dublin, including Dundalk and Gorey, have been mentioned. There have been huge developments in Rochfortbridge, County Westmeath, Bunclody, County Wexford and Castlecomer, County Kilkenny. These towns have all experienced huge housing developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Towns such as Navan, Drogheda, Carlow and Naas have also experienced huge development because the people who have moved into these areas cannot afford accommodation in Dublin. I <Col N="31" /> had experience of this in Carlow where our party held its annual conference. I was told that there are a large number of estates on the outskirts of Carlow which has improved enormously. People are now commuting to Dublin from Carlow which is taking a big chunk out of their day. I believe nine buses are being provided by a private operator.</P>
    <P>This situation has been allowed to get out of control and public transport or infrastructure has not been provided. Statistics in the Leinster area show a growth in new houses of 163% from 1994 to 1999. New car registrations for that period rose by 164%. Interestingly, in the Louth area, where there is a huge concentration of new developments, car registrations increased by 433%. This tells its own story because the Enterprise service from Dundalk, which is a very good service, increased by just 142%. This indicates an imbalance between car transport and public transport which needs to be addressed before proceeding with all this urban renewal. We need to get the first principles correct, which has not been the case up to now.</P>
    <P>Sustainability is mentioned in this Bill and in the Planning and Development Bill. However, there is a fundamental contradiction here because one cannot have sustainable development if the infrastructure is not in place. Cearly that is the case in this country. If we continue along these lines, we have no hope of meeting our commitments under the Kyoto Agreement because CO2 emissions will increase. The M50 has already become clogged and all commuter routes will quickly become clogged up which is not sustainable. There will be gridlock not just in the cities and towns but on roads leading to and from these towns.</P>
    <P>As a result of rented accommodation in these towns we will get owner-occupiers doing up their property and families moving in, but we could also get the phenomenon of the transient population moving into towns where there is little integration. We need to avoid that. I take the point made by previous speakers that local authorities are under-resourced and do not have the personnel to deal with planning issues. There should be holistic thinking and an integrated approach to this issue. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government needs to understand that there is now a crisis because we cannot keep people in the Civil Service or in local authorities. We need planners and people with expertise. These people are moving at the rate of knots to more lucrative employment.</P>
    <P>I understand Deputy Dukes will be tabling an amendment which I will support. In relation to the ESRI report, it is clear that because of staffing shortages local authorities do not have the expertise and we are getting bad planning decisions. For example, the Department had to intervene where Meath County Council was proposing that Kilbride, with a population of 100, would now become a dormitory town with a <Col N="32" /> population of 5,000. This is the type of incredibly unsustainable planning we need to avoid. I hope the Minister of State will take on board some of my points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>I want to object strenuously to retrospective approval proposed in the Town Renewal Bill, 2000. It is unacceptable that the Government is proposing retrospective approval of decisions that have been already carried out, back dating them to February 1999. The Government is showing increasing contempt for public representatives elected to the Dáil who should have a bigger input into legislation. It is becoming a habit. Recently all Stages of the retrospective legislation validating the illegal refuse charges collected in the last three years were rammed through the House in one day. How it will stand up in the courts is a different matter but this should not be accepted as Government practice.</P>
      <P>I agree in principle with the idea of encouraging development in smaller towns. There is no question that the manner in which planning has developed is unsustainable, with Dublin and other urban areas growing at a rate disproportionate to rural areas. Everyone who lives in Dublin is paying the price for that. It was late in the day before definitive action was taken to reverse that situation. Cramming more and more people, housing and traffic into the capital city area is a feature of countries which would be considered to be more backward in their economic and social development, not one of a supposedly modern capitalist society. It is critical, therefore, that definitive action is taken to create a situation where young people can stay in their own areas and find employment and accommodation. That would be balanced development and it is a principle everyone should accept.</P>
      <P>The only engine for such development included in the Bill is tax designation of areas in chosen towns. That is far from sufficient and I am opposed to the way in which tax designation has been used in the past. As a minimum, there should have been a rigorous study of how tax designation has been used in towns under different schemes in the past. People in some seaside towns would say that the manner in which tax designation was operated &ndash; as a cover for speculators &ndash; has been destructive and counter-productive. The philosophy of this Fianna Fáil-PD Government is to throw more and more at the feet of the speculators, the land owners, the developers and the capitalists and rely on them to put into practice what should be social policy with investment from many different directions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The speculation in land and housing this will encourage has been the scourge of ordinary people. In Dublin over recent years the Government has resolutely refused to cut out speculation and the obscene situation has arisen where speculators have priced working people on average to middle incomes out of the opportunity to purchase their own homes. People dependent on <Col N="33" /> rented accommodation are increasingly seeing more and more of their incomes going into the pockets of the landlords and face great difficulties as a result. The Government resolutely refuses to tackle the small minority whose grasping and greed are creating such a crisis because they have been lavishly funded by those sections in the past. Are we to see now a replication of that in towns around the State?</P>
    <P>Tax designation is the only concrete measure in this Bill. There are other aspirations but I guarantee that if the Government continues to give these lopsided privileges to one narrow sector of society at the expense of the other, the magnificent result of the independent socialist candidate, Séamus Healy, in Tipperary South will be the music of the future.</P>
    <P>There are worthy aspirations in the Bill concerning how towns should be developed but the funding and commitment of resources, particularly in terms of local authorities, should be much more concrete. When the Government is sitting on such a huge surplus of funds, far more resources should be made available to local authorities for investment in these services.</P>
    <P>Private institutions such as banks, the services of which are crucial for the economic and social life of communities, cannot be allowed to walk away from rural areas. They are shutting down their branches in sizeable towns, walking away and leaving people without a banking service. Many community groups have written to me to complain about banks which make huge profits, walking away from towns. They should not be allowed to do that; they should be compelled to have a social dimension to their operations and to stay in towns and villages which need their services.</P>
    <P>Similarly, other services, such as post offices, must not be moved. In recent years this tendency to close services and rationalise in smaller towns has been very damaging to the fabric of communities. I equate it in its narrow mindedness and lack of vision to the closure during the 1950s of sections of the railway and railway spurs. I remember the spur between Tralee and Dingle being closed during my childhood. That railway would be hugely profitable if it was there today, attracting tourists and benefiting the environment. We cannot allow capitalism, red in tooth and claw to dominate. The interests of people and their communities must be put first.</P>
    <P>The decentralisation of State services should tie in with town renewal but not decentralisation where each Minister makes a grab for some section of a Department under his or her control, like a rugby player going for a ball, and then races away with it into his or her constituency. That should not be permitted.</P>
    <P>The spatial plan contained in the national development plan makes it crazy to talk about town renewal. We do not know what areas will be designated as growth centres in the spatial plan. Everything has been turned on its head by this Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Gormley's comments about wanting families to move into the area. However, the record will show that the last point he made is that there are families living in apartment blocks in the area who are being supported by the health services. I admire independent thinking but it is abhorrent that intelligent people's thinking can be clouded by ideology. However, we will have to continue this debate on another occasion because I must make my contribution on the Bill before us.</P>
      <P>The urban renewal scheme from which a number of larger towns benefited in recent times was, undoubtedly, one of the most successful political innovations in the past 30 years. It gave towns which were badly affected by dereliction an inventive to improve their images. Any person who contests that view should visit some of the towns which were included under that scheme. People must be honest and admit that the scheme to which I refer was extremely effective. One of the most extraordinary things about the scheme was that it not only renewed the physical infrastructure and fabric of many towns, but it also highlighted the ingenuity, willingness and enterprise which exists in small communities.</P>
      <P>I was born in the town of Wexford which suffered more than its fair share of economic distress in the past. All of the town's major industrial concerns were undermined or downsized in one way or another because they could not keep pace with changes in the world market. When I attended secondary school in the 1960s, the major concern of every young person in Wexford town was whether they would obtain employment there and, as a result, remain in the community. The majority of people, including myself, who sat the leaving certificate in the 1960s left the town to seek work in Dublin or joined the great diaspora which left the country during that period.</P>
      <P>The urban renewal scheme helped to turn matters around in Wexford and other towns. More importantly, however, it helped to create a sense of confidence and pride among the members of many communities. I am not of the opinion that the scheme was a universal success. For example, two separate allocations were made to Bray under the urban renewal scheme but it did not develop in the same way as towns such as Ennis and Wexford where the relevant authorities were remarkably energetic in their use of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the difficulties we face with any scheme of this nature lies in achieving a balance between housing and sustainable development and good and bad architecture and to avoid, as Deputy <Col N="36" /> Higgins stated, repeating some of the nightmares which resulted from the seaside resorts scheme. I agree with the Deputy that the latter scheme went off the rails because it lacked proper focus.</P>
    <P>The scheme outlined in the Town Renewal Bill does not lack the proper focus. I do not care that what we are attempting to achieve is retrospective. Such matters will not be a source of concern to the towns and communities that will benefit from the scheme. However, what will matter is the way in which the provisions of the Bill will be put into effect. In that context, the first paragraph of the explanatory memorandum stresses that there is a need to focus on revitalising small towns. Despite the fact that they are situated close to Dublin, many of the small towns in my constituency have not benefited from the major economic upturn because they lack a critical mass or a centre of focus or because incentives have simply sucked capital out of them and moved it elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Many of the small towns in my constituency have suffered extraordinary dereliction. During the recent by-election campaign I spent time in Clonmel, which provides an extremely good example of what capitalist incentivisation can achieve. Clonmel is an extraordinary town and I am quite familiar with it because I visited it on many occasions when I was young. It is amazing to see how financial and taxation incentives can be extremely beneficial in terms of improving towns. The concept that we should focus on smaller towns, assist them to grow and develop and ensure they become commercial and social centres for the communities in their surrounding hinterlands is an ideal objective.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting the Bill is perfect in every regard and I am sure it will be improved by debate. However, the scheme outlined in the Bill, if it is applied imaginatively, will be of great benefit to small towns which have been left behind in the past ten or 15 years. There are many small towns in counties Wicklow and Kildare which, if they obtain the right type of incentives, will rise to the challenge and show their capacity to develop and improve.</P>
    <P>One aim of the scheme is to ensure the towns to which I refer will become social and commercial centres, not dormitories. I am concerned about one aspect of the scheme. We must ensure a balance is achieved in this regard and that dormitory towns are not allowed to develop. Wicklow County Council has designated Baltinglass, Tinahely, Carnew, Dunlavin and Rathdrum for consideration by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. I ask the Department to accept local wisdom on this occasion, to apply, in principle and in spirit, the concept of subsidiarity, to accept that the local authority has submitted good schemes in respect of these towns and to avoid the centralist or <i>l'état c'est moi</i> attitude displayed by Departments which states that &ldquo;We do it better than you can possibly do it out there in the sticks&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There are elements of the schemes I would like <Col N="37" /> to see improved. However, the towns in question were selected by Wicklow County Council following a long period of debate. I wish to refer to three towns in particular, namely, Baltinglass, Tinahely and Carnew, which are on the periphery of the greater Dublin commuter belt. Baltinglass, for example, is a thriving town but it has at its centre a great deal of dereliction and it would benefit immensely from the scheme. It is the kind of town where a mixture of residential and commercial development would help to form a critical mass and this, in turn, would help to underpin the centrality of that town for communities in the surrounding hinterland and assist it to regain some of its past splendours. A number of innovative proposals have been put forward by members of the community in Baltinglass. By and large, these have been incorporated with the unanimous approval of all sides in the county council.</P>
    <P>The town of Baltinglass is a classic example of a small Irish town. It has a remarkable and long history. In the 12th century, it boasted two Members of the very first Irish Parliament and had two MPs up until the 18th century. In spite of its illustrious history, the town has been bypassed and there are pockets of dereliction within it which the scheme could help to remedy. The most significant point in Baltinglass's favour is that it already has a critical mass which could be expanded to build on the town's economic might and capacities. Towns such as Baltinglass, Tinahely, Carnew, Rathdrum and Dunlavin could become centres in their own rights rather than the mere commuter villages we witnessed in the 1970s.</P>
    <P>Baltinglass fulfils all of the sustainable development criteria as do Tinahely and Carnew. I do not want to appear excessively parochial but Tinahely and Carnew are very important shopping centres and have a long history of interconnectedness with the surrounding rural hinterland and agricultural community. The towns also have within them small but significant central areas which, if they are to be renewed, require an incentive. Dunlavin, Rathnew and Rathdrum are well chosen as they are within the commuter belt and are beginning to feel the pressure of commuter building. When the departmental officials come to the stage of implementing the scheme, they will see that the local communities and the local authorities have invested a great deal of effort into choosing the areas for renewal.</P>
    <P>There is a particular issue about which I am concerned in regard to the Bill. Irrespective of how laudable the scheme may be, real planning problems are beginning to be experienced in Wicklow, Kildare and Meath. I am sure Deputy Dukes will bear that out. Population dynamics have resulted in people being shoved out into these counties and we now have a planning crisis, certainly in County Wicklow. I appeal to the Minister and the Government to realise that the adventurous development proposed in this legislation can only be fulfilled if local authorities <Col N="38" /> have the necessary planning staff. We do not have such staff in Wicklow and I am sure the same applies to other counties peripheral to Dublin.</P>
    <P>The serious problem of planning capacity must be addressed. Otherwise, any development which comes on stream will be developer-led and will not have the social mix required to revitalise towns. In that situation, developments would be led by profit rather than community motives and that would fulfil the gloomy prognosis outlined by the two previous speakers, particularly Deputy Higgins who seems to believe that the red flag is about to be hoisted in every town and village in the country. God forbid.</P>
    <P>We have a planning problem in the greater Dublin area. While there has been massive investment in infrastructure, we now need to invest in human capital. Local authorities, as currently structured, staffed and funded, are not capable of playing the necessary proactive role in this regard. We had to engage private consultants when the development plans for towns in County Wicklow were being drawn up and, to be fair to them, they did a very good job. When I see the planning chaos which faces us at every second and third Monday at planning meetings in County Wicklow, I am fearful that local authorities do not have the capacity to address the problem. We can pass all manner of Bills and introduce all manner of tax incentives but they will not have any effect unless we invest heavily in planning staff, particularly in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>When the schemes under this Bill come into operation, I urge the Department to ensure that shared ownership schemes, affordable housing initiatives and the 20% social housing requirement will be rigidly observed. In regard to some of the smaller towns and villages in County Wicklow &ndash; and I am sure this is true of Kildare and Meath too &ndash; there is a very real danger that single class ghettos will be built. I want to draw the Minister's attention to an appalling reality. In some of the smaller towns and villages which are regarded by investors as very desirable addresses, small estates are being built behind fences and gates. I hoped never to see that type of development occurring here. The last time I saw such development was in Dallas many years ago where small townships were built up behind gates on the outskirts of the city. People living in such developments cannot become part of an integrated, developed and balanced community in any sense.</P>
    <P>This is an excellent scheme but the necessary human capital must be provided within local authorities in order for its objectives to be realised. I compliment the Minister and I certainly do not share Deputy Higgins's concerns that the Bill provides for a retrospective approval element. Obviously, from his point of view, it would be better if we did everything differently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions to this debate. Tax incentive based renewal schemes focused on the improvement of urban and large environments have been in operation for some 14 years and we can safely say that their benefits are clear to all. The impact of successive urban renewal schemes on the transformation of the inner city areas of our larger towns and cities, blighted by dereliction and decay over many decades, is not in dispute.</P>
      <P>There is now a well established consensus, which was reflected in the debate, that the schemes have been critically instrumental in kick-starting the process of attracting investment, underpinning the revitalisation of deprived areas and rebuilding communities. It is entirely appropriate that this tried and trusted approach should be applied, albeit in a different way, to our smaller towns to ensure they can exploit the potential on offer, in the process ensuring their attractiveness as places in which people can live and work into the future.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes, whose contribution was in marked contrast to the more measured response of other Deputies, including one of his party colleagues, waxed cynical about the sustainability, spatial planning and integrated dimensions of the scheme outlined by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, when he introduced the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The standard definition of sustainable development which is used internationally describes it as development which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of <Col N="40" /> future generations to meet their own needs. If that is not about people and catering for their needs, I do not know what is. Deputy Dukes could have taken the trouble to read the guidelines for the scheme and the document, Sustainable Development &ndash; A Strategy for Ireland, which was produced by the previous Government of which he was a Member. That document called for the continued development of policies to bring redundant and derelict sites and buildings back into active use. It also identified a more integrated approach to the physical, economic and social revitalisation of urban areas, flexibility in the application of planning policies to encourage a better mix of activities, encouraging the use of upper storeys for residential purposes, the conversion of outmoded buildings to new uses, making optimum use of existing infrastructural capacity and a partnership approach involving broad consultation.</P>
    <P>There are also obvious benefits in the area of transport, energy conservation and dividends to be obtained from the promotion of living in revitalised towns where people can find employment and a place to live. Deputy Dukes can hardly complain if the policies contained in the document are now being integrated by the Government into programmes and schemes in line with that strategy.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Dukes had taken the trouble to read the report on the scope and delivery of the national spatial strategy published by my Department recently and circulated to all Members of the House, he might have demonstrated better understanding of the strategy's objectives and the range of challenges and issues it will address.</P>
    <P>Within its overall objective of promoting balanced regional development, the national spatial strategy will identify where balance and sustainable urban growth are feasible. It will also set out a basis for the future development of small urban centres with links to major urban centres and rural hinterlands. The strategy will also offer a development strategy which seeks to create positive linkages between town and country and promote self-sustaining rural and village communities. It will be built on the premise that all our cities, towns, villages and rural areas must be given equality of opportunity to reach their potential in terms of economic, social and cultural development. In that context, we should welcome an initiative such as the town renewal scheme which is specifically aimed at enhancing the future economic and social role of many small towns throughout the country. The national spatial strategy and town renewal scheme share many objectives. I cannot agree that proceeding to implement the scheme now is prejudicial to the outcome of the spatial strategy.</P>
    <P>I was taken aback by Deputy Dukes's onslaught on the arrangements which have been made for extensive participation in the preparation of the national spatial strategy by local and regional authorities, community groups, social partners, Departments, semi-State bodies, <Col N="41" /> sectoral interests and individual citizens. I see widespread participation at the various stages of the strategy's preparation as being of central importance in ensuring that the strategy is relevant to people's real needs. Developing a high degree of ownership among the various interests affected by spatial planning initiatives is also vital to the strategy's successful completion and implementation. The strategy has the potential profoundly to alter the way Ireland develops over the next 20 years. It is only right, therefore, in an era of social partnership that as many people, groups and organisations as possible should be given an opportunity to make a contribution to its preparation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes is also wide of the mark in his comments on housing output and his comments reflected a misunderstanding as to how the tax incentive system will operate. The scheme follows a similar model to that adopted for the urban renewal scheme which was initiated by the previous Government. The guidelines for the scheme are heavily focused on refurbishment of existing buildings, which should produce a significant contribution to housing supply. In terms of the number of towns benefiting, this is the broadest based tax incentive scheme to date. Tax incentives will not be applied willy-nilly across the entire area covered by a town renewal plan, rather will they be targeted at the areas and buildings of greatest need and potential. As in the case of the urban renewal scheme, these targeted sites will act as catalysts, encouraging investment in derelict areas of the designated towns.</P>
    <P>Focusing on the cost to the Exchequer of the scheme, as Deputy Dukes has done, paints a distorted picture. The designations announced under the current urban renewal scheme were entirely based on the recommendations of local authorities as modified by the expert panel. Deputy Dukes's exaggerated description of the role of the Minister for Finance should be seen against this background. It is appropriate that the main focus, both in selecting towns and making recommendations, should rest with county councils. Under the reformed local government system, county councils have a pivotal role in developing their areas. County councils are sometimes criticised for not behaving responsibly. To act responsibly one must be given responsibility and I know county councils rose to this challenge exceptionally well, as Deputy Penrose pointed out in relation to his own county.</P>
    <P>A total of 223 eligible towns were identified. County councils were then required to select the towns for which town renewal plans were to be prepared under the first phase of the scheme. This selection process was carried out by reference to a formula based on a number of eligible towns in the county. This resulted in the selection of 102 towns and plans have been submitted for these. The guidelines make it clear that the scheme will run for three years and consideration will be given to extending it to other eligible towns in future phases of the scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="42" /> Deputies made valid points concerning the dangers of uniformity and repetitiveness in planning design, street furniture and so on. The scheme is expressly designed to restore, consolidate and improve the built fabric of the targeted towns. The preparation of a town renewal plan is specifically required to be prepared having regard to the unique historical, social and architectural character of the individual town and its geographical context. Detailed guidance on the essential elements of townscape have been provided to assist planners in this task.</P>
    <P>In the context of guiding public taste, Deputies will be aware of the national tidy towns competition administered by my Department and its significance in small towns the length and breadth of Ireland. The competition is regarded as a conduit for values relating to the built and natural environments and competitors are provided with detailed advice on the importance of relying on the unique features of their own circumstances rather than slavishly adopting external solutions, whether in plantings, shop fronts or street furniture. As confidence is built up in the native heritage, I am confident this will be reflected in the design features of our urban landscape.</P>
    <P>Town renewal plans have been prepared in the context of the proper planning and development of the areas in question. The guidelines issued on this specified that plans would be expected to address established built-up areas which the statutory development plan had identified as obsolete, derelict or in need of rejuvenation. I expect that the preparation of plans will have been undertaken in the context of the local area plans.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred to the sense of uncertainty that may arise given the need to seek EU approval for a portion of the incentives. There is no uncertainty with regard to any of the incentives for residential development as these are not subject to EU approval. With regard to commercial incentives, they will have to be approved by the EU Commission. Having regard to the fact that the commercial incentives proposed are similar to those which the EU Commission has approved for the current urban renewal scheme, I am confident they will be accepted by the Commission. As was the case with the urban renewal scheme, we intend to announce the designations next month and proceed with the implementation of the residential incentives initially. The introduction of the commercial incentives will be deferred until the necessary EU approval is obtained. Legislative provision for the various incentives is contained in this year's Finance Act.</P>
    <P>The expert advisory panel comprises seven members and is made up of people with relevant expertise and experience. The role of the panel is similar to that which operated for the urban renewal scheme. It is our intention to publicise the minutes of the expert panel meetings together with their report when the designations are announced next month. We want the panel's deliberations to be carried out in a transparent <Col N="43" /> manner, as happened with the urban renewal scheme where all of this information was posted on the Department's website on the day of the announcement, an initiative which was widely welcomed at the time.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Naughten's comments on Monksland, this land is within the urban area of Athlone which is already benefiting under the urban renewal scheme and would not qualify for inclusion in the new scheme. I note the Deputy's point on residential density. If properly implemented, the residential guidelines will deliver an increased supply of housing from existing land and infrastructure. I agree that quality design is vital in the context of increased density and I am anxious to ensure the best possible design is applied in implementing these guidelines.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ulick Burke referred to restrictions placed on planning applications. The process of drawing up and adopting a development plan is a transparent process open to comments from interested parties. Our courthouses and many other publicly owned buildings are not targeted under this renewal scheme which is a tax incentive scheme where construction and refurbishment costs are offset against tax liability. A wide range of conservation measures are in place to ensure conservation of our built heritage. Many privately owned buildings are included for designation in the plans submitted and the scheme will make a major contribution to conservation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brendan Daly referred to rates remission. There is nothing sinister in this. EU approval is required for all non-residential incentives. Difficulties arose with the EU Commission relating to the application of two reliefs which are operated in the Custom House docks areas and under previous urban renewal schemes. These incentives were the double rent allowance and the rates remission. The EU Commission regards these incentives as operating State aids and contrary to EU treaty laws on trade between member states. As a result of the EU decision in relation to these, the incentives that have been discontinued impact on the provisions in the existing urban renewal legislation, which could not be implemented.</P>
    <P>I thank all the contributors to this debate. When we announced our intention to introduce this new scheme, we came under considerable pressure to get the scheme up and running as quickly as possible. We are all anxious to get it under way and I am satisfied the approach taken was sensible and pragmatic in the overall circumstances. That was the basis for proceeding as we did in advance of the legislation being passed. There are plenty of precedents for our actions. I emphasise the potential of this scheme to bring about significant changes and improvements, not just for the communities in the targeted towns but for the community as a whole. The process of <Col N="44" /> examining the plans is now well advanced and we hope to announce the designations next month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), to delete line 37, and in page 4, to delete lines 1 and 2.</P>
      <P>I am sorry for the Minister of State, that he was sent in here to try to defend things the other Minister of State said at the beginning of the debate. If the Minister of State would care to look back at my remarks, he will find that my criticisms were directed principally at the overblown language used by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, and at some of the technical aspects of the Bill. I notice there is still no answer from the Minister of State on how many of the 102 towns listed in the press release will benefit from a designation.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 concerns one of the features that runs through this Bill &ndash; the element of arbitrariness. The provision which Deputy Gilmore and I propose to delete is one which simply sets out arbitrarily, without any explanation, to exclude towns in County Dublin from the benefit of this scheme. There may be an argument for doing it, but the argument needs to be made. Why, for example, exclude Balbriggan, Skerries, Rush, Lusk, The Naul, Dalkey, Stepaside, Ballybrack, Shankill and even Clondalkin. They are all excluded and every one of them, as I know from my childhood, was and still is a town with an identifiable centre, an identifiable entity. The same can be said of Clondalkin and Glasthule, and it can certainly be said of Skerries and of Balbriggan.</P>
      <P>Why exclude those from the provisions of this Bill? Why exclude the potential to support a community and the development of a community in the way that this Bill sets out to do in towns countrywide? I have no idea. This element of arbitrariness runs all through this Bill. It is arbitrary in the way the selection is made. The Minister of State has objected to my exaggeration of the role of the Minister for Finance. I tabled an amendment for later on which perhaps the Minister of State could accept, that would remove the arbitrariness of the role of the Minister for Finance in this and that would respect subsidiarity, which the Minister has now discovered.</P>
      <P>The provisions of this Bill, the arbitrariness of which is illustrated in section 1, give a totally arbitrary role to the Minister for Finance in these designations. Having invited local authorities to do the job for which the Minister of State rightly commended him, he takes all decisions out of their hands as to which towns will be designated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="45" /> I invite the Minister of State to accept amendment No. 1 and to signal that he accepts the other amendments tabled in Deputy Gilmore's name and mine, intended to remove the arbitrary character of this Bill.</P>

      <P>We have until just 1.30 p.m. I regret that we do not have a longer period to have a proper Committee Stage debate on this Bill and, in particular, this amendment. There is no excuse for excluding the entire area of County Dublin in this Bill. As Deputy Dukes says, there are many towns in Dublin which would benefit from a town renewal scheme. We should stop defining towns as constructions which are surrounded by countryside. There are such things as urban towns. Deputy Dukes identified some of them there as I did on Second Stage, such as Ballybrack, Shankill, Cabinteely, Cornelscourt, Glasthule, Balbriggan, Newcastle and Clondalkin. These are all towns which would benefit from the town renewal scheme.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State in the limited time available to include Dublin again in this Bill. The provision taking Dublin out of this Bill is an attack by this Government on Dublin and the towns of Dublin. It should be discontinued and Dublin should be included in this scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>This scheme is specifically designed to promote the physical renewal of smaller towns with a heavy focus on residential development in run down areas thus revitalising them as living communities. I am confident that selective application of the incentives to the smaller towns will have the desired effect. Towns in the counties specified in this section as drafted are suburban in character due to their close proximity to Dublin city and attract many people who commute to the city. Land and house prices are indicative of the already high demand for housing in these sectors. The Government is satisfied there is no need for special incentives for the area. In these circumstances, I regret it is not possible to accept this amendment.</P>

Instead of saying &ldquo;not exceed 6,000&rdquo;, we should state &ldquo;approximately 6,000&rdquo;. In other words, 6,000 should be a guideline rather than an absolute limit. It is nonsensical that if a town has a population of 6,050 it does not qualify under the scheme. A form of approximation should be used rather than absolute limits which can create anomalies.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to present the Bill to the House. When enacted, it will replace the temporary legislation in this area, the Firearms (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1998, which came into effect on 14 July 1998 and which will cease to operate on 14 July 2000. The Bill provides for the amendment of the provisions of section 3 of the Firearms Act, 1925, governing the granting of firearm certificates to persons ordinarily resident outside the State, whether for hunting or sporting purposes or for shooting species where such shooting is not prohibited by law, for example, vermin, or for other purposes. It also amends the Wildlife Act, 1976, primarily in regard to the granting of hunting licences for persons ordinarily resident outside the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 3(2) of the Firearms Act, 1925, the granting of firearm certificates to non-residents is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Under Section 29(2) of the Wildlife Act, 1976, a non-resident who wishes to hunt protected or exempted wild ani<Col N="47" /> mals or protected wild birds in Ireland must obtain a separate licence to hunt from the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. There are two types of licences to hunt, a licence to hunt exempted wild mammals other than hares &ndash; in practical terms this means deer &ndash; and a licence to hunt protected wild birds and hares.</P>
    <P>A firearm certificate will not be issued to a non-resident applicant who intends to hunt unless he or she has been granted a licence to hunt from the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, whether it authorises the hunting of deer or protected wild birds and hares. The position of residents of the State differs in that, under section 3(1) of the Firearms Act, 1925, the issue of firearm certificates to residents is a matter for the local Garda superintendent in the area in which the applicant resides. As in the case of non-residents, a resident who wishes to hunt protected wild mammals other than hares must satisfy An Garda Síochána that he or she is the holder of a current licence to so hunt from the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands before he or she can get a firearm certificate. However, under section 29(5) of the Wildlife Act, 1976, the superintendent can grant a combined firearm certificate/hunting licence to a resident who wishes to hunt hares or protected wild birds.</P>
    <P>The Bill amends the provisions of the Firearms Act, 1925 to allow the Garda authorities, after an initial transitional period during which the Minister will continue to be responsible, to grant firearm certificates to non-residents for hunting or sporting purposes and to process those applications in a similar way to the arrangements which apply in the case of residents of the State. For the first time, a combined firearm certificate/hunting licence will be available to non-residents for the purpose of hunting hares or protected wild birds. A separate hunting licence from the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands will still be required for non-residents who wish to hunt deer as is the case for residents of the State at present.</P>
    <P>The Wildlife Act, 1976, is amended by the insertion of a new section 29, provided for in section 4 of this legislation, to allow this new scheme for non-residents to operate. The new scheme, when fully operational after the initial transitional period, will establish a level playing field in the matter of the granting of hunting licences to residents and non-residents alike with some minor modifications to reflect the different position of non-residents.</P>
    <P>For instance, many non-resident hunters only come here for short periods and may not return for several years, if ever, unlike residents who are entitled to hunt here for entire seasons and possess their firearms throughout the years. Non-residents, like residents, will have to be 16 years or over to obtain a firearm certificate, will only be able to use the firearm for the purposes specified and can have their certificates revoked for, among other reasons, failure to comply with the <Col N="48" /> limitations as to use and will have to comply with the obligations under the Wildlife Acts to get a hunting licence.</P>
    <P>As Members will be aware from the debate on the Firearms (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1998, the background to the Bill is that the High Court decided on 12 June 1998 following a judicial review sought by the National Association of Regional Game Councils, which represents domestic shooters, that the procedures adopted to enable the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to discharge adequately the obligations imposed by the Firearms Act, 1925, in granting firearm certificates to non-resident hunters were ineffective and insufficient. The High Court found also that the procedures followed by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in granting hunting licences to non-residents, which they must first obtain to be granted firearm certificates, were also ineffective and insufficient. The effect of the judgment was that both Ministers were precluded from issuing hunting licences and the consequential firearm certificates to non-residents. The granting of licences and firearm certificates ceased with effect from the date of the judgment.</P>
    <P>As time did not permit an extensive overhaul of the Firearms Act, 1925, having regard to the fact that the Dáil was due to go into recess on 2 July 1998, I decided that a two stage response was essential to deal with the matters raised by the High Court judgment. First, I decided that the public interest required that interim legislation should be introduced as quickly as possible to enable hunting licences/firearm certificates to be granted and to protect the State against potential liabilities. The interim legislation, the Firearms (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1998, came into effect on 14 July 1998.</P>
    <P>Second, I decided to establish a review group comprising representatives of the relevant Departments, the Garda and the relevant interest groups to examine the implications of the judgment generally for the granting of firearms certificates to non-residents. The group was charged with bringing forward proposals in this sensitive but complicated area following a full review, having taken account of the views of the major sectional interests involved. The group reported in November 1998 and its report formed the basis for the preparation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The main recommendation of the firearms legislation review group was that the Firearms Acts should be amended to provide for the granting of firearm certificates to non-residents by the Garda authorities which is also the authority that grants firearm certificates to residents. The group recommended that for the first two years the legislation was in force there would be a parallel right to apply to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Thereafter, such firearms certificates would not be granted by the Minister &ldquo;except where circumstances warranted it&rdquo;. The group's report admitted that recommendation was less than ideal but that it would ensure that <Col N="49" /> tourism interests were not damaged. It also recommended that the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands should include a provision in the Wildlife Bill, &ldquo;whereby firearm certificates will be deemed to be hunting licences also.&rdquo; In addition, the review group recommended that the certificates be granted for a period of one year and that the combined hunting licence and firearm certificate should specify the lands available to the tourists for shooting purposes.</P>
    <P>While I accepted the main recommendation of the review group, that the Firearms Acts should be amended to provide for the granting of firearm certificates to non-residents by the Garda superintendent in charge of the district visited, I was concerned that the recommendation for two parallel routes for applicants, the Minister and the Garda Síochána, could give rise to administrative difficulties and confusion and, therefore, prove to be impracticable. I was also concerned about the essentially open-ended aspect of the recommendation whereby, even after the two year transitional period, applications might still be made to the Minister in certain unidentified circumstances.</P>
    <P>My proposal, therefore, is for a slightly different and more clearcut arrangement under which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will continue, on a transitional basis, to grant certificates to non-resident shooters for a further two years after which period the granting of firearm certificates in such cases will be a matter for An Garda Síochána. However, this is qualified by a provision under which any time after the commencement of the legislation in July, the Minister may, by order, relinquish that function to the Garda. This I would do if I was satisfied that the Garda Síochána was organisationally ready to assume full responsibility for granting firearm certificates for hunting and sporting purposes to foreign shooters.</P>
    <P>An amendment of the Wildlife Act, 1976, will allow firearm certificates issued to non-residents for the purpose, <i>inter alia</i>, of hunting hares or protected wild birds, to be deemed to be hunting licences for the purpose of the Wildlife Acts, that is, it will provide for a combined firearm certificate/hunting licence to issue in these cases as already applies in the case of residents of the State, as soon as the Garda Síochána assumes responsibility for the grant of firearm certificates to non-resident shooters.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides in section 2(7) that a firearm certificate will operate from the date of its commencement until the next following 31 July, which is the date on which hunting licences expire, or for such shorter period as may be specified in the certificate.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the other main provisions of the Bill, it is important to emphasise that, in practical terms, the provisions of the Bill do not change the procedures which have been followed for some years under different Governments in <Col N="50" /> granting firearm certificates to non-residents. While the Bill does propose to amend the statutory provisions governing the limitations and restrictions for the granting of firearm certificates to non-residents, in real terms it gives effect to the existing procedures in recognition of the fact that the statutory obligations were, prior to the 1998 Temporary Provisions Act, in practice, difficult to meet and, in some instances, impossible.</P>
    <P>In the granting of firearm certificates to non-residents, regard has always been had to the preservation of the public safety and the peace. This was always the overriding consideration. The measures proposed in the Bill will in no way change this. In fact, two additional restrictive measures are introduced. These are in section 2(10), which allows the issuing person to attach conditions to a firearm certificate, and also in section 2(13), where provision is made to allow the issuing person to revoke a firearm certificate where he or she is of the opinion that the holder of the certificate cannot, without danger to the public safety or to the peace, be permitted to have a firearm in his or her possession or that he or she is using, or has used, such firearm for purposes not authorised by the certificate or has contravened a condition attaching to the firearm certificate. These are new permanent provisions. Up to now there has been no provision in permanent legislation permitting the attachment of conditions to, or for the revocation of, a firearm certificate granted to a non-resident.</P>
    <P>I also want to emphasise that the policy, which in the main has been in existence since 1972, of restricting the granting of firearm certificates to certain categories of firearms, is not changed by this Bill. That policy, which is among the most restrictive in Europe, provides that firearm certificates will only be granted for shotguns and rifles in certain limited categories. I am currently reviewing certain aspects of this policy, but that is not a matter covered by this Bill.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from what might be described as new restrictions, the Bill provides in section 2(8) that, before granting a firearm certificate, the issuing person, whether it be the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform during the transitional period, or the Garda authorities, shall be of the opinion that the application is bona fide and that there is no good reason to refuse to grant the certificate. For the purpose of establishing that there is no good reason for refusing a firearm certificate, the issuing person may seek evidence of a European firearms pass, where the applicant is resident in an EU member state, or any other documents relevant to firearms issued by an appropriate body outside the State. Or, indeed, the issuing person may make such inquiries as he or she considers appropriate. Such inquiries could be made to the Garda Síochána in the transitional period, or to other police forces, if it is considered necessary to do that to determine suitability in any particular case.</P>
    <P>The European firearms pass is a document which is issued by the authorities of a member <Col N="51" /> state of the EU to a person lawfully entering into possession of, and using, a firearm. The pass contains information about the holder's identity and is a non-transferrable document on which are entered details of the firearm or firearms possessed and used by the holder of the pass. The pass is required to be always in the possession of the person using the firearm and changes in the possession or characteristics of the firearms must be indicated on the pass, as well as the loss or theft of a firearm.</P>
    <P>In the interests of further improving public safety, section 3 of the Bill makes it an offence to give false information when making an application for a firearm certificate, or to alter a certificate with intent to deceive, or to use a certificate with intent to deceive. Those offences are punishable by a fine of up to £10,000 or imprisonment for up to five years, or both. Any other problems with firearm misuse by a non-resident can effectively be dealt with by the enforcement of existing firearm legislation in the same way as it applies to residents of the State. This new provision along with other provisions will ensure that the scheme I am putting in place will be among the most stringent and restrictive in Europe.</P>
    <P>In summary, this Bill maintains our traditionally strict controls over the use and possession of firearms by non-residents while safeguarding the jobs and incomes of those engaged in our tourist industry and rural economy generally. The Bill does not lessen the measures taken to safeguard the public safety and the peace; all checks previously undertaken will continue in force. In addition, two additional permanent safeguards have been introduced &ndash; the power to add conditions to certificates and the power to revoke them.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I hope that the proposals contained in this significant and somewhat technical Bill will meet with the approval of all Deputies. I commend the Bill to the House. It is appropriate for me now to hand over to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, who will deal with the wildlife provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to support my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, in presenting to the House the Firearms (Firearm Certificates for Non-Residents) Bill, 2000. The Bill amends both the Firearms Act, 1925, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and the Wildlife Act, 1976, which is my responsibility. Our two Departments have, therefore, collaborated on the preparation of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation will implement a valuable rationalisation of the arrangements for the licensing of hunting with firearms and will improve the co-ordination between the authorisation of the possession of firearms, which falls to my col<Col N="52" /> league, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and licensing of the hunting of wild species, which comes within my remit as the Minister responsible for wildlife conservation.</P>
    <P>At present, anyone wishing to hunt protected wild species in Ireland requires both a hunting licence for the relevant species under the Wildlife Acts, 1976, and a firearm certificate under the Firearms Act, 1925. Those who wish to hunt exempted wild animals &ndash; deer in effect &ndash; must first apply to my Department for a licence to hunt this species and, having obtained it, go to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for a firearms certificate.</P>
    <P>Those ordinarily resident in the State and non-residents are treated in the same way. This Bill will make no change to these arrangements. However, it is proposed to change the arrangements that apply to non-residents who wish to hunt protected wild birds and hares. As of now, persons ordinarily resident in the State may apply to the Garda Síochána for a firearm certificate which the Garda endorses so that it can also serve as a hunting licence.</P>
    <P>Those ordinarily resident outside the State first apply to my Department for a hunting licence and then apply to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for a firearm certificate. This Bill will change that procedure.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that for a maximum period of two years from when this legislation is passed, all applications for firearm certificates from non-residents will continue to be processed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. During this period, non-resident hunters will also require a hunting licence from my Department. This system will continue in relation to deer. However, in relation to protected wild birds and hares, there will, after two years, be a complete handover to the Garda, which will issue firearm certificates to residents, as is already the case, and to non-residents.</P>
    <P>These certificates will be endorsed to also serve as hunting licences in the case of resident and non-resident hunters. The two year interim period will allow the Garda to prepare appropriate systems and procedures for performing the functions that will ultimately fall to it regarding non-residents while ensuring an efficient service continues to be provided to all hunters.</P>
    <P>In addition to the changes I have outlined, I wish to deal with other aspects of section 4. For example, the Bill continues the position already provided for under the Wildlife Act, 1976, where, in considering an application for a hunting licence, regard must be had to the conservation requirements of the species to be hunted.</P>
    <P>As will be the case with firearm certificates, hunting licences may be granted only to non-residents where the applicant is bona fide and where there is no good reason to refuse. In this context, a European firearms pass in the case of an EU resident or, in any other case, a permit, licence, authorisation or other document issued by an appropriate authority that I, as Minister, consider <Col N="53" /> acceptable will constitute satisfactory evidence of suitability. I may also make such inquiries or request such information as is considered necessary to assess the suitability of an applicant. An applicant who has been refused a licence may appeal the decision to the courts whose decision shall be final and binding.</P>
    <P>A number of amendments are included that had already been separately proposed in the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, 1999. These include powers to enable me, as Minister, if I think fit, to require the payment of fees for hunting licences; a specific provision allowing for the attachment of conditions to such licences; and an enabling provision to allow for the introduction, by way of regulations, of a requirement for the tagging of captured or killed wild animals or wild birds. This is particularly relevant to the hunting of deer. I am delighted to join my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in commending the Bill to the House.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> The late arrival of this legislation is yet another example of the Government's tardiness in meeting deadlines for delivering long promised legislation. On 2 July, the House dealt with all Stages of the Firearms (Temporary Provisions) Bill, 1998. As the Minister said, it was an emergency measure for one year only, designed to allow the issuing of firearms certificates to foreign visitors coming to Ireland for shooting holidays. While there was a time limit of one year on the Bill, luckily there was also provision for a further 12 months extension.</P>
      <P>One would imagine that, having consulted the various bodies and interested parties involved, it should have been possible to publish the resultant Bill in good time. However, typically, the Bill was published on 13 June, less than three weeks in advance of the deadline beyond which it would not have been possible for 4,000 tourist shooters to come to Ireland because of the lapsing of the temporary legislation. As with that legislation, we are expected to rush this Bill through the House and deal with all Stages on the same day. The Bill could, and should, have been published months ago to enable proper and detailed consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The origin of the legislation was a successful High Court challenge, as the Minister said, which was brought by the National Association of Regional Game Councils against the manner in which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands had discharged their respective responsibilities imposed on them by the Firearms Act, 1925, and the Wildlife Act, 1976. In a withering 35 page judgment, Mr. Jus<Col N="54" /> tice Quirke delivered a damning denunciation of both Ministers.</P>
    <P>The Firearms Act, 1925, sets down exactly the same conditions for non-resident applicants for firearms certificates as for Irish citizens. In particular, section 8(1) of the 1925 Act sets down seven different categories of persons who are disentitled to hold firearms certificates. The High Court found that the sensible requirements and safeguards of the 1925 Act were being largely ignored. Instead of a proper check on the credentials and suitability of applicants, as required by law, the National Parks and Wildlife Service simply submitted to officials of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform the name and address of the non-resident applicant and a description of the person's firearms whereupon a firearms certificate and a hunting licence were issued.</P>
    <P>Both Ministers maintained that public safety was well served by the manner in which the system operated. However, it was clear from Mr. Justice Quirke's comments that he did not share the Ministers' views. In his judgment, he was specific that nobody, either national or non-resident, should be permitted to have in his or her possession, use or carry a firearm or ammunition without an inquiry or investigation into the suitability of that person. There was no such investigation into the suitability of the person applying in the case of non-residents. I pointed out that such carelessness in respect of the possession of lethal weapons was reckless and irresponsible.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not meet the strict requirements of section 8 of the 1925 Act. However, I acknowledge that it goes some way towards introducing an element of inquiry regarding the applicant's suitability. An application form must be completed which requires certain information to be furnished. The Garda superintendent or the Minister shall satisfy himself as to the bona fides of the applicant. A European firearms pass can be required of an EU national or, in the case of a non-EU national, a permit, licence, document or authorisation issued by the appropriate licensing authority within the applicant's state.</P>
    <P>The Minister or superintendent may make inquiries as he or she considers necessary regarding the suitability of the applicant. The Minister or the superintendent may attach such conditions as he or she considers necessary. I am reluctant to accept that these new requirements are adequate or meet the required standard. It would be preferable and possible to put in place exactly the same requirements contained in the 1925 Act. There are too many instances of &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in the Bill. However, I am prepared to support the Bill, but its operation should be monitored closely to see how it is being enforced and implemented. I also ask the Minister to outline what checking processes exist to ensure that non-residents who bring guns into the country bring them out again when they depart.</P>
    <P>Why was the Minister not consulted before the Garda Síochána issued a directive last week to <Col N="55" /> change the security arrangements for the safe keeping of guns whereby specially designed steel cabinets are required? I acknowledge that the directive is well intentioned but it appears to be illegal and unconstitutional. The directive seeks to change the law and, as Members are aware, the Garda cannot change the law; only the Oireachtas can do so. The directive also discriminates between different categories within the State and treats non-resident EU citizens more favourably than Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that proper legal advice was not sought in advance of the issuing of the directive. Perhaps the Minister could clarify if it is the case that the advice of the Attorney General was sought only after the directive had been issued. What is the view of the Attorney General on the validity of this directive? Apart from its legality and constitutionality, it is also obvious that there was a marked lack of clear thinking in the manner in which the directive was drafted and presented. The original directive from the Assistant Garda Commissioner stated that it would apply to all applicants for firearms certificates from 1 July next. However, the Garda press release modified the requirements, stating that all new applicants must have the security safe in place in just over eight days, on 1 July 2000, while the date for existing licensees is 1 July 2001.</P>
    <P>The directive specifies that certain categories of guns must be kept in a special steel cabinet constructed of sheet steel not less than two millimetres thick. All seams must be continuously welded. Hinges must be internally fixed and, depending on the height of the cabinet, two such locks may be required. Fastenings must be by way of Rawl bolts and expansion bolts to brick and stone and screws and bolts to roof and floor joists. Consideration must be taken of the load bearing capacity of the floor. Locations near central heating ducts or chimney stacks should be avoided. The work must be carried out to the satisfaction of the divisional crime prevention officer.</P>
    <P>It is a pity the gardaí did not consult the Minister and the Department who would probably have been advised that the directive is fraught with difficulty in terms of its legality, constitutionality and practicality and that it does not have a legal standing. The legal problems may be summarised as follows. The Firearms Act does not give the Garda Síochána an authority to implement the provisions of the directive as a requirement or precedent to obtain a firearms licence. Section 8 of the Act sets out the categories of persons who create a new category of disentitled person, that is, those persons who have not installed a gun safe. This is an amendment to the Firearms Act and a complete misinterpretation of section 4(<i>b</i>). Any amendment to an Act can only be effected by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The directive is discriminatory in that it will be applied to new entrants for firearms licences this year and will apply to existing licence holders one <Col N="56" /> year later. The provisions of the Firearms Act applies equally to all applicants without discrimination and, therefore, both categories of applicants are entitled to be treated equally by the legislation under the Constitution. The implementation of the directive will be contrary to European law as non-resident EU citizens will be treated differently from Irish citizens in so far as the assistant commissioners' directive applies to non-Irish EU citizens and non-EU citizens.</P>
    <P>The requirement by the Garda Síochána to enter homes and inspect the installation of the gun safe requires each applicant to give a waiver of his or her constitutional rights to the inviolability of the home or to Article 40.5 of the Constitution. The home of an Irish citizen cannot be entered by the Garda Síochána save in accordance with the law. Under Irish family law a husband and wife equally hold joint ownership of the family home. A husband, therefore, cannot waive his wife's right under the Constitution to the inviolability of the home.</P>
    <P>Large sections of Irish society live in rented accommodation. A firearms licence holder living in rented accommodation may not have sufficient proprietary interest in the property to allow it to be inspected by the Garda Síochána. A landlord, for example, may not wish to give his authority to have his property inspected by the gardaí. In addition, a tenant or leaseholder will in all probability be precluded from an installation of a permanent fixture or any modification of the rented premises under standard covenants in letting or lease agreements. In such a situation, the implementation of the assistant commissioner's directive would discriminate against such applicants or licence holders.</P>
    <P>For the directive to be lawful and for a reasonable interpretation of section 4(<i>b</i>) of the Firearms Act, 1925, there is a clear inference that for 75 years the Garda Síochána has not applied the legislation as it should. This directive states that any person whose dwelling is not suitably secured and who does not have a firearms cabinet installed of a certain quality and standard cannot be permitted to carry, use or be in possession of a firearm.</P>
    <P>Legal advice should have been sought on this issue in advance. The directive is not sustainable, although it is well intentioned. I know where the Minister is coming from &ndash; he is talking about public safety. There are practical difficulties which are too many to enumerate. The directive should be withdrawn and the issue revisited only after detailed legal advice has been obtained. I welcome the provisions of the Bill which tidy and streamline matters. I hope it will have the desired effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Jim Higgins for sharing his time with me. I have three concerns about the Bill which has all the hallmarks of rushed legislation. Emergency legislation was introduced in 1998 but now, two years later, the Minister has admitted that time is not on his side. <Col N="57" /> Given that this is a joint effort by the Minister and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, I thought the position would have been tidied up and made bullet proof by now.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that authorisation for licensing is in the Minister's hands while licensing is the responsibility of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. Many European shooting groups come to this country in the guise of tourists and wreak havoc on the wildlife in certain areas. However, the provisions of this Bill do not provide for the protection of the species. The activities of these hunting groups, who masquerade as tourists, in the Shannon callows from Portumna to Athlone are not acceptable. While the provisions of the Bill deal with authorisation for the provision of licences, they fall short in that they do not provide for such activities to be monitored. The licences do not restrict them from shooting wherever they want. They will shoot anything with feathers which flies. That is a terrible condemnation of the people who bring such groups into the country and give them free rein.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands agrees that many endangered species of birds have been shot by such tourists. Many people have protested to me about their activities. We are not allowed to say anything because we want to promote tourism in our areas. However, can we condone the activities of such groups? </P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands also agrees that continental tourist groups indiscriminately shoot deer in the forests in Slieve Aughty. The culling of the deer in the forests is controlled by Coillte. However, it is unacceptable that these people can seriously affect or wipe out deer herds by indiscriminately shooting them at night or during the day.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill a European pass is part of the accreditation the Garda superintendent will accept before granting a licence. Will the Minister confirm that he is satisfied with the authenticity of many European passes? It is important to ensure that licences include restrictions on the lands people can access. They usually target commonages, forests and other areas for which no individual landowner has responsibility. I am certain a private landowner would not allow this to happen on his or her property. If it is possible to incorporate some restriction, I ask the Minister to do that.</P>
      <P>I endorse what Deputy Higgins said. What guarantees are contained in the legislation, that the arms are being returned by the bearers who initially brought them into the country? I am certain that some people who became short of cash on their holidays, offered for sale many of the arms that were taken in. There was no registration involved and there is no actual proof that these arms were taken out by the bearer to whom the licence was initially issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must tighten up another area. When these people come in, they should be made <Col N="58" /> to display the arms so that we can ensure they are leaving with the arms they brought into the country. It is important that the Minister carries out a root and branch examination of the area of arms ownership given the amount of illegal arms in the country. Can we trace the legitimacy of the arms used in many of the horrific murders committed here in recent times? I am sure many of those murders were committed using illegal arms which originated in the trade we are talking about under this legislation. They are brought into this country and sold without any identification having to be produced.</P>
    <P>The amendments proposed by Deputies Stagg and Higgins are of the greatest importance, particularly in the areas I represent in east Galway which attracts many continental visitors. I hope that area is specifically targeted by the Minister so that this problem will not continue. It is ironic that the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is doing everything possible to encourage the protection of endangered species in these areas while the actions of tourists at certain times can undo all that work. Those people may not return here for several years. That is the problem. They come in here but they do not have any responsibility. They know they may not return here and therefore everything is fair game. I ask the Minister to take a stand on that issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The last time we addressed this issue was in July 1998 and it was in response to a successful High Court action brought by NARGC, the National Association of Regional Game Councils, against the Minister which successfully challenged the power of the Minister to grant firearms certificates and hunting licences to tourists or non-residents under the 1925 and 1998 Firearms Acts. In response to that court action, the Minister introduced the Firearms (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1998. At that time I was critical of the terms of the temporary provision and called on the Minister to bring forward a permanent comprehensive measure such as we are dealing with today.</P>
      <P>The Minister at the time promised to set up a representative review group to advise on the best approach to the resolution of the problems that had been identified. At the time I took that promise with a pinch of salt but I want to give credit where it is due &ndash; I always seek to do that. The Minister set up the review group and it is representative of all identified interests from landowners, shooting organisations, three Departments and the Garda. It got down to work immediately, finished its work and published its report by the end of 1998. I compliment the members of the review group on the vigour with which they approached their task and on their findings and recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note the Minister has had the report since November 1998. It might be said that it took him a long time to produce the legislation we are debating today. However, given the work volume <Col N="59" /> and the urgency of the many other matters being dealt with by the Minister and his Department, I accept that this legislation has been produced in a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>The Minister has accepted, by and large, the recommendations of the review group and that they are reflected in this legislation. As a result, we will have one of the best licensing systems for shooting and hunting tourists in Europe that will not be overly restrictive and which will allow for the necessary controls while encouraging the growth of this area of tourism. Again, I am giving credit where it is due.</P>
    <P>This legislation is only one piece of the jigsaw which will be complete only when the regulations are in place and the Wildlife Act is enforced. I will deal with some specifics of the Bill later, but I want to first refer to aspects of the contribution I made on this subject in 1998. During that contribution I referred to the cowboy operators &ndash; Deputy Burke referred to the same section of this business &ndash; and early morning raids over lands on which the tourists or agents have no rights. There is no doubt that such occurs, and as someone who holds a licensed shotgun I have first-hand experience of same. I trust this legislation and the regulations to follow will help eliminate such unacceptable practices.</P>
    <P>However, in concentrating on this aspect of the business in my contribution I inadvertently gave the impression that all operatives and agents were in this category. That was not my intention. Since then I have corresponded with Mr. John Flood of Ballypatrick, Clonmel, who is a major organiser of shooting tourists. I appreciate the points he made to me and that his operation is strictly controlled within the law and in the interests of sustainability, that a great service is provided by his operation to local landowners by controlling pigeons and rabbits and to the local economy by attracting tourists to the area. I also thank Mr. Paul Carberry, who is the chairman of the Association of Game Shoot Operators, for the advice and assistance he has given me. I commend the system of operation rules operated by AGSO for its members to the Minister when making the regulations under the Bill. These are the type of shooting tourist operations we need and which should be encouraged. They represent the bulk of shooting tourists and should not be confused with the minority who give shooting tourism a bad name. With adequate policing, the minority should be excluded or made toe the line. I hope that sets the record straight.</P>
    <P>There is only one section of the Bill on which I have reservations, that is section 4, and my concerns centre around the duration of licences granted and the need to have licences applicable only to particular lands. If licences are issued to tourists for one year, as they are for natives, and if the shooting period over an operator's land is for a lesser period, and it is likely to be, that tourist would be free to shoot elsewhere for the remaining period of the licence. For example, if <Col N="60" /> an Italian shooter is contracted to Paul Carberry's land for a period of three weeks, at the end of that three weeks he &ndash; and they are usually males &ndash; would be free to shoot wherever for the duration of his stay and may revisit several times during the year until his licence expires. There is a danger that such a tourist might be attracted from the mainstream regulated area of gaming into the minority cowboy country. Licences or certificates that are land and time specific would eliminate any such wildcat activity and would encourage shooting tourists to remain in the organised and regulated area. Perhaps the Minister will consider that aspect. I will table an amendment on Committee Stage along the lines I suggested. Perhaps the Minister will be able to satisfy me at that Stage that such an amendment is not necessary. I would like to record my thanks to Mr. Desmond Crofton of the National Association of Regional Games Councils for his advice and assistance leading up to this debate.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a few other points related to this legislation but more specifically related to the Wildlife Bill. We have the farcical situation where we pay landowners large amounts of money to set aside tracks of the best farmland in the country, in other words, take it out of mainstream use, while at the same time we give grants to other landowners to destroy wetland habitats by draining those lands and poisoning them with large doses of phosphates. Why can we not reverse this crazy system and pay the wetland owners to preserve the habitats and leave the arable land in use?</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that wetland owners are usually the poorer sector of the farming community and should not be further disadvantaged by being required to provide for the preservation of wetland habitats out of their own pockets. Similarly, the position on commonages, to which Deputy Ulick Burke also referred, needs to be clarified. Who has and who has not rights to such land? For example, I saw an advertisement in a shooting magazine a few years ago inviting tenders from shooting syndicates for rights over the 3,000 acres of Bloomfield Bog in County Mayo, a place I know well. The man who placed that advertisement has even fewer rights there than I, as my family have turbary rights on that bog. He did not even have those rights, yet he placed that advertisement. I would like the position on commonages regularised. I would also welcome the opening up of State lands to local and tourist shooters. That would lead to a management regime for such lands that would enhance the habitat for wildlife generally and create an income from tourists in the off peak season. The Minister and his colleagues might examine this area.</P>
    <P>With regard to pest control, magpies, who wreak havoc on other birds, including songbirds, are rampant in all parts of the country and in our towns and cities. There were 14 magpies' nests in trees along the side of the Liffey from Kingsbridge Station to O'Connell Bridge last year. <Col N="61" /> When caught in tragic jams in the mornings, I was tempted to get out of my car and knock down the nests. The songbirds have virtually disappeared from the city because of the abundance of magpies. They eat the eggs in other birds' nests and when other birds do not have chicks those species are wiped out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a case of the chicken and the egg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>It is. It is a matter for the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to deal with. I am sure she must be conscious of it.  Magpies do much more damage to songbirds not only in the city but in the country than all of the cowboy operators to whom Deputy Ulick Burke referred on the last occasion we spoke on this matter. They need to be seriously culled and incentives need to be put in place to achieve this objective. Great crows are in a similar category, but the problem they pose is not as widespread.</P>
      <P>Cormorants are in a different category and pose a problem to our inland fisheries. Since they became a protected species, their numbers have greatly increased and this has led to relatively large numbers moving inland from the seaside to feed in fresh water. They do serious damage to fish stocks, especially to artificially stocked waters where the fish are not as wise as their wild cousins. Because of its poor digestive system, a cormorant will eat its own weight in fish every day. I have seen 30 cormorants flying over a small lake in the evenings, near where I come from in County Mayo. Their weight in fish would nearly sink a boat. They are doing serious damage to our inland fisheries. The angling organisations and the gaming clubs should be allowed and encouraged to deal with this new menace to our inland fisheries. I urge the Minister to talk to his colleague on this matter.</P>
      <P>I thank all concerned in reaching the point we are at today, particularly the Minister for presenting the Bill in its present form.</P>

      <P>
        <b>(Mr. O'Donoghue): </b>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to this interesting debate. Given the time constraints that apply, I will deal directly with the matters raised. Deputies Jim Higgins and Ulick Burke referred to the delay in bringing this important legislation before the House. I agree that the control of firearms is an important issue but, as Deputy Stagg graciously acknowledged, my Department is involved in the preparation of a great deal of important legislation and this Bill was prepared as quickly as other competing priorities allowed. This will be the thirtieth piece of legislation enacted since I came into office for which I am responsible. That gives Members an idea of the amount of legislation emanating from my Department. There are 11 other Bills at various Stages in the Oireachtas and many more are under preparation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The control of firearms is a complex area that <Col N="62" /> requires careful legislation and a coherent, sensible and balanced approach. We have brought those elements together in this Bill. Deputy Higgins argued that the Bill did not go all the way towards assessing the suitability of non-residents. When a resident applies for a firearm certificate, the Garda, using local knowledge, can make reasonable inquiries as to the fitness and suitability of that person to possess a firearm. Because of different procedures in other countries, it is not possible to make the same inquiries, as a matter of routine, in the case of non-resident applications. That means we allow no non-resident hunters into the country or we provide a separate scheme. The former option is a non-starter for obvious reasons and this Bill provides for the latter.</P>
    <P>I have already explained what is provided for in the Bill and I will not repeat myself. I am fully satisfied that the differences between the provisions of this Bill and those applying to residents are allowable under European anti-discrimination laws which, <i>inter alia</i>, preclude discrimination against tourists exercising the rights to travel and to avail of services unless differences of treatment were capable of objective justification. That being said, the Bill does not give extensive powers to the Garda or the Minister during the transitional period to scrutinise applications for firearm certificates from non-residents. The issuing person must be satisfied that the application is bone fide. The type of documentation referred to in section 2(8) will suffice as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of suitability. However, the issuing person does have power to make further inquiries if he or she is not satisfied with some aspect of the application. In addition, the certificate may have conditions attached to it and it may be revoked.</P>
    <P>Section 3 makes it an offence to give false information regarding an application for a firearm certificate. Such an offence can be charged on indictment where it would attract a penalty of £10,000 or five years' imprisonment or both. I am fully satisfied that the powers available to ensure that applications from non-residents to hunt here or to use firearms for sporting purposes are sufficient to prevent firearm certificates falling into the wrong hands.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins inquired as to the directive by the Garda Síochána regarding the requirement for licensed firearms holders to install gun cabinets. Under the Firearms Acts, 1925 to 1998, it is not lawful for any person, with some exceptions &ndash; such as firearms dealers &ndash; to have in his or her possession, use or carry a firearm, unless authorised to do so by a firearm certificate granted under the relevant Act. The power to grant or to refuse to grant a firearm certificate to any person resident in the State is vested in the superintendent of the Garda district where the person resides. Therefore, I have no statutory function in the matter.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Garda Síochána that for some time it has been increasingly concerned about the consequences of insecure storage of <Col N="63" /> firearms. The number of firearms stolen from the homes or motor vehicles of licensed holders is of particular concern. In 1999, 153 licensed firearms were stolen. During the first three months of this year in excess of 50 licensed firearms were stolen. Some of those stolen firearms were used in the commission of other serious crimes. The level of larceny of licensed firearms and the use to which they are subsequently put are matters of serious concern. A significant factor in the vulnerability of licensed firearms to larceny is the security or insecurity of the conditions under which they are stored. The view of the Garda Síochána arising out of their investigation of the circumstances surrounding these larcenies is that carelessness on the part of the owners of the firearms has in many cases been a contributory factor. In some cases the security arrangements for the storage of the firearms were non-existent and in other cases firearms were left unattended in motor vehicles overnight or stored in outhouses. Carelessness over the secure storage of firearms can have other serious consequences apart from larceny. If children and young persons can play and experiment with unsecured firearms often there are tragic results. There is also the consideration that access to unsecured weapons can facilitate suicide.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that there were 23 cases of suicide involving licensed firearms in 1999 and 50 the previous year. This is of serious concern to the Garda Síochána. The report of the national task force on suicide urged improved controls on the safe storage of firearms aimed at reducing their availability for suicide. This is the background to the decision of the Garda Síochána to require the holders of firearms certificates to take measures to secure and store their firearms. There is nothing new in the concept as the Garda Síochána has long advised the holders of firearms certificates on the appropriate measures to take. Garda guidelines on the matter were issued for the information of holders of firearms certificates. However, the view of the Garda Síochána is that their advice on the security and safe storage of firearms has not been adhered to by the majority of holders of firearms certificates. This clearly is a very serious concern to the Garda Síochána who have an obligation to ensure that adequate security arrangements are in place for the safe and secure storage of lethal weapons. In particular the Garda Síochána is concerned to ensure that every effort is made to prevent dangers to members of the public arising from larceny or misuse of firearms.</P>
    <P>One of the conditions for granting a firearms certificate is that the superintendent must be satisfied that the applicant can be permitted to have the firearm in his possession without danger to the public safety or to the peace. It was with all these issues in mind that the Garda Commissioner recently issued a directive with the following effect. New firearms certificates will not be issued by the Garda Síochána unless the applicant has installed a security cabinet for the safe <Col N="64" /> storage of the firearm; current certificate holders will be informed when collecting new firearms certificates this year that their firearm will not be licensed for the year 2001-2 unless they have provided a security cabinet for it; the Garda authorities are considering the application of the directive to non-residents also. These are the security arrangements decided upon by the Garda Síochána for the reason I have outlined in the discharge of its statutory function of granting firearms certificates.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke complained about the activities of foreign shooters. From the point of view of the firearms certificate, there have been no incidents in recent years concerning foreign shooters. The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is introducing new storage measures in the Wildelife (Amendment) Bill, 1999, including a separate new provision to regulate the activities of tourist shoot operators. Recently she appointed over 30 new rangers to police the protection of wildlife. That will be welcomed by everybody.</P>
    <P>Deer numbers in the State have not been higher for a long time. They are restricted to lands on which the holders of firearms certificates have permission to hunt. It is illegal under the Wildlife Act, 1976, to hunt on lands without permission. Deputy Stagg referred to his doubts over the period of the licence and the lands on which non-residents can shoot. I shall deal with that matter when discussing his amendment. He mentioned also cowboy operators and tourist shoot operators. The Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, 1999, will introduce new provisions to regulate the activities of tourist shoot operators. The Minister has been complimented on these provisions. All important habitats are protected either by SAC or NHA designation and landowners are compensated for any losses they may have.</P>
    <P>On the other point raised by Deputy Stagg, a review is currently taking place on the issue of shooting on State lands. The Deputy will accept that one cannot deny a person a right to seek permission to hunt on another person's land. That is something we cannot do anything about.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions. Before moving to Committee Stage I should refer to Deputy Stagg's comments on magpies and cormorants. I shall refer these matters to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. The Deputy's contribution was an informed one for me as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I certainly would not feel qualified to comment in any detail on what he had to say. I understand there are provisions in the wildlife legislation to allow for pest control. I shall bring the Deputy's learned views to the attention of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (2)(<i>a</i>)(ii), lines 30 and 31, after &ldquo;commencement&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or if the Minister has made an order under subsection (3)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 2(2) provides that applications for firearms certificates for firearms to be used for hunting or sporting purposes or for species whose shooting is not proscribed would be made to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for two years following the commencement of this legislation. Thereafter the applications will be made to the appropriate Garda superintendent. Subsection (2) is qualified by subsection (3) under which at any time during the initial two year period the Minister can, by order, relinquish his functions in that respect to the Garda Síochána. A rereading of those provisions would suggest that they could have the opposite effect to that intended and that the appropriate superintendent could not assume responsibility for granting certificates until two years had elapsed despite the power of the Minister to reduce the two years referred to in subsection (2)(f2&gt;a)(i). The proposed amendment removes any ambiguity about my intentions, that is, to make clear that should the Minister relinquish the power to grant firearms certificates to non-residents for hunting or sporting purposes within two years, the appropriate Garda superintendent would immediately assume responsibility for granting firearms certificates to non-residents for firearms to be used for hunting or sporting purposes or for shooting unprotected species such as vermin.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>In page 5, subsection (6), line 5, after &ldquo;thereof&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, but a firearm certificate granted before the 31st day of July in any year may be expressed to commence on the next following 1st day of August and shall in that case be in force on and from such 1st day of August until the next following 31st day of July&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (6) provides that a firearms certificate granted under this section shall remain in force until 31 July next following the grant thereof or for such shorter period as may be specified in the certificate. A difficulty could arise in the case of a non-resident who applies in, for example, July which is the end of one licence period, for a firearms certificate effective from, say, 1 August which is the beginning of the next licence period. The present wording of this subsection would preclude the issue of a firearms certificate with an expiry date later than 31 July of the year of <Col N="66" /> application, thus making advance applications impossible where the certificate was needed for shortly after 1 August. The proposed amendment would enable the issuing person, the Minister or Garda authorities as the case may be, to issue a firearms certificate in July which is effective from the following August. This will ensure that the position of residents under section 3(3) of the Firearms Act, 1925, will be the same in that respect for non-residents under this Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the intention obviously that the generality of licences issuing to tourists would be for a year's duration. I understand from the Bill they can be for a shorter period or the superintendent can specify a shorter period. My amendment suggests that they should always be for a lesser or specified amount and only for a year if somebody intends to shoot for a year and has indicated that. I cannot understand why a visitor who will be in this country for a month should be given a licence for a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the shorter period, the intent is to cater for visiting dignitaries. Applications intermittently arrive in the Department in relation to visiting dignitaries and the possibility of bodyguards carrying firearms. These are not always granted. We have stringent and strict controls regarding the carrying of firearms in this country. They are probably the most stringent in Europe, certainly in EU member states. Careful consideration is given by officials in the Department to decisions about whether, for example, a visiting dignitary's bodyguards can carry firearms and the application is sent to the Minister for decision.</P>
      <P>It is not intended, therefore, for visiting shooters. The difficulty with having a shorter period is that there cannot be discrimination against people who are coming to the State, as I explained on Second Stage. I understand the Deputy's concerns and I hope I have explained the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Why would somebody who is visiting Ireland for up to two months, who wants to shoot during that period of time and wants to have their gun with them in Ireland for that length of time, be given a licence for a longer period? There would be no discrimination against them if they want to shoot for two months, to have their gun in Ireland for two months and have specified the lands they want to shoot on. This will have been notified to and dealt with by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. That Department will have all relevant information on when the tourist is arriving, what type of gun will be brought into the country, on what lands they will shoot and whether there is permission to shoot on those lands. There would be no discrimination against them because they would be given what they want or need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The danger in having a 12 month licence is that after the regulated period of shooting, the basis <Col N="67" /> on which they were granted the hunting and firearms licence, they can then go where they wish. If the person applied in the first instance for an unrestricted licence to shoot where they wished, they would be refused and correctly so. The Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands would also refuse and the visitor would not get the hunting licence and, consequently, would not be given the gun licence.</P>
    <P>However, in this Bill the Minister is giving the visitor an unrestricted licence for the ten months outside the two month shooting holiday. I do not think they want that. The organised shoot operators, who are the majority interest in this sector, do not want it either. This will give tourists an opportunity to come to a regulated shoot operator and then leave after a week to go to a 3,000 acre bog in Mayo or to the Shannon where they can do as they wish for another three weeks. The Minister will have no control over that. That is the difficulty and I believe a specified period of time for the licence would have addressed it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty relates to European anti-discrimination law. If, for example, a resident will be granted the relevant certificate for a year, anti-discrimination law dictates that the non-resident who comes from a member state of the EU must also get a certificate for a year. In other words, all EU non-residents must be treated the same.</P>
      <P>In the case of Northern Ireland, Members will understand that an individual from the North who is interested in the sport would require the licence for a year. The advice from the Attorney General is that the Minister is not entitled to say that a person from Northern Ireland can have a licence for a year but a person from Italy can only have it for two months. The difficulty is the law of the land in so far as it is dictated by European law. The Attorney General advised that it would not be possible to delimit the time in the manner advocated by Deputy Stagg. There is a prohibition on discrimination. In short, if the certificate is to be granted to a resident of the State for one year, it must be granted to a non-resident for one year as well. There is no way around it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>They are required to comply with certain criteria to get a licence which gives them a right to shoot over lands. If the right to shoot over lands is limited in time by the operator or owner of the lands, surely the right to have a licence would coincide with the limitation the landowner is putting on them to shoot over the lands? I am not sure if I am getting my point across.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is getting his point across. If the person concerned wishes to go home after a month or two, he can do that. If he returns here, however, after another three or four months, one could argue that it makes sense not <Col N="68" /> to have to go through the administrative arrangements for issuing the licence again.</P>

      <P>In page 5, subsection (11), line 31, to delete &ldquo;only&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of subsections (11) and (12) is to ensure that where application is made for a firearm certificate with a view the hunting, the firearm certificate should not be issued unless the applicant has obtained any necessary hunting licence. That is clearly a sensible and prudent provision.</P>
      <P>The technical amendments I am proposing in relation to these subsections, which involve deleting the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; in each subsection, are to remove a possible ambiguity which might otherwise exist. Each subsection refers to the issuing of firearm certificates to a person in respect of a firearm which is intended to be used only for the purpose of hunting. There is a possibility that the provisions might, therefore, be taken not to apply to a person who intended to use his or her firearm not only for hunting but for hunting and target shooting. Clearly, this would not be intended.</P>
      <P>The deletion of the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; in each subsection will make clear that any person who applies for a firearm certificate for the purpose of hunting must first obtain any necessary hunting licence irrespective of whether he or she intends to use the firearm for other purposes also.</P>

    <P>I have discussed the amendment already and the Minister explained the difficulty in accepting it. When I apply for my gun licence, I must specify what lands I will shoot over. The section of the original Act requires me to make that declaration. It will also be required of the tourist shooter. I am not sure if it is possible to stop the type of activity to which Deputy Ulick Burke and I referred on the last occasion we discussed this given what the Minister said about the time limitation, but we could have land specific, if not time specific, licences for tourists. I am not sure if this is possible given what the Minister said earlier about discrimination and a different regime for visiting shooters. The Minister should take this on board and let someone else challenge it because this would prevent the type of activity described by Deputy Burke. This is giving a bad name to shooting tourists in general.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to either Deputy Stagg's amendment or to my amendment. Deputy Stagg's amendment goes further than mine in that it proposes a time limit. It seeks to delimit the activities of the person, both in terms of time and area. My amendment reads, &ldquo;The licence granted to a non-resident shall have endorsed on it the lands over which the non-resident is entitled to shoot as submitted by the applicant or non-resident when he or she applied for the licence.&rdquo;  There is general acknowledgment that the Minister has taken on board most of the recommendations of the review group which was a composite group made up of different representative bodies. Deputy Stagg has rightly paid tribute to the National Association of Regional Game Councils who, having taken action on the applicability of the 1925 Act, inputted very constructively to the review group. This is a responsible body of 22,000 members who regulate satisfactorily their owns affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the recommendations of the review group have been incorporated in this legislation. However, for some reason, recommendation 4 of the review group's report is the only omission. My amendment seeks to put some kind of limitation on lands. In other words, a licence should specify the areas of ground over which the applicant is permitted to shoot. Will the Minister take this matter seriously and try to curtail the mass destruction and ruthless carnage which is taking place. I witness this taking place in my county where photographs have been taken of bags of songbirds, sparrows, thrushes, linnets, blackbirds and so on. These are seen as justifiable prey in <Col N="70" /> the eyes of shooters from abroad, particularly the French, carrying out their shooting activities.</P>
    <P>The problem does not relate as much to permission as to commonage. There are huge tracts of open commonage in the west of Ireland in particular. There is also a huge amount of fallow ground and long railway embankments. These people see it as their entitlement to go on to railway embankments and other tracts of open land, which is not under anyone's control, and shoot indiscriminately. I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to this issue because it seems to be the only omission in terms of taking on board the recommendations of the review body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal with the last point first, there is some evidence of indiscriminate shooting but this is on a very small scale at present. Matters have improved greatly recently. Approximately nine months ago the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, appointed 30 new rangers who are acting on the ground at present and are very successful in policing activities. I also understand that shoot operators have introduced a set of guidelines which are being adhered to and that the situation has improved greatly. There will always by those who will disobey rules and guidelines and seek to become involved in indiscriminate shooting, which is absolutely disgraceful, but any such persons will be severely dealt with under the law if apprehended. That is the message Deputies will want to go out from this House. A sufficient number of rangers are now in place to police this activity.</P>
      <P>I propose to take the Deputies' amendments Nos. 5 and 6 together, as they are concerned with the same issues, but I cannot accept them for the following reasons. First, if the proposed measure was introduced it would create a situation whereby we would introduce an uneven playing field where non-residents would be subject to greater restrictions than resident hunters. This would be contrary to the High Court judgment and to EU anti-discrimination laws. These laws, <i>inter alia</i>, preclude discrimination against tourists exercising their rights to travel and to avail of services unless any difference of treatment was capable of objective justification. My legal advice is that the different requirements for resident and non-resident applicants, as proposed in the amendments, are not capable of objective justification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, section 28 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, states that a person, whether resident or non-resident, cannot lawfully hunt with firearms unless such a person is a qualified person within the provisions of that section. To be such a qualified person, a person must, <i>inter alia</i>, be entitled to sporting rights over land or have the permission of the person who is entitled to such sporting rights. Any application for a hunting licence under section 29 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, must be accompanied by a list of the lands over which the applicant has permission to hunt. In addition, any <Col N="71" /> application to the Garda Síochána for a firearm certificate which will be used and endorsed for hunting must be accompanied by a declaration which includes details of the lands to be hunted over.</P>
    <P>Third, it would not be possible to restrict a non-resident to certain specific lands as, after the firearm certificate has been issued, the licence holder may receive permission to hunt over new lands. Accordingly, it would not be proper to restrict his or her hunting to certain lands that may have been originally listed on the licence. Fourth, section 44 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, already provides that it will be an offence to hunt over lands with a firearm without the permission of the landowner.</P>
    <P>Specifically in relation to Deputy Stagg's amendment, as the Bill is drafted, the maximum licence period in the case of both a firearm certificate and a hunting licence is one year. Accordingly, there are already various strong provisions in relation to the lands over which people may hunt which apply to both residents and non-residents. The amendments, therefore, are unnecessary and would be contrary to the legal and European requirements which had to be taken into account in the preparation of the Bill. This was confirmed by the advice of the Attorney General.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will clarify what &ldquo;permission from a landowner&rdquo; entails. Does it entail going to his house and asking, &ldquo;Can I shoot over your lands?&rdquo; and, if he says &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, &ldquo;How long does that &lsquo;yes' last?&rdquo;  Does one have to get it in writing? Does a person have to tell the Garda he has it or get a letter from the landowner? What does permission entail? I know what permission entails for me. When I go shooting, I ask the farmer can I shoot on his lands and, if he says I can, I take it that &ldquo;yes&rdquo; is good for a year. What happens if there is no one to ask? In relation to Bloomfield Bog, for example, where there are 3,000 acres of high heather, high bog, good snipe country, woodcock, the occasional pheasant, duck on ponds and lakes, who does one ask for permission or can anyone shoot there, including tourists? Can unscrupulous shooters who are not regulated bring large numbers of shooters to these commonages and wipe out the game and other wildlife in the area? This is what we are seeking to address. The legislation as framed is flawed in that it does not restrict cowboy operators severely enough to eliminate them or make them toe the line.</P>

      <P>A commonage would entail the permission of a number of owners. With a commonage, a person is deemed to be the owner of part and all. If a person had an interest in a commonage, he or she has a right to graze his or her cattle on any part of that commonage for the simple reason that there is no defined area of ownership for the individual concerned. That raises the question of whether a person who owns commonage can unilaterally give the consent which Deputy Stagg mentioned. We could try the Supreme Court but I would guess that he could give consent on the basis that he can exercise ownership rights over all of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of what the Minister says, to have a right to shoot over Bloomfield Bog in County Mayo, a person would need to get permission from around 500 plot owners. Otherwise he will be acting illegally under this and previous Acts. If that is the case, he can be arrested and punished in whatever way the law determines for shooting. That person will not have permission from 500 people. He certainly will not get permission from my family. We can block anyone from shooting there because we own half an acre of bog there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a nice legal point. If an individual has an interest in a commonage, he or she has the right to graze on any part of that commonage, even though in theory he or she owns one undivided part of that commonage which is undefined in the title. If the sporting rights are reserved to the owners of the commonage, since each owner of the commonage is an owner of an undivided part of it, and has the right to exercise ownership rights as far as grazing is concerned over all of the commonage, it follows that he or she would also be entitled to grant permission for <Col N="73" /> the sporting rights over the undivided section, which is not specified, because he or she has an undivided right. My view is that such a person would be in a position to give permission to an individual.</P>

        <b>:</b> It is extraordinary that the review group, comprising representatives of the relevant Departments and the Garda Síochána, did its work and one of the recommendations made was that there should be some definition in relation to the land. The report states that it should be granted to a non-resident, he should have endorsed on the licence the land over which the non-resident is entitled to shoot, as submitted by the applicant or non-resident when he or she applied for the licence. Something deemed appropriate by those on the review group is now unsuitable and could create legal problems. I do not understand how, having sat down together, the group changed its opinion. Why is it not possible to marry the provisions of the wildlife legislation and this Bill?</P>
      <P>I cannot see why commonage cannot be specified on the licence. One of the benefits of designating the lands on the licence is that the 30 additional wildlife rangers would be able to patrol these areas knowing that certain people are operating under licence for a certain period within specified areas.</P>
      <P>This would provide safeguards which would end the ruthless, indiscriminate carnage which is taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained the position on non-residents. They cannot be treated differently from residents if they are EU citizens because there are anti-discrimination laws which must be observed. If, for example, we grant licences to non-residents for two months, we must do the same for residents and that would be an administrative nightmare. The checks and balances in the legislation will ensure that those who are granted non-resident certificates are fit to hold such certificates.</P>
      <P>We have had a worthwhile discussion on land ownership. It is not possible, however, to prevent a person who has or is seeking a certificate from asking for permission to shoot from someone who owns land, even if it is a commonage. There are a number of points of legal nicety but we cannot stop people seeking permission to go shooting on another person's land, whether it is commonage or not.</P>

        <b>:</b> On the steel safe which is now required for all residents, the Minister said he is looking at the possibility of making this applicable to non-residents. As matters stand there would seem be a problem with the directive. Does the householder, hotel owner or person providing accommodation have to ensure that the guns of the non-resident shooters will be kept in the same fashion as those of residents with firearm certificates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there is a need for people to ensure that their guns are stored safely. I am concerned about the fact that members of the Garda Síochána will have the right to enter people's houses in order to inspect their guns and ensure that they have complied with the provisions in the Bill. I do not believe that gardaí should be allowed to enter one's house unless one breaks the law.</P>
      <P>I accept that it is wise to ensure that guns are stored safely. In that context, cars are surely the most unsafe places to store guns. People who go for a drink or a meal after a day's shooting cannot bring their guns with them into a pub or a restaurant and, as a result, they leave them in their cars. I have often seen people leave their guns unattended in the interior of their cars rather than locking them in the boot. Guns left in this way are liable to be stolen. Will the Minister indicate whether guns are usually stolen from cars or from houses?</P>

        <b>:</b> The Minister indicated that 153 guns were stolen in 1999. Will he indicate the number stolen from cars? I fully agree with the point made by Deputy Stagg about the theft of guns from cars and other vehicles.</P>
      <P>I accept that the directive is well intentioned but I believe it will cause considerable difficulties for elderly people living in isolated areas whose guns are often their only form of security. Under the Bill, these people will be obliged to put safes in place in their homes. On &ldquo;Crimeline&rdquo; recently, Chief Superintendent John Farrelly displayed the type of safe people are expected to put in place. As stated earlier, these safes will be made of sheet steel 2 mm thick, they will have double locks and they must be anchored firmly to floors, walls, etc. This stipulation will create problems and the Minister could find himself involved in a dispute similar to that which occurred in respect of rod licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To a person living in an isolated rural area, particularly someone in receipt of a non-contributory old age pension who is obliged to live on £80 per week, a gun is a valuable form of protection. If that person's house is broken into, by the time he extracted the gun from the safe it would be too late. Elderly people are not reckless or careless with their guns and we should reconsider the <Col N="75" /> directive, which is well intentioned, in terms of the effect it will have on them.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that 153 guns were stolen last year. The National Association of Regional Game Councils has 22,000 members, many of whom own two or three guns which means that there are approximately 120,000 or 130,000 guns in the country. When one considers the position in those terms, 153 is a relatively small number. We must ensure, however, as Deputy Stagg stated, that people secure their guns properly when transporting them in vehicles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this section, firearms certificates are granted with conditions attached and the objective is to ensure that people comply with those conditions. If a person fails to comply, he will be in breach of the terms under which the certificate was granted in the first instance.</P>
      <P>There have been disturbing reports about the number of firearms which have been stolen and we are aware that some of these have been used in serious crimes. In addition, it is unfortunate that guns are also used in suicides. Given these two facts, the Garda Síochána felt that certain controls had to be introduced. We are not asking people to place their guns or firearms in remote places where they will not have access to them. Therefore, in the situation envisaged by Deputy Higgins, an individual will be obliged to store his gun in a safe cabinet in his house. I do not believe that is asking too much.</P>
      <P>With regard to the situation to which Deputy Stagg referred, under the condition with which the Garda Commissioner is asking people to comply, shooters will not be allowed to leave their guns unattended while they enter a pub or restaurant or go about some other activity. These people will not be entitled to leave their guns in their cars and they will be obliged to comply with the conditions which apply to the certificate.</P>

        <b>:</b> I urge the Minister to reconsider the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> this provision. I accept that it has been recommended by the Garda authorities who are supposed to have expertise in these matters but I believe that in certain instances a more modest provision should apply. I do not believe there is any need for people to be obliged to put in place a metal safe of the kind to which I referred earlier. The Mini<Col N="76" /> ster should reconsider this matter from the point of view of the practicalities involved.</P>
      <P>The Minister's argument about the use of guns in suicides is somewhat out of place. Suicide is a premeditated act and people who want to kill themselves usually find ways of doing so. Does the Minister intend to reduce people's access to paracetamol, bridges, cliffs or ropes in order to prevent them committing suicide? I accept what he is saying about public security and safety but I do not believe this issue should be put up in lights.</P>
      <P>For the benefit of old age pensioners who take great care of their guns and to whom guns are valuable allies, a less costly and stringent provision should be put in place. Local gardaí should be given discretion in this area; they should be allowed to decide if the security arrangements a person employs are sensible and adequate.</P>
