    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business shall be as follows: No. 22, motion re referral to joint committee of Abbeylara report; No. 23, motion re approval of terms of agreement establishing an Advisory Centre on World Trade Organisation Law; No. 7, Teaching Council Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed); No. 9, Youth Work Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage; and No. 41, Aviation Regulation Bill, 2000 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Second Stage (resumed).</P>
      <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders relative to public or private business, that Nos. 22 and 23 shall be decided without debate; and in relation to the Trinity College, Dublin (Charters and Letters Patent Amendment) Bill, 1997, that (<i>a</i>) Report Stage be taken tomorrow at the conclusion of statements on the ASEM lll Summit in Seoul and (<i>b</i>) Fifth Stage be taken tomorrow.</P>
      <P>The Dáil, on its rising tomorrow, shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 7 November 2000. Private Members' Business shall be No. 67, Twenty-First Amendment of the Constitution (No. 3) Bill, 1999 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed), to conclude at 8.30 p.m. this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three proposals to be put to the House. The first is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 22 and 23. Is that agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to taking two questions as one. The World Trade Organisation office and the Abbeylara shooting inquiry are entirely separate matters and the issues of whether they should be debated are entirely separate questions. To put them together in one question prevents the House from considering properly the issue of whether a particular issue should be debated.</P>
      <P>With regard to the motion that the Abbeylara report be taken without debate, I propose that the House agree to add the following words:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1346" /> That the committee shall have full powers&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The first question to be decided is whether the matter is to be taken without debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first question, I wish to table this amendment to the motion that it be taken without debate. I am agreeable to its being taken without debate provided the following words are added to the motion that it be taken without debate:</P>
      <P>That the committee shall have full powers to compel the attendance of any and every witness . . .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a question before the House. It is that two items be taken without debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Standing Orders I am entitled to table an amendment to any motion. The proposal that this matter be taken without debate is a motion and I am proposing an amendment, of which I gave notice to your office last night, to that motion. I wish to be allowed to move my amendment. It reads:</P>
      <P>To add the following to the motion:</P>
      <P>provided that the committee shall have full powers to compel the attendance of any and every witness that may be required by the committee, that the report of the committee shall be fully debated in Dáil Éireann and that the Carthy family shall have early sight of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party shares the concerns expressed by Deputy Bruton and would support such a motion if it is in order. If it is not in order, and that is for you, Sir, to decide, we will not agree to this matter being taken unless the Taoiseach gives a categorical assurance that the thrust of the amendment proposed by Deputy Bruton will obtain Government approval.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i> (Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> The Abbeylara tragedy has been the subject of selective leaks to the media for several months, justifying the Garda position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Higgins, are you for or against the proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Because the report has been the subject of selective leaks, it must be published and should then be debated by the Dáil as a whole. The question of a public inquiry which has been demanded by the Carthy family, by civil rights groups and by people in this House should be debated and decided upon. It is not acceptable that the matter be dealt with in this way. The Dáil has been insulted by the Minister for Justice, <Col N="1347" /> Equality and Law Reform and the senior Garda authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may not make a statement. I am putting the question. Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 22 and 23 agreed? This is the only question before the House. The amendment is not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I anticipated your response, Sir, and I ask that the Taoiseach give a response. You might allow the Taoiseach the opportunity to respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I inquire why it is not in order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have ruled it is not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking, mildly, why it is not in order. This is not an unreasonable question. The Chair is accountable for his decisions, in the same as every other Member of the House. You have made a decision and I ask you to explain it, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is an amendment to the motion itself. The motion itself is not before the House. The question is how the motion is to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tabled an amendment both to the motion and to the manner of its being debated. The House cannot properly decide whether it is worth debating this motion until it knows whether the issues raised in the motion can be dealt with other than by debate. Therefore my amendment must be tabled at this stage as well as when the substantive motion is considered. I submit that my amendment is in order. That the amendment is being made to another question does not render it out of order in respect of the question of whether there should be a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in order to move the amendment to this question or for the amendment to be considered. The Chair has ruled on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair cannot be cross-examined on his rulings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion is:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the report of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána on the fatal shooting of John Carthy at Abbeylara, County Longford on 20 April 2000 be referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence <Col N="1348" /> and Women's Rights in accordance with paragraph (2) of the Orders of Reference of that committee.</P>
    <P>This is what we are asking the House to agree to. I understand what Deputies Bruton and Quinn are asking. We are asking the House to agree to this. Deputies Bruton and Quinn are asking that the joint committee have the right to compel the attendance of witnesses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Should it request it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my understanding that the procedure under the legislation dealing with the compellability of witnesses is that, as a statutory committee, the joint committee, which is representative of all the main parties in the House, can ask for this. I, for my part, would have no difficulty with this and no interest in blocking such a request. I wish to make that clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Not having a difficulty and giving one's approval to ensure the majority in the House would accede to such a request are two different things. Am I to understand that if the joint committee makes such a request the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats will accede by majority to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the wish of the joint committee. On the second issue raised by Deputy Bruton, that the Carthy family should have early sight of the report, if there is no legal difficulty with this, I have no difficulty, but it is a matter for a legal committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton said that the matter should be debated fully in the House after it has been dealt with by the joint committee. I have no difficulty with this either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 22 and 23 agreed to? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Not debating the World Trade Organisation office and the Abbeylara inquiry are entirely separate questions. Will the Taoiseach give an assurance that when he seeks to have items taken without debate he will put them separately because there may be items that the House wishes to debate and others it may not? This joint procedure is not acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not interpret it that way. What I said was, &ldquo;The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 22, motion re referral to joint committee of Abbeylara report; No. 23, motion re approval of terms of agreement establishing an Advisory Centre on World Trade Organisation Law . . . that Nos. 22 and 23 shall be decided without debate . . .&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy saying that I should have stated that No. 22 shall be decided without debate and that No. 23 shall be decided without debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Seven or eight items are often taken without debate. If we were to follow Deputy Bruton's logic, I would have to state that No. 1 shall be taken without debate, that No. 2 shall be taken without debate and so on. That has never been done and it is not necessary to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the proposal for dealing with the Trinity College, Dublin (Charters and Letters Patent Amendment) Bill, 1997, agreed to? Agreed. Is the proposal that the Dáil, on its rising tomorrow, shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 7 November 2000 agreed to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The House resumed in plenary session following the summer recess just three weeks ago. I wonder, therefore, about the wisdom of the House not sitting in plenary session next week, given that a considerable volume of business has been scheduled for this session. Will the Taoiseach give a commitment that the A list of the Government's legislative programme will be dealt with in its entirety by the end of the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about our internal business, there is widespread concern at the prospect of secondary schools being closed for up to four or five days. If that is to be the case, Deputies may wish to have the matter raised. Will the Taoiseach indicate whether the Minister for Education and Science will make a statement on the matter today or tomorrow or, alternatively, whether provision can be made next week for such a statement when the House will not meet in plenary session? Before the Labour Party assents to that proposal, I seek an indication as to how the Government proposes to address the concern of parents at the threatened closure of the secondary school system and the disruption this will cause to family life.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot discuss the matter now. The question before the House relates to the adjournment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Opposition Whip, it is our intention to complete all the business scheduled. There will be six long weeks of sittings. There will also be committee meetings. On the industrial relations dispute, industrial action is threatened by the ASTI, with a national one day stoppage on 14 November. The House will have plenty of time to debate the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is getting shy in his replies. It is impossible to hear him on this side of the House. Either there is a problem with the volume on the other side of the House or it is fortitude. I am not sure what the Taoiseach said.</P>

In view of the fact that our secondary school system will effectively be closed on 22, 23, 28, 29 and 30 November for reasons of insurance cover, as supervision will not be provided by the secondary school teachers' union, and because of the disruptive effect this will have on families which will be required to make alternative arrangements &ndash; courtesy requires that they should be informed in advance of what is likely to happen &ndash; will the Minister for Education and Science be in a position to make a statement to the House today or tomorrow indicating what will happen and the action, if any, that can be taken by the Government to resolve the matter?</P>

      <P>I reluctantly return to a question I asked the Taoiseach last week about promised legislation to establish a single regulator for the financial services industry.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter has not been settled, therefore, the Taoiseach did not give an accurate answer to the question put last week. Why is the Government taking so long to make up its mind on this issue? What is the cause of the paralysis in Cabinet on the matter? Is the Taoiseach not aware that the Government's inability to decide a personality dispute between two individuals is doing great damage to the financial services industry and to Ireland's international financial reputation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the Law Society's view on this matter. The issue must be considered bearing in mind that the legal profession in the State has organised itself into two separate and distinct branches with a well-established division of work.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General is the adviser to the Government in matters of law and legal opinion. The Office of the Attorney General employs barristers who act as legal assistants and solicitors who act as solicitors in the Office of the Chief State Solicitor. The barrister and solicitor roles in the office and the separate and mutually exclusive career structures reflect the different and special skills of each profession. Barristers and solicitors have a full career structure and the opportunity to advance their careers in their respective offices and, with the exception of one post, solicitors in the Office of the Chief State Solicitor have all grades equivalent to those of the legal assistants.</P>
      <P>The Office of the Attorney General also employs parliamentary counsel &ndash; parliamentary drafters &ndash; who may be barristers or solicitors. Drafting is a law specialism and drafters are recruited separately and have a separate career structure within the office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of the legal assistant is to provide specialist legal advice, including on all constitutional issues and matters of considerable public importance, and to direct the conduct of litigation in which the State is involved. As such the role of a legal assistant in the Office of the Attorney General which is the primary law office of the State is fundamentally different from, say, the more limited role of a legal adviser in a Department whose work relates specifically to departmental matters. Neither is the work of a legal assistant the same as the work ordinarily done by <Col N="1368" /> solicitors, including by the solicitors in the Office of the Chief State Solicitor. This specialist legal advice as well as the experience of actual conduct of litigation and of the courts are key requirements for the positions and are found in the type of advisory and advocacy work and the experience of those who practise at the Bar.</P>
    <P>It is the case that there may be overlaps in some aspects of the roles and skills of a barrister and solicitor. This does not take away from the fact that there are areas of work which are more properly and better performed by solicitors on the one hand and other areas where the tasks are better and more properly performed by barristers on the other. Typically, the skills and experience needed in the position of legal assistant in the Office of the Attorney General are to be found in the barristers' profession.</P>
    <P>The State has quite reasonably and properly decided to organise the provision of its legal services in this way without discriminating or prejudicing the career prospects of either profession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach acknowledge that when it comes to appointing people to legal positions in the Attorney General's office, it is in the public interest that there is a broad group of people from whom new members of that office can be selected? Will he also acknowledge that since 1971, it has been open to members of the solicitors' profession, along with members of the barristers' profession, to act as advocates before the superior courts, that is, the High Court and the Supreme Court?</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that solicitors who specialise in a broad range of different areas of law frequently prepare opinions on issues of legal controversy no different that of barristers? Will he acknowledge that the rules now applicable to the selection of staff in the Attorney General's office reflect the approach of a bygone age and are no longer in the public interest?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, the legal profession in the State has, as Deputy Shatter correctly said, over the years organised itself into two separate and distinct branches with a well established division of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has followed that down through the years. The Bar allows familiarity with not just the formal rules by which the courts operate but the informal understanding and practices which are part of every legal system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Barristers coming to the Attorney General's office have practised at the Bar and have a particular understanding of litigation and how judges are likely to treat particular issues. They also have a special knowledge of the skills, strengths and weaknesses of practitioners at the Bar. I cannot stress enough that the Bar continues to provide highly qualified candidates with experience of the actual conduct of litigation, the courts and <Col N="1369" /> judges. That is the sort of advice the Attorney General requires of legal assistants, barristers, who work with him. That has been the division down through the years and it works well for solicitors. I do not think it works against them in any way.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>For the record &ndash; this is important for anyone who might think solicitors are, in some way, discriminated against by the State &ndash; the Office of the Chief State Solicitor has 91 professional solicitors and no barrister is eligible for appointment. There is the network of State solicitors, 32 professional solicitors, and no barrister is eligible for appointment to it. The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has 11 solicitors and barristers and both professions are eligible for appointment. The Attorney General's office has 21 legal assistants, barristers, who act as counsel to that office and have, by tradition, been recruited for their practice at the Bar. The figures speak for themselves. That is the system which has been followed down through the years to the advantage of solicitors. Some 80% of the legal posts are confined to solicitors and barristers have no way into them.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the secretary of the Law Society wrote to the Attorney General on 8 September of this year? Would he agree that the action taken by the Attorney General is in conflict with the principles underlying the strategic management initiative and the principle of equality of treatment of solicitors and barristers in respect of appointments to certain courts where the demarcation line between solicitors and barristers was removed by a previous Administration? Having regard to the considerable difficulty the Civil Service is having attracting professional staff to various posts across Departments, does he not regard this action by the Attorney General, who is a barrister, as tantamount to, in effect, running a closed shop?</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that there has been a trend in many professions for people to move from one professional area to another, that firms, in general, are providing a combination of services rather than specialist services and that that is the trend in the commercial world? What is the Taoiseach's view on moving towards a unification of the legal profession to one profession? Does he agree that there should be uniform rules if we are to continue with two professions where people could move from profession to the other with no more onerous rules applying for a movement in one direction than would apply to a movement in the opposite direction? Does he agree that equity should be introduced if we are not to go all the way and have a unified profession?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that whether we have a unified profession or two professions of law is not a matter to which the Government should be indifferent, that it is not a matter that can be left to the professions themselves because there is a public interest in having the maximum efficiency in the provision of legal advice and assistance for citizens, that the Government has a pre-eminent role in that matter and that it is not simply a matter for the two professions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of those points are reasonable. I, as Deputy Bruton has done before me, and others involved in the professions have read back over the arguments. It seems they have not moved much over the years. Looking back over the arguments, as a member of neither profession, and at what has happened in the accountancy profession, which I would know best, there seems to be a case one could put forward if they unified on how things could move. Otherwise, one will still come back to the same argument about who does things best. I have looked at the correspondence which does not seem to have changed too much &ndash; maybe 1970 is too far back &ndash; in recent decades. If the case was balanced on the basis of a unified profession, it would make a good deal of sense. I do not mean to be disrespectful, but every profession has the right to argue one way or the other. If what I am about to say is unfair, I apologise in advance, but it seems to be a case of &ldquo;what I have I hold and what you have I want&rdquo;. Such an approach will not resolve the argument. If both sections of this excellent profession were to move towards a unified profession, the position could be very different and the flexibilities mentioned by Deputy <Col N="1371" /> Bruton would be in place. Having read through the correspondence on this matter, I did not see one syllable to indicate that is a likely position as of now.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree the message being sent by the Attorney General's office regarding this restrictive practice, which excludes 80% of the legal profession from even being considered for these two posts, is contrary to every message about flexibility and adaptability, to the removal of demarcation lines and everything else that seems to have great application when one is talking to aircraft maintenance technicians in Aer Lingus but is immune in terms of people who wear wigs going about part of their daily work?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach did not fully answer my first question. In view of the shortage of professional staff throughout the Civil Service at national and local level, does the Taoiseach agree that flexibility is required and that a person who purports to be the president or tentative president of the radical party has an obligation to demonstrate flexibility and even some radicalism in the way in which he runs his office? Has the Taoiseach seen fit to consult the Attorney General on this matter and to reconsider it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No is the answer to that question. Having read extensively through the record in this regard not only for the term of the current Attorney General or previous Attorneys General, it is evident that there is consistency regarding this matter. Deputy Bruton made a fair point that if the legal professions were to come together for the purposes of regulation those issues could be dealt with. Apart from what several Attorneys General have said, from my reading of the file it is clear that it is their belief in terms of best practice they have continued to recruit fairly from the two professions on the basis of specialisation, as they have set down. As it happens solicitors are winning out at a rate of 80% to 20%. I do not think the case is made for the opposite position.</P>

The Taoiseach mentioned 11 parliamentary draftsmen, some of whom come from the solicitors' profession and some of whom come from the barristers' profession. How many come from the solicitors' profession and how many come from the barristers' profession?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach explain how the Government has made a policy decision to introduce a Courts and Court Officers Bill to extend eligibility to solicitors to be appointed directly to the <Col N="1373" /> High Court and Supreme Court at a time when the Attorney General's office does not regard people qualified and practising as solicitors as fit to prepare legal opinions or to be involved directly in other work involving that office? Will the Taoiseach acknowledge that for far too long the Attorney General's office has been the private preserve of the Bar Library and could he tell the House whether the reluctance of that office to extend judicial eligibility to solicitors to the superior courts is the reason for the long delay in publishing that legislation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct regarding that legislation and the line taken by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. As I do not have the breakdown regarding the 11 parliamentary draftsmen, I will ask my office to submit that information to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>With regard to these positions, this is a long-standing practice, but like many long-standing practices I am sure it could be changed. The file indicates this practice has been reviewed six or seven times, but successive Attorneys General have taken the view consistently that for reasons of specialisation this practice works well for them. I do not believe it is discriminatory because if it were the current balance would not exist. Successive Attorneys General have given their considered views on this matter, and not all their views are similar. They have given considered and lengthy points of view and the letters are on record, as the letters have gone to and fro between the professions. Rather than have someone here in ten years' time discussing this matter, if it is a source of annoyance to the Law Society, as it seems to be, it should examine Deputy Bruton's suggestion, with which I would find some favour.</P>

The digital media district will be developed as a creative centre for digital industries such as multimedia, Internet and electronic commerce content and applications.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year the Government established a new body, Digital Media Development Limited, to manage the development of the digital media district and co-ordinate with MediaLab Europe on behalf of the Government.

There have been two meetings so far, but it will be some time next year before the full financial commitment is decided. The board is in negotiations regarding an area in the public domain as a suitable property, but that has not been finalised. The board must also get a project team of full-time people to work on this. I hope not too much time is lost because the response through the IDA and Enterprise Ireland has been enormous. I hope the team to work on this and carry it forward can be organised. It will probably be necessary to involve a Department, IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland in this as it is that expertise which will be needed to drive it forward.

      <P>That issue has been raised and other countries have a lower VAT rate, but there are other issues also.

Members may have read the report published this summer on the matter or they may have visited the exhibitions and they will have seen the range of people involved, such as the large number of Massachusetts Institute of Technology students working on projects.</P>
      <P>Regarding the amount of money involved, it is either £21 million or £31 million &ndash; I will have to check in the Estimates, though I recall answering questions on that in the committee which dealt with the Estimates. There will be many private sector interests and State agencies involved. Resources will not be a problem here. The capacity to take on board the enormous range of people and companies that are interested will be the issue. There is interest from America and all over Europe and that is why I want to involve the IDA and Enterprise Ireland. I started this project with one person in the Department of the Taoiseach and it is not realistic to operate on that basis, as quite a large number of staff will be required &ndash; not from my Department, as they would not have the expertise, but IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland which are well suited to this.</P>

      <P>It does not expect the State to put money into this for it all to be risked. The organisation had great success earlier this year with controlling sound &ndash; that is worth billions to the organisation. When developing a children's toy, two young graduates invented a system to control sound without microphones. This invention will be worth billions. The individuals in question informed me that they could not expect anyone to invest in their project unless there was an opportunity to profit from it. They are anxious to do that, presumably because they want the money to aid their research. I do not believe there will be any difficulties in that regard.</P>

      <P>As already stated, final negotiations have not taken place in respect of that matter. The current site is being used on a temporary basis because a large amount of space is available there. The space to which I refer can be readily transferred to the company for its use and agreement may be reached regarding its permanent use. The company concerned is prepared to negotiate very favourable arrangements to facilitate the commencement of operations. The site is also located close to a number of third level institutions. Primarily, however, it is being used because the space is readily available at cheap rates.</P>

      <P>I hoped the company had backed off on that decision. However, the company must commence operations at some location because developments in this area are proceeding at a rapid rate. There was little interest in this area up to a few months ago, but now we have a good opportunity to move ahead. What will be the final outcome is a question for another day. However, the space provided to allow it to develop this summer has been useful and cheap.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>The Information Society Commission's recent report on how the general public is adapting to the information society presented a positive picture overall, with all the indicators showing that access to, and usage of, the new technology is steadily increasing. At the same time, the survey indicated that we appear to be no nearer to closing the digital divide, with those not working, or in non-skilled jobs, having very low rates of access.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to the written question last week, the Information Society Commission continues to focus on this key area of awareness, access and training in its programme of activities. An IT training roadshow is currently under way, with the deployment of a mobile computer classroom around the country to provide late adopters with access to basic computer and Internet training. A further initiative to promote greater access to new technology among the general public is the commission's Internet venue directory. This is a register of public Internet access points which can be accessed<i> via </i>the commission's website or by phoning a lo-call number. Plans are also in preparation for a radio series &ndash; which will complement the excellent &ldquo;dot.what?&rdquo; series co-funded by the commission with RTE &ndash; on the importance of new and emerging technology in everyday life. In addition, the commission is working with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and IBEC to provide a series of e-business master classes for SMEs around the country. This will build on the highly successful countrywide e-commerce business awareness campaign organised by the commission in conjunction with IBEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission's work in improving levels of awareness, access and training is only part of the picture. Other Departments and agencies are also active in this area, with, as examples, free Internet access being provided in our libraries and the provision of kiosks in employment offices to enable access to the FAS on-line jobs bank. Details are set out in the replies I provided to questions on 17 October last. In addition, an interdepartmental group, chaired by my Department, is working on a framework for an integrated strategy to ensure that everyone can participate in, and benefit from, the information society. The community-voluntary sector, with support from the State, is also doing valuable <Col N="1381" /> work in tackling access issues, particularly for late adopters.</P>
    <P>In addition to the activities I have already outlined, the Information Society Commission's work programme includes the preparation, with the assistance of its advisory groups, of its third comprehensive report to the Government on public policy on information society matters. The commission is also due to publish soon the results of a research project on best international practice for lifelong learning in the information society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe it is fair for second level schools to set project work and homework for students which, if they are to do their work properly, involves the use of computers at home?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That question is not relevant to matters dealt with by the Information Society Commission and should really be tabled to the Minister for Education and Science. However, I do not believe it is fair to pressurise young people into believing they should have a computer at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware &ndash; I can confirm this from first-hand experience &ndash; that schools are setting work which involves the use of a computer at home and that the families of students in the schools in question, one of which is attended by one of my children, would not be able to afford to purchase a computer for home use? This means that those students do not have the same opportunities to complete their homework as quickly as those who are fortunate enough to have a computer at home. Furthermore, if one lives in an area where there is not ready access to ISDN lines, etc., the operation of a computer is much slower so that people living in rural areas experience disadvantages not encountered by those living in other areas.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that there is a widening digital divide in this country and that it is not an academic issue because it affects children, old people and those living in rural areas who are gradually being cut off from mainstream society? Does he further agree that people are being left behind in this headlong rush towards the IT revolution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I already stated that in my reply. I am not aware of the schools in question but it would be unfair if children were expected to have the use of a computer at home. We would be doing well if half of the people in any given area had access to a computer at home. The Information Society Commission is doing an enormous amount of work to try to provide a framework for an integration strategy to ensure everyone can participate and benefit. Information days for old people were held last year in community centres throughout the country. Programmes are taking place which enable people to <Col N="1382" /> access FÁS centres, unemployment centres and shopping centres. However, those who have access to computers in school and at home have an advantage over those who do not have such access.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the fundamental source of most injustice in Ireland begins in schools? Will he agree that if there is injustice in relation to access to computers and the use of computers in schools, that injustice will last for the next 60 or 70 years as long as these people live?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Three years ago, there were no computers in 95% of schools. As a result of the IT 2000 programme, students have access to computers in all schools. A high proportion of schools throughout the country now have computer rooms. Obviously there is not a computer for every student but more schools now include computer studies on the curriculum. Students have more access to computers. Obviously, people cannot use these computers if they have left on the bus, but in many cases students have access to computers after school hours. Computers are also being used to access credit unions, social welfare centres and employment exchanges. As regards the point the Deputy made about broadband connectivity, whether 360 or global crossing throughout the country, that will be available for rural Ireland. This will take place in the next six months.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development</askee>
      <Quest>if he has any proposals to grant milk quota or compensation to those farmers whose milk quota was expropriated in the recent restructuring scheme because it had been leased during the reference period; if any consideration was given to the family circumstances or animal health considerations which might have motivated such farmers' decisions to lease out their quotas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[22945/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Deputy Dukes as spokesman on agriculture and wish him a pleasant stay in the job. I welcome also my constituency colleague, Deputy Sheehan, and Deputy Stanton. I cannot go to a Teagasc meeting or any <Col N="1383" /> such cosy occasion in west Cork without being harassed by Deputy Sheehan regarding disadvantaged areas and other agricultural matters.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that there was any expropriation of milk quotas under the restructuring scheme. The main objectives of the changes in the management of milk quotas are as follows: (i) to provide greater access to quota for small and medium sized producers at a reasonable cost and on a permanent basis; (ii) to replace the uncertainty that was a feature of the existing regime with a system which generated greater certainty and permanency in relation to quota transfers; (iii) to ensure the cost of milk quota did not become a constant drain on the profits from milk production and (iv) to maintain milk production within regions, particularly disadvantaged regions.</P>
      <P>Under the new milk quota regulations, it is no longer possible for quota holders to temporarily lease their milk quota where all the quota has been temporarily leased for the preceding three milk quota years, that is, 1997 to 1999, inclusive. However, such quota holders have a number of other options as follows: (i) transfer the milk quota with land to a family member; (ii) sell the milk quota into the restructuring scheme and (iii) resume milk production. Where a person is no longer entitled to temporarily lease his or her milk quota in accordance with the regulations, and where the option outlined is availed of, that person's son or daughter will have first priority, subject to certain conditions, to purchase up to an equivalent amount of milk quota under a subsequent milk quota restructuring scheme operated by the same milk purchaser.</P>
      <P>I also made provision that in certain exceptional circumstances a person may apply in writing for a declaration granting approval to make a temporary transfer of his or her quota for one further milk quota year. Among the circumstances taken into account were whether the producer was compelled by reasons of personal illness or animal disease to lease the quota and also whether there was an indication that the producer or a successor would resume milk production. A number of applications for such declarations were received in my Department and each one was judged on its merits. In those circumstances, it can clearly be seen that there was no expropriation of milk quotas under the restructuring scheme.</P>
      <P>The changes I introduced to the management of the quota system are in the interests of the industry as a whole and were made following wide consultation with the industry, including the widely representative milk quota review group. They have been welcomed across the sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his kind welcome to my colleagues and me. I have every hope that kind of relationship between us will be of very short duration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1384" /> Given that the Minister does not accept there have been expropriations, how does he explain this to a person who for whatever reason was unable to involve himself in milk production for three years, leased his quota and now finds his quota has been discontinued? These people have no option but to hand over the quota. Is that anything other than expropriation? How many applications were made to or granted, if any, by the Department for different treatment on the basis of either animal health problems or health problems of the owner of the farm? </P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept there was expropriation of milk quotas under the present restructuring scheme. Such quota holders have three options, that is, to transfer the milk quota to a family member, resume milk production or sell the milk quota into the restructuring scheme.</P>
      <P>Regarding the second part of the Deputy's question, the Department has received 170 applications for hardship or exceptional cases, more than 160 of which have already been examined. Some 85 of these applications have been granted an exemption because of exceptional circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister repeated that people have three options. At what price do those who eventually sell their quota under these arrangements have to do so? In the event that no family member wishes to continue milk production, does this seriously reduce the options available? Will the Minister agree, in light of the information he has given to me, that half the applications that have been granted reveal situations in which it is agreed that the application of the strict terms of the scheme is inappropriate and that the scheme was inappropriately cast in the first instance? If half the applications are justified on the basis of hardship, does he agree the scheme has been written too harshly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>First, the price is £1.36 per gallon. Second, of the 170 applications, 160 have been examined and 85 have been approved, which is slightly in excess of half.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>So far half the applications received have been justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Some 170 applications were submitted. One hundred and sixty were examined and ten more remain to be examined. Some 85 of the 160 applications is slightly more than half. Slightly more than half the applications have been approved. The fact that 170 only of the 30,000 milk producers applied for consideration under the schemes indicates that a relatively small number felt they were exceptional cases. The scheme provides options for people and those who have exceptional circumstances because of family illness or animal disease are treated in a very humane and sympathetic way by the section of the Department which deals with these issues.</P>

      <P>EU Regulation 1804/1999, which governs the organic livestock sector, came into effect on 24 August 2000. This Regulation supplemented regulation 2092/91 which had already governed the organic crop sector since 1992. As the competent authority, my Department has had to put measures in place to give effect to regulation 1804/1999. In doing so, my Department had regard to the recommendation in the AgriFood 2010 report that a credible regulatory system be put in place for the organic sector and that the existing confusion between competing inspection bodies be ended. In response to that recommendation, I undertook to streamline the inspection arrangements. My objective is to ensure that all organic farmers and processors have ready access to the most efficient, transparent and consistent arrangements for inspection and certification, and to encourage new entrants to the sector.</P>
      <P>To that end, my Department has put proposals to the three bodies which had been approved to inspect organic crop produce under regulation 2091/92 &ndash; Demeter Standards Limited, Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association and Organic Trust &ndash; for a unified inspection and certification system which will achieve this objective while allowing the three bodies to continue to operate their own arrangements, where their own members are concerned, as heretofore. My Department has since had a number of meetings and other contacts with the three bodies to clarify these proposals. Furthermore, at their request, my Department has agreed to assist with funding to engage a facilitator to help the three bodies in their negotiations with one another.</P>
      <P>A considerable amount of time and effort has been expended to date in endeavouring to assist the three bodies to arrive at a resolution of issues associated with the establishment of a unified inspection and certification system. I understand the three bodies are still considering the Department's proposals and I am hopeful of an early and positive response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the new regulation 1804 has already come into effect, final decisions on the practical aspects of its application must be taken as a matter of urgency. Pending the outcome of this process, the approval which the three organic farming bodies <Col N="1386" /> were given in 1993 to carry out the inspection function will remain in effect.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>

    <P>
      <i>
      </i>While my Department has had numerous and lengthy discussions with the three organic farming bodies both on the inspection and certification arrangements for organic farming and also on the standards to apply to the organic livestock sector, a number of groups of organic producers have also made approaches to my Department independently of the three bodies to offer their own comments and recommendations.</P>
    <P>The AgriFood 2010 committee also recommended the establishment of an organic development committee and I accepted that recommendation. I am seeking to ensure that the committee includes representatives of the widest interests in the organic sector including those involved in production, marketing, distribution and retailing, as well as the areas of research, training, advice and regulation. The remit of the committee is to recommend a coherent development strategy to achieve expansion in production, processing and marketing of Irish organic produce and to secure an increased share of the growing national and export markets, and to consider the broad actions necessary for the most advantageous long-term future development of the Irish organic sector while protecting its integrity. I envisage that the organic development committee will convene for the first time within the next few weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>My Labour Party colleagues and I agree it was a bad decision to lower standards. It is not good enough that lower standards apply to the production of organic produce. What consultations were held between those representing the interests of the organic industry in Ireland and the Department? Who was represented at such discussions? Has the Department agreed recently to revise some of its proposals to lower organic food standards? Why does it refuse to accept current standards and insist on taking over the administration of organic standards? What level of expertise and experience has it in administering organic standards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The organic sector operates three different standards at present. This follows ten years of discussion to get European agreement on what should be an organic standard. We asked the three bodies concerned to come forward with a unified response. We are prepared to pay a facilitator to help them to do so but we have not had a reaction from them. To date it has been impossible for them to meet the facilitator. I hope they will do so on 1 November.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is division among them already but we are hoping a meeting will be held with the facilitator on 1 November. These are the <Col N="1387" /> standards agreed by the EU and they will apply to the importation of organic food from other countries that have accepted them. Less than 1% of farming here is organic and this provides an opportunity for more farmers to commence organic farming. In Austria there were 2,000 organic farmers in 1992 and there are now 20,000. It affords an opportunity to have one Irish organic standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State said that the changes in regard to organic farming were based on the findings of the AgriFood 2010 committee. How many members of that committee have expertise in organic food production? Does the regulation not permit us to set our own standards? Rather than lowering standards to a common EU one, can we not be individualistic and set our own? Britain will do so and we will lose market share there. Is that not the import of this? We are dragging standards down instead of raising them. Will the Minister of State postpone or withdraw the proposed changes to the certification system until the facilitator has been put in place and negotiations have concluded?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in all our interests that the three bodies come together. We would like them to be the inspection body for it. While they can inspect to the lower level &ndash; what the Deputy assumes is the European level &ndash; they have a glorious opportunity to promote the higher level under one Irish organic standard not three standards. Less than 6% of people recognise any Irish organic logo at present. I know a number of bodies have been very co-operative in this area but there are difficulties. I hope common sense will prevail on 1 November. We have already accepted changes in regard to animals being born on a farm. Poultry is an area where we must be careful because other people can import allegedly organic eggs.</P>

      <P>Following judgments in the Supreme Court in 1997 in favour of a number of plaintiffs who were producers following development plans in the 1980s, this matter was referred to the High Court for assessment of damages. The High Court has already dealt with a number of those cases. The proceedings in the High Court concern some 110 plaintiffs involved <Col N="1388" /> in the original case, known as the Duff case, and in associated cases.</P>
      <P>No special provision has been made in respect of any persons or group of persons who are not party to the proceedings in the Duff case and other associated cases. I have received legal advice to the effect that any proceedings that may be initiated by such persons are barred by the passage of time. I have not as yet made any decision on the allocation of the second tranche of additional milk quota for this country negotiated by me as part of the Agenda 2000 agreement. Before taking a decision on this, I will, as is normal, consult with the relevant social partners and the widely representative milk quota review group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to consulting with the social partners will the Minister consult with his colleagues in this House? Is he aware that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture and the Marine has unanimously recommended that measures similar to those taken by the courts in relation to cases that came before them should be applied to people whose cases did not come before the courts? Is he aware the committee recommended that the same treatment be applied to them? To plead that these cases are statute barred is to continue a blatant injustice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the advice I have received from the Attorney General on this matter. The position is that the Department met this group on at least four occasions over the past few months. The additional milk quota will be due for allocation in the next few months and, following consultations with the relevant social partners and the milk review group, the application by this group will be taken into account together with that of other groups seeking additional quotas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that this group is in a different position from other groups in that its grievance has been in existence since the early 1980s? Will he forego the use of the now rather threadbare O'Rourke defence, as it might be called, of &ldquo;This happened when you were there and you did not do anything about it&rdquo;? His colleague the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, is inclined to use that defence all the time. Does he agree that, unfortunately, over the period since 1983 we have had Fianna Fáil Ministers for Agriculture more often that Fine Gael Ministers? I say that as a matter of regret. If the Minister feels I am to be criticised on that basis, would he not agree there must have been large<Col N="1389" /> scale lack of sympathy on the part of Fianna Fáil Ministers, including his genial self, who did nothing during that period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We can rewrite the history books but history books will not produce one gallon of milk on a farm. The Minister is in a position to do something about the matter and he should do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>They will have the same hope as the other groups. Like the younger farm groups in Deputy Connaughton's constituency, the Macra na Feirme delegations which have come to me to seek additional milk quota and a range of other groups such as the exceptional cases mentioned by Deputy Dukes. There are more farmers seeking milk quotas than there is quota available for them. This group will be considered with the other groups who are seeking additional milk quota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I invite the Minister to come to the committee to discuss this issue with us. Does the Minister not agree that the people about whom we speak, because of the long-standing nature of their claim, are entitled to more than consideration with the other groups? Is it not disingenuous of the Minister to lump this group &ndash; a group where the injustice was deliberately created by this year's milk restructuring scheme &ndash; with everyone else and say they must be treated on the same basis? Will the Minister at least agree that the group concerned in this question should be given a degree of priority in the allocation of available quota?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>

      <P>The new scheme of early retirement from farming, which forms part of my Department's rural development plan, was approved by the European Commission on 28 September 2000. The detailed provisions of the new scheme have been the subject of consultation with the farming organisations in accordance with commitments in the protocol on direct payments to farmers arising from the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. These consultations have been concluded and the necessary scheme documentation, including terms and conditions and application forms, is being finalised. The scheme of early retirement from farming will commence in about four weeks.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree it is more than 12 months since the old farm retirement scheme was discontinued? What will happen to farmers who would have qualified for a pension if the new scheme had been introduced as soon as the old one ceased? Why has it taken 12 months for the EC to approve the new scheme? Did the Department delay in applying for approval of the new scheme? On what exact date will application forms for the new scheme be issued by the Department and when can the farmers concerned apply for the farm retirement scheme?

I am glad Deputy Sheehan is happy that part-time farmers can join the scheme if 25%, not 50%, of their income comes from farming. Equally transferees who derive 25% of their income from farming qualify for the farm retirement scheme. The new rate will be £10,624 and will be paid for a maximum of ten years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department operates a wide range of monitoring and surveillance systems to ensure traceability, quality assurance and verifiable standards and safety of Irish food. At farm level, the measures cover animal registration and identification, disease control, animal health and <Col N="1392" /> welfare, animal feed, animal remedies and environmental protection. At processing level, all processing establishments operate according to licensing or approval systems under the control and supervision of the Department, or, in the case of establishments producing solely for the domestic market, under the control and supervision of the local authorities. The animal feed sector is also regulated.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government established the Food Safety Authority of Ireland which has primary responsibility for the protection of public health by ensuring that food consumed, distributed, marketed or produced in the State meets the highest standards of food safety and hygiene.</P>
      <P>Specific initiatives taken by my Department include the continued operation of disease eradication schemes, the establishment of the computerised cattle movement monitoring system &ndash; CMMS &ndash; the introduction of the dairy hygiene scheme, the development of a national beef assurance scheme, the operation of HACCP systems at meat production plants, the introduction of a requirement for residue monitoring programmes at all such plants, the introduction of compulsory origin labelling for Irish beef, the development of an identification system for Irish sheep, the BSE surveillance and control programmes, the pesticides control service, the plant health inspection system, seed testing etc.</P>

Does he also agree that an outbreak of food poisoning or contamination identified abroad as being associated with Irish food could jeopardise the reputation of the entire Irish food sector? Does he further agree that it is not enough to say that Ireland produces safe food, that we must be able to prove scientifically that it does, that traceability, quality assurance and verifiable standards must now be product specifications, that state-of-the-art surveillance systems are required, and that much work needs to be done in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for tabling this question because the two matters which have moved to the top of the queue in recent years domestically and on foreign food markets are food safety and animal welfare. An outbreak of food poisoning would affect our food industry more than any other, given that we export food products to about 65 countries world wide From recent food scares, particularly the dioxin problem in Belgium and listeria and salmonella poisoning in various other countries, I know it would <Col N="1393" /> cause severe problems for the economy. Every possible strata of control systems is in place as part of a belt and braces approach. Dr. Pat Wall does a very good job. Whenever there is a question about food quality and hygiene he communicates straight away and with great authority. Any time the importance of food safety at all levels, production, processing and distribution, is highlighted I welcome it. I give an assurance to the House and consumers, both in Ireland and our markets world wide that every possible precaution is taken to ensure the safety of Irish food.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Organic food is one of the fastest growing segments of the European food market, albeit from a small base. The principal factors driving the growth of organic foods are consumer concerns about health and safety, animal welfare and other environmental considerations. Irish consumers are driven by similar concerns and <Col N="1394" /> producers are reacting to these concerns with a view to supplying the demand that now exists for organic produce.</P>
      <P>To date the organic market in Ireland has been relatively limited, but the retail chains are showing greater interest and this is expected to lead to an expansion in the market. Organic production has grown, with around 1,000 registered producers and some 30,000 hectares in organic production or conversion in 1999.</P>
      <P>The total market for organic foods in Ireland is estimated to range between £20 million and £25 million or less than 1% of the total retail food market. Major opportunities now exist for Irish organic producers to significantly increase market share, both on domestic and export markets. It is anticipated that the quantity of organic food produced in Ireland will continue to grow.</P>
      <P>I am committed to the development of the organic sector with substantial funding being made available in the national development plan to ensure continued support for organic farming. Some £1.6 billion earmarked for the new REP scheme in the period to 2006 will enable up to 70,000 farmers to participate. The facility to undertake Supplementary Measure 6 on organic farming for such a large number of farms could have a significant impact on the growth of the organic sector. The national development plan also includes funding of £6 million for the development of the organic sector under the regional programmes for the Border, midland and western region and the south and east region.</P>
      <P>I am aware of concerns raised in relation to the livestock standards to apply in Ireland and my Department's proposal to streamline the inspection system. Standards for organic crop produce had been fixed since 1991 by EU Regulation 2092/91. When Regulation 1804/99 covering the livestock sector was introduced on 24 August, my Department had proposed to adopt standards for such produce in accordance with the regulation. Following further discussions on the issue with interested parties, including the three private organic bodies and other stakeholders in the organic sector, my Department has moved significantly to address a number of points of concern in relation to the origin of animals and the minimum conversion period. Other issues may be considered subsequently by the Organic Development Committee.</P>
      <P>I am confident the standards now being set for the organic sector will provide every reassurance to retailers and consumers as to the quality and integrity of Irish organic produce, without compromising the competitiveness of Irish organic producers. My objective is to ensure the continuing growth of the organic sector as part of mainstream farming in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The AgriFood 2010 report recommended that a credible regulatory system be put in place for the organic sector and that the existing confusion between competing inspection bodies be ended. In response I undertook to streamline the inspection arrangements. My objective is to ensure all <Col N="1395" /> organic farmers and processors have ready access to the most efficient, transparent and consistent arrangements for inspection and certification. My Department has recently put proposals to the three private bodies for a unified inspection and certification system which will achieve this objective while allowing the three bodies to continue to operate their own private arrangements where their own members are concerned as heretofore. I understand the three bodies are considering these proposals and I hope to receive a positive response.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State accept that the Government made a disastrous mistake in adopting the lowest organic standards in Europe? Will he confirm that Ireland is the only European country to adopt and implement the EU minimum standard which is based on Regulation 2092/91 as amended by Regulation 1804/99 and operational from 24 August? Does he accept that in doing so we are effectively closing the door for Irish organic exports to EU countries which will be operating to a higher standard, in particular the United Kingdom?</P>

      <P>It is the right of any individual to apply this standard in Ireland, but I understand from individuals with knowledge of the organic sector that retail outlets will not apply it. We are allowing the three inspection bodies to operate a unified inspection system under which they will apply the minimum standard while continuing to operate their own arrangements in order to ensure there is one organic logo for the entire country. Only 6% of people recognise any of the three existing standards. This is an opportunity for the organic movement to move ahead and promote the sector in a much more dedicated marketing system.</P>

      <P>Those are specific questions that are not related to this issue. A sum of £1.6 billion has been allocated to the REP scheme, which will include some organic materials. A further £6 million has been allocated to the promotion of the organic system. We are prepared to fund a facilitator within the system to bring the three bodies together to agree on one system because of difficulties in the past when they disagreed. They all have different standards. Now that they have a plan agreed we are anxious that on 1 November they will come together with the facilitator we are prepared to pay for to operate the scheme. This would help their own organisations and make it cheaper for them to have an inspection done.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister of State not accept that the obvious way forward is to establish an organic development committee, to allow it to work out what is best for the future development of the organic sector, to defer changes until the committee has produced its findings and then to take action?

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94 and 148 together.</P>
      <P>Dairying plays a central role in the agricultural and wider economy in Ireland. The sector accounts for over one third of gross agricultural output and includes 30,000 dairy farmers and almost 8,000 people directly employed in processing.</P>
      <P>The price paid to milk producers ultimately depends on a number of factors, including a combination of the efficiency of the processing, marketing and distribution operations, the type of products produced and market returns available from these products at any given time and the level of underlying support under the EU dairy regime. While the costs of milk production vary across the sector, studies indicate that the average cost of milk production in 1998 was 13.8 pence per litre. The annualised weighted average price paid by processors to farmers for liquid milk under National Milk Agency contracts was 25 pence per litre.</P>
      <P>My Department has no function in setting the retail price of milk or milk products. Matters related to competition and to the functioning of the market at retail level are for the Competition Authority and the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs. However, it is clear that if producers cannot recoup the cost of production supply patterns will be disrupted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that milk is available to consumers at the lowest possible price, which at the same time protects those involved in dairy farming and production?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is competition in this market. The worry is that milk at consumer level will be sold by retailers at below the cost of production. A serious problem would then arise because producers need a margin. This applies especially to liquid milk producers because they must supply all year, including in the winter period when the cost of production is much greater than it is for manufacturing milk. There must be a margin for all concerned in this cycle and there is a reasonable balance at present.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I confirm the matter the Deputy alluded to, but below cost selling is not precluded under the Groceries Order. There is no evidence that retailers are selling at below the invoice price received from co-operatives. The difficulty arises if processors come under increasing pressure to further reduce the price of milk. There must be a margin for the farmer and the processor.</P>
      <P>The consumer wants the produce at the cheapest price. Deputy Callely is rightly concerned about the consumers in his constituency. As a rural Deputy I am concerned about the margin for the farming community. There needs to be a balance. In the first instance it is a matter for the Competition Authority and the Director of Consumer Affairs to ensure that there is a reasonable balance. A good quality product &ndash; milk &ndash; is available to people at a reasonable price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome these questions, especially the one in the name of Deputy Callely. I initially thought he was only interested in the providers of milk. I am a provider. I produce liquid milk on the home farm.</P>
      <P>There must be a balance here. Is the Minister clear about the difficulties in the industry? Is he certain that milk is not being sold below cost? I do not believe farmers would have picketed in County Donegal in recent weeks if there was not a problem there.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that some of the companies selling milk at 80p or 82p per litre were selling water at £1 per litre? Does he agree that it does not make sense that milk, which must first be produced by a cow, then milked by a farmer, put through a processing plant and delivered by hand or shop to the consumer&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important question, especially if the present trend continues. Is the Minister satisfied that people will remain in liquid milk production? If they do not the consumer will suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is pressure on liquid milk farmers, first, because it is an all year around activity. Producing milk in the winter is very costly. It is at least 20% more costly than manufacturing milk. The younger generation of producers will not continue in milk production 365 days a year. They will need a break like people in all other sectors of the economy. In addition, there is a squeeze on the margins. There is a sizeable margin for the retailers, less of a margin for the processors and less again for the farmer producers.</P>
      <P>This balance must be maintained. We are at the limit of it at present. If farmers are squeezed any further in terms of their margins there could be a shortage in the supply of milk to urban areas, as there was in the 1920s and 1930s. That would have serious consequences and we cannot allow it to happen.</P>

      <P>I confirm that we have a longer growing season in Cork. I confirm also that the standards of food safety and hygiene under which the milk is produced is up to both domestic regulatory standards and EU standards. Not all of it is produced in the Republic. Some milk is coming freely from the North, for example, but we have to accede to that under the Single European Act.</P>
      <P>In relation to Deputy Deasy's question, that is the subject of Question No. 145, but I can say that the matter he has referred to is a serious one. It is the largest milk pool in the country and it is one that is being monitored very closely by both the Department and the State agencies to which he referred.</P>

      <P>The beef task force monitoring committee is responsible for implementing those recommendations in the report of the beef task force relating to export promotion, price transparency, graded pricing and mechanical classification. Considerable progress had been made within the monitoring committee on the establishment of a voluntary beef promotion fund late last year but this was put on hold following the dispute between the meat factories and farmers last January.</P>
      <P>The monitoring committee has also made substantial progress on market price transparency and, in particular, on a price reporting model. I understand agreement has not yet been reached on the way independent verification will be applied. I should point out, however, that the Department publishes, on a weekly basis, prices paid by named meat plants for steers, heifers and cows by grade and on an individual factory basis, and this has introduced an unprecedented degree of transparency into the market place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to graded pricing and mechanical classification, the task assigned to the monitoring committee is to review progress in these areas. Primary responsibility for the implementation of a graded pricing system rests with the beef pro<Col N="1402" /> cessing industry itself and while I appreciate that some progress has been made in this area, bigger differentials are needed to encourage the production of the type of high quality beef in demand, particularly on the European market.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>As far as mechanical classification is concerned, my Department, in conjunction with three developers from Denmark, Australia and Germany, has organised two trials to test the accuracy of three machines in classifying carcases against the EUROP carcase classification scale and in estimating meat yield. The trials showed that mechanical classification has potential but needs to be improved if it is to replace visual assessment. The European Commission has also proposed a draft regulation setting down the standards for the approval of machines. A pilot test is due to be carried out in Germany next month in order to check the appropriateness of these standards. The definitive standards will be set down early next year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday evening I made the point that in view of the teacher shortage the Minister might consider that talented teachers are engaged in initiatives, such as the home-school liaison scheme. Is it always necessary to assign a teacher to such schemes? We believe in partnership between the school, the community and parents. At a time when we need teachers at the chalkface, perhaps the Minister and his officials, together with the teacher unions whose agreement would be necessary, might consider the possibility of assigning some of the functions currently carried out by teachers, such as those in the home-school liaison scheme, to other professionals and people who could be suitably trained to do that job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point raised in the discussion on teacher shortages at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Science yesterday <Col N="1406" /> evening was that many programmes promoted by the Department of Education and Science, the Minister and the Government have drawn teachers with a great deal of talent and expertise out of the system. They are seconded in many cases to the Department of Education and Science and other organisations, such as the NCVA and the curriculum development unit. Often the most talented and creative teachers are taken out of a school and used to promote these programmes. That is as it should be because many teachers have great initiative. However, perhaps we might consider putting a temporary restriction on the further release of teachers at a time when their talents might be better used in a classroom.</P>
    <P>There was a high level of unemployment among the teaching profession in the 1980s and many teachers went to work abroad, particularly in the UK. Many of these might be encouraged to return home to work. I know FÁS has been involved in international employment fairs, particularly throughout Europe. Such fairs might give us an opportunity to encourage teachers to return home.</P>
    <P>Other issues which will come within the remit of the Teaching Council include remuneration for teachers working in areas of serious disadvantage and specific training for people where teaching is a strain, particularly remedial and special teachers. I know they get an allowance but I am not sure it is adequate to compensate for the work required. The cost of living allowance applies in London and the nursing profession seems to be calling for it to be introduced here. If we want to retain teachers of the best calibre in the Dublin area in particular, we must try to ensure they are properly remunerated.</P>
    <P>As regards training, every student teacher should be asked to teach in a school in an area where conditions in terms of the environment, home background and educational attainment are not perfect. That was one of the things I and my colleagues did when we were training for the teaching profession. Schools were not designated as educationally disadvantaged in those days. In one of our three periods of two-week classroom teaching we went to schools which were known to have difficulties and we knew what we would face.</P>
    <P>I am a great believer in the Early Start and Breaking the Cycle initiatives. I know these programmes are costly but they are extremely worthwhile in a school and a community. Perhaps the Minister will consider how they can be expanded.</P>
    <P>Large numbers of people who do not have the necessary qualifications work in schools. Creative ways of providing after school, weekend and summer training should be considered to allow people to enter the teaching profession. They have a big role to play. I said yesterday evening that everyone is not burnt out at 65 years of age. It is worth looking at the possibility of allowing teachers to work in certain circumstances where they are needed until they are 68 years of age. <Col N="1407" /> This provision used to apply in the primary school sector.</P>
    <P>This Bill will significantly enhance the image and position of teachers and give them a role in the regulation of their profession. Issues such as teacher supply and the welfare and disciplining of teachers must be examined. I know it will take time to enact the Bill but I warmly welcome it. I commend the Minister on introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo. I welcome the introduction of the Bill. The general aim of the Bill is to promote teaching as a profession and the professional development of teachers, to maintain and improve the quality of teaching in the State, to provide for the establishment of standards for education and training of teachers, to provide for the registration and regulation of teachers, to enhance professional standards and competence and to establish a Teaching Council. This is an all-embracing concept as regards the council but I hope it is not aspirational and I wonder if the commitment exists to achieve it. I would be happy if the Minister indicated that he and the Government are wholeheartedly behind the Bill.</P>
      <P>I raise these doubts for a number of reasons. This Bill has been on the Minister's, and his predecessor's, desk in the Department for two and a half years. If there was a vitality and a determination to bring this concept forward the Bill would have come before the House long ago. I accept that much consultation took place which is very important, and the teachers' unions are satisfied with and support this idea. I attended many teachers' conferences at Easter and one knows what immediate policy demands exist for the years to come. Ministers often take on board many of the suggestions which arise at such conferences as they are the most important statements made by the teachers' unions.</P>
      <P>However, it has taken two and a half years for this Bill to come before the House and there is no financial commitment in the Bill towards the council. In his speech the Minister referred to unspecified registration fees. Will the budget at the disposal of the council, its director and members derive from these unspecified registration fees? I do not know whether the fee will be £50, £100 or whatever annually. I would like the Minister to give a commitment that whatever resources the Teaching Council requires will be made available by him and the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly suspicious that the Minister has to ask the Minister for Finance for financial support for the council. I have been involved in education all my life and the Department and the Minister for Finance have always tightly controlled the financial reins when it comes to education. The situation is no different today. One could go through the list of inadequacies in education. Some school buildings are centuries old. We have made efforts to improve them but many are totally inadequate for children and teachers. <Col N="1408" /> I am somewhat concerned that the Department of Finance will strangle this council to death because it will not make the necessary finance available to make it work.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes grand clichés about improving the status and morale of teachers. However, the majority of teachers are threatening a seven-day strike because they have lost their enthusiasm for teaching due to the physical conditions in which they work and the remuneration they receive. I will give the Minister one example of what I am talking about. What other professional group would wait for 28 years to reach the top of the pay scale? This system means that if I had stayed teaching a bricklayer would earn more than me after five years' training and all my years of experience.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not meeting the teachers to settle this situation. Such a settlement would mean we can continue to provide education so that young people sitting examinations next June will not be denied their entitlements. The onus is on the Minister to introduce a proper pay structure for teachers.</P>
    <P>The threat of strike action does not just apply to the ASTI. The TUI has stated that it is seeking a 30% plus pay increase. The teaching profession is entitled to a just remuneration for its services. The platitudes in the Minister's speech are welcome but they are meaningless when almost 16,000 ASTI members have decided that enough is enough and they want proper pay and working conditions. Most Members would support the teachers in this request. I call on the Minister to use whatever muscle he has to bring about a settlement with the Department of Finance which will have the ultimate say in releasing funding for this structure.</P>
    <P>Teachers receive a degree allowance of £1,000 plus and a higher diploma allowance of £90 plus. Is the Minister suggesting that this would make anyone enthusiastic about entering the teaching profession? Would such allowances boost anyone's morale? These allowances work out at pence per week after tax but that is what teachers are receiving.</P>

      <P>The Minister in his Second Stage speech said the Bill was to promote the continuing education, training and professional development of teachers. Acquiring a degree and a diploma are part of that objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department has shown inadequate recognition of the development of teachers. The Mini<Col N="1409" /> ster will know that many new programmes were introduced at various levels by successive Ministers down the years. However, these programmes were implemented at school level on a pittance. I say that because where in-service training was provided, the Department conducted it in the evenings if it was available. In addition, the teacher got £18 for a day's in-service training. When the new programme for the junior certificate was inaugurated, we all went on in-service courses, schools were closed and we suffered accusations from various groups, including the media. On one topical morning show, our great supporter, the name of whom I dare not mention, continually harped on the idea that teachers were not in the classroom. They were out of class improving ways in which they could deliver this programme. The reason I say this is that even today the in-service training provided by the Department of Education and Science to improve the professional delivery of the education service is appalling. If the Minister is serious about the Bill and all the related topics I mentioned in the opening paragraph, he must seriously consider ways in which in-service training for teachers can be done properly. It should be part of policy that every seven to ten years teachers should be allowed one year out to replenish themselves regarding the changes taking place and to examine their involvement in education. It is necessary to recharge one's batteries every so often and, therefore, the Minister must examine ways in which this can be incorporated as a necessity, not just as a perk. Some people would say they may have a year out, but it must be a year out with full pay so they can recharge their batteries, replenish themselves and return with great enthusiasm to the classroom. That might be to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's liking.</P>
    <P>The two issues I mentioned, and primarily the long delay in bringing forward the legislation, makes me doubt the enthusiasm and sincerity with which this matter is being taken on board by the Minister, despite his plaudits last night in his speech. There is also the question of finance. I see no evidence of a commitment to provide finance.</P>
    <P>There is also the matter of the appointments to the Teaching Council. The director of the Teaching Council and his staff will be appointed. Where will the council be located? This is an important question. If it is to be an autonomous body, will the Minister locate it in an annex in a building of the Department of Education and Science? Will he give it a building of its own and staff not seconded from the Department of Education and Science or officers previously employed by the Department who have been moved sideways and called director and staff of the Teaching Council? It is important that everything is done openly and transparently and that there are no shortcuts. If the concept, which is a good one and which is welcomed extensively by the partners involved in education, is progressed in a positive way, it will survive the test of time. However, if shortcuts are taken for reasons seen as necessary by the Mini<Col N="1410" /> ster or his officials, the Minister will sound an early death knell for the council, and that would be regrettable. Will the Minister indicate if he proposes to advertise initially for the post of director and the staff? I hope that, as in the case of the appointment of District Court judges, Ministers will not claim that a person they know would be a fine person for a position on this new council. I hope the Minister will indicate that, as this is to be established as a new council, everything about it will be new and it will be serviced properly.</P>
    <P>I welcome the composition of the council in so far as the hallmark by which we would judge the effectiveness of a self-regulating body is how well it can regulate itself. That is why it is important that there is a good representation on it from the teaching bodies. I have the utmost confidence that when providing professional training and supporting professional staff, one could find no better people than practising teachers. I am pleased, therefore, that the Minister has included a majority of teachers in the membership of 37, and that it is also related to the teacher training areas.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that the Minister is making sure there will be national representation in addition to the other personnel within the council. I also hope the council will have a gender balance because an increasing number of teachers at primary level are female. While I welcome the fact that they are taking up posts as principal teachers which were not open to them in the past, there is also a need for a gender balance. It is patently obvious that the number of male teachers at any level is decreasing rapidly. Has the Department conducted any research on that matter? If that trend continues, there will be consequences. I do not mean to be critical of the ever increasing female presence in the teaching profession, but it will inevitably have its downside. This relates to what I said earlier about pay, structure and conditions and the fact that alternative more lucrative careers are easy to find. There is no point in continuing to work in a profession because it is satisfying. If the remuneration, which is a priority for everyone, is not satisfactory, there will be difficulties.</P>
    <P>The consultation on the Bill has been excellent, but it will all come to naught if there is a body of teachers who are frustrated and whose remuneration and working conditions are inadequate. If that is the case, this country will be the loser. Ministers have always held up the education system as the flagship of our current prosperity. We must continue to do this and the only way that can be done is by the Minister meeting the teachers as a matter of urgency to resolve the current crisis.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to contribute to the debate on the Teaching Council Bill. It is hard to believe that it is only now that we are establishing an independent statutory agency to oversee the standards, policies and procedures for the education and training of teachers while also establishing a professional code of conduct. Such a move, which has been made in full consultation with the partners in education over a two and half year time span and which had been called for in 1991 and again in 1992 in the Green Paper, will benefit all those involved in education whether teachers, pupils or parents.  As a former teacher, I fully endorse the principle that teachers should have their professional role recognised in a formal manner by the State. They should have a council that can promote teaching as a profession, establish, review and maintain codes of professional conduct for teachers, establish and maintain a register of teachers, establish and promote standards in programmes of teacher education and training, promote the continuing education, training and professional development of teachers, conduct inquiries where appropriate, impose sanctions in relation to fitness to teach, conduct or commission research, represent the teaching profession on educational issues and provide advice to the Minister. That is no small remit for any group to undertake.</P>
      <P>That the majority of the 37 member council will be made up of teachers, teacher training colleges, parents' associations and management bodies, who will be elected by teachers, is a very important starting point. As in any other profession, a professional teaching council will develop a constantly evolving profession. There will be a true ability, through this Bill, for teachers to shape their own future and effectively contribute to education policy. This makes sense given that those who are at the coal face are perhaps the ones with the greatest knowledge and expertise. As the Minister said, this will confirm the status of teachers, entitle teachers to regulate their own affairs and empower teachers giving them greater responsibility for the standards and quality of Irish education.</P>
      <P>Similarly, I fully accept that as a profession which has and will continue to have an impact on every young life, there should be a professional code of conduct so that students and parents can be confident that their teachers are well qualified and competent individuals and that there is a clear course of action that can be followed should parents or students feel these standards are not being met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It goes without saying that teaching is a very highly regarded profession, and rightly so. Our teachers are, in the main, responsible and caring individuals who have the interests of their students to the fore often above and beyond the call of duty. Everyone of us can point to a number of teachers who would have fitted into this category when we were going through the education system. I am delighted to say that through my work in the House, I am continually heartened by <Col N="1412" /> the devotion that many teachers display to their students. These people who stand out in our thoughts act above and beyond the call of duty.</P>
    <P>Investment in education has been the foundation and cornerstone of the Celtic tiger and our continued growth will depend on how much emphasis we place on our education system. This is a lesson I have learned in my constituency as we now face the consequences of, for example, the collapse of an industry that was a factor that assisted us in achieving a record of having 60% of an adult population who are early school leavers. Now is the time to reinforce the good work already begun in education. This Bill, which links into similar work in the North of Ireland, will not only have a symbolic but a real value throughout the island.</P>
    <P>One major problem is that a teacher has, in a sense, no definition &ndash; there is no boundary. Sometimes a teacher is a social worker, always a role model, sometimes even a mother or a father, a mentor and obviously an educator. There is no definition, no set criteria, as to where this job starts and ends. Through the Teaching Council teachers need to have a mechanism to promote public awareness of the way in which they work and of the environment in which they work. They need a mechanism to get the message of their achievements across to encourage the profession in general. It seems that so far I have followed two careers that suffer from a serious lack of real mechanisms to get the entire picture across to the public. We need to compare the many opportunities now presented in so many different and alternative employment fields with the new challenges teachers face in their classrooms. Serious efforts in terms of public relations will have to be made to attract people into the profession.</P>
    <P>It was suggested yesterday that every social ill leads to a pilot project in a school to cure it. In reality, too often the teacher is almost blamed for every social ill that arises. Teachers are supposed to cure all ills in the hours the school is open. We need to be more understanding of teachers and this message probably needs to be sent by themselves. This council, I trust, will assist in that.</P>
    <P>At this point I will deviate slightly and say that while the council may advise, it will still take the Government to react, particularly with resources, to support the role and work of the teacher. The minimum a teacher will require is a decent form of accommodation in which to teach. I take the opportunity to thank the Minister for his recent announcement in regard to the community college in my town of Moville. The Minister has reacted very positively to the education needs in the Inishowen region. In this recent announcement, the Minister's ability to address the situation and adopt criteria to suit what was needed has been very much appreciated. We all look forward to seeing the school up and running in September 2001 and to the physical building being there in 2003.</P>
    <P>There is a need for the development of facilities in other existing schools. During the Mini<Col N="1413" /> ster's recent visit to the peninsula, he was very much made aware of the need to support facilities in Carndonagh Community School, for extensions to Scoil Mhuire and the fast tracking of repairs and extensions to schools all over the peninsula. Given the moneys that have been injected into the capital programme by this Government, I am confident that all the current needs will be addressed.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and the previous Minister, Deputy Martin, on increasing the number of support staff for schools, including classroom assistants, resource teachers and remedial teachers. I remember coming into the House four and a half years ago to address the issue of remedial teaching with the former Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach. The statistics were appalling at that stage. Whatever statistics looked good, were not realistic.</P>
    <P>Teachers know they will have children with special needs in a given year and that they will need a classroom assistant or a resource teacher and inform the inspector of their probable needs very early in the year. It is a bit annoying that at this stage in the year when children are back, particularly those with special needs who are trying to integrate without any support, decisions about classroom assistants and resource teachers are not made. Perhaps teachers do not know of everybody who will enrol, but they have a fair idea. Given that the Minister is moving towards increasing the number of support staff and that this Government has an excellent record in relation to the numbers of support staff available, the delay in appointing them is putting undue pressure on teachers who have to wait that extra few weeks after the school year has started. When the Minister has done the basic work of providing the resource, it is just a matter of timing.</P>
    <P>I congratulate all the teachers who are doing a great deal of work with regard to integration. Everybody has made the point that teaching has become totally different in the recent past and many people are working very hard towards integration. The Minister met a group in Inishowen. One can see the excellent work being done. This debate emphasised the negative aspects of teaching and one gets the feeling that all teachers are burnt out and bored with what they are doing. However, that is not the case. There are very motivated teachers, teachers who are interested in their communities who are doing everything they can to advance the situation. We need to continue to get supports to the classroom.</P>
    <P>Coming from a music background, I encourage the Minister, as I do at every education committee meeting almost to the boredom of other Members, to examine the area of music therapy and music education in general for the development of slow learners and the general development, co-ordination, language development and rhythmic development of all children. While the council will examine the provision of in-service <Col N="1414" /> training, such training should encourage teachers to develop the music component, given that it is not only appropriate for the development of the slow learner or children with other special needs but for the development of all children from a young age.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the implementation of a disadvantage programme under the Bill. Many teachers have been put under undue pressure due to the haphazard nature of the implementation of the previous scheme under which schools in towns where many children were disadvantaged were not designated as disadvantaged. I note that my school, Scóil Eoghain in Moville, was not designated as disadvantaged. The boys school in Carndonagh was given that status but not the girls school despite the fact that the children attending both come from the same background. That is the type of issue that puts pressure on teachers. Teachers in schools that are not designated as disadvantaged must deal with children who are disadvantaged and compete with schools designated as disadvantaged, although such status was allocated in a haphazard manner. I appreciate the initiative taken by the Minister in examining the criteria for awarding schools disadvantaged status.</P>
    <P>The Teaching Council will advise on the supply of teachers. There is a difficulty in recruiting teachers in Donegal and we will have to look to the EU to recruit teachers. The Minister is aware that such teachers would have a difficulty with the Irish examination requirement. While I do not want to offend Gaelgeóirs, I have talked to people who have an excellent competency in spoken Irish and a good enough competency in written Irish, but they have a difficulty with the Irish examination, particularly that required for primary school teaching, which is more academic than practical. The policy on teaching Irish should be addressed in an honest fashion, given that young people who have spent 13 or 14 years learning Irish in school should be fluent in it, which is not the case, for whatever reason. This policy should be examined not only in the interests of teachers but also in the interests of students.</P>
    <P>I welcome the discussion and good comment on cross-Border co-operation in the Bill. Given my location in Ulster, I appreciate the efforts being made in that regard. Given that teachers who have trained in the North may seek teaching posts in the South, we should try to fast track incremental resolutions in that regard.</P>
    <P>The supply of teachers is linked to the availability of student grants. I was disappointed to learn from the reply to a parliamentary question I tabled recently that the number of students in receipt of a student grant has decreased from a high of 26,500 to 25,000. I am aware the Minister is examining the question of student grants in terms of the area of disadvantage. Eligibility for such grants should be based on net rather than gross income. If we are to encourage people to train as teachers, we will have to examine the sup<Col N="1415" /> ports given to particularly disadvantaged people who do not currently qualify for such grants and the difficulties experienced, particularly in Donegal, in light of the punt-pound differential.</P>
    <P>I am uncertain about the difference between the role of the union and that of the Teaching Council, particularly in the case of a dispute. Where does the union stand if a complaint has been made against a teacher and is being dealt with under the dispute process. If there is an overlap between the roles of the two bodies, that area needs to be clarified.</P>
    <P>We need a strong definition of what is expected of a teacher, as that will enable us to know what constitutes something that is wrong and that may lead to a teacher being taken off the register or being debarred from teaching.</P>
    <P>An investigating committee and a disciplinary committee will deal with complaints. Will the membership of those committees be made up of teachers or will they also include people outside the teaching profession? There are two schools of thought regarding the membership of such committees. For example, many people complain that in the case of Garda complaints procedures the profession investigates itself, while others claim no one knows the profession better that those working in it. I would like the membership of those committees to be clarified.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill teachers may be retained on the register subject to conditions or could be removed from it in the case of a serious wrongdoing. There will be a charge for getting on to the register. Will that be a nominal charge? If not, I am sure teachers who pay a union subscription will query what they will get out of being on the register.  </P>
    <P>Consideration should be given to examining more ways in which teachers, whether they have taught for 10 years, 15 years or longer, can divert from teaching. It is difficult for teachers to spend 40 years in one role and to still have a fresh approach to teaching. Consideration should be given, particularly in terms of in-service training, to enable teachers to have something more than a career break, given that anyone who has worked in the same job continually for 40 years is bound to lose his or her edge. We should support efforts to ensure teachers continue to adopt a fresh approach to their subjects.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. It is appropriate to have a code of conduct for teaching. Parents will welcome the fact that when they feel there is something seriously wrong, they can deal with it. I am concerned about the possible overlap of work between the union and the Teaching Council, but I am sure that will be clarified as time passes. I trust the council will be properly resourced to ensure it lives up to the ideals the Minister outlined very well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the opportunity to speak on it. This debate affords a broad <Col N="1416" /> ranging discussion on the important subject of education.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the Chair's ruling, I urge the Minister to do everything possible to prevent the threatened strike taking place next week. While the Minister said he met the representatives of the union, apparently the strike is still threatened. Such a strike would disrupt pupils' studies and the work of the teachers concerned, many of whom do not want it to happen. Teachers have enough pressures.  We will support the Minister in his efforts and I urge him to make a last ditch effort to resolve the dispute.</P>
      <P>We have a very good education system ranging from primary level to secondary level to third level. I am not being political in saying that we must acknowledge that during the past decade the rainbow coalition started to ungrade our schools and they have continued to be upgraded. For too long, many primary schools were not of a suitable standard for children who come from modern homes with modern heating systems. Such difficulties did not arise in the past when schools had similar heating systems to those in our homes. Outdoor toilets are a thing of the past. We must acknowledge the great strides made in upgrading such schools. The only complaints I tend to get in this area are calls for an extra classroom, which are welcome, as they show we have a growing population.</P>
      <P>The level of secondary education is marvellous. We have a range of private colleges and vocational schools. I take this opportunity to laud the vocational education committees for the tremendous work they have done in furthering secondary education. Through the vocational education system young people have been prepared for regional colleges. I am talking about regional technical colleges, the colleges of technology in this city, such as Bolton Street and Kevin Street, the Dublin Institute of Technology, which is now Dublin City University, and various regional technical colleges in Limerick, Sligo and Dundalk. These are marvellous opportunities for our young people. We should also acknowledge that young people appreciate and are taking up those opportunities. I was leaving Sligo last morning at 9 a.m. and I was delighted and proud to see hundreds of young people with their gear heading off to the local institute of technology from their apartments, flats and digs.</P>
      <P>We must also recognise that young people have been educated through those schools to the level which allows them to take up the jobs now available in Ireland. Multinational companies such as Intel and Hewlett Packard are only setting up here because our young people have the skills for the jobs in those companies. We must acknowledge how educated and skilled our young people are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That said, we cannot become complacent; technology moves very fast and we must keep abreast of it. Keeping abreast starts the day a child enters primary school. I recently visited a primary school <Col N="1417" /> in my village of Butlersbridge &ndash; I had not been there for two or three years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

      <P>I was slipping up. There were computers set aside in one classroom and I was proud to see that, as I did not realise the school was so advanced. It was marvelous to see the laptop computers. The teacher told me there was one downside to introducing the children to computers &ndash; in some homes a child would receive a computer for Christmas and could continue with what he or she had learnt in school. However, computers are costly and there are homes where income cannot be stretched to that kind of present, so some children are disadvantaged. The teacher was very astute in recognising that point and the Minister should take this on board. All children must be treated equally and what is available to one child should be available to all. A price range of £75 to £150 may not be much to a family with a high income or two incomes, but a single parent or parents on social welfare would find that hard to reach.</P>
      <P>Grant aiding the introduction of new and necessary skills at home for children should be considered. When we started school we had pens and pencils, but now it is laptop computers and pressing buttons. I hope handwriting skills will not go down the drain as a result of all this modern technology.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear that, as this issue was raised with me. It shows that it pays for public representatives to visit these places and listen to teachers. We must acknowledge our dedicated teachers. It is true of any profession that there are very good and good practitioners along with some who may be slightly careless. That is where this council will come into play &ndash; to advise the Minister on what is important, what is needed and what is changing.</P>
      <P>People may say that a membership of 37 is large, but it is not &ndash; a broad range of views is needed, such as those expressed by Deputies who have already contributed. The Minister cannot take all views on board, but he will get some ideas which can be brought forward. As some Members have said, if the board makes a recommendation the Minister should take it on board and that advice should be made public. If the Minister does not accept the advice he or she should come to the House and explain. There will have to be an explanation or the board will become a talking shop, which would be unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed that two members of the board should be parents. I do not agree with that as the final figure. Parents are at the coal-face of educating children. When their children come home at <Col N="1418" /> 3 p.m. the parents take over. We must acknowledge the pressure being put on parents and two parents on the board does not recognise the role of the parent in the early stages of moulding the child in primary and secondary school. When young people get to third level they go off on their own and become independent but they still come back home on the weekend to discuss their problems.</P>
    <P>If we have colleges of excellence in our region we should not be ashamed to highlight them; I mentioned the colleges in Bolton Street and Kevin Street already. There is a college of further studies in Cavan town which teaches computer skills. That was developed because two people in Cavan VEC used their initiative when they saw a need. They set this college up in a small convent in Cavan town and it has become so successful that children come to it from all over the country and it is now necessary to build a college in a greenfield site. Regrettably, the college is now scattered all over the town &ndash; it sets up a classroom anywhere it can get an office or a room. That is not a good way for children to make the most of the skills that are being taught to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give a fair regional balance to third level education and should commit funding from the Minister for Finance for this project. The Tánaiste said at one point that the Exchequer was awash with money and I know where some of that can be spent positively. The Minister should be given the go-ahead to sanction the building of a new college of further studies for the benefit not just of the Cavan region but of the nation &ndash; students come to the college from Tipperary, Kilkenny and Limerick. Deputy Keaveney mentioned the cross-Border development of education. This is an opportunity for young people from Fermanagh to get to know their Southern counterparts through the educational system. I stress this point.</P>
    <P>The Minister will appoint a director to this advisory council. I do not want to cast a slur on anyone's character, but I hope this will not be a job for a party hack who has no knowledge or understanding of the position. I concur with the view that the position should be advertised and a board should be established to interview prospective candidates to ensure that the Director is competent, understanding, can deal with the needs of the board and the education system and see to it that proper guidelines are laid down.</P>
    <P>We have an excellent education system and our young people are more than capable of taking up the type of job vacancies that are becoming available. If we ensure the education system continues to develop so that these young people will be taught the skills they require, we will have done great work and the debate on this Bill will have been worthwhile.</P>

      <P>The national school in Keenagh, my home village, was built during the term of office of the then Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, when very little funding was available. Construction of the school proceeded without the provision of a utility room.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Someone once said that all politics is parochial. The letter to which I refer is concerned with people's discontent with the funding of voluntary secondary schools. For example, the authorities of St. Joseph's secondary school, Newtownforbes, County Longford, have already contacted the Minister about the funding of voluntary schools <i>vis-a±-vis </i>that of other secondary schools. Will he bring the funding of voluntary schools into line with that of other schools to ensure that they have access to adequate moneys?</P>
      <P>Education is similar to health, one cannot spend enough money to satisfy everyone's demands. However, the Bill represents a step in the right direction. One of the gravest statistics relating to the current education system is the number of pupils who leave primary school without the basic skills of reading or writing. Crime statistics prove that people who leave primary level without these skills will not do well later on in terms of leading a normal life, gaining employment, etc. It would be a welcome development if the council the Minister is establishing under the Bill could deal with that issue in a forthright manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not doubt that the Minister will deal with the problem to which I refer as a matter of priority. I accept that new schools are being built and additional moneys are being invested in the education system. However, there is no point in trying to follow-up on the students to which I refer when they enter second level. Emphasis should be placed on identifying and helping them <Col N="1420" /> at primary level and it is there that additional funding should be invested. It is similar to a race, in that it is difficult to catch someone who gets a good start. I again thank the Minister for the good work he has done in my area.</P>

      <P>It is important to acknowledge the role of teachers and others in the steering committee which produced its report in October 1998. The report arises from recommendations made in the Green Paper and elsewhere over many years. Teachers have a record of welcoming, leading and driving change in education and in society. This Bill will enhance the status of their profession. As many Members have stated, that is not before time. The establishment of a teaching council has been sought by teachers and others involved in education for many years. Such a council will have an important effect on education.</P>
      <P>The Teaching Council has the potential to play a key role in ensuring the highest standards among teachers and in the education system. It will also give teachers a key role in setting and maintaining standards and the professional council should have the effect of maintaining and developing those standards. Bodies such as the Medical Council and Bord Altranais operate in a similar vein in respect of doctors and nurses, respectively.</P>
      <P>Teachers will also welcome recognition of their formal role as professionals. They will be entitled to regulate their affairs and they will be given greater responsibility for the standard and quality of the education system. One of the weaknesses of the system has been that while, in many respects, teachers have had a central role in the classroom, they have been by-standers in terms of setting standards and developing policy. I hope the establishment of the Teaching Council will redress the balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The council will be an independent statutory agency, with a role to play in terms of the regulation of the teaching profession. It will order the professional affairs of teachers and it will have an <Col N="1421" /> important role to play in terms of advising the Department of Education and Science in relation to other matters.</P>
    <P>Section 7 sets out the very comprehensive list of functions which apply to the council. It states that the council shall &ldquo;promote teaching as a profession&rdquo; and &ldquo;establish, review and maintain codes of professional conduct for teachers, which shall include standards of teaching, knowledge, skill and competence&rdquo;. It lists a comprehensive series of subheadings.</P>
    <P>Some people will be surprised that the council will have 37 members, some of whom will be directly elected and some nominated by unions, colleges, parents, employers, the Minister and so on. Mistakes have been made in the past in trying to reduce the membership of various boards in the interests of avoiding unwieldiness. In many instances this had the effect of excluding interest groups who had a right to participation and representation on the various boards and councils. I believe this will not be the case in this instance and I am not worried about the size of the board. Many Members of this House have worked in local authorities and other bodies where there has been a membership of this order, or larger, and where people who have had an urgent need to have their voices heard have managed to make considerable progress and work for the betterment of their community. I believe this council will do likewise.</P>
    <P>Many areas which are not specified will come within the remit of the council. There are areas where Members of this House would like to see the council play an active role, including advising the Department or taking a more central role in setting policy. I have been concerned recently about second level education and the pressure on minority interest subjects such as music and art, which have been long established in some schools. The pressure of retaining teachers for various other mainstream courses has had the effect of pushing these subjects to the periphery. It is not of great advantage for Departments to promote the arts, music and so on, at great cost at national level, if at the most fundamental level in the education system these subjects are being squeezed out by the claims of more traditional subjects. I would like the council to become active in this area. Naturally, specialist teachers of these subjects are less numerous than teachers of other subjects. However, in the professional milieu of the council with their peers they should be in a position to ensure these subjects are not squeezed further out of the system.</P>
    <P>Computer studies is quite new and extremely fashionable. This has not become a Leaving Certificate subject in the way that was predicted ten years ago. It is a Leaving Certificate subject in some schools in the University of Limerick catchment area. In fact, it is marked for entry to some courses in the university but it has never been developed beyond that. This area could be examined because it may be the method by which matters such as this will be initially considered, driven <Col N="1422" /> by the impetus of the teachers of the specific subjects.</P>
    <P>Most of us will have encountered difficulties which have arisen when teachers have sought to move between various countries. Sometimes Irish teachers seeking to teach abroad have had difficulty having their qualifications accepted and accredited elsewhere. More frequently, we have been dealing with people coming from the UK or other EU countries who have had difficulty, or enormous delays at least, in obtaining recognition in this country for their professional qualifications. This issue will be dealt with by the council more expeditiously than has been the case heretofore. This will improve the quality of education and the quality for practitioners at teaching level in having their business processed.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the role of the principal teacher in all schools, particularly in the smaller primary schools. This is truly an impossible job which requires recognition and support. This support network is not yet in place and I commend the Minister for the considerable progress made over the last 12 months or so. Having worked in this capacity for many years, I know from experience how difficult it is to deal with the huge range of responsibilities which arise simultaneously and which ultimately have an enormous impact on the standard of education available throughout rural Ireland in a great number of schools and affecting a massive number of pupils. It is also fair to acknowledge that there has been enormous progress in this area.</P>
    <P>I recall 25 years ago having five classes with 42 pupils and having to deal with the curriculum. Fortunately, I was young and starry eyed and less easily put off than might now be the case. This situation would not arise nowadays. In all my time in the teaching profession, I did not have the services of either a remedial or resource teacher. I have been out of teaching for just eight years but all schools now have remedial teachers and a huge majority of them have access to resource teachers. This will improve even more dramatically next year. Therefore, it is fair to acknowledge that there has been an improvement in the provision of education and in support for teachers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision for a code of conduct because I had forgotten that this did not exist. There is a lot more talk about codes of conduct in the political arena than in other professions. This will facilitate teachers in their professional work. It will clarify particular matters and remove areas of doubt. My former colleagues who still work in teaching have had to impose on themselves changes in the way they interact with their classes arising from scandals and the various difficulties which have arisen in recent years. The code of conduct will be very important and a tool of support for teachers, which is long overdue.</P>
    <P>One of the challenges the council faces is attracting new entrants to the teaching profession. This has proven to be notoriously difficult in recent years, particularly in relation to men. It <Col N="1423" /> seems strange in an era when men are playing a more active and caring role within the family than was traditionally the case that they are abandoning in droves professions such as teaching and refusing to countenance or consider it as an option. This is a real challenge for the council and it will be interesting to see how it addresses it.</P>
    <P>There has been a need for many years for more structured in-career development models. This is another role which will be taken up by the council. Many excellent courses have been available but there is a need to rationalise and scientifically set out the requirements of teachers in terms of courses and support systems. This will be a great challenge for the council in the early years. I hope it will address the issue quickly because this will have a positive impact on the quality of education for pupils and teachers, the benefits of which will be enormous.</P>
    <P>The council will set up and maintain a register of teachers. I am interested in the provision for annual renewal of registration. It is not immediately apparent to me why this should be necessary. I have looked through the explanatory memorandum and listened to the Minister's speech but the reason why annual renewal might be necessary has not been adverted to. I am sure there is a sensible reason for this, no doubt people will have to pay a fee. In order to register in the first instance, teachers will have to attain a verifiable standard of teaching, knowledge, skill and competence. The council will decide what will be maintained on the register and this will apparently be available for inspection. This is an issue in which practising teachers will have a particular interest. Given the membership of the council, teachers' interests will certainly be looked after. However, people tend to be quite sensitive about information maintained on a register, particularly given that it is available for public inspection.</P>
    <P>Only people on the register will be able to work as teachers in State-funded schools, which is a sensible provision. It may be very constricting in terms of the supply of teachers and schools requiring substitute teachers for three or four days, and this issue will need to be considered carefully by the council. The council may need to have a register of teachers available for permanent positions and also teachers on temporary registration who might be available for short-term work or for very specific work in areas in which they would have a sufficient level of competence to enable them work as teachers. The Bill allows for a great degree of flexibility and effectively allows the Teaching Council to make many decisions in this area. I hope a sensible approach will be taken to these matters. Perhaps the most important provisions relate to parents being assured that teachers working with their children have been recognised by a professional body. A clear and transparent course of action will be available to parents who have complaints about <Col N="1424" /> teachers working with their children. The Bill safeguards the rights of all the parties.</P>
    <P>I know from experience that there were good, competent and decent teachers driven out of the profession as a result of attacks made on them while others who were unsuitable for the job and still others, as we have seen from court cases, who should never have been in schools, managed to remain there for 30 or 40 years. The fact that there was no way in which to address difficulties with teachers was an enormous weakness in the system. The safeguards in the Bill will enable complaints to be processed fairly and openly, the council to be the arbiter and the end result to be fair to all parties.</P>
    <P>The system envisages setting up an investigatory committee and a disciplinary committee with the next step being the High Court. The Minister should consider having an intermediate appeals committee which would have a role after the investigatory and disciplinary committees had their say. It is a dramatic step to go from the findings of the disciplinary committee to the High Court. There may be good reasons for people being allowed access to an intermediate tier of an appeals committee.</P>
    <P>I have difficulty envisaging how the investigatory committee will go about its work. No doubt tangible evidence will be available to it. Heretofore most of the evidence would have come from an inspector's report. It is important that the <i>modus operandi</i> of the committee be clearly set out in advance. It would be inappropriate to include it in the Bill but the council will need to be clear on its procedures and set them out in advance of any action it might take, particularly so as some of the determinations may be tested in the courts subsequently. Even if they were never tested, however, it is a tenet of natural justice that a clear process is set out for a person against whom complaints were made and that anyone with a concern about the level of service provided by the State, directly or indirectly, through the schools would be open to such scrutiny and such a system.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to third level colleges having more and more courses, some of them specifically to train teachers in various disciplines. The council will have a job determining what combination of the various degree and diplomas will be required in order to accredit a teacher. I welcome the provision for North-South co-operation. I am aware of the work of the joint working groups in the period since the Good Friday Agreement and the work of the Ministerial Council. There is room for much progress to be made in this area which will enhance the quality of education and the professional standing of teachers North and South. The biggest union, the INTO, has membership North and South and has had since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the transfer of some of the Department's functions to the council and for the council to provide advice and advisory services to the Department. It is also charged with <Col N="1425" /> regulating teacher supply. This is an area that has bedevilled the Department and every practitioner in education for the past 20 years. At various times during my 20 years as school principal I remember having a huge panel of substitute teachers from which to pick if the need arose and, at others, knowing there was no one available within a 20 mile radius. We have not been good at managing our supply of teachers or foretelling the needs in the profession at various levels. It is important that we are certain there is a supply of teachers available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies, I welcome the Bill which has been a long time in gestation. It was recommended in the Green Paper in 1992 and has been on the Minister's shelf for the best part of two years. It is one that all interested in education, especially teachers, will welcome.</P>
      <P>We are discussing the Bill at a time of unprecedented crisis in the teaching profession. There are daily reports of industrial action which may be taken by the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland, the Teachers Union of Ireland and possibly down the road by the INTO. The Minister has a grave responsibility in this area but does not seem to be closely involved in resolving the problems. Why should a single day's schooling be lost if the Minister becomes involved? As was said of George Bush as Governor of Texas, the Minister seems to be a spectator watching the events that are happening. It is only recently that he met the TUI and INTO and in recent days asked for a meeting with the ASTI. It is deplorable that there has not been a real sense of engagement by the Minister to address the major problems of secondary teachers and bring about a resolution. I am proud to be a member of the ASTI.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a big step forward in the professional recognition of teachers and is of great benefit to all elements, students, parents and teachers. It is past time that teachers, like other professions such as solicitors, accountants, barristers, doctors and nurses, had professional autonomy and self-regulation of their professional ethos. It is welcome that this status has been afforded to them.</P>
      <P>The teaching profession has played a strong and historic role in our democracy. In the first decades of the State the local national school teacher was often the organiser of sports clubs and political parties and played a key role in motivating local communities. In the 1960s and 1970s, secondary teachers responded to the call of Donogh O'Malley to provide a free second level system. Over recent decades teachers have shown enormous generosity in meeting the huge demands of new curricula and teaching systems and of preparing pupils for new courses in universities while maintaining the service of extra-curricular activities including music, drama, public speaking, Gaelic games, association football, rugby and athletics. The teaching profession has been to the fore in organising many activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1426" /> The current ASTI campaign highlights the tremendous sense of community engendered in schools and the core of that provision is with the teaching profession. My own school proudly remembers famous past pupils, including the Taoiseach, the Secretary General of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and Mark Kinsella who is Roy Keane's right-hand man on the Irish football team. The personalities of pupils shape the ethos of a school but it originates in the qualities shown by the teaching staff.</P>
    <P>Everyone recognises the role played by our 44,000 teachers in the recent economic achievements, particularly since 1995. While many factors, such as inward IT investment, the process of European integration and the fact that English is our vernacular helped to shape this economic miracle, the teachers of Ireland changed the mindset of our nation by developing new modules in electronics and by producing the independent minded and sophisticated young population who are beginning to take the economic helm and are bringing us our current success.</P>
    <P>Many new courses have been developed, such as the leaving certificate vocational and the new junior certificate. Civil and political education, for which Deputy Michael Higgins campaigned for many years, was examined this year for the first time. Teachers have played a fundamental role and the recognition of their professional integrity in the provision of the teaching council is welcome.</P>
    <P>The council has been a long time in gestation &ndash; the 1991 OECD report mentioned it. I pay tribute to my former, and I hope future, colleague, Niamh Bhreathnach whose White Paper provided the impetus for the Bill. I also welcome the fact that the central elements of the report of the steering committee have been followed closely in the Bill. I commend the Minister for this. However, I am dismayed that it has taken two years, since October 1998, to develop the Bill.</P>
    <P>The issue of pay and conditions of teachers has developed in recent years. The ASTI felt it necessary to withdraw from the PPF in order to negotiate an increase in pay which would take cognisance of the major developments in education. Many people are appalled by the lethargic reaction of the Minister for Education and Science to this matter. Although he has briefed the Cabinet, he has only recently begun to interact with the trade unions and has not shown an interest in examining the benchmarking mechanism or in using the PPF to pursue negotiations with the three teacher unions. The ASTI withdrew from the PPF very reluctantly. The three teacher unions have adhered closely to all the national agreements since 1987 but the great disenchantment felt in the profession at pay and conditions is reflected in the fact that the recent ASTI vote was 9 to 1 in favour of industrial action. The Minister having failed to respond in a significant way to calls for negotiations, 90% of ASTI members <Col N="1427" /> had no option but to take some form of industrial action.</P>
    <P>Many teachers feel the avenue of industrial action must be explored because the nature of their job has become much more complex and pressurised. We have seen a plethora of new curricula over the past 30 years and particularly in the last decade. I commend the Government on providing a financial package for IT development in schools. However, this package will not be successful if teachers do not have the necessary skills to develop and implement IT programmes. This places an extra burden on the teaching profession. The enormous pressure on each cohort of students to enter third level remains and the most attractive third level courses are still oversubscribed. Many second level teachers carry the enormous burden of trying to ensure that their pupils succeed in public examinations.</P>
    <P>In the mid-1990s my colleague, Niamh Bhreathnach, introduced new middle management systems in schools involving assistant head teachers along with deputy principals and assistant principals over subject areas and the main activities of the school. This was a very valuable development but it needs greater resources than the Government has provided.</P>
    <P>The pressure of the public examination structure has intensified, given the increasingly public nature of the examinations. Given that each student may now see his or her own answer paper, teachers are more accountable than ever before. One of the major reasons for the great burden on teachers is the failure of the Minister and his predecessor, Deputy Martin, to give significant support to the secretarial and administrative function in schools. I have already raised the matter of the need for secretaries and caretakers in primary schools but the situation in voluntary second level schools is also appalling. I refer to the JMB 2001 budget submission. Secretarial and caretaker grants of £10,500 and £7,950 respectively do not even encompass the notion of a living wage. This anomaly needs to be addressed. Schools with less than 200 pupils do not receive any grants. There has been, therefore, no development worth talking about under the Minister, Deputy Woods, or his predecessor, Deputy Martin, in terms of administrative and secretarial support. As a consequence, ordinary teachers with a full 22 hour teaching programme have to carry the burden.</P>
    <P>The pupil-teacher ratio is still far too high. The Deputy from Clare mentioned that he taught classes of 42 pupils. There are still classes of that dimension and above. A huge proportion of primary school classes and some popular second level classes have more than 30 pupils. The Minister has moved towards a ratio of 18:1, but this is still far from satisfactory. We should be aiming at a ratio of 15:1.</P>
    <P>The burden of principal and vice-principals has increased greatly in recent years. We should not <Col N="1428" /> pretend that a proper middle management system, properly resourced, has been put in place in schools. Teachers face a plethora of new responsibilities imposed on them by legislation, in particular the Education Welfare Bill which, although welcome, in the sense that it deals with the issue of school attendance, places enormous pressures, in terms of time and resources, on the hard-pressed teaching profession.</P>
    <P>This time last year we were in the midst of the nurses dispute which was preceded six months before by the famous blue flu in the Garda Síochána. Prison officers also took industrial action. Public sector workers are determined to get their fair share, to which they are entitled. In this context why should we expect secondary or primary school teachers to be any different?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we want to have an autonomous, highly regarded teaching profession, we have to provide for the pay and conditions to which they are entitled. While the Bill highlights teacher supply as a key element, the three teaching unions and the teaching profession in general are gravely disenchanted with the Government. There is a need for urgent action before school time is lost and pupils go unsupervised. There is a need for negotiation to reach a settlement of the dispute.</P>
      <P>I warmly welcome section 7 which promotes the importance of the teaching profession and as one young people should consider pursuing. It also highlights teacher supply as a key element. I also warmly welcome section 8 which deals with the membership of the Teaching Council on which colleges of education, universities, boards of management, parents' associations, the trade union movement and employers will be represented.</P>
      <P>Teachers have expressed concern about sections 12 to 22. They are not clear how much seed capital the Teaching Council will have and how it will be financed in its first two years of operation. This is a grave weakness. Teachers are also anxious to know what premises will be available. If the council is to be a key institution of our democracy, it is critical that it is provided with the capital resources that it needs.</P>
      <P>A colleague of mine referred to the annual registration fee. Members of other professions such as solicitors and doctors are allowed to claim their annual registration fee against their tax. The Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, should consider applying this condition to teachers.</P>
      <P>I warmly welcome section 6 which provides for the introduction of a professional code of conduct which will be the responsibility of the Teaching Council. It is noted that the teaching unions will continue to have important responsibilities in such matters as service, salaries and pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1429" /> Section 28 and later sections deal with the register and the information to be contained therein. It is welcome that it will be covered by the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
    <P>Section 38 deals with the continuing education and professional development of teachers. It is a key section. It is noted that the Teaching Council will have important responsibilities in such matters as research into training methods, maintaining a high level of public awareness of the teaching profession and reviewing training programmes.</P>
    <P>While I warmly welcome the Bill, the teaching profession faces a great crisis which I hope the Minister will address with the urgency it deserves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>Much has been said about education. The two points that are true are that it has become a lifelong process and that it is facing a changing world. Compared to their role five years ago we are now looking at a completely different type of teacher. Much has happened in the intervening period with the result that the job specification of primary and secondary teachers is now completely different. Social and economic changes exert huge pressures on teachers. The new responsibilities imposed on them by legislation as leaders in their local communities to respond to the particular needs of families are additional to the long list of responsibilities already attached to their job.</P>
      <P>There is an administration issue and it did not arise only during the term of office of the Minister, Deputy Woods. Secretarial and caretaking functions were often rolled into the job to be done by teachers. This is no longer the case. The responsibilities of teachers are now so great that we, as legislators, and the Department should not ask them to extend their duties to act as secretary and caretaker as part of the one job. If we are to take seriously the issues which the Teaching Council will raise, we first have to understand and then address all these issues.</P>
      <P>Teachers are working more and more hours at home. Because of the pressure they are under and because of its complex nature, teachers take much work home with them. This is not a political issue, but this role of teachers was not recognised by successive Governments and as a result they were not paid for it. Nevertheless, teachers continue to engage in the process. If they did not we would not have the same degree of efficiency and care in our schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More than ever before, teachers need to expand on their educational base. They must continue to do courses to bring themselves up to date with developments. To opt out of a normal day's routine to participate in a pressurised course, to get from it as much as possible in the shortest time period and put what has been absorbed into operation in the daily work programme adds a further pressure. Coupled with the information technology revolution, we are also asking teachers to keep up to date. The specification for the job is constantly expanding and demanding <Col N="1430" /> more and more from the people employed and expected to be employed in the profession.</P>
    <P>Information communication technology works two ways. Pupils can draw down from a website so much information to assist with homework and to expand their knowledge that they almost compete with the teacher in the classroom, who has to contend with all the other responsibilities to which I have referred. While teachers keep up to date with changes in education and in the subject they teach they are also expected to keep up to date with the revolution in information communication technology. It is an extraordinary challenge for the profession, but teachers have met it head on. On a daily basis they continue to deliver a quality education system to the young students who are fortunate to participate in their classes.</P>
    <P>It is time we acknowledged all of this in monetary terms. The Opposition may say the Minister has not done so. Ministers have not done so since long before I became a Member of this House. We should admit we are all responsible. Teachers deserve a significant increase in remuneration because they are seeking to catch up.</P>
    <P>A bishop in my area, God rest him, used to ask, &ldquo;Who will care for the carers&rdquo;? That should be applied to teachers. The Bill goes some way to dealing with the issues of concern to the 44,000 teachers and the three trade unions. It also goes some way to empower them to deal with the issues that affect their lives on a daily basis. I hope it will give them the finance to put the structures in place to assist in delivery. This is also a good Bill for pupils, parents and the country because, in one way or another, we are all associated with the educational process.</P>
    <P>The code of conduct referred to in the Bill will bring about a new discipline in the teaching profession. It will be good for teachers, pupils and parents. They can refer to it and be judged by it. Perhaps it will become a benchmark for future developments in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the council will lead and drive all aspects of change in education. That is a serious challenge. It is a very broad statement, but the 37 members of the council will find the whole issue of education a challenge, as will the Department. If this power is to be granted to the council and if we expect it to respond to the needs of those involved in education, the Department must be open, proactive, be prepared to put its money where its mouth is and run with the development of education in terms of what is required and demanded of it by the council. If that does not happen we will not serve education well and the establishment of the council and enactment of this legislation will be ineffective.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government, however, have the will to ensure that the council is established and that the necessary finance is available. I hope the officials in the Department, with the politicians in this House, will meet the challenge this legislation will present. We will have to become more proactive. Hitherto we reacted to <Col N="1431" /> issues of the day but education is now such a serious issue we will have to be proactive and allocate the necessary finance. In this regard I hope a secretariat and headquarters will be supplied to the council as a matter of course.</P>
    <P>We must also recognise the revolution that is driving education. It is not happening within the Department or the teaching profession, but within the communities, representing the parents and all of those interested in education. They are asking for and forcing on us pre-school facilities and the homework club initiative. They are demanding that we respond positively in terms of finance. There is a desire for education and a hunger in communities for continuing education and a desire to give it the priority it deserves.</P>
    <P>When we talk about attracting teachers into the system we must be careful about what is happening in the communities. It is not necessary for those involved in homework clubs to be fully qualified teachers. If we acknowledge that they need some qualification and begin to acknowledge that one does not need to be fully qualified in the various areas at primary and second level we might attract more people into the system. If we build into the system re-education programmes or further courses so that such people can become fully qualified as they progress we will make it far more attractive for younger people to become involved as teachers in the education system.</P>
    <P>There are difficulties at primary level, especially with regard to infrastructure. This has a bearing on attracting people to the teaching profession. There is a need to modernise the primary school infrastructure, including the buildings. They should be made more accessible. Computers and IT systems should be part of every classroom and not just a room at the end of the corridor. This will require substantial funding. There is a need to be proactive in this regard.</P>
    <P>With regard to getting young people to attend school I note from a report that the Garda and officers are available to monitor those who do not attend. I know of a child in my constituency who missed 59 days out of 169. He is one of many. That is unacceptable. These patterns can be broken through the deployment of specialised teachers in schools in marginalised areas. This would enable them to cross reference between the school, the pupil that is having difficulty or a dysfunctional family.</P>
    <P>We must address this issue because the success of the homework club, the pre-school initiative and the other initiatives announced by the Minister depends on catching the people falling out of mainstream education. That is where the real problem lies. We can address it if we put enough specialist teachers into the system who can liaise between the school, family and pupil. If one breaks down the problem it becomes apparent that one may have to deal with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the local gardaí, an official from the health board and the <Col N="1432" /> Department of Education and Science. There should be one way of dealing with this particular problem.</P>
    <P>Dyslexia, autism and other specialised areas have been in the news a lot lately. Those areas should be addressed in terms of teachers' qualifications and the number of teachers in our schools. People who are mildly disabled should be accommodated in mainstream education. That is what the families want and they want an assurance from the education sector that there will be more involvement of those people in mainstream education. In doing that we will address a host of other problems with which families are confronted.</P>
    <P>I mention autism in particular because a number of families in my own constituency have raised with me the problem of not being able to access mainstream education, knowing that their child can be assessed and that there are possibilities for them within the mainstream educational structure. I ask for more teachers in that area.</P>
    <P>There is another report available which highlights various problems in the care of disturbed children. If there were more teachers in the system and specialists in this area, they could interact with the family and rather than an official from the health board or a garda calling to the house, someone who understands the problem and who would be willing to interact with that person could intervene.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to a recent statement by the Minister for Education and Science in which he said that the south east region had the lowest number of take-ups for third level education. He announced the appointment of a director and a secretariat to Ciaran's College in Kilkenny to encourage the take-up of third level places. In the course of that announcement the Minister also said that we could link up with the industrial base in that region.</P>
    <P>In terms of the Teaching Council Bill, we will find that there is a demand for outreach centres and we will have the development of that outreach centre in Kilkenny. There is a need, through information technology, to go beyond what is available in the region and to look towards Cork or to Queens &ndash; an outreach centre in Armagh. All of that can be brought to the doorstep of those who want to access second chance education in Kilkenny and to take up specific courses tailored for the industrial base. In that way a child could go from pre-school to primary to secondary to third level within their own region. We must respond to the needs of that industrial base, particularly in the areas of finance, computer skills and telecentres. That is the type of education we must develop.</P>
    <P>Other speakers referred to the need for teachers in art and design to be recognised. In Kilkenny, which is synonymous with design because of the design centre, an arts course is taking shape within the VEC structure, albeit a small one. When something like that happens at community level, and there is enormous drive and <Col N="1433" /> initiative in that area, the Department should tap into that new energy and ensure that a life is given to it. We are the leading exporters of design software in the world. Surely the art and the design form can be linked together to provide a course under the umbrella of an outreach centre. That is not impossible. It is a new concept but we will find that the policies of the teaching council will be community driven and will be activated from the bottom up. That being the case, it will come up against a demand by local communities for radical change in the way we approach our education system, the way teachers qualify and how their needs are met. If we respond to that, the job of this 37 person council will be made that much easier.</P>
    <P>The qualifications for teachers should be streamlined. Recently I dealt with a case which involved a voluntary school versus a community school whereby a H.Dip in French is required in one but not in the other. The lady who requires the H.Dip in French is qualified and is actually teaching teachers, yet she is not allowed to become permanent in that school because she does not have a H.Dip. To take the H.Dip she would have to remove herself from the system, spend £2,000 to £3,000 to qualify and then try to get a job two years down the road. That is not acceptable. There must be a flexible approach to such matters but the current system is not flexible, it does not deal with them and it is not responsive. It does not deal with real life issues. That problem could be dealt with easily and in considering the role of the council, I ask the Minister to ensure that such issues do not arise in the future.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to teachers who are substituting without qualification. A report was submitted to the Oireachtas committee on education recently requesting that it be found to allow these teachers to qualify over a period of time, to move from being non-qualified substitute teachers to being qualified teachers. That is not beyond the possibility of consideration and I support their case. I know the report was before the committee again today and I ask that it be given serious consideration. In his contribution the Minister said that this issue might be dealt with on Committee Stage. I hope he brings forward the appropriate resolutions.</P>
    <P>The issue of school attendance officers in urban areas can be addressed in consultation with the teachers. More consultation on that matter is needed so that marginalised communities in particular can benefit from the work of the council and the involvement of more teachers and attendance officers in mainstream education.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill. It has provided a wonderful opportunity to discuss the many issues facing education. I commend the Minister on his work to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the Teaching Council Bill. It is an interesting Bill in that it allows us to discuss a wide area of educational issues which are vitally <Col N="1434" /> important. Most people, but not all, who spoke on the Bill are teachers of one form or another. I am not a teacher but we have two newly qualified young teachers in our house and a number of other family members in third level education.</P>
      <P>Irrespective of where one comes from, for parents this Bill is hugely important. I have had a great interest in education over the years. I assume that the Minister's contribution contained a number of aspirations; that is usually the case in these matters. There is a mammoth task involved in setting up the teaching council but it is a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>The Bill will promote the professional development of teachers, which is very important. I will return to that subject later. It will maintain and improve the quality of teaching. The establishment of standards, policies and procedures for the education and training of teachers is important but that will be done by the teachers themselves. The self-regulatory aspect of the Bill is something that will be welcomed by all teachers. The Bill also imposes enormous responsibility on teachers but that is the case with the IMO and the nursing profession, for example. This Bill is good news for teachers who are trained and doing their job properly but it might not be for others.</P>
      <P>The ideals the Bill seeks to attain must be highly commended, although we must wait to see if they are fulfilled. This Bill is of immense importance for the 44,000 teachers in the country, for the welfare and future of students and for parents and the community. It is only right to reflect on what parents expect from the implementation of this Bill, such as a good education for their children.</P>
      <P>The Bill creates an opportunity for parents to take action if a teacher fails to meet the standards laid down. I have been a Member of this House for a long time and I have seen problems in communities where parents and a particular teacher fell out for one reason or another. As Deputy Killeen said and he should know after teaching for 20 years, some teachers were unnecessarily hounded out of the school system while others, who were not pulling their weight, were allowed to continue teaching. It will be extremely important for the council to address that fairly.</P>
      <P>There is an element of self-regulation in the Bill and that is as it should be. However, if a profession wants to make progress, it is important for its members to believe their work is appreciated and that they are having an impact. It is the same for a Member of this House, a Minister, an engineer, a doctor or a farmer. Unless people believe they have a contribution to make and unless it is seen by society as being important, it will be difficult to encourage people to enter that profession. That is what is wrong in the teaching profession at present. Many teachers feel they are being leap-frogged by other professions and this permeates to the students. It is important for people's work to be appreciated and for society to understand and accept their contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1435" /> I want to give the House an idea of how teaching is viewed at present. A week ago I had the pleasure of speaking to approximately 70 third year students in a community school in north Galway. Most of the boys and girls came from rural backgrounds and they were intelligent. To liven up the proceedings, I asked them what they would like to do when they left school. When I asked who would like to be an engineer, two or three students put up their hands. When I asked who would like to be a nurse, two or three girls put up their hands. When I asked who would like to become involved in computers, 60 of the 70 students put up their hands or, in some cases, their two hands. However, when I asked who wanted to be a teacher, only two were interested. Two or three students wanted to be welders. Although 80% of them had walked through a farmer's gate that morning, only one wanted to become involved in farming.</P>
    <P>I know these students will probably change their minds when they go to university, but it is significant that they thought about becoming involved in professions other than teaching. I have no doubt if I had been in the same school ten years ago there would have been a greater interest in teaching.</P>
    <P>I am a long time in this House and I have seen good and bad budgets. I have also seen times when we were strapped for cash and the only cash we had was that which we borrowed. However, Governments always ensured they invested in education, perhaps not at the same pace as at present but at a pace relative to other professions. I make no apologies for any Government doing that. The birds have now come home to roost. We can argue and I accept that EU integration, our position in Europe, inward investment and technology played a part, but if we did not have the education system we have had for the past 20 or 25 years we would not be much different from anywhere else. Every pound we spent on education was well worthwhile. It is important to continue to do that.</P>
    <P>It is important to look closely at the reasons many young people drop out of school. It is a major worry that many illiterate people come through the system. Last night I saw an excellent programme on television about illiteracy which was presented by Teri Garvey. I have great sympathy for a person who cannot sign his or her name on an application form. As a Member of this House, I come across this problem regularly. This is a problem in major centres but also and particularly in rural Ireland. It is difficult to understand how a boy or girl can go through national and secondary school without learning to read and write.</P>
    <P>I knew a person on the programme last night although he comes from County Mayo. His name is Ernie Sweeney and he had the character and the guts to say on the television he was not able to read or write. He was lucky because an employer told him if he could learn enough <Col N="1436" /> vocabulary to be able to identify things in a store he would give him a job. He got the job some months later. That programme would have done more than anything else to highlight the problem if enough people had seen it. I hope the teaching council addresses this problem in great detail.</P>
    <P>I assume there was a consultative process. While this Bill has nothing to do with the teaching unions, they should give it their blessing. There will be great benefits for the unions and their members. If we want to change the image of teaching and if we want teachers to take their place among other professions, we must ensure they are paid at a similar rate.</P>
    <P>This Bill is very welcome from a parents' point of view provided it is implemented. Teachers play an extremely important role in the community and more and more parents have come to understand the role teachers play in the future and in the well-being of their children. In a debate such as this we should reflect on the excellent contribution teachers have made and the huge responsibilities they shoulder. The Minister and society will face great difficulties if teachers as a body are beginning to think their work is under-valued or that their contribution is somewhat less than it should be. However, those problems will be as nothing compared with those faced by children.</P>
    <P>Primary schools are a fundamental bedrock of the entire education system. However, the fact that about 2,000 untrained teachers are involved in the system highlights the fact that there has been little strategic planning concerning the numbers required. Someone should have been examining this issue ten years ago and we cannot blame the Minister. The same happened with nurses and the medical profession.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the back-to-education scheme. For one reason or another many people drop out of second and third level education but there is now an opportunity for them to return. However, many people have been extremely frustrated in their efforts to get back into education. The Minister will know what I am talking about as he was instrumental in introducing the scheme as Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a 32 year old married man in east Galway who is on a low income and who decided to return to a third level institution. One of the social welfare criteria for doing so is that one must be signing on for 150 weeks. Unfortunately, this man had only 100 or 110 contributions and was deemed ineligible. I raised this issue with the Departments of Education and Science and Social, Community and Family Affairs but one would imagine the two had set out to scuttle one another. The Minister talks about synchronisation among Departments but the reality is far different. The Department of Education and Science claims that people should return to education as it is good for the economy, the workforce and the individuals concerned. However, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs wanted to get this man off the live <Col N="1437" /> register as quickly as possible and did not agree he should be allowed to leave a low paid job and draw social welfare to return to third level education. This is a tug-of-war in which many people are caught. There is much anger and frustration over this situation and I hope the new council will address this issue.</P>
    <P>We should spare a thought for school principals, many of whom have outlined their present workload in comparison to five years ago. There is no doubt they would want to be like octopuses to keep pace with all the material coming at them from all sides and at all levels. School principals are the core of the system but their work is under-valued and they have so many things to which they have to pay attention. If things are not right at the principal's level then the whole school suffers.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that national school principals in poor areas have to clean their schools. FÁS has made an excellent input into the school system through the social employment schemes. However, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, has changed the structure of the schemes. As a result, the continuity which existed by way of caretakers will come to an end. This service was built up in many schools and unless the Minister and her Department change the rules, school management boards will have to pay caretakers or teachers will have to do the work. This is not the right direction in which to go. These are fundamental matters which affect the image and performance of teachers. There has been increased investment in the education system including in information technology. Teachers have to be retrained in IT which poses a significant hurdle for many of them.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, the High Court will be the final recourse for teachers deemed to be below standard. This is an extreme measure. I may be missing something but it is a pity there is no appeals mechanism between the disciplinary committee and the High Court. Bringing these issues to the High Court is a significant escalation and one would have thought these matters should be dealt with at a lower level. I hope the Minister will refer to this issue in his reply as it is of concern to many Deputies.</P>
    <P>Why do members have to register every year? Once they are registered and have attained the required standard, one would think they should only be taken off the register if anything untoward happened. The Minister might refer to this matter.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill which is a significant step forward for education. However, I hope it is not aspirational as there is no room for such an approach. The Bill will have to be concrete as it will form the foundation for education for the next 25 or 30 years. I hope the contributions made in this House and elsewhere will mean that the future education of our children will be even better than in the past.</P>
    <Col N="1438" />
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which has been a long time coming. In many respects teachers have operated in a vacuum which has led to many difficulties for teachers, parents and pupils. Hopefully the establishment of a teaching council and the other measures in the Bill will address the past difficulties.</P>
      <P>Autonomy and self-regulation are almost the order of the day and the creation of this council for teachers should result in a structure and forum which will benefit all. Parents and pupils should be happier in the knowledge that teachers must reach the highest standards of qualification and adhere to a professional code of conduct. There will also be a procedural structure through which parents can seek to air their concerns or complaints if they believe there is a shortcoming in the service provided. All of these measures should ensure that the highest standards are maintained.</P>
      <P>A good education system is the bedrock of any good society and we have always prided ourselves on the excellence of our system. In doing so, while I acknowledge the great contribution of many, we have glossed over many shortcomings. I particularly wish to refer to the large number &ndash; in the region of 20% &ndash; of adults who have reading difficulties. Generations of people have passed through the system and regrettably it has failed them. I realise that successive Ministers have sought to address this through the adult education process but more measures need to be taken in the initial years at primary level. Many people working in and associated with the system were and still are oblivious to the difficulties in this area. Many young children were put to the back of the classroom and categorised as having no intellectual ability when in fact a few small measures could have prevented much difficulty subsequently. Sadly this situation still persists in a large number of schools.</P>
      <P>I welcome the establishment by the Minister of the special report group on dyslexia which is due to report to him within the next couple of months. This group chaired by Peadar Cronin has an important role to play and I urge the many people involved to tell their stories as it may assist others. While I do not want to pre-empt the findings of the group, I believe it will paint a bleak picture of an almost total lack of understanding of dyslexia, an inability to recognise it and little knowledge available on how to deal with it. The blame for this does not lie with individual teachers but rather with a system, which does not recognise such a condition or its central role and which has not sought to address it at the teacher training level. The challenge for the Minister will be in how he responds to this issue. We can learn from the measures taken by other countries and I look forward to the Minister dealing with this sorry affair. The closing date for submissions is Friday, 27 October, but I would hope that the review group would be lenient in the acceptance of submissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I came into the House I received a telephone call from a lady who has been in touch <Col N="1439" /> with me over the past few years. She said she saw the advertisement and has made a submission. She said that I had sent her information a few years ago on the various facilities in place for children with dyslexia, but that she has never encountered them. It is a problem throughout the country. It is not necessarily the Minister's fault. Successive Ministers have just not been aware of it. It is an area which needs to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I am not familiar with the members of the review group, but it is important that some of them would not be solely from the educational system. Many teachers to whom I have spoken at various conferences and elsewhere, including teachers &ndash; I would not necessarily include Deputy Kenny among them &ndash; in my parliamentary party, fail to recognise that there is such a condition as dyslexia. They are still of the opinion that one third of students are bright, one third are in the middle and one third are like their fathers and mothers and, therefore, are put at the back of the class. The Teaching Council Bill makes mention of the research carried out and there is an onus on the Teaching Council to publish the research, but it is important that no matter how damning the report, which, if it is to be an accurate reflection of what is out there, will be damning, the Minister should publish it. One of the difficulties with many such reports is that when the report is submitted, either the Civil Service or the Minister does not like the tone of it, various spins are put on it and by the time it is published the people are worn out. I would like to see that report published as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The weight of children's school bags is a topic which comes to the fore at this time of the year. The Minister's predecessor set up a study group, a report was published and many glossy leaflets were distributed but the problem still persists. There appears to be an unwillingness on behalf of the Department and school boards of management to tackle this problem. They are content to let it drift along and feel they have done their bit by disseminating the information. This must be followed-up and carelessness should not be acceptable in this area. If it is not adequately dealt with, it will come back to haunt us. Several people are weary from raising it.</P>
    <P>Following the report of the Minister's review group, the lovely glossy leaflets are evident lying about the place but the school bags are still getting heavier. I do not know what measures can be taken but there is a need for follow-up through the boards of management and the teachers, whether on the basis of an organised seminar or otherwise, because children up and down the country can still be seen dragging their school bags along behind them.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in his speech that the Bill will improve the morale of teachers. A measure taken in recent years to assist in morale was the concept of job-sharing. This would allow spouses to take time out, generally to spend with their young families. It was a positive step and, if <Col N="1440" /> implemented in the correct spirit, can be of benefit to all. However, it has been brought to my attention that this may not always be the case as some principals have a difficulty and in order to overcome this difficulty they have gone out of their way to make the process unworkable.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a school, which thankfully is not in my constituency, where three out of four job-sharing teachers are required to come in for periods during the five days and the remaining person must come in for four days. This defeats the purpose of the scheme. In addition, often the classes are programmed at either end of the day. This is certainly not in keeping with the spirit of the scheme. I do not know what measures can be taken to overcome it. Perhaps the Minister could issue a directive re-emphasising the spirit of the scheme because in many cases teachers may be unwilling to tackle this issue at a local level.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the establishment of the council will be viewed by teachers as a recognition of the need for them to regulate their own affairs. Teaching can be a much maligned profession, as the usual throwaway remark about long holidays will confirm, but the role of the teacher has evolved, often to take the place of parent or guardian and on occasion to act as counsellor to the parent. Home-school liaison teachers now go out into the community and this reflects the difficulties many family units are experiencing. If we get the basics right, it can make life so much easier in the future.</P>
    <P>One of the objects of the council, as outlined in section 6, is to promote the continuing education and training and professional development of teachers and this is dealt with in Part IV, where section 38 refers to the council conducting research, publishing its findings and promoting the benefits of continuing education.</P>
    <P>I realise that the time available to the Minister was limited, but he did deal with this section. In my view this is perhaps the most important aspect of the Bill. One of the basic flaws in the education system is the almost total lack of in-service training for teachers. Some may argue that there has been an improvement and the training days are being provided, however, it is possible for a teacher to go through several decades without receiving further education. Virtually all companies and bodies invest a major part of their funding in re-training, but this is something we have failed to do in many State institutions. Methods and practices evolve and we must do so with them. The new council should take great care when dealing with this issue and should look at the feasibility of introducing a properly structured body to implement the various required measures. Every five or six years a teacher should be able to go back into full-time training in the various teacher training colleges or relevant universities for a three to six month period.</P>
    <P>If I may divert from the Bill for a moment, I wish to mention a few local issues. On the subject of building projects, in my home town of Baltinglass approval was given for a PE hall co-inciden<Col N="1441" /> tally in May 1997. If the project proceeds at full steam, it will not be ready by June 2002. In effect by the time somebody gets to use it a full cycle of pupils will have gone through the system. This is something for which the Department is to blame. We can talk about the lack of resources, planners and architects in the school system and the building boom, but it is unacceptable that a project takes so long to complete. There is also a difficulty with the PE hall in Arklow and with several other building projects in the constituency.</P>

There must be a means to address this. We are all familiar with the primary school which is low in numbers because parents are choosing to send their children to another school they perceive as being more advantageous to their children. This should not be the case as one should be able to obtain an education in one's own locality.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this issue. It is very timely that we discuss these matters as we consider what should and should not go into the coming budget. There is sufficient evidence to show that this country has a form of apartheid which is every bit as bad as that experienced in South Africa at its worst, although our form of apartheid is not on the basis of the colour of one's skin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A briefing document presented to Members of the Oireachtas by the CORI justice commission included a social protection and expenditure timetable which indicated that in 1997 Ireland had social protection expenditure, as a percent age of GDP, of 17.5%. What is sad about that is <Col N="1442" /> that it had declined from 19.1% in 1990 when we were a much poorer country. What is even sadder is that the amount of money we spent on social protection, 17.5% of GDP, was about half that spent in Sweden &ndash; 33.7% of GDP. The United Kingdom spent almost one and a half times as much as we did on social protection &ndash; 26.8% of GDP, Denmark spent almost twice what we spent &ndash; 31.4% and France spent almost one and three quarters of what we spent &ndash; 30.8%. In fact, of the 15 EU members states, we were the lowest by far. The next lowest after us was Spain at 21.4% of GDP and Portugal at 22.5% of GDP. We are simply not using our resources to help the poorest people in this country, and it is not as if we cannot do it.</P>
    <P>When I first become a councillor in 1979 and a TD in 1981, I recall that Dublin Corporation alone was building 1,750 houses per year when we did not have a bob. We did not have anything like the money we have in the coffers now. Is it any wonder that the demand for housing is such when the supply, particularly of public housing, has all but dried up? This year between what it purchases and what it builds, Dublin Corporation will provide something like 300,000 housing units. People say there is no room in this city to build these houses but there is as the corporation's housing policy committee has been told. Most of the 1,750 houses per year we built were not, in any event, built in Dublin city. They were built for people from Dublin city who were in need of housing.</P>
    <P>In relation to justice and the need for prison reform, 75% of prisoners in Mountjoy come from five identifiable areas of Dublin. There are no prizes for guessing that we are not talking about the nicer parts of the city. We are talking about parts of the city where there is real deprivation. We are talking about parts of the city, for example, where the residents of whole flat complexes as big as major villages outside Dublin never go on to third level education, areas where the participation rate in third level education is something of the order of 5% while elsewhere in the same city, in good neighbourhoods, it is about 55%. These are the areas from which the prison population comes. We talk about the terrible problems of crime and we build bigger prisons and recruit more gardaí. Why do we not spend money on education?</P>
    <P>According to research done by ARC, Area Response Crumlin, in my constituency, those who abuse heroin are likely to come from a group where only one in ten have done their leaving certificate whereas the average is that eight out of ten teenagers do their leaving certificate. Among those who abuse heroin, it is as low as one in ten &ndash; in other words, these are largely people who have no access to education, for whom third level education is not on the agenda and for whom second level education is almost not on the agenda. The housing conditions in which they live are, in many cases, very deprived.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1443" /> If these people happen to fall sick, God help them because we have an arrangement with the IMO, the Irish Medical Organisation, where we can have 40% of the population in the medical card system. In fact only 31% of the population is in the medical card system. The effect is that a single person who earns over £95 per week, a married couple who earn over £135 per week or a married couple with two qualifying children who have an income over £167 per week do not qualify for a medical card. That was never intended. Only the poorest of the poor now get a medical card. There are people whose children are sick week in, week out who will not go to the doctor because they cannot afford to do so.</P>
    <P>What I have said about housing, prison reform, education, drug abuse and health in the few minutes available to me indicates that social apartheid is alive and well and only we, in this House, can put that right. This debate gives us an opportunity as we prepare for the budget, for future budgets and, indeed, for the election ahead to set the agenda, an agenda which considers social justice to be as important, or more important, than something called &ldquo;economic success&rdquo;. We are not running an economy, we are running a country and when running a country, we have to take into account the weakest people. The sooner we are obliged to do that, the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Cooper-Flynn and Lenihan.</P>
      <P>As Minister with primary responsibility for social inclusion, I welcome the opportunity provided by this Private Members' Bill to speak on the adoption of a rights-based approach to social policy.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendment refers to certain principles. Everybody should have the right to earn a livelihood. In fact, that is currently there and registered in our Constitution. Everybody must have the right to adequate health care and to a decent standard of living. These rights are already guaranteed in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which was ratified by a Fianna Fáil-led Government in 1989.</P>
      <P>Supporting the case for the systematic advancement and promotion of rights does not imply that such rights are not already realised in Ireland to a significant degree, or that legislation, policies and programmes do not exist to promote these. For instance, our republican Constitution, introduced by my party in 1937, enshrines a large number of rights, including the right to a livelihood, in a way which is the envy of some of our neighbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a recent document, contains substantial commitments in relation to poverty and social exclusion and reinforces a rights context in public policy by stating that citizenship rights encompass social, <Col N="1444" /> economic and cultural rights and obligations which are embedded in our political culture.</P>
    <P>The matter before the House is whether there is a need for specific rights to be incorporated in law, into our Constitution, and the experience of other countries in this regard is instructive. When one looks at other countries where there is a rights based approach in their legislation, one will find that not everything that is put in place in that respect comes to fruition. Like us, they would have difficulties in delivering on those rights.</P>
    <P>Recently the Constitution Review Group stated the main reason the Constitution should not confer personal rights to freedom from poverty or to other specific economic and social entitlement is that they are essentially political matters, which in a democracy should be the responsibility of elected representatives of the people to address and determine. As a republican party, Fianna Fáil believes the democratically elected representatives of the people must take on that responsibility to promote the welfare of all our people.</P>
    <P>Unlike the elitist approach of the Labour Party, we do not believe social rights are best adjudicated on by unelected judges. It is always easier to have these ideas in Opposition. Despite being in Government for a decade or more in recent years, it seems it is only now that the Labour Party discovers its commitment to social rights. For instance, instead of doing nothing else but discussing, analysing and assessing issues such as employment, Fianna Fáil's record is one of action. We can rightly claim we have reduced unemployment to historic and heretofore unimagined levels, at a time when there was a significant increase in the population with many of our emigrants returning. We have helped to crack the nut of intergenerational unemployment and poverty.</P>
    <P>I take very seriously the responsibility of promoting the welfare of our people and I am proud that this Government has overseen significant improvements on a comprehensive social inclusion agenda in our term of office to date. In An Action Programme for the Millennium the Government set the objective of building an inclusive society. We set out to make this a better Ireland for all. What is the result? Findings for the 1998 Living In Ireland Survey show the number of people living in consistent poverty has dropped from 15% in 1994 to 8% in 1998. In practical terms, that means the number of people who cannot afford basic items such as warm clothing, good footwear and a balanced diet, has reduced by one-half over that period.</P>
    <P>In addition, the most recent information from the ESRI on child poverty shows that the level of consistent poverty dropped from 17% to 12% in the 12 month period from 1997 to 1998. That means that 50,000 children were taken out of poverty as a result of the Government's policies. Much of this massive drop in child poverty is due to our work friendly policies, which have put in place a wide range of supports for unemployed <Col N="1445" /> people and produced plummeting unemployment figures.</P>
    <P>Record welfare increases have also had an impact. I have been able to say after each budget introduced under this Government that the increase in social welfare in that budget was the highest in the history of the State. I will not give away any secrets when I say that significant improvements on last's years record welfare package can be expected in the forthcoming budget.</P>
    <P>While this progress is encouraging, we are determined to achieve even more through a comprehensive review and extension of the national anti-poverty strategy, which is about to get under way. As part of that review, which is being carried out in conjunction with the social partners under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, new targets will be considered in consultation with the social partners under the themes of child poverty, women's poverty, health, older people, housing and accommodation.</P>
    <P>Recognising rights to health care, housing and so on is not the full solution to the problems that exist &ndash; it is not the magic wand many hope it will be. The use of rights language and even enshrining rights in legislation in isolation can achieve very little. It is important to ensure all that is possible is being done to break the cycle of disadvantage by ensuring the appropriate policies and resources are in place to bring about change.</P>
    <P>The focus of the Government is and will continue to be on determining the needs of the disadvantaged in society and on identifying and developing policies which meet those needs. The Labour Party proposal will not help to achieve these objectives. Its drafting is fundamentally flawed. For instance, why include a right to earn a livelihood when it is already in our Constitution? The Labour Party approach is typical of its arrogant and elitist approach to democracy. It does not trust the people to do the right thing. It does not trust the Members of this House to act in the best interests of all our people.</P>
    <P>We, in Fianna Fáil, are committed to making this a better Ireland for all. That is what we have done in our term of office to date and what we will continue to do. We will continue on the road of social partnership, which has been the hallmark of enshrining in law the types of rights to which the Labour Party is referring. The experience of recent years shows how we have turned the corner. When I started out in public life intergenerational unemployment and poverty were evident, but matters have improved as a result of the social partnership my party pioneered in Government in 1987. A job is the best way out of poverty, but in the past people who lived in certain estates &ndash; we all know such estates in our constituencies &ndash; were refused a job interview because they had a certain address on their application forms. That is no longer the case and that is a testimony to the type of policies implemented by Fianna Fáil, when in Government over the period, irrespective of which party was in <Col N="1446" /> Government with it. People who did not have the possibility of participating in society are now participating in it. The issue of intergenerational unemployment, whereby from generation to generation families did not have a prospect of getting a job that would help bring them out of poverty, is a thing of the past. That is a hallmark of the type of society we now have, based on the policies this party in Government has put in place.</P>
    <P>I am not saying we have the answer to all the ills, but in Government our record has been one of action. Instead of discussing, analysing and navel gazing for too long on issues, we do something about them. The numbers on the live register have fallen by more than 100,000 over the past three and a half years, while the population has increased by more than 100,000. That is testimony to the type of society this Government and previous Governments led by my party have achieved over several years.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be overly political, but the reality is that parties on the far side of the House were not overly in favour of social partnership, a partnership that is delivering on the aspirations and ideals of all our society. People from all walks of life, whether members of unions, farmers, employers or the voluntary and community sector, an important addition to social partnership, are part of the process, under which much more than the rights attempted to be enshrined in this legislation, the rights of ordinary people are being examined and advanced as a result of the social partnership model. The recent fuel crisis did not affect this country as badly as it did other European countries because our social partnership model kicked into place. That is an example of how social partnership works. That type of co-operation is much more important than giving a nod towards putting rights into the Constitution. I am not saying it is bad to do that, but actions speak louder than words. We will continue on the road of social partnership while the Government is in office and into the future to ensure ordinary people get their just deserts and the rights they deserve. The example of social partnership and the democracy we have in Ireland, has stood us in good stead.</P>

      <P>The attempt to enshrine these rights in the Constitution in this format may well be unhelpful and seems to be me unlikely to achieve the ends sought by the proposers. If one looks in detail at what is proposed one could not reasonably argue with the intentions herein; the amendment proposes that the State, bearing in mind international legal standards, recognises the economic, social and cultural rights of all persons. That is an interesting point at which to begin, as it presupposes that a State has absolute and total control over the economic well-being of its citizens. That may well be the case at the moment, but I do not accept that it is always the case that a State, particularly one of our economic mass, is in a position to deliver on this commitment were it included in the Constitution. Many corpor<Col N="1447" /> ations exceed a State such as this in size and value and the international marketplace tends to have little respect for the smaller players.</P>
      <P>The current Government can rightly claim credit for many positive policies which have contributed to the improvement of standards of living, but, as three Ministers said in last night's debate, the State, through Governments of all shades of political opinion, has attempted to enshrine the rights of citizens in law and to ensure the weaker elements of society are looked after to the best of the State's ability.</P>
      <P>People's social and cultural rights are referred to in this proposal and this is a very important area. Some people argue with some justification that those rights are enshrined in various other aspects of the Constitution and have been looked after, but we need to be vigilant about this in future, though I enter the same caveat that insertion into the Constitution might not be the most effective way to ensure such rights survive into the future.</P>
      <P>The right to a livelihood and to reasonable conditions of employment could also be said to be currently enshrined in the Constitution and in so far as that is not specifically done they are enshrined in a raft of legislation regarding conditions of employment. Unfortunately, from time to time difficulties arise and conditions of employment lead to strikes and, at times, Members get aggravated at the treatment meted out to people and cast about for ways to address the problem. There is an argument that the appropriate way to address deficiencies of this nature is through legislation passed by the Oireachtas rather than through a constitutional amendment such as this.</P>
      <P>Underlying all this is the requirement that the State, through its policies, be in a fiscal position to deliver adequate health care. It seems to me and to others who have exercised their minds about health care that there has been little tangible improvement arising from spending huge amounts of money on health. That is a matter of huge concern and I doubt that situation would improve for the individual were the proposed change to the Constitution made.</P>
      <P>An immediate and tangible improvement in housing for many families would also be unlikely if this amendment were made. I agree with the contention of several Members that it would be more appropriate for the House to carry out its functions under the Constitution and to address these issues on an ongoing basis. To be fair, that is what Members have sought to do &ndash; not all of us to great effect but at least with a commitment to ensuring a dignified existence for the State's citizens.</P>

      <P>I heard the Labour Party leader interviewed on radio and I agree with some of the sentiments behind the Bill, but I disagree as to the manner in which the Bill's aims can be achieved &ndash; through a constitutional <Col N="1448" /> amendment. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said last night that the Bill is loosely based on rights contained in the 1966 UN International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which Ireland has signed. It was ratified in December 1989 and came into force for Ireland in March 1990. Ireland makes regular reports on this to a relevant UN committee, so we are already signed up to many of the sentiments in this Bill. I welcome the fact that our last report to the UN committee was in 1999.</P>
      <P>In 1996 the report of the Constitutional Review Group also looked at these issues in great detail and the main reason given as to why the Constitution should not confer personal rights to freedom from poverty or other economic and social entitlements is that these are essentially political matters which, in a democracy, should be the responsibility of elected Members to address and determine. I agree fully with that because when we put ourselves forward for election we outline our policies clearly to the public, which votes on them. Many issues referred to in this Bill have been dealt with effectively by the Government, such as health care and housing.</P>
      <P>It is important to recognise that these are responsibilities of the Oireachtas and elected representatives, not an unelected Judiciary. It would be wrong to go down that road.</P>
      <P>The 1996 report refers to solving economic and social problems as being an integral part of a political agenda. Time and again Members complain about matters being taken out of our domain and decided elsewhere. This is a perfect opportunity for Members to implement policy on serious issues such as health care, livelihood and housing and the Government is doing so very effectively.</P>
      <P>To be fair to the Labour Party, the Constitutional Review Group, on balance, favoured an amendment to Article 40.3 of the Constitution, but that matter will be considered by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitution. When that committee has examined the matter the Government will consider the situation.</P>
      <P>Housing is one area referred to in the Bill which is very much in the public eye. Nobody could have done more or taken the housing situation more seriously than the Government. That is illustrated by the fact that £7 billion will be allocated in respect of housing over the six years of the national development plan. The Government has provided an increase of 60% in Exchequer expenditure on an ambitious programme of local authority and social housing and this has resulted in a significant number of housing starts in every local authority area. Between now and the end of 2003, there will be 25,000 local authority housing starts and 15,000 additional voluntary housing units. For the first time, there will be a serious effort by local authorities, particularly the one I represent, in dealing with housing for Travellers over a five year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Government has gone to great lengths to ensure that houses will be more affordable for first-time buyers. It has put in place some <Col N="1449" /> radical measures to make that a reality and some of those measures are beginning to yield results. The relevant statistics support my case and no one can argue that the Government has shirked its responsibility to provide adequate housing for all citizens. That is our responsibility as elected representatives.</P>

      <P>I will be brief because I wish to afford the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, the opportunity to contribute. I thank Deputy Cooper-Flynn for sharing time.</P>
      <P>I understand the objectives outlined in the Bill and I agree they are extremely important. However, we must ask whether they should be enshrined in the Constitution. As the purpose of the Constitution is to enshrine fundamental and human rights, not to detail specific economic and social rights. This matter has been considered by the all-party committee on the Constitution and if the Labour Party is contemplating taking further action in this area, it should refer the matter back to the committee for further consideration.</P>
      <P>The problem with writing specific economic and social rights into the Constitution is that as time passes the Supreme Court may interpret the Constitution as we originally envisaged it or it may interpret it differently. Regardless of the route the court takes, we are stuck with its judgment. The difficulty I have with the Bill is that when we write something into the Constitution and the Supreme Court adjudicates on it, we must adhere to the court's interpretation until a further constitutional amendment is introduced. This matter is exercising the minds of many people throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Our fundamental rights should be enshrined in the Constitution. In that context, the democratically elected Members are best placed to reflect on the changes in society from year to year and decade to decade and introduce the necessary legislation. This is the route we should take rather than enshrining individual economic rights into the Constitution as proposed by this measure. For example, what a Supreme Court judge might interpret as a person's right to reasonable conditions of employment might be viewed in more far-reaching terms by the House. I am concerned that the hands of the Oireachtas would be tied in terms of bringing forward progressive legislation if rigid provisions were added to the Constitution.</P>

    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen): I thank Deputies Cooper-Flynn and Fleming for sharing time.</P>
    <P>The Government remains wholly committed to the vindication of social, economic and cultural rights. We are striving to put in place the best possible social, economic and cultural programmes for all members of our society, particularly the most vulnerable. The Government is doing everything in its power, subject to resources, to facilitate individuals and families in the enjoyment of such rights and to assist and, where necessary, provide for those who, for whatever reason, are unable to provide adequately for themselves in the areas referred to in the amendment. Our actions include, but are by no means restricted to, the opportunity to earn a livelihood in reasonable conditions, adequate health care and adequate standards of living, housing and nutrition.</P>
    <P>I do not believe anyone could seriously suggest that we fall short of international legal standards, which the proposed amendment would have the State bear in mind, in meeting our social and economic obligations to all sections of society. Indeed, our public services in these areas are well in excess of any such legal standards. The Government is totally committed to improving services further in all the areas covered by the proposed amendment, as well as in other areas.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Quinn is aware that since 1997 we have provided for a 32% increase in spending on education. Any Government of which Labour was a member would be happy to stand over an increase of that order. In addition, spending in the area of health has doubled to over £4 billion and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has released land bank reserves in order to allow the additional houses we require to be built. I accept that there are problems of supply and demand in the area of housing but everyone is at full stretch in the current booming economy.</P>
    <P>With regard to the promotion of social inclusion, the amendment seems to ignore in a sense the question of social partnership, which is fundamental in terms of the issues raised in the motion. Social partnership has been the basis of our success in the past decade, during which Deputy Quinn's party has been in Government at various stages.</P>
    <P>It would be unwise to purport to guarantee something in the Constitution that, due to circumstances outside its control, any Government, with the best will in the world, might not be able to deliver. Already there is a shortage of qualified personnel in certain specialised areas. In spite of the Government and State agencies wanting to deliver services, there are practical difficulties in doing so in some circumstances.</P>
    <P>The amendment contains the phrase &ldquo;as far as practical&rdquo; but that phrase is capable of many interpretations which would, under the proposal, ultimately fall to the courts to determine. The suggested amendment could lead to the transfer <Col N="1451" /> of a large measure of policy determination in key areas from the Government and the Oireachtas to the Judiciary. Does Deputy Quinn realise that and is he seriously advocating such a course of action?</P>

      <P>I have listened to a succession of Government speakers who stated they think this amendment is a great idea but that it should not be included in the Constitution because it is not necessary. An interviewee on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning made the case, if unintentionally, in favour of this amendment. On the programme, one of the 28 tenants living in a group of houses in Ballybough in the Taoiseach's constituency spoke about facing eviction because the owners of the properties are selling them over the tenants' heads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The resident concerned referred to vindicating his constitutional right to housing. The problem is that he does not have such a right and the purpose of this amendment, among other things, is to confer that right on him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's argument seems to be that the Constitution is for civil, political and fundamental rights but that it should remain neutral in respect of social and economic rights. However, the Constitution is not neutral in those areas. The landlord who owns the properties in Ballybough has a constitutional right to their ownership and to sell them, but the people who live in them and who face eviction do not have a corresponding constitutional right to a home. The land speculators who contribute so much to the increased <Col N="1452" /> price of housing, particularly in the greater Dublin area, have a constitutional right to their property and to its economic use, but young couples who are trying to buy a home of their own do not have a corresponding constitutional right. Private landlords have a constitutional right to the properties they own and to their use, but the tenants who live in them do not have a constitutional right to a home. The people who are sleeping rough in this city tonight and who are homeless do not have a constitutional right to a home.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party proposes to give citizens a constitutional right to housing and to a home. The idea of enshrining in the Constitution a right to housing, to shelter and to a home was first proposed in the Labour Party's Housing Commission report. We are seeking to give effect to that proposal in the Bill. That constitutional right is necessary to counter-balance the other rights, particularly the rights to property which are already enshrined in the Constitution and which are hauled out repeatedly every time a measure is proposed to deal with the enormous housing crisis.</P>
    <P>I listened yesterday evening to the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, who seems to think the housing problem is solved. He again uttered the same mantra that supply has been increased and so on. One cannot talk in this House about the allocation of 22,000 local authority houses over the next four years, for example. One must look at performance and delivery. According to the Department's figures, in the first six months of this year, only 500 local authority dwellings were provided at a time when there are 50,000 families on housing waiting lists. Legislation was promised on the proposals from the commission on the private rented sector but it has not yet been published. There are occasional hints that there may be constitutional difficulties in relation to this issue. We need to deal with the constitutional difficulties and to enshrine in our Constitution a right to housing so that the measures which will be necessary to deal with the housing crisis can be put in place without impediment or obstruction.</P>

      <P>The Constitution is the basic law document of the State. It sets out the rights of citizens and the principles underpinning the functioning of the State. It provides a benchmark against which legislation and public practice may be tested. It is also a statement of the political and social values of our society. While every Constitution reflects the ethos of the period in which it was drafted, many of the values of a constitution remain valued throughout decades, generations and even centuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Constitution of the United States was drafted more than 200 years ago but many of the principles it espouses are as valid today as they were two centuries ago. The Constitution of Norway was adopted in 1814. Compared to these documents, our Constitution is of relatively <Col N="1453" /> recent vintage. All constitutions need to be amended to reflect changing values, standards and aspirations. It is of critical importance to have a constitution that can meet the challenges of today and the future in a manner which provide greater inclusiveness, equality and democratic participation.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas committee is considering the broader question of constitutional reform, based on the Whitaker committee report, established by the rainbow Government when it came into office in December 1994. This is a major task which may take some time to complete. The fact that the Oireachtas committee is looking at the broader question of constitutional reform does not absolve the Oireachtas from its responsibility to look at the more obvious and urgent defects in the Constitution which could be addressed without having to wait for the committee's final report.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that each Constitution reflects to some extent the era in which it was drafted. Our Constitution is no exception, particularly in relation to the contrasting way in which it treats the respective claims of private property and social justice. Article 43 gives primacy to the rights of private property, circumscribed only by the qualification that these rights must, in certain cases, be subordinated to the principle of social justice. It is entirely appropriate that the Constitution should uphold the right of individuals to hold private property, but why should the right to private property be of greater importance than the right to work, education, nutrition and shelter? Take, for example, the right of a parent on social welfare benefit to provide third level education for their children. When they face huge costs and the Department of Education and Science turns its back, the system is such that the community welfare officer is put in a difficult position trying to help that parent. Why should this parent have to struggle in a time of such wealth in the country?</P>
    <P>Society has changed enormously since the 1930s when the Constitution was drafted. We now have the money and resources that would not have been imaginable 60 years ago. It might have been unreasonable to place the burden of enforceable social and economic rights on a new and under-developed State, but that is no longer a valid argument. We are now entering a new century and we need to set ourselves a new agenda. Not everyone is benefiting equally from the economic boom. There are many islands of deprivation in this sea of plenty. If one is born poor, one is still more likely to die poor. The children of the lowest income groups still have the least chance of receiving third level education, particularly university education. The doorways of buildings in the centre of our capital city tonight still provide the only shelter for many homeless people. People must wait for years for treatment for painful and often life-threatening conditions. Children still go to bed hungry each night in this land of plenty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1454" /> The cycle repeats itself in each generation. Poverty, as well as wealth, is inherited in this society. Will we accept this or begin to move forward?</P>

      <P>The Labour Party introduced this Bill on the day the Equal Status Act comes into force. While this legislation is welcome as an anti-discrimination measure, it is clear this is anything but a society where equality prevails. We need only look around us to see that there are very deep divisions in our society and that a fundamental examination is needed of what it is to live in a society where equality truly reigns. This Bill to amend the Constitution in relation to socio and economic rights is part of a very important move forward towards a genuinely equal society. There is a great need for a process of social renewal. There are homeless people living on the streets of our cities. People must wait in hospital queues for years in many cases. It is clear that while there may be anti-discrimination legislation on the Statute Book, that does not in itself bring equality of opportunity and life experience. Anti-discrimination legislation covers only certain aspects.</P>
      <P>This is a time of plenty with extra billions of pounds in Government coffers, yet it is not deemed the appropriate time to introduce these equal rights. When will we have a more appropriate time? When times are bad, we are told people must wait and, when times are good, we are told it is still not appropriate to guarantee basic social and economic rights in our Constitution. What we are talking about is the right to earn a livelihood, to have reasonable conditions of employment, adequate health care and standard of living comprising adequate housing, nutrition and other means necessary to a dignified existence. Surely these are basic rights that should be enshrined in the Constitution. I am amazed at the Government's response that the Constitution is not the appropriate place for these rights when, as Deputy Gilmore said, property rights are very well enshrined in our Constitution and skew the balance against these basic rights.</P>
      <P>Under the equality legislation people with disabilities were not given the rights we hope to introduce under this proposal because of the property rights in the Constitution. Only a nominal cost could be incurred. Surely that is good reason to change our Constitution in this regard. People must be able to vindicate their rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In opening the debate last night, Deputy Quinn referred to the response to Towards Equal Citizenship, the report indicating how the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities was being implemented. It suggested that giving disabled people a legally backed right to health and social services would cost too much money. Therefore, people cannot have these basic rights because of the cost and because, as Deputy Quinn said, it might lead to requests from other persons seeking access to health and other services without regard to the eventual cost of providing them. Surely people are entitled to these <Col N="1455" /> basic rights which are more important than many others, such as those concerning property, already enshrined in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children said last night that we were indulging in flights of political fancy in wanting to enshrine these rights in the Constitution. If that is the case what kind of society do we believe in? Do we believe only in the economy or in a society where citizens are equal and living in solidarity, where we do not have citizens who cannot access housing, health care, education &ndash; we saw examples of that in the courts recently &ndash;  and children who cannot access the most basic of rights? Surely we must enshrine these rights in the Constitution.</P>

      <P>Throughout its long history the Labour Party has striven to place economic and social rights at the heart of our basic rights. We profoundly disagree with the thesis advanced last night by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue. Historians rightly salute the influence of the Labour Party and the trade union movement in the publication of the democratic programme in the first Dáil and the attempts of our predecessors to emphasise economic and social rights in the 1922 and 1937 Constitutions.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, is thus carrying on a great tradition through this Bill. He noted several times in last night's debate that constitutional provision of itself may not change the poverty and grave economic circumstances of many of our citizens but it can at least set a standard which Governments must address and which could be a signpost for future generations of political leaders. It also gives our most vulnerable citizens the ultimate avenue of recourse to the courts system where a Government blatantly ignores the Constitution and thus has great merit in itself.</P>
      <P>The new section 7 lays down the fundamental requirement of the right to an adequate standard of living comprising adequate housing, nutrition and other means necessary to a dignified existence. If the 21st amendment were part of our basic law, the huge discrepancy between this modest ideal and the reality for tens of thousands of citizens would be apparent.</P>

    <P>For the first occasion in living memory increases in our social welfare rates of 5.2% to 5.7% this year have been easily superseded by inflation, and the cost of living, standing at 6.2% for over three months, is almost certainly rising. Because of high energy costs and the rising price of oil, our senior citizens, widows, carers, those on disability, lone parents and the long-term unemployed are faced with outrageous increases in the cost of heating and other services and rising food and grocery prices. A caring Government operating under an amendment such as that proposed by Deputy Quinn would have come forward last September with an emergency inflation package or even perhaps a Euro solidarity pack<Col N="1456" /> age to commence on 1 December or at latest 1 January. Despite its £2 billion current war chest, the Ministers, Deputies Ahern and McCreevy, laughingly refused to take this course of action five or six weeks ago and our most vulnerable citizens must wait until 6 April for relief.</P>
    <P>The issue of income adequacy in the Labour Party's view is the key underlying central motif of all social welfare provision. Our call last year, for example, for a basic rise of £10 went unheeded. We will shortly make our proposals for 2001. We recognise that the ravages of inflation must be addressed head on as it affects our poorest citizens and all our proposals should meet the reasonable criteria of the amendment before us. Despite the massive growth of our economy, 25% of children still live in families where basic income is below £90 per week and 17% of families live below the poverty line. Ireland has the disgraceful distinction of having one of the highest rates of child poverty in the EU, together with Portugal and the UK. Women are a particularly vulnerable, high risk group in terms of poverty. The most striking aspect, which many Labour Deputies noticed, of the recent report on lone parent payment was the grave risk of poverty of single parent families headed by women.</P>
    <P>As regards widows, senior citizens and carers, the Government has failed deplorably to provide an adequate standard of living. The recent demand by carers that a basic carer's charter be incorporated into legislation is just and it could be encompassed in this Bill. In the context of our current wealth, from combating rampant inflation and providing an adequate standard of living to recognising the rights of senior citizens, children, widows, carers and most vulnerable families, the Government is very hard-hearted and careless. For such a Government the Bill would provide a basic legal barrier below which living standards could not fall. For that reason I commend Deputy Quinn and his Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>It is incredible to listen to Government backbenchers agreeing with the sentiments of the Bill but falling short of agreeing to it. There is a sense among them that what the Labour Party is trying to achieve is the right way to do business politically, but there is a deep sense of unease on the part of Ministers that their hands might be tied in regard to the policies they implement. The reason they are concerned is they do not believe in the fundamental principles of basic civil rights &ndash; civil, social and economic rights for our people.</P>
      <P>As well as giving a clear message to the people about what we believe in regarding the equality of citizens, this Bill gives the Government an opportunity to make its position clear. Unfortunately by its insistence on rejecting this Bill it is making it clear it is not prepared to go the route of basic civil rights. It is not prepared to provide, on a legal basis, for an equal and just society. That says a lot about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to draw attention to the official denial of basic rights for a consider<Col N="1457" /> able section of the people and propose a constitutional basis for establishing and guaranteeing those rights. It seems incredible that, at a time of such plenty, we have the scandalous position of a considerable section of the people being denied the most fundamental rights, the right to earn a living, to shelter and nutrition. It is difficult to see how that sits with our present wealth where the Government has an enormous budget surplus and a great opportunity to right many past mistakes and to tip the balance back in favour of those who have been less fortunate than the rest of us, giving them an equal opportunity in life.</P>
    <P>My colleagues have outlined the situations in which many of our people find themselves because of the denial of rights. Children, the most vulnerable section of our population, are affected by the denial of those rights by the Government, and particularly by poverty. Deputy Gilmore spoke of the shameful number of people sleeping rough and in very overcrowded hostels and bed and breakfast accommodation. Among these homeless people are 1,000 children of homeless families. How can we content ourselves when we live in a State which has such enormous wealth but where more than 1,000 children live by night in appalling circumstances and wander the streets by day, hanging around in public parks to fill in the day? Since most of these children are displaced people they do not attend school. We see many of them begging on the streets by day in order to buy food in fast food restaurants. It is tragic to see young families dragging around the streets of the city, filling in the time until their bed and breakfast accommodation opens at 6 o'clock in the evening. This is an indictment of the Government.</P>
    <P>Children are losing out in many other areas while the Government is engaging in the scandalous exercise of debating whether to cut a few pence off the top rate of tax to benefit the people who are already doing very well. Young people at serious risk are being failed by the State. Young people who have got into trouble with the law and who have serious behavioural problems are being denied basic care and protection because the State is not prepared to provide the resources for the necessary services. Children are deprived of several essential services, particularly in the area of education. The Government has done little or nothing to target those children who are most deprived and most disadvantaged. Education can be a way to break the cycle of poverty but the Government has chosen to ignore that fact and has done little or nothing to target educational spending at those most in need. That is one of the reasons the Labour Party is tabling this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of children's rights is a fundamental one which has not been adequately dealt with by the State. Policies to remedy the serious marginalisation of children have been far from successful, if they exist at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1458" /> There are 1,250 children homeless in the Dublin area alone, 90,000 children are living in consistent poverty and 4,000 cases of physical or sexual abuse against children are reported annually. We should vindicate those children's rights.</P>
    <P>Far too many children are falling seriously short of their potential in education. There are 64,000 children with serious literacy problems at school, more than 3,000 children leave school each year without a qualification, 33,000 children have special education needs and many of them are not identified in time. Surely we must vindicate the right of these citizens.</P>
    <P>Far too many children are engaging in high risk behaviour. More than 5,000 teenagers are regular users of hard drugs and more than a third of children are regular smokers. There is a high level of casual and unprotected sex among children.</P>
    <P>The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child spells out the right of a child to a full and decent life in the different domains where public policy plays a part. The convention has been ratified by Ireland but it must be spelled out in a charter of rights that can be placed on the wall of every public service provider. Every agency must have a strategy to recognise this convention and must make measurable progress in improving the lot of children.</P>
    <P>There should be a strong, independent commissioner of children's rights, an Ombudsman for children. The Government has been promising this for years but it must put in place such a commissioner who will constantly turn over stones to see the dark underside. The commissioner, or Ombudsman, should be appointed by statute, must be independent of Government and should have an Ombudsman's role on complaints, policies and procedures. The Ombudsman should have a monitoring role on the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. He or she should have independent powers of investigation and have the opportunity to childproof legislation and ministerial proposals. He or she should have an advocacy role for children, a pioneering research arm and a direct input to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>There are too many children whose circumstances represent serious deviation from an acceptable standard. In March 1999, there were 340 young people under the age of 20 alone and homeless in Dublin and a further 900 children homeless with a parent. When measured both in terms of relative income and denial of basic necessities, 9% of children are found to be in consistent poverty. The infant mortality rate among Traveller children is 2.5 times the national average and nothing is being done about it. There are more than 4,000 reported cases of physical and sexual abuse per year, up over 50% in four years. The number of pregnancies which end in abortion continues to grow and is now equal to more than one in eight live births, with more than 1,000 teenage mothers procuring abortion. There is growing evidence of child prostitution among <Col N="1459" /> young people. A 1997 study found 50 children under 18 working in prostitution in Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate and will try to deal with some of the questions raised by Deputy Shortall and others.</P>
      <P>The consensus on economic and social policy which we now have in Ireland could not have been achieved without the existence of basic social standards. That consensus of social partnership, to which many of my colleagues referred because of our attachment to that process, involves employers, employees and Government and has been backed up by a well balanced array of employment rights and labour legislation.</P>
      <P>It is widely accepted that good economic benefits accrue from strong co-operative labour relations in the workplace. Employees who enjoy good working conditions are more likely to be productive and willing to embrace change than those without such progressive conditions of employment.</P>
      <P>The primary objectives of employment rights legislation are to protect employees against arbitrary or capricious behaviour by employers, to protect the safety and health of workers and to foster labour market stability by promoting personnel policies which minimise conflict and maximise fairness. Additional objectives are to afford special protection to special groups, for example pregnant workers and young workers.</P>
      <P>In keeping with this voluntarist tradition, collective agreements are the primary method of determining conditions of employment. The role of statute law has generally been limited to setting minimal standard levels of protection or entitlement. Over the past 20 or 30 years, Ireland has been in the forefront in ensuring that reasonable conditions of employment exist which set out clearly for employers and employees their respective entitlements.</P>
      <P>Successive Governments, including those in which Deputy Quinn's party participated, have enacted legislation on employment rights reflecting changes in society and the workplace at national and international level, that is, through the transposition of EU directives, International Labour Organisation and Council of Europe recommendations and conventions. Such legislation has covered a wide range of areas, including minimum notice and terms of employment, protection against unfair dismissal, payment of wages, organisation of working time, protection of young persons at work, safety, health and welfare at work, redundancy entitlements and minimum wage entitlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to this legislation, Ireland has ratified all seven of the core conventions designated by the ILO. In June 1989 the ILO adopted convention No. 182 concerning the prohibition and immediate action for the elimination of child labour. I was pleased, as the Minister of State <Col N="1460" /> responsible, that we were the first EU member state to do so. The Government supports compliance with these instruments as affirming its commitment to ensuring our labour standards reflect best international practice.</P>
    <P>Ireland was also among the first Council of Europe member states to sign and ratify the European Social Charter which was opened for signature in 1961. In so doing, Ireland decided to accept all the essential or core provisions of the charter and most of the remaining provisions with a number of exceptions. The revised European Social Charter was opened for signature in Strasbourg on 3 May 1996. Ireland has given detailed consideration to the revised charter and I am pleased to inform the House that we will be in a position to sign and ratify it in the near future.</P>
    <P>Central to the successful effectiveness of this legislation is the parallel appeals procedures involving rights commissioners, the Labour Court, Labour Relations Commission and Employment Appeals Tribunal, all of which provide employees and employers with access to independent redress mechanisms to resolve disputes. I have no doubt that Members will agree that these mechanisms have worked during the years.</P>
    <P>The most frequent criticism of labour legislation, which tends to be over-exaggerated, is that it lowers employment through an increase in labour costs and a loss of competitiveness. Conversely, supporters of labour legislation have pointed to its indirectly beneficial effects in promoting labour market stability and minimising conflict. That is the case in Ireland.</P>
    <P>As regards our citizens being fully informed about their labour law rights, my Department's employment rights information unit is expected to deal with 120,000 inquiries this year compared to 85,000 last year. This reflects a greater awareness among the public of its entitlements and desire to ensure it obtains them. This is a healthy and positive development and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>In the current Dáil session I will sponsor two Bills which reflect in a pragmatic way the ongoing changes in society and which must be reflected in the needs and expectations of workers. The first is the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Bill, 2000, which is designed to give effect to EU Council Directive 97/81/EC, which was adopted in 1997. The Bill will provide for the removal of discrimination against part-time workers where such exists. It will also improve the quality of part-time work, facilitate the development of part-time work on a voluntary basis as well as contribute to the flexible organisation of working time in a manner which takes into account the needs of employers and workers. It will further guarantee that part-time workers may not be treated less favourably than full-time workers.</P>
    <P>The second is the Carer's Leave Bill, 2000, which will allow employees to take up to 65 weeks unpaid leave to look after persons in need of full-time care and attention. The Bill complements the Government's budget 2000 proposal <Col N="1461" /> to introduce from this October a carer's benefit scheme which will be administered by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The Bill is a further recognition by the Government of the important role played by carers in society and we must continue to provide support and practical assistance for them. The Bill will make it possible for workers to make the temporary choice of becoming a carer without loss of employment and, where possible, care recipients may be cared for in the home. The Bill is a unique and innovative social policy that seeks to support people during a difficult period.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State responsible for labour affairs, I am satisfied that the right to reasonable conditions of employment should and will continue to be enshrined in employment rights legislation. As my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, stated, it is our duty, as elected and accountable legislators, to adopt a proactive approach in ensuring any such future legislation reflects the needs and expectations of employees and employers, is framed in such a way as to respond to the needs of society as a whole and reflects the ongoing changes taking place at an enormous pace in the labour market.</P>
    <P>While the motivation for the Labour Party Bill to amend the Constitution is well intentioned &ndash; I welcome the debate &ndash; I am not sure it would provide the flexibility which would allow us, as legislators, to introduce legislation in a speedy and effective manner should it be required in the area of employment or other rights. Deputy Shortall claims to have a monopoly of ideas and solutions in dealing with social inclusion, which for some time has been central to Fianna Fáil policy. The Government has reduced unemployment to 3.8%.</P>

      <P>Article 1 of the Constitution states:</P>
      <P>The Irish nation hereby affirms its inalienable, indefeasible, and sovereign right to choose its own form of Government, to determine its relations with other nations, and to develop its life, political, economic and cultural, in accordance with its own genius and traditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a guarantee of rights that we hold, as a free people, to determine our future and to shape that <Col N="1462" /> future to meet our needs. It is in that same spirit that we, in the Labour Party, are putting forward this set of further guarantees for inclusion in the Constitution. The right to a home is surely as important to human dignity and freedom as the right to choose who becomes our President; the right to work is as important as the right to own property; the right to medical care is as important to human life as the right to declare war on another nation. Yet, our Constitution does not protect these rights. It is silent on the issues of homelessness, needless suffering and the scourge of unemployment.</P>
    <P>In 1937 no one could have made such constitutional provision, but that was then and this is now. The radical transformation of our nation in political, economic and cultural terms gives us a capability unknown to any previous generation. We can meet the needs of the young people sleeping rough on our streets. We can provide health care for the elderly waiting in pain for hip replacement operations. We can ensure our people can contribute to the good of society and earn a living with dignity. We can meet these needs because we have unprecedented resources to do so and because we have a constitutional right, as a people, to organise our society in such a way as to meet those needs. What is lacking is a duty on those who govern to deliver and the recognition that the rights to a home, health care and work should be enshrined in our Constitution in order that they may be exercised.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the all-party committee on the Constitution which is in the process of considering at length the many proposals embodied in the expert review group report. If we were to accept and recommend that all the recommendations made be put to the people, we would have to hold referenda approximately every six months for many years to come. It may be the case that the review group, to which various Ministers referred, has done its work, but it is also the case that political judgment determines what proposals are put to the people. I am well aware that the Government is making deals with a handful of Deputies on holding a referendum on the issue of abortion. When it is politically expedient the Government has no qualms in pressing ahead, even though such a referendum would be wasteful, unnecessary and divisive. It would not stop one abortion or change one Irish woman's mind about termination of pregnancy, but it is not designed to. It is designed simply to maintain the life of the Government beyond its date of viability. The Government which is concentrating such efforts on that referendum is turning its face against establishing rights for those of us who are born, the children at risk of abuse, exploitation or future criminality because no one has given them the support they need or recognises that their rights must be upheld and delivered upon.</P>
    <P>Our society is deeply divided and the rights of many are being denied and lost as the balance tilts further in favour of the better-off. This is particularly true in the area of health care where <Col N="1463" /> a system of apartheid, pure and simple, operates daily. Unlike those Irish men who drew up the Constitution, we can create a new dispensation designed to match the needs of our generation and based on our capability to develop our life, as a nation, in political, economic and cultural terms. That is the task we have set out in this Bill and it deserves support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed but not surprised by the reaction from Fianna Fáil to this debate. Listening to the arguments made by successive speakers I wondered what the founding fathers of the party would have thought. It was as if we were listening to a Redmondite explanation as to why Home Rule would give all the autonomy required when the republicans of the day, including the Labour Party, were looking for sovereign independence.</P>
      <P>All the arguments put forward by the Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the only Minister to seriously address the issues raised in this debate, were couched in these terms. To take the historical analogy further, the Minister attempted to justify, in a re-run of that wonderful Fianna Fáil phrase &ldquo;external association&rdquo;, that all the rights we are seeking are there by way of external association in the international treaties we signed up to, but that we could not bring them home and put them into our own document. Why not? The reason proffered is that it might cost somebody something. This is at the core of the matter. The false argument was then trotted out to the effect that if a right is given it would lead to open season.</P>
      <P>Nobody appears to have read the carefully drafted amendment we propose to put into the Constitution. Having enumerated the rights, the second paragraph states: &ldquo;Where practicable, the enjoyment of these rights should in the first place be ensured by individual and family effort and initiative.&rdquo;  Rights carry responsibilities for those who are capable of exercising them. This does not provide an open cheque book. The third paragraph of the proposed amendment states: &ldquo;Where persons or their dependants are unable adequately to exercise or enjoy any of these rights, the State guarantees, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate these rights, in accordance with the principles of social justice.&rdquo;  The Taoiseach regularly goes on air and talks about us having the most successful economy in the world. When will he start talking about the society in which people live and which has produced this economy? We want to build a system where people can vindicate these rights themselves, as citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have citizens who know how to use the Constitution because of the way people like Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh and former Mr. Justice Brian Walsh opened up the workings of the Supreme Court in the 1950s and 1960s. Citizens like Máirín de Burca challenged, on their own initiative, the discrimination against women and <Col N="1464" /> non-property owners in relation to jury trials, and they won. Mrs. Airey challenged her right to legal aid. Senator Norris challenged his rights as a citizen with regard to his sexual orientation. That initiative and way of using the Constitution is one of the great jewels in the republican tradition of this country. People know how to use it in a way that is denied in many other countries.</P>
    <P>We are not seeking an open cheque book that would bankrupt the country, but we are asking that a counter-balance be written into our document, not into some international treaty or covenant we signed or ratified, welcome as that is, but into the document that was put together in the 1930s and that has been amended on a number of occasions. I do not understand why Fianna Fáil is opposed to this. Not one coherent argument has been made on the issue of amending the Constitution.</P>
    <P>We did not introduce this Bill to attack the Government. There are far more effective ways of doing that. We did not do it to suggest this was a way of attacking different aspects of policy. The Minister for Health and Children's pathetic litany of expenditure on health &ndash; one would think it was his own money &ndash; provoked some response. Likewise the ludicrous exposition on housing by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, as a justification for not dealing with the issue. This was accurately counter poised on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and repeated in the House this afternoon. What is the purpose of living in a republic at the turn of the Millennium if one cannot, alongside one's right to vote, vindicate, if one is incapable of doing it by one's own initiative and family effort, one's right to a house and to earn a livelihood?</P>
    <P>Is this what Fianna Fáil has come to? Is the party at the stage where people in the Department of Finance are writing the principles upon which its members come into this sovereign assembly and say in Augustinian style, &ldquo;yes, but not now, some time later&rdquo;. How much money does the country need in terms of piled up budget surpluses before people have the right, if they cannot do it for themselves, to get a house?</P>
    <P>Did the State collapse, did the portals of Merrion Street disintegrate under the weight of the court's judgment which said that the parents of an autistic child had the right to have their child educated to the best of their ability? Was that the collapse of civilisation as we know it? Did it undermine the republican structures of the State? What planet is Fianna Fáil living on? Where is the party's republican conscience, that its members have come here to read scripts that were crafted in the mealy-mouthed, bean-counting corridors of Merrion Street by people who do not realise that the world has changed and the country has changed with it?</P>
    <P>This year alone the Minister for Finance will have a current account surplus greater than all the money we got from the EU Structural Funds over the past six years. We are a rich country, but <Col N="1465" /> I am looking at impoverished minds. We have a spectacularly performing economy. On the radio this morning Michael Porter said if we deal with our own internal contradictions we can go on to a new higher level of economic prosperity.</P>
    <P>What is it for? To pile up more surpluses? To create new tax exiles who get licences for State monopolies, manipulate them for a couple of years, cash their chips and run away? Is that what this is about? Is that what we have come to?</P>

      <P>Why not accept this Bill? Why not deal with it? I am amazed at the procession of mealy-mouthed defences and Augustinian responses to a golden opportunity to write into the Constitution, and say to those who cannot by their individual efforts or whose families are incapable, for whatever reason, to deal with the <Col N="1466" /> needs of their children that, ultimately, if the law and the politicians fail them and if the politics of the day does not respond to their needs, they can at least go to court and the court will vindicate their rights? I thought that is what 1916, what this whole struggle, was about. I thought that was what being a member of a republic, as a citizen, was about, not a subject of some empire.</P>
      <P>I look at the soldiers of destiny and ask was it all for this? Is this where we are, that we cannot, at the turn of the Millennium, write into our document, not write into an international covenant, that we will, to the best of our ability, where practicable, vindicate certain fundamental rights? If Fianna Fáil will not do it in Government, the Labour Party will when our turn comes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter on behalf of a number of people in Kilkenny city who are concerned that once again this winter the gynaecological unit at the hospital will be closed for a period of time. I understand this development was brought about by the management of the hospital and it is currently being debated by the South Eastern Health Board. This is an issue of women's health and of facilitating all the patients in the hospital. With better management, they could be accommodated.</P>
      <P>The number of beds in the unit is being reduced because there will be an influx of people with respiratory problems and pneumonia during the winter. The Government is spending £750,000 refurbishing the nearby Kilcreene hospital. In the past week eight patients were turned away from the gynaecological unit. Surely the Kilcreene hospital could be reopened and the proper staff complement put in place to deal with the increased numbers of patients, particularly elderly people, who will be presented with these problems in the winter. This would mean the gynaecological unit which was established six years ago could be kept open.</P>
      <P>The hospital management has decided the unit should be closed to facilitate what is happening. However, a recent letter stated that if patients are lucky enough to be admitted they might be looked after in the maternity unit. It also points out that it is difficult to place a woman who is threatening to miscarry, or who has already miscarried, beside a mother and a new-born baby. Such an arrangement would put a dampener on things for the new mother, as she would know that someone beside her is miserable.</P>
      <P>The letter went on to point out that another alternative is that patients might be placed on a floor away from all facilities and specially trained gynaecological nurses. However, it drew attention to the fact that often after the doctor has gone questions arise and it is good for a patient to have a nurse to explain what is happening. Not all nurses are close to the midwifery unit so if a patient is on another floor she might not be as well informed as those accommodated in the gynaecological ward.</P>
      <P>There are issues concerning women's health which have to be addressed but the health board, in particular, is overlooking them. It is overlooking the accommodation and staffing problems in the hospital which will give rise to grave concern to all those who will seek the services of the gynaecological ward.</P>
      <P>One day last week, eight women with appointments had to be turned away because of the number of sudden admissions the previous evening. One lady had a number of abnormal smears and was anxious to get answers that day. It was a grim task for nurses to have to send these people home. If beds are closed more women will be disappointed. The Minister of State should use his good offices with the South Eastern Health Board to ensure this does not happen again this winter, that the services in the gynaecological unit are maintained at the present level and that no beds are lost.</P>

      <P>On behalf of my colleague the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, I am glad of this opportunity to inform the House of the current position in relation to this issue. As the Deputy will be aware, the provision of services at St. Luke's hospital, Kilkenny, is a matter for the South Eastern Health Board in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The South Eastern Health Board document, Shaping the Future of the Kilkenny Hospital Sys<Col N="1469" /> tem, is the blueprint for the development of St. Luke's hospital as a comprehensive, integrated, quality and efficient hospital, capable of meeting the challenges of the times in a competent and humane manner. The year 2002 is the target date set for rationalisation of all hospital services in Kilkenny city into an interactive hospital complex.</P>
    <P>This development plan contains proposals to enhance existing services on the St. Luke's site, including general surgery, general medicine, obstetrics, gynaecology, accident and emergency and diagnostic services. It proposes to provide all hospital services on one site in a way that combines ease of access for the public with a cost-effective service.</P>
    <P>The development plans take account of national policy which is to have a strong network of local and general hospitals which serve defined catchment hospital services for general medical and surgical facilities. Pending completion of these developments, the hospital has a limited capacity to respond internally to the increase in demands presented due to its physical design and structure and lack of access to alternatives to in-patient services.</P>
    <P>The following measures are proposed to be implemented with a view to redressing the difficulties experienced in the hospital: the development of a four bed medical assessment-observation unit; the redesignation of bed allocation between specialties in the hospital &ndash; medical, surgical and gynaecology, including the redesignation of four gynaecological beds as surgical beds; the provision of enhanced community supports including home help, home care and direct access to convalescent care in private nursing homes to facilitate early discharge and the development of the role of bed management group at consultant level to review, on a scheduled basis, the impact of these measures.</P>
    <P>Proposals for the development of a medical admissions unit are at an advanced stage and protocols for its management are being prepared. Equipping and commissioning will take approximately four weeks. Arrangements will be made for contracting an agreed number of private nursing home beds to which patients may be discharged directly from St. Luke's general hospital for convalescent care. Discharges will be within agreed protocols and for a maximum duration of ten days. The purpose of this measure is to facilitate earlier and speedier access to convalescent nursing care between hospital and home.</P>
    <P>I trust the Deputy will understand why the board has had to take a range of measures to meet the current situation in the interests of the future development of the hospital. The board has assured the Minister that it recognises there is a need to provide for the ongoing monitoring of activity in St. Luke's hospital and the impact of these measures on bed management and utilisation in the hospital.</P>

      <P>The National Cancer Forum issued its report on symptomatic breast cancer services earlier this year and presented it to the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and to the various health boards which have statutory responsibility for the provision of services.</P>
      <P>The Minister has accepted the main recommendations of the report but has made no final decisions until the question of what he terms &ldquo;local refinements&rdquo; can be dealt with. He has already confirmed to me in the Dáil that he can overrule any section or recommendation of the report. The report recommends the phase out and closure of the breast cancer unit at Mayo general hospital, Castlebar.</P>
      <P>The Minister appointed an advisory group to deal with the issue of the local refinements referred to, and, in respect of Mayo general hospital, this group met in Galway with medical staff and Western Health Board personnel on 12 October 2000. The meeting was quite acrimonious and its concluding recommendation was to phase out and close the Mayo breast cancer unit when the specialist unit in University College Hospital, Galway, would be provided. It was also suggested at the meeting that it would be a sufficiently good service to bus women from Mayo to UCHG for examination and treatment.</P>
      <P>This news and the implications of the recommendation has been received with a deep sense of shock and a level of anger I have not witnessed in many years. Women from all over the county have contacted me by telephone, letter, and personally to express this anger. I have a letter from a woman who recently had a mastectomy who would not have been even examined, never mind had treatment, if she had had to travel to Galway and deal with waiting lists.</P>
      <P>I want to say loudly and clearly that this unit should not be allowed to close under any circumstances, for a number of reasons. The consultants in Mayo general hospital, backed by a superb team, have dealt with 52 cases so far this year. Women can have a referral, surgical attention, radiology, pathology and cytology, breast care nurse, medical oncology and radiotherapy in a short time with no waiting list. The medical team would welcome any audit of the quality of its treatment and attention which will stand up to any scrutiny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this recommendation were carried through, all breast cancer cases from the Western Health Board area would be referred to Galway. This would inevitably lead to long waiting lists as has happened with orthopaedic, orthodontic, cataract, and cardiac cases. Breast cancer is traumatic enough and of a deeply personal and stressful <Col N="1471" /> nature, without having to deal with long waiting lists.</P>
    <P>A Dublin solution will not work in a west of Ireland setting. Professor O'Higgins initially recommended only two units for Dublin but, after discussion with his colleagues, increased this to five. His recommendation for the west does not take account of capital investment to date, geography and distances involved in Mayo, or population projections. Does the Minister realise that a round trip to Galway from Geesala, Belmullet, Aughleam, Blacksod, Porturlin or Rossport is in excess of 220 miles?</P>
    <P>The status and reputation of Mayo general hospital &ndash; a new hospital &ndash; would be seriously diminished and reduced. I will not allow this to happen and I want this unit kept open. I want to hear the Minister say that it will be kept open. I want this unit to continue its valuable work, not in competition with UCHG but in co-operation with it.</P>
    <P>I express my appreciation to all the women's groups, the Mayo Cancer Society, the ICA, the IFA and the hundreds of men and women who have supported my call in this matter. The Taoiseach is due to visit the hospital on Friday next. He will be welcome but, as a politician, I warn him to take careful note of the extent and depth of feeling about the issue. The closure of this unit must not be allowed.</P>

        <b>:</b> I thank Deputy Kenny for sharing his time with me and Deputy Cooper-Flynn. Seldom has an issue galvanised public and political opinion as much as the possible proposed closure of the Mayo breast cancer unit. This is a matter of life and death and that is how people see it.</P>
      <P>It is deplorable that anybody could apply the economic slide rule to such an essential service. At a time when the incidence of breast cancer is rampant and on the increase, it is beyond me how anybody could parade the sacred cow of so-called rationalisation and centralisation to such an essential service. The decision to close the Mayo facility is not acceptable. It must not happen and it will not be tolerated. Apart from the medical necessity for the service, as Deputy Kenny stated, the political consequences are obvious. Mná Maigh Eo are on the march and they will not take no for an answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for allowing me an opportunity to contribute to this important debate. They have outlined the up to date position quite well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important for a number of reasons to state at this stage that no decision has yet been taken. We want to see a standard of excellence at Mayo General Hospital. As a member of the health board, I already know, because this has been confirmed by the chief executive officer on numerous occasions, that that standard of excellence applies at Mayo General Hospital. For that reason alone, <Col N="1472" /> there is no reason to close the cancer unit. There are a sufficient number of procedures taking place at Mayo General Hospital to ensure that the standard of excellence is maintained and, no doubt, that will be the case in the future.</P>
    <P>We want to achieve the best possible care for women. We all recognise that the purpose of this report was to improve those services to women all over the country. When one is living in the regions, particularly in a county like Mayo, while standards of excellence are paramount one cannot ignore geographical considerations. As Deputy Kenny outlined, the county is 120 miles in diameter. This, together with the fact that the requisite standard applies already in Mayo, makes me urge the Minister to make a quick decision to remove any element of uncertainty on the issue. I also recognise how motivated the women of Mayo and, indeed, of the Western Health Board region are to the retention of those services.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies Kenny, Jim Higgins and Cooper-Flynn for raising these issues.</P>
      <P>On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, I am glad to have the opportunity afforded to me this evening by Deputy Kenny to inform the House of the current position regarding the specialist breast cancer units in the Western Health Board area.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Kenny will be aware, the provision of medical services at Mayo General Hospital is a matter for the Western Health Board in the first instance. At the request of the Minister for Health and Children, the National Cancer Forum established a sub-group to examine the provision of services for women with symptomatic breast disease. The sub-group had the following terms of reference: to assess the impact on the existing diagnostic services for benign and malignant breast disease in the light of the National Breast Cancer Screening Programme, the increase in the target population, the increased awareness of the importance of breast screening and the current and evolving technologies in the area of breast screening. The sub-group asked to make recommendations to the Minister for Health and Children on the diagnostic services for symptomatic breast disease necessary to meet projected increased needs, the need to develop associated services in radiotherapy, medical oncology, counselling and other support services, the resources required to develop these services and the principles that should underlie the organisation and delivery of services for breast disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the work of the sub-group, the regional directors of cancer services were asked for information concerning their current service and their views were sought on how the service should be developed in their region. In addition, three members of the sub-group visited each region. The consensus view regarding best practice in the management of breast disease was presented to regional representatives and their <Col N="1473" /> views on how this could be achieved in their region were sought.</P>
    <P>The sub-group found that although services should be delivered as close to the patient's home as is feasible, the overriding priority should be to provide the best, safest and most effective treatment for women and, in doing so, provide the best opportunity for long-term survival to those who are found to have breast cancer.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children has received the report of the sub-group on the development of services for symptomatic breast disease. No final decisions regarding implementation arrangements at health board level have been taken. The Minister has established an advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor Niall O'Higgins to assist the health boards in formulating its plans for the development of services for symptomatic breast disease. This group has recently met with Western Health Board officials and clinicians. Further discussions will take place with the chief executive officer and the Western Health Board, following which a definitive plan will be formulated for the treatment of breast cancer in the health board area. This, in turn, will be forwarded to the Minister for final decision and funding approval.</P>
    <P>This is a serious and sensitive problem. We must put the patient first, hospitals second and politicians a poor third. We should not play political football with the issue. Unfortunately, this has been the case on the issue of breast cancer in many instances. It is not the way to go forward. I will do my best in the Department of Health and Children to make sure we retain the service in Castlebar.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Water Supply.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with my colleague, Deputy Penrose.</P>
      <P>The water supply to households and businesses in Moate, County Westmeath, is more akin to what is available in a Third World country than in modern Ireland where Ministers almost daily boast of the Exchequer being awash with money.</P>
      <P>Moate has a population of close to 2,000. It is a busy centre of commerce on the N6 and has a number of industrial enterprises employing many people. There are a number of schools, shops and offices, a magnificent arts centre, a hotel, a nursing home under construction, a golf club, a community centre and an array of other facilities.</P>
      <P>For a number of years the water supply in Moate has been at best erratic and at worst non-existent. For the past five weeks the supply has been closed down officially from midnight to 7 a.m., but the reality is that the supply could be cut off without prior warning at any time. Many households at the end of supply lines experience poor pressure even when the supply is operative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has caused difficulty for many householders. Domestic appliances have been damaged for lack of a water supply and low pressure. The water crisis is causing havoc in particular to publi <Col N="1474" /> cans and business users. There is also the constant worry that should there be a fire in Moate the fire hydrants would be inoperative and this would have predictable consequences.</P>
    <P>Housing and other developments in the Moate area have now been halted because of the non-availability of a water supply. The recent designation of special status for Moate under the village renewal scheme must now be in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>The water supply for Moate comes from a local source and the dry summer is blamed for the poor supply. An augmentation scheme was added to the supply in recent years but it had little impact on the existing supply. Westmeath County Council is carrying out what amount to temporary measures to try to alleviate the difficult but these are totally inadequate. The people of Moate, who have been very tolerant to date, have now reached the end of their tether. They want and are entitled to an adequate water supply and they want it immediately. The years of being fobbed off with excuses and promises of action must end.</P>
    <P>The proposed south Westmeath supply scheme will not bring a quality water supply to Moate for six or seven years. Can we expect the people of Moate to wait so long for a basic right? Will the Minister stand over such a long delay or will he provide the funds to have this problem rectified immediately. Money must be provided now by the Department of the Environment and Local Government to remedy the situation. There are remedies available. An additional temporary supply could be provided, either from the Mount Temple group water scheme or from the Mullingar regional water supply scheme which comes through Ballynacarrigy and Ballymore. A simple pipeline could be extended to Moate to improve the scheme there. Will the Minister bring to the attention of the Department of the Environment and Local Government the urgent need for these works.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy McGrath, for sharing his time. This is an extremely important matter concerning the water supply in Moate which is grossly inadequate. Deputy McGrath was, to say the least, very kind when he said it was spasmodic and erratic. As he said, there are up to 2,000 inhabitants in Moate and a rapidly expanding population. Huge developments are taking place in Moate in the area of domestic house building, although it has virtually stalled because of the unreliability of the water supply. Moate is an area which needs industry; it is well located on the N6 close to Athlone and Dublin. There is no doubt that the absence of an adequate water supply is an inhibiting factor in relation to the location of industrial development in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the domestic, agricultural and industrial view point, the inadequate water supply is a major impediment to moving forward. Apart from that, an adequate water supply is indispensable to public health and for ordinary things, such as looking after young children. As Deputy <Col N="1475" /> McGrath rightly pointed out, the inadequate water supply has had a major negative impact on domestic household appliances and so on. It is a huge inconvenience to the population.</P>
    <P>Moate is a rapidly expanding area with hotels and expensive recreational facilities, including a large golf club. The time has come when people are no longer prepared to tolerate this. It is an issue of public health at this stage and it is vital for the preservation and protection of public health. As Deputy McGrath outlined, the possibility of a fire risk given the inadequate water supply and a rapidly expanded population cannot be under estimated.</P>
    <P>At a time when we have unprecedented resources available, it is time we brought forward and expedited those schemes. Deputy McGrath proposed a couple of emergency measures and he is right that the Moate-Ballymore and the Mullingar regional water supply scheme could be extended along that road. Many rural dwellers along that road, including Deputy McGrath's relations, would be absolutely delighted to see it coming that way. That is a sensible solution. There was talk about bringing water from the Shannon but that is six or seven years away. I urge the Minister to take note of the deeply expressed concerns of the people of Moate and to bring forward the resources to enable this scheme to be approved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Dempsey cannot be in the House this evening to respond to this matter and he has asked me to do so on his behalf. I extend his apologies to the Members.</P>
      <P>Before I address the specific issues raised by the Deputy in relation to the water supply to Moate, I would like to put the proposed development in the context of the water and sewerage services investment programme, the first phase of which the Minister for the Environment and Local Government launched in July of this year.</P>
      <P>As we are all well aware, Ireland has experienced remarkable social and economic growth over the past few years and this has been reflected in a corresponding expansion and broadening of the water and sewerage services investment programme. Overall, between 1994 and the end of 1999, we invested more than £960 million of capital funding in providing water and sewerage facilities to meet burgeoning social and economic demand, very considerably more than what was envisaged at the start of the last national development plan. The final year of that plan, 1999, saw record investment of £283 million in water services, an increase of 50% on 1998 expenditure and more than double the 1996 figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Total planned investment in water and sewerage services over the period of the new national development plan is almost £3 billion, with more than £2.4 billion for major public schemes. The <Col N="1476" /> new investment programme will continue the focus of previous programmes on water and waste water services investment required to support economic and social development, employment generation, maintenance of high growth rates and the achievement of high environmental standards. Funding is being provided for new projects in every single county, ensuring that all areas of the country will benefit.</P>
    <P>The new plan envisages an almost threefold increase in capital spending on water services in the seven years up to 2006 by comparison to the 1994-99 period. This will present challenges to all the major players such as contractors, engineering services and local authorities in ensuring that the increased number of projects envisaged under the plan are delivered. For this reason, a three year programme has been announced rather than the traditional annual one to reduce the uncertainties caused by the previous single year approach. It will provide the critical participants with an opportunity for longer-term resource planning to optimise delivery of the programme. It will be a rolling three year programme which will run right up to 2006. In future years, the programme will be rolled forward by one year at a time. There will be sufficient flexibility to allow for new schemes to be introduced as other imperatives emerge such as social or economic issues requiring the fast-tracking of individual projects needed for particular purposes.</P>
    <P>Schemes going into the programme are mainly drawn from local authority assessments of needs completed by them during 1999. The main purpose of the assessments was to develop an overall strategic investment plan for each county for the medium to long-term and to set out a programme of works to meet the identified needs.</P>
    <P>Westmeath County Council included the South Westmeath Regional Water Supply Scheme as part of its assessment of needs submission. The council proposes that this scheme be done in three stages. The first stage will address the requirement to provide a new intake at Coosan Lough incorporating a treatment plant for five million gallons of water per day and to include a rising main to Annagh Reservoir. The project will provide for improving the existing water supply to the Athlone urban area and its environs, including upgrading and replacing existing mains and examining options in respect of the future role of the existing Athlone town water treatment plant. Stage two, which must await the completion of stage one, will address the extension of the supply from Athlone to serve Moate and environs, including provision of a new reservoir at Knockdomney. Stage three will deal with the extension of public water mains to service the Tang-Glasson area.</P>
    <P>At the moment, Westmeath County Council is preparing a revised preliminary report for stage one, which it expects to submit to the Department of the Environment and Local Government within 12 months. Stage one has been included in the first phase of the water and sewerage services <Col N="1477" /> investment programme, covering 2000-2003, as a scheme to enter planning.</P>
    <P>The Department has been made aware by Westmeath County Council of the problems encountered recently with the water supply to Moate. This was due in part to inadequate yield from the Ballinderry Reservoir source, brought about by a protracted dry period, and was compounded by mechanical failure that resulted in some customers in the town being without water for in excess of 24 hours.</P>
    <P>It is clear that a permanent solution to the problems encountered by the residents of Moate is still some way off. However, interim solutions are being examined by the council which may provide alternative means of augmenting the supply. The council has written to the Department seeking a further allocation under the small schemes programme. While all allocations under this scheme for 2000 have been drawn down, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, has asked his Department to consider the request further in the light of any savings that might arise before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House this evening for the debate. This week the success of the Garda in recovering two major consignments of illegal fireworks with a street value of approximately £1.5 million is certainly commendable. Despite this success anyone who lives in, or even visits, a built up area will be only too well aware of the prevalence of fireworks. In many communities, particularly in the city, anyone would be forgiven for not having noticed that there had been a major confiscation of fireworks by the Garda. It seems that there are more fireworks in the hands of young people this year than ever before.</P>
      <P>Since the end of September, fireworks have been blasting in flat complexes and housing estates. Older people are absolutely terrified and since the use of fireworks began this autumn, I am aware of many people who simply will not leave their houses after 4 o'clock or 5 o'clock in the afternoon. I received a number of letters and telephone calls asking what can be done and from people saying they are terrified and feel threatened even in their own houses. Some people have gone as far as sealing up their letterboxes because fireworks have been dropped through them. They are living in fear and terror. Apart from the discomfort caused by fireworks to older people, animals are also particularly affected. Dogs and cats run scared every time one of these bangers or fireworks explodes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issues around fireworks are wider than the sole problem of causing nervousness and discomfort to either people or animals. To the user, fireworks are incredibly dangerous. From my experience, it seems that fireworks are mainly entering the hands of young children who pose great risks to themselves every time they light <Col N="1478" /> fireworks. Despite the best efforts of the Garda, fireworks are getting into the hands of children. A five minutes walk through any housing estate in Dublin South Central will vindicate this for anyone who may cast a doubt over my claim. Clearly, there is an issue to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Fireworks are illegal and yet they get into the hands of very young children who will use them in unsupervised circumstances posing huge risks to themselves and to those around them. Every year there is a number of horrific injuries, particularly to younger children, with hand and eye injuries being reported. Yet people persist in allowing children to use these fireworks very dangerously.</P>
    <P>Another extremely disconcerting issue around the type of fireworks that end up on our streets is their country of origin. It appears that the majority of fireworks which end up on Irish streets come from China and other low wage economies in the Far East. These fireworks are of an extremely low grade. They are more dangerous than those produced within the EU and, most distressingly, they are produced, in the main, by children. Within those child sweat shops accidents occur on a daily basis that leave children as young as seven or eight maimed for life. We cannot stand over a practice whereby these fireworks, whether held legally or illegally, end up on our streets. I did not raise this matter to put a damper on the Hallowe'en celebrations, but we cannot allow more and more dangerous fireworks to fall into the hands of young people.</P>
    <P>The Government, to some extent, introduced a new fireworks culture to Irish society. The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Brennan, and the State owned airline treated us to two magnificent fireworks displays during the past 12 months to celebrate the millennium. While they were magnificent, to an extent they inculcated a culture of fireworks.</P>
    <P>Washing our hands of the problem is not the answer, we must examine what we can do to ensure that if fireworks enter the State they are as safe as fireworks can be, that they do not get into the hands of young people and that they are not used to frighten people in unsupervised environments.</P>
    <P>The Explosives Act, 1875, which governs the use of fireworks is outdated. It did not envisage the popularity of fireworks, the level of trafficking in these products and the increasing dangers they pose to the user. Over the millennium celebrations, I was aware of many people who went to the North and purchased fireworks of French and UK origin on a legal basis. These were used in public parks and gardens throughout the country on a supervised basis to ring in the new year. No harm was done to anyone and everybody enjoyed themselves.</P>
    <P>The veritable war zones in communities throughout this city bear no resemblance to new year's eve. It is critical that we move to change the law to strike a new balance regarding the use of fireworks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to set out the position in this regard. Under the Explosives Act, 1875, fireworks may be imported here only in accordance with an importation licence issued by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is a long-standing policy that such licences are issued only for organised displays conducted by competent and professional operators. The use of fireworks under such controlled conditions minimises the risk of injury and mishap and enables the spectacle of large fireworks displays to be enjoyed in safety.</P>
      <P>Supplies of fireworks, however, continue to be imported into the State in contravention of the law, especially leading up to and around the Hallowe'en period, and they find their way into the hands of young people. As the Deputy pointed out, much of what comes in is of dubious quality. Unscrupulous individuals seek to flood the market with as many of these fireworks as they can sell to make a quick profit with no regard for the safety of young people using them.</P>
      <P>At this time every year, a concerted effort is made by the Garda Síochána to control the illegal possession, sale and use of fireworks. Special measures are taken in addition to the normal routine policing measures. These include attention to known trouble areas to deal with the problem, liaison with other services and arrangements for media publicity aimed at parents and teachers regarding the dangers of handling fireworks. In addition, all Garda divisions throughout the country are advised to pay particular attention to this problem and community police officers visit schools to educate teachers and pupils on the danger of fireworks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A close watch is kept by the Garda Síochána on the illegal trade and gardaí do not hesitate to act where necessary. As a result the gardaí have made significant seizures in recent years. Through their vigilance, substantial amounts of fireworks <Col N="1480" /> are seized each year and subsequently destroyed. This year the gardaí are increasing their efforts and I take this opportunity to congratulate the commissioner and members of the force on their recent successful operations, which included the confiscation of illegally imported fireworks with an estimated street value in excess of £1.5 million, to which the Deputy referred.</P>
    <P>The current restrictive licensing policy allied to the seizures of illegal fireworks have gone a long way towards protecting the public from the inherent dangers of fireworks, while ensuring that people are not deprived of the enjoyment of the spectacle of fireworks operated by knowledgeable persons in a controlled environment.</P>
    <P>I am aware that a case can be and is made in favour of relaxing the law to permit the importation of fireworks for individual use to enable the quality and use of fireworks to be regulated and controlled. It seems the potential advantages of any such change would have to be very carefully assessed and weighted against any disadvantages arising from the increase in the use of fireworks to which the change would undoubtedly give rise. My Department is currently carrying out a review of the legislation relating to explosives and these issues will be addressed in the review.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on us all to take a share of responsibility in this matter. Vigilance cannot be left to the gardaí alone. Parents, in particular, should ensure their children are aware of the dangers posed by fireworks.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge Deputy Upton's tribute to the fireworks display carried out under the direction of the Chief Whip, Deputy Brennan, and I am sure she would like it to be pointed out that these spectacles were operated by knowledgeable persons in a controlled environment. The only disappointment I had in that respect was that the Deputy did not refer to my contribution in this House to controlled fireworks displays.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 26 October 2000.</P>

      <P>The Government is concerned about the impact inflation could have on our economic performance, and the Minister for Finance has indicated that tackling inflation is a key priority for the forthcoming budget. While the agricultural sector is affected by inflation along with the rest of the community, the impact on agricultural income is no greater than for many other sectors.</P>
      <P>In relation to farm incomes, livestock prices in 2000 are running at levels significantly higher than those obtained last year. In addition, it appears that the crop sector is also likely to fare well, while producers in the dairy sector should also see their incomes increase. The increases in direct payments to farmers, agreed under Agenda 2000, will also impact positively on farm incomes this year, with payments rising to approximately £1 billion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The price of certain inputs, such as diesel fuel, has risen, but the increase in output value, <Col N="1482" /> together with increased direct payments, should more than offset any increase in input costs. As a result, I expect a significant improvement in the average income of farmers this year.</P>

      <P>From the outset, the proposals which the Minister for Finance and I had for the future organisation and funding of Irish racing and in particular the establishment of a new single governing structure for the administration of the industry were well received and supported by almost all the organisations involved in the industry. Following a period of extensive consultations and negotiations in the first half of this year we announced our detailed proposals on 27 July 2000. While they were generally welcomed, the Turf Club and the AIR executive expressed some reservations.</P>
      <P>At a meeting with the Association of Irish Racecourses, AIR, on 13 September agreement was reached with that body on the broad thrust of the issues of concern to them. Officials of my Department met the Turf Club on 25 September and again on 11 October. The Minister for Finance and I met with senior stewards of the turf club on 19 October and after lengthy, intensive and constructive discussions, a basis for the resolution of the outstanding issues of concern to the turf club was agreed. It is considered that the conditions now exist for the establishment of the proposed new horseracing body and I will be making arrangements to have the necessary work commenced to facilitate the introduction of the required legislation as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Each of the four currently approved border inspection posts retains a register of consignments of products imported directly from third countries. In the register an entry is made identifying those consignments which have been rejected. A separate record is then retained for each rejected consignment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1483" /> Imported agricultural products are sampled and analysed on a regular basis to ensure that they do not constitute a danger to public health. Third countries' imports are subject to a documentary, identity and physical check whilst goods coming from other member states are subject to random checks. Goods which are not in compliance with the veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination and, if necessary, destroyed.</P>
    <P>Products imported directly from third countries and from other member states are monitored on a regular basis. The controls in this area operated by my Department are based on EU harmonised rules governing the veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable to intra community and third country trade in live animals and animal products. These rules require a range of checks to be carried out and provide for the imposition of restrictions on, or the banning of, trade in particular animal products when this is considered necessary for the protection of public health. Last year's dioxin scare is a case in point, where trade in a wide range of animal products from Belgium was banned.</P>
    <P>The standing veterinary committee of the European Commission, in which experts from my Department participate, constantly monitors events in member states and third countries which are likely to have implications for public health. At present EU harmonised rules require advance notification to my Department of animal product imports; that the goods must be accompanied by a veterinary certificate or, in certain cases, a commercial document; that the goods must come from an approved establishment, for example, a slaughterhouse, cutting plant or cold store which has been approved by the EU Commission; and that the goods may be subject to inspection by officials of my Department.</P>
    <P>The framework of veterinary checks provided for by harmonised EU rules, the implementation of those rules by my Department and the veterinary services of other member states, together with the constant programme of monitoring and review of public health risks provided for under the aegis of the standing veterinary committee, are intended to provide assurance that imported animal products are fit for human consumption, while allowing member states to fulfil their trade obligations as members of the European Union and the World Trade Organisation.</P>

      <P>The total number of herds that were restricted for TB from 1997 to the end of 1999 was 28,854 while there was 2,779 herds restricted for brucellosis for the same period. The number of herds depopulated as a result of brucellosis for the years 1997, 1998 and 1999 were 254, 328 and 317, respectively. The numbers of TB infected herds that were depopulated during this period are not readily available but the numbers involved are considerably less than those for brucellosis.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to TB reactors is that in the years 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively, 28,647, 44,498 and 44,903 were disclosed. In respect of brucellosis the position for the same years is that 5,880 , 6,417 and 4,545 reactors were disclosed. A monthly breakdown, as requested by the Deputy, is not available.</P>
      <P>Total expenditure on the TB and brucellosis eradication programmes to the end of 1999 was £895 million while total receipts amounted to £413 million leaving a net cost to the Exchequer of some £482 million.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the TB and brucellosis eradication programmes in 1997, 1998 and 1999 was £38.8 million £49.9 million and £64.3 million respectively. Total receipts in each of these years amounted to £19.1 million £11.8 million and £12.2 million respectively. A breakdown of these figures between TB and brucellosis is not available due to the fact the majority of brucellosis tests occur simultaneously with the TB test, while similarly levy receipts cannot be apportioned between the TB and brucellosis schemes.</P>

      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, provides for the introduction of an on-farm market valuation system and that the arrangements, including the detailed operational arrangements, are to be finalised with the farming organisations with the benefit of independent expertise. The proposed operational date was 1 September 2000. Numerous meetings have since taken place between senior officials of <Col N="1485" /> my Department and the farming bodies on the detailed arrangements for the introduction of the new system.</P>
      <P>However, given the complexity and broad range of the issues involved, it has not been possible to conclude these negotiations to date. The most recent meeting took place on 10 October and a further meeting which will be chaired by the Secretary General of my Department is due shortly.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the full package of measures, which will have the objective of reducing current levels of and ultimately eradicating brucellosis and TB from the national herd, will be finalised at a meeting of the animal health forum in the near future. In addition to the on-farm valuation scheme, there are other issues under discussion such as movement controls, the deployment of increased staff on badger removal work together with additional research on these diseases. I am hopeful that agreement from all the parties concerned will be forthcoming at that stage and that progress can be made to enable the new regime to be introduced in the near future.</P>

      <P>Among the objectives of the commission in tabling the proposals to which the Deputy refers is to ensure that food producers will bear full responsibility for the safety of the food they produce. This is made possible by the development of hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) principles and is in line with internationally accepted procedures. For the purposes of these proposed regulations, farmers are considered to be primary producers. While the regulations will require food producers to implement HACCP type procedures, it is proposed that primary production will be carried out in accordance with good practice and managed in such a way that hazards are monitored and, where necessary, eliminated or reduced to an acceptable level.</P>
      <P>The commission's proposals, which are extremely comprehensive and wide ranging and which involve recasting some 17 directives into five regulations, are currently being considered at working group level and have yet to be adopted by council. A similar process has yet to take place in the European Parliament. One regulation has had a first reading in the council working group. It is likely that it will be some time before the proposals are adopted.</P>
      <P>My Department will ensure that farmers are alerted to the requirements of these proposals in good time.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the lack of success of the REP scheme in halting the decline and quality of rural life and in particular with regard to the destruction of habitats and the extinction and depletion of many forms of wildlife such as has been authenticated by Birdlife Ireland; and if he will give the scheme a new impetus to arrest the perceived decline.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The REP scheme, which currently has 45,171 farmers actively participating, involves a range of measures which support sustainable agriculture by providing for nutrient management planning; protection and maintenance of watercourses; limits on use of fertilisers, pesticides and herbicides; protection of habitat, wildlife and landscape; and protection of features of historical and archaeological interest.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive evaluation of the REP scheme was carried out in 1999. The evaluation looked at the agriculture, socio-economic and environment aspects of the scheme and it drew on material from my Department, Teagasc and organisations including the Heritage Council, Birdwatch Ireland and the farm bodies. Independent studies were commissioned on particular measures of the REP scheme under the auspices of Teagasc and the universities. Independent consultants were engaged to consider the various inputs to the evaluation process and finalise the report.</P>
      <P>The evaluation report acknowledged that the REP scheme has increased awareness of environmentally sensitive practices in the farming community and has safeguarded important wildlife habitats.</P>
      <P>The report finds that one of the scheme's measures protects the grassland ecology of the farm by reducing over-grazing and soil erosion while also preserving a diversity of flora as well as species such as lapwing and swallow which are dependent on extensive farm practices.</P>
      <P>The report further acknowledges that other measures of the scheme deal specifically with habitats. The objective of one of these measures is to protect habitats from damage and recognises that Ireland is rich in hedgerows, wetlands and unfertilised meadows. These areas provide habitat for many common species of flora and fauna and also for species such as yellowhammer, bullfinch, skylark and reed bunting which were formerly abundant in farmland areas, but whose numbers have declined dramatically in much of western Europe.</P>
      <P>The character of the Irish landscape owes much to hedgerows and stone walls and another measure promotes the maintenance of these features. This measure has successfully stopped the practice of poorly timed trimming and herbicide application previously conducted by tillage farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The evaluation report was submitted to the European Commission in July 1999. The commission has acknowledged that the evaluation has shown that the REP scheme corresponds to the purposes of the EU regulations and demonstrates <Col N="1489" /> that it enables the objectives of the regulations to be achieved.</P>
    <P>The evaluation provided practical recommendations for future modifications and improvements to the REP scheme. The new REP scheme will include a higher payment to encourage smaller farmers to participate and also allow more intensive farmers to farm that part of their lands in target areas to the REPS specification. The importance of training for farmers and planners will be given increased emphasis and attendance at REPS training courses will be mandatory for all beneficiaries under the scheme. The requirements of REPS will also be communicated through public information meetings in the coming months.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the important contribution which REPS makes to an improved environment will grow under the new scheme. The targeting, training and publicity arrangements which are being put in place will give a further impetus to REPS and increase the already significant participation levels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Good Friday Agreement, agriculture was identified as one of the areas for co-operation between North and South.</P>
      <P>At the first plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in Armagh in December 1999, the areas identified for co-operation in agriculture were agreed, namely, discussion of CAP issues, animal and plant health policy and research and rural development.</P>
      <P>I hosted the first meeting of the Agriculture North-South Ministerial Council in Dublin on 26 June last which was attended by my Northern Ireland counterpart, Ms Brid Rodgers, Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, and by Mr. Dermot Nesbitt, a junior Minister in the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister.</P>
      <P>We reviewed the high level of existing co-operation between our two Departments and discussed the matters for enhanced co-operation in agriculture to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both sides underlined the important contribution already being made to the development of agriculture by the Departments and agencies involved and we looked forward to further significant progress arising from our co-operation in the Ministerial Council. Specifically we agreed that our respective officials would prepare a detailed <Col N="1490" /> programme for joint action for consideration at our next meeting.</P>
    <P>With that in mind, both sides agreed that they would identify those areas in animal and plant health research with greatest potential for enhanced co-operation and would produce a timetable for further work.</P>
    <P>The council attached importance to developing a common response and approach to a number of issues crucial to the farming community. In this regard, it specifically considered changes regarding payments to farmers in less favoured areas under the new European rural development regulations and the issue of low incidence BSE status for Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The council also noted with satisfaction the recent improvement in prices for the pig meat sector and that current forecasts for the future were positive. Both sides looked forward to examining the joint study on the pig industry then in progress.</P>
    <P>Finally, we agreed to reconstitute a steering committee on cross-border rural development.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of this committee, which comprises senior officials from both Departments, are to promote maximum co-operation in the implementation of rural development programmes and on EU programmes, to exchange information on experience and best practice in both jurisdictions in relation to rural development and to continue to develop common approaches to cross-Border area based strategies and rural development research. The steering committee was asked to bring forward to the next Ministerial Council a detailed work programme in regard to its remit.</P>
    <P>The second meeting of the Agriculture North-South Ministerial Council will be held next month. I confidently expect that, in light of the good progress made in the meantime, we will be able to commence detailed work programmes of joint co-operation in a number of the areas I have outlined.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the four cases identified in meat factories whereby spinal cord remained in beef carcasses which was ready to go to butcher shops; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[23422/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of its extensive BSE related control system, my Department has in place stringent regulations to exclude specified risk material or SRM from human food and animal feed chains. SRM includes the spinal cord of cattle over 12 months. SRM is isolated on slaughter of the animals, permanently stained and removed directly to a specially dedicated rendering plant, where it is rendered for ultimate destruction by incineration.</P>
      <P>The incidents to which the Deputy refers arose from the discovery of small amounts of spinal cord in 11 quarters from five consignments of carcasses exported to destinations in Northern Ireland between February and September of this year. Given the absolute necessity to guarantee public safety and maintain consumer confidence in Irish beef coupled with the importance of the beef export industry to the Irish economy, any non-compliance with SRM requirements, however slight, is taken extremely seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the five incidents in question, my Department enforced a suspension of slaugh<Col N="1492" /> tering at each of the plants until a full review of the plant's SRM policy was carried out and measures acceptable to my Department put in place to avoid a recurrence.</P>
    <P>While this matter has been taken very seriously, it should be put into context. The level of controls which apply prior to slaughter minimise the risk of a BSE animal being sent for slaughter. In the context of the overall volume of beef exports to Northern Ireland which for 1999 amounted to 13,538 tonnes, 11 quarters containing sections of spinal cord, measuring from 1.5 inches in one to 24 inches in another, were discovered out of approximately 1,000 quarters for the five consignments concerned. No recurrences have occurred at any of the four plants in question. Given a cattle kill of approximately two million animals per year, involving the removal of some ten million feet of spinal cord, the fact that no spinal cord was detected in any other consignments would suggest that these incidents were isolated and sporadic. If the carcasses containing spinal cord had gone to a deboning hall in this country, the cord would have been identified and removed in the course of the second level check, as occurred in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>Higher numbers of bovine TB reactors were disclosed here in 1998 and 1999 than in preceding years. Simultaneously there has been increased levels of the disease in parts of Britain and in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Veterinary opinion both here and in the UK is that TB infected badgers are a major constraint to bovine TB eradication. For this reason I have arranged for the effects of badger removal on TB levels in cattle to be studied in detail. The east Offaly badger removal project has been in place for some time and further research commenced in four area experimental projects in parts of Cork north, Donegal, Kilkenny and Monaghan in 1997. I have also arranged for a number of new initiatives in areas where disease levels are particularly high. In particular, herds in these areas are being subjected to a more intensive testing regime additional to the annual round test of each and every herd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the number of reactors disclosed to date in the year 2000 is over 3,000 below that for the comparable period in 1999 the current high level of TB is not sustainable. Therefore in the context of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, it has been agreed to commit specified staff resources in each district veterinary office to carry out investigative work into the causes of herd breakdown. A proactive approach to the removal of all sources of infection will be taken in each DVO area using additional and farm relief <Col N="1493" /> service personnel. Their efforts will be concentrated in that 20% of the country which yields 50% of current reactors. The objective of this programme is to reduce the incidence of TB by 50% over the next four years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 115 and 151 together.</P>
      <P>Standards for organic crop produce had been fixed since 1991 by EU Regulation 2092/91. This regulation was supplemented by Regulation No. 1804/99 on 24 August, which set standards for organic livestock produce and my Department had proposed to adopt standards for such produce in accordance with the regulation.</P>
      <P>Following further discussions on this issue with interested parties including the three private organic bodies and other stakeholders in the organic sector, my Department has moved significantly to address a number of points of concern in relation to the origin of animals and the minimum conversion period. Other issues may be considered subsequently by the organic development committee.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the standards now being set for the organic sector will provide every reassurance to retailers and consumers as to the quality and integrity of Irish organic produce, without compromising the competitiveness of Irish organic producers. My objective is to ensure the continuing growth of the organic sector as part of mainstream farming in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agrifood 2010 report included a recommendation that a credible regulatory system be put in place for the organic sector and that the existing confusion between competing inspection bodies be ended. In response, I undertook to streamline the inspection arrangements. My objective is to ensure that all organic farmers and processors have ready access to the most efficient, transparent and consistent arrangements for inspection and certification. My Department has recently put proposals to the three private bodies, the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association, Organic Trust and Demeter Standards <Col N="1494" /> Limited, for a unified inspection and certification system which will achieve this objective while allowing the three bodies to continue to operate their own private arrangements, where their own members are concerned, as heretofore. I understand that the three bodies are currently considering these proposals and I am hopeful for a positive response.</P>

      <P>The £1 million assistance referred to was provided to facilitate the operation of a ferry service to carry livestock to the Continent in the winter of 1997. During this period there was no alternative means of getting Irish livestock exports to continental European markets as no commercial ferry operator was available to carry cattle. Failure to act by providing the means by which an outlet to vital markets for Irish livestock producers would be maintained would have resulted in a serious adverse economic impact on producers and farm incomes across Ireland.</P>
      <P>While the Commission decision has held that the aid was incompatible with the common market, the Commission, in taking the view that the beneficiaries were the Irish livestock producers and recognising that there are special circumstances in this instance, has invited the Irish Government to detail its arguments and submit its evidence on the alleged impossibility of recovering the aid granted. In light of the decision my Department has fully set out its arguments in a submission to the Commission and awaits the Commission's response.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to BSE as my Department has no responsibility for CJD.</P>
      <P>BSE became a compulsory notifiable disease in 1989 and veterinary surgeons and herdowners are obliged to report animals suspected of having BSE to their local district veterinary office. Upon notification, a Department official from the local district veterinary office will visit the premises where the suspect is held, movement restrictions are placed on the herd and arrangements are made for the suspect animal to be euthanased after a compensatory figure is agreed. The sample is then sent to the veterinary research laboratory for testing.</P>
      <P>If the sample proves negative, the movement restrictions are lifted and the agreed compensatory amount will issue. Should the sample prove positive, arrangements are made for the herd to be depopulated, subsequent to valuation being agreed between the herdowner and my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ministerial Council of the World Trade Organisation, the successor to the GATT, failed to reach agreement on a negotiating framework for the launch of a comprehensive round of multilateral trade negotiations at its meeting in Seattle in December 1999. In accordance with Article 20 of the Agreement on Agriculture, which was concluded as <Col N="1496" /> part of the last round of multilateral trade negotiations under the GATT, further negotiations on agriculture were due to commence by end 1999, irrespective of whether a new comprehensive round of negotiations would be launched by then. Accordingly, negotiations on agriculture started in March 2000 under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation. The first phase of the negotiations is a preparatory one, during which WTO members are requested to submit negotiating proposals in preparation for the commencement of substantive negotiations in 2001.</P>
      <P>The European Union participates in the WTO negotiations as a single entity with the EU Commission conducting the negotiations in accordance with a mandate adopted by the Council of Ministers. The EU negotiating mandate for agriculture was adopted by the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers on 27 September 1999 and endorsed subsequently by the General Affairs Council. The mandate primarily is based on the Agenda 2000 agreement decided by the European Council in Berlin in March 1999. The Council of Ministers is currently considering a paper prepared by the commission which will set out the EU's negotiating proposal. It is my intention to ensure that the interests of the Irish agriculture and food industries are fully protected in the council's preparations for the WTO negotiations and in the negotiations themselves.</P>
      <P>Because of changes in the trading environment which may result from the WTO negotiations and from enlargement of the EU as well as factors such as changing consumer tastes, new food distribution channels and general technological developments, I established a group to make recommendations on the development of the Irish agriculture and food industries over the present decade. That group's report entitled Agri Food 2010 was completed earlier this year and I have approved and published a plan of action for the implementation of its recommendations. As a result, I expect that the agriculture and food industries will be well prepared to maximise their contribution to Irish wealth and employment and the development of rural areas over the next ten years.</P>

      <P>The overall level of penalties under the special beef premium scheme is relatively small representing less than 2% in recent years of all applications received which amounted to 187,000 in 1999. Penalties can range from relatively minor reduction penalties which account for some 95% of all penalties under the <Col N="1497" /> scheme to more serious situations which result in one year or two year exclusions from the scheme.</P>
      <P>At the Agriculture Council in Luxembourg earlier this week, I welcomed the positive reaction from the commission to the lobbying from Ireland to reduce the bureaucratic burden of the CAP direct payment rules. The commission announced its intention to review the imposition of penalties for minor errors in premium applications; simplify applications for small farmers; allow more flexibility in determining set aside and develop a monitoring system to minimise the requirements for farm inspections.</P>
      <P>I believe that the approach signalled by the commission on penalties, together with last week's Government decision on the new appeals office, represent major steps in meeting the concerns of farmers regarding proportionality of penalties under the various schemes.</P>

      <P>Cattle breed improvement activities in Ireland were, until recent years, fragmented between a number of organisations including my Department, AI organisations, milk recording and breed societies. A new central co-operative organisation called the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF) incorporating all of these interest groups was set up on an interim basis in 1997 with the support of funding and other forms of assistance from my Department. A permanent structure for the organisation and operation of the co-operative was established in July this year.</P>
      <P>The main objective of ICBF is to improve the genetic merit of the national herd, particularly by improving genetic evaluation and providing information on breeding quality. ICBF is in the process of clearly defining breeding objectives for beef cattle in the context of changing market requirements and farming systems. ICBF is pursuing a pro-active strategy for achieving these objectives through the operation of a comprehensive national, recording, testing and genetic evaluation programme using sophisticated IT systems.</P>
      <P>Teagasc has intensified its efforts this year to promote the development of quality breeding by producers. For example, Teagasc undertook a series of road shows earlier in the year in order to give producers guidance on the ideal heifer replacement essential for the production of quality beef. This was also central to its exhibition at the National Ploughing Championships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that in addition to genetic improvement the quality of Irish beef cattle can be <Col N="1498" /> upgraded through better feeding, husbandry and general farm management practices. These can all be encouraged through an effective graded pricing system at meat factory level. Some progress is being made in this regard but I would like to see more effective differentials introduced.</P>

      <P>The report on anti-competitive practices in the beef industry was commissioned by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, last January and was submitted to her last month. The main findings of the report were that there is no evidence of anti-competitive behaviour either in the pattern of cattle prices or in profits achieved by the beef processing industry and that, on the contrary, there is evidence from the various sources that, on average, the industry is one of low profitability; and taking account of the weight losses involved in converting the live animal into saleable beef and cost developments in the post farm-gate sectors of the food chain, the changes in retail prices are fully explained by <Col N="1499" /> the combined movement in farm-gate prices and post farm-gate costs. I have no reason to question these findings which were made by a group of independent and respected consultants.</P>
      <P>The consultants also made a number of recommendations relating to introduction of an annual census of the economic performance of the food and drinks industry, the modernisation of the meat inspection system, an examination by the Competition Authority into the legal status of the type of collective negotiations conducted by farmers, the time of the blockade and the promotion of integrated action by producers, processors and retailers to secure the development of the beef industry. These recommendations are currently being examined by my Department, the Central Statistics Office and the Competition Authority.</P>

      <P>To protect and develop our vital lamb trade it is essential that Ireland now puts in place a workable, credible and reliable system of sheep identification. Factors influencing this requirement include: the recommendation of the sheepmeat forum, which recognised &ldquo;the need for a sheep traceability system&rdquo;; market developments; most notably the introduction in Britain with effect from 1 January 2001 of a tag based identification system; the increasingly important need for identification and traceability for disease control purposes; the universally recognised unsatisfactory nature of our current system; and the general approach at EU level to traceability and identification.</P>
      <P>In designing the system to be put in place my Department has placed the emphasis on simplicity and on minimising both bureaucracy and cost. It is proposed that identification would be by means of tagging and will be based on flock numbers, although farmers will have the option of individually tagging for flock management purposes. All sheep would have to be tagged within six months of birth or on movement off farm, whichever is the sooner.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Qst>
    <P>(Mr. Walsh): As the Deputy will be aware, my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, has recently announced her intention to retain the 1987 groceries order in its entirety. I am very pleased with this approach as I believe that any diminution of its scope would in the longer term have an adverse impact on consumers generally and on rural communities in particular.</P>
    <P>The measures provided for under the order are, in the main, aimed at preventing abuse of a dominant position and it is accepted that a dominant position must prevail before any action can be taken. Therefore since the groceries order acts as a deterrent, it is not possible to quantify its current impact on the agricultural sector. There is no evidence to suggest that the groceries order has had any detrimental effects on competition or prices.</P>

The Commission has refused to exclude sheep from the calculation of stocking density for the extensification premium because they claim that to do so would introduce a new inequity between beef producers who also raise sheep and beef producers who rear cattle only. They are also opposed to the introduction of an extensification premium for sheep because of the cost and in their view the rural world premium takes the place of the extensification premium in the sheep sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed changes for the organic sector in Ireland relate principally to standards for organic food, the introduction of a single national logo and the streamlining of the current inspection arrangements.</P>
      <P>Standards for organic crop produce had been fixed since 1991 by EU regulation 2092/91, and on 24 August 2000 this regulation was supplemented by Regulation 1804/99 which set standards for organic livestock produce. Previously there had been no national standards for organic livestock produce. Under Regulation 2092/91 my Department, which is the competent authority under the regulation, had approved three private bodies to inspect and certify organic crop produce. These bodies, in a private capacity, had also been certifying organic livestock produce to standards that they themselves had set.</P>
      <P>When the EU regulations were extended to the livestock sector on 24 August, my Department had proposed to adopt standards for such produce in accordance with the regulations. My information is that a number of other member states will certify produce as organic which meets those standards, and my Department had to bear in mind the fact that such produce could not legally be excluded from the Irish market.</P>
      <P>However the standards in the regulation did not include all the requirements recommended by the three private bodies, the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association, Organic Trust and Demeter Standards limited. Following further discussions on this issue with interested parties including the three private organic bodies and other stakeholders in the organic sector, my Department has moved significantly to address a number of points of concern and other issues may be considered subsequently by the Organic Development Committee which I am establishing in accordance with the recommendation of the Agri-Food 2010 Committee. I am confident that the standards now being set for the organic sector will provide every reassurance to retailers and consumers as to the quality and integrity of Irish organic produce, without compromising the competitiveness of Irish organic producers. My objective is to ensure the continuing growth of the organic sector as part of mainstream farming in Ireland.</P>
      <P>My Department will also implement the recommendation in the recent Bord Bia report <i>Prospects for Organic Food in Ireland</i> that there should be one clear national logo for organic food that can be used to market Irish organic food to both domestic and overseas consumers. I am confident that this measure will bring significant benefits to all Irish organic producers and processors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Agri-Food 2010 report included a recommendation that a credible regulatory system be put in place for the organic sector and that the <Col N="1502" /> existing confusion between competing inspection bodies be ended. In response, I undertook to streamline the inspection arrangements. My objective is to ensure that all organic farmers and processors have ready access to the most efficient, transparent and consistent arrangements for inspection and certification. My Department has recently put proposals to the three private bodies, the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association, Organic Trust and Demeter Standards Limited, for a unified inspection and certification system which will achieve this objective while allowing the three bodies to continue to operate their own private arrangements, where their own members are concerned, as heretofore. I understand that the three bodies are currently considering these proposals and I am hopeful for a positive response.</P>

      <P>I have recently written to the EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development outlining my concern about possible further reductions in export refunds for beef. I have asked the Commission not to take any such action because of the implications for cattle prices in Ireland. I emphasised the importance of third country markets for the Irish beef sector and I pointed out that, while the Irish beef industry is continually striving to re-focus its efforts on the EU market, third country markets will continue to be an important outlet for Irish beef. I also expressed concern that the current Commission's approach to export refunds could undermine the competitiveness of Irish exporters on third country markets relative to other third country suppliers, particularly from South America and India. There is continuous downward pressure on the level of export refunds due to the overall policy direction of the Commission and to the WTO requirements. Looking to the future the challenge facing the beef industry is to reduce their dependence on third country markets and exploit the growing opportunities on the EU markets which are more lucrative and more stable in the long-term.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the comprehensive range of measures we have in place is proving effective. In the first instance, the overall incidence of BSE in this country continues to be extremely low with a total of just 528 cases since 1989 while the cattle population exceeded more than 7.5 million each year. The higher number of cases here this year was foreseen in the recent report of the European Union's Scientific Steering Committee which predicted a temporary increase in the number of cases for the next couple of years from animals infected prior to the measures introduced in 1996 and 1997 taking full effect. That committee also concluded that the Irish system was &ldquo;optimally stable&rdquo;, meaning that the measures in place since then prevent the agent of BSE from re-infecting cattle. Likewise the plan of action prepared in the context of the Agri-Food 2010 report acknowledged that the number of BSE cases are unlikely to decline until after 2002. I would like to draw particular attention to the fewer numbers of BSE cases aged five years or less this year which tends to confirm the views of the Scientific Steering Committee that we can expect to see a reduction in the number of cases from 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have of course a most comprehensive range of surveillance and control measures in place and these were significantly enhanced in 1996 and 1997. These measures are intended to protect human and animal health and are reviewed on an <Col N="1504" /> ongoing basis. They are being supplemented by the enhanced active surveillance programme which is now under way.</P>
    <P>It remains my clear objective to eradicate BSE at the earliest possible date. In the meantime, the various controls in place will be strictly enforced and enhanced as necessary to provide the best possible level of protection to consumers at home and abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has introduced a range of measures to protect and improve water quality in Ireland. The rural environment protection scheme, more commonly known as REPS, has as one of its main objectives the protection of water quality. The National Development Plan 2000-2006 provides for expen<Col N="1505" /> diture of some £1,600 million on environmental protection measures under REPS.</P>
      <P>Apart from REPS, payments under agricultural aid schemes will generally be subject to good farming practice. A range of measures is required in good farming practice, including conformity with Teagasc recommendations on nutrient management, including proper use of nitrogen and chemical and organic fertilisers, and to comply with the 1996 Code of Good Agricultural Practice to Protect Waters from Pollution by Nitrates.</P>
      <P>The national scheme of investment aid for the control of farm pollution is in place which provides for grant aid for the construction of waste storage facilities, silage storage facilities, animal housing and associated farmyard facilities. It is a prerequisite to participation in the scheme that applicants are either in the rural environment protection scheme or have a nutrient management plan approved by my Department. The scheme provides farmers with the necessary support to improve pollution control on their farms, engage in more sustainable farming practices and protect the environment including water quality. Since its introduction in 1999, 5,700 applications have been received under the scheme, approvals involving potential grant aid of £27.8 million have issued by my Department and grant aid of £6.3 million has been paid.</P>
      <P>In addition, under the national development plan a provision of £180.9 million has been made for a scheme of investment aid for farm waste management for the period 2000-2006. It is proposed to provide grant aid for similar investment items to the current national scheme of investment aid for the control of farm pollution. It will be a requirement that farmers participating in this new scheme must follow good farming practice. Penalties will apply to non compliance with any of the GFP measures. It is expected that 20,000 farmers will benefit from this scheme. Clearance to proceed with this scheme requires the approval of the European Commission. Negotiations between my Department and the European Commission on the approval process are at an advanced stage.</P>
      <P>My Department continues its support for organic farming, including financial support for measures to improve marketing and public awareness of the environmental benefits of organic products. The National Development Plan 2000-2006 provides for expenditure of £6 million under this heading.</P>
      <P>Substantial progress is being made in dealing with pollution especially from phosphorus generated from intensive animal rearing systems. The operation of the integrated pollution control licensing system by the Environmental Protection Agency for intensive pig and poultry rearing units will have beneficial effects.</P>

      <P>Products imported directly from third countries and from other member states are monitored on a regular basis. The controls in this area operated by my Department are based on EU harmonised rules governing the veterinary and zoo technical checks applicable to intra community and third country trade in live animals and animal products. These rules require a range of checks to be carried out and also provide for the imposition of restrictions on, or indeed the banning of trade in particular animal products when this is considered necessary for the protection of public health.</P>
      <P>The Standing Veterinary Committee of the European Commission, in which experts from my Department participate, constantly monitors events in member states and third countries which are likely to have implications for public health.</P>
      <P>At present EU harmonised rules require advance notification to my Department of animal product imports; that the goods must be accompanied by a veterinary certificate or, in certain cases, a commercial document; that the goods must come from an approved establishment, that is, a slaughterhouse, cutting plant or cold store which has been approved by the EU Commission; and that the goods may be subject to inspection by officials of my Department.</P>
      <P>Imported agricultural products are sampled and analysed on a regular basis to ensure that they do not constitute a danger to public health. Third countries' imports are subject to a documentary, identity and physical check whilst goods coming from other member states are subject to random checks. Goods which are not in compliance with the veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination and if necessary destroyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The framework of veterinary checks provided for by harmonised EU rules, the implementation of those rules by my Department and the veterinary services of other member states, together with the constant programme of monitoring and review of public health risks provided for under the aegis of the Standing Veterinary Committee, are intended to provide assurance that imported animal products meet the requisite standards and are fit for human consumption, while allowing member states to fulfil their trade obligations as <Col N="1507" /> members of the European Union and the World Trade Organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Standards for organic crop produce had been fixed since 1991 by Council Regulation 2092/91. Under Regulation 2092/91 the Department, which is the competent authority under the regulation, had approved three private bodies to inspect and certify organic crop produce. There were no national standards for organic livestock produce. These bodies, in a private capacity, had also been certifying organic livestock produce to standards that they themselves had set.</P>
      <P>When Regulation 2092/91 was supplemented by Regulation 1804/99 and extended to the livestock sector on 24 August, the Department had proposed to adopt standards for such produce in accordance with the regulations. However these standards did not include all the requirements recommended by the three private bodies, the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association, Organic Trust and Demeter Standards Limited. Following further discussions on this issue with interested parties including the three private organic bodies and other stakeholders in the organic sector, my Department has moved significantly to address a number of points of concern and other issues may be considered subsequently by the Organic Development Committee.</P>
      <P>I value the expertise and commitment of the organic bodies and recognise the substantial input they have made to the development of the organic sector in Ireland including the development of proposals on a set of common standards. However in view of the early stage of the development of the organic sector in Ireland, where the supply of Irish organic produce is unable to meet the current demand thus necessitating a high level of imports of organic produce, it was not considered appropriate to accept all of the standards proposed by the organic bodies as the Department's minimum standards.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the standards now being set for the organic sector will provide every reassurance to retailers and consumers as to the quality and integrity of Irish organic produce, without compromising the competitiveness of Irish organic producers. My objective is to ensure the continuing growth of the organic sector as part of mainstream farming in Ireland.</P>

      <P>My Department is committed to providing a quality customer service to all its clients. Direct income payments are of crucial importance to the income position of farmers. The aim of the Protocol on Direct Payments to Farmers, which was developed by my Department in conjunction with the farm organisations, is to ensure that, subject to regulatory constraints, the best possible service is provided to farmers. Feedback from customers at both representative and individual level has acknowledged a significant and sustained improvement in the quality of service in recent years.</P>
      <P>The protocol is a further step in the drive by my Department to provide an efficient, responsive and user-friendly service to farmer clients. My Department is already meeting its payment commitments under the protocol with the commencement on Monday week last, 16 October, the earliest date allowed under the EU rules, of payment of the first instalment of special beef premium, suckler cow premium and the new slaughter premium, including entitlements under the national envelope provision. Over £104 million was paid to farmers at the beginning of last week. Payments will continue on an ongoing basis over the coming weeks and this commitment to the early payment dates is in line with the payment and delivery targets set out in the protocol.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department will soon commence a consultative process involving the widest possible number of its customers as part of its preparations for the updating of the customer service action plan.

      <P>The main objective of the changes I made in the management of milk quotas in Ireland was to provide committed dairy farmers with greater access to permanent quota at a reasonable cost. The rigid link between land and quota and the volume of dormant quota which existed had hindered the efficient restructuring of the sector.</P>
      <P>Even at this early stage, the benefits of the new regime are very clear. Over 62 million gallons of quota have been made available under this year's restructuring scheme to active milk producers. This is almost equivalent to the total quantity restructured during the past five years. The average annual amount allocated over the past five years was 14.3 million gallons. The positive response of the Minister for Finance in the tax treatment of purchases under the scheme also helped considerably in making it a success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year's restructuring scheme, together with future schemes will have a significant impact on <Col N="1512" /> the structure of the dairy industry. A preliminary analysis of the effects of this year's scheme shows that there has been a significant increase in the number of producers with quotas in excess of 35,000 gallons even compared with last year. In addition about 90% of the quota was taken up by producers in the small to medium size categories. It is very encouraging to see that such a significant number of producers in these categories had the commitment required to invest in expanding their enterprises and to better prepare themselves for the future.</P>

      <P>In addition to ensuring political stability by consolidating and strengthening the democratic process in the new member states, enlargement can provide the conditions and the impetus to promote economic and social development to the benefit of both the new member states and existing member states. For these reasons, it is the policy of the Government <Col N="1513" /> to support enlargement, a policy with which, of course, I fully concur.</P>
      <P>As part of our preparations for enlargement, my officials and I are involved in a programme of exchange visits, at both ministerial and official levels, with the prospective new member states. These visits are most beneficial in terms of reaching an understanding of the issues involved in enlargement and in establishing contacts in the candidate countries. They also are of assistance to the candidate countries in making the legal and administrative arrangements necessary to implement EU legislation.</P>
      <P>A precise assessment of the impact of enlargement on Irish agriculture will depend on the outcome of the enlargement negotiations, particularly in relation to the level of restraint on production in the new member states and the related EU budgetary arrangements. It is reasonable to conclude at this stage, however, that enlargement will give rise to more competition on existing EU markets and more opportunities on the markets of the new member states.</P>
      <P>Because of such changes in the trading environment which may result from the enlargement of the EU and from the WTO negotiations, as well as factors such as changing consumer tastes, new food distribution channels and general technological developments, I established a group to make recommendations on the development of the Irish agriculture and food industries over the present decade. That group's report entitled Agri Food 2010, was completed earlier this year and I have approved and published a plan of action for the implementation of its recommendations. As a result, I expect that the agriculture and food industries will be well prepared to deal with the challenge of enlargement over the next ten years.</P>

      <P>Council Directive 97/78/EC of 18 December 1997 which lays down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries was transposed into national legislation under the European Communities (Veterinary Checks on Products from Third Countries) Regulations, 2000 ( S.I. No. 292 of 2000 ) in so far as it refers to non-fishery products. The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources is drafting the appropriate legislation with regard to fishery products.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied the vast majority of participants are co-operating with the CMMS and that the system is operating satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>The CMMS is of course a newly developed database and systems and procedures are being continuously monitored and updated. There are on-going contacts with all participants to ensure that commitments are being met and that accurate data are submitted. The continued co-operation of all parties is critical for the success of the CMMS.</P>
      <P>To ensure that there is an accurate and up to date record on CMMS of the current cattle population, my Department proposes to conduct a herd reconciliation exercise or mini census to confirm the location of these animals as at 31 December, 2000. Co-operation with this exercise will facilitate the greater use of CMMS both for traceability purposes and also in establishing entitlement to EU premia.</P>

      <P>The Report of the Advisory Committee on the Role of Women in Agriculture was launched on 27 September 2000.</P>
      <P>The report contains 36 recommendations, covering a broad area which includes education and training, information technology and social inclusion. Some 18 of these recommendations have been identified as falling within the remit of my Department. The recommendations are being examined individually and appropriate action will be taken in the shortest possible time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also corresponding with my other colleagues in Government with regard to the recommendations of the report which relate to the <Col N="1516" /> activities of their Departments. I would anticipate that they too will have these recommendations examined as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I would add that my Department has in fact already commenced the implementation of a number of these recommendations. Funding has been allocated to organisations to assist in promoting the role of women in agriculture and in improving the image of farming as a career and lifestyle, and it is envisaged that the establishment of a network of women in farming, funded under the national mainstream rural development programme, will also encourage more women to play an active role in the decision-making process in rural and agricultural life.</P>

      <P>The Irish National Employment Action Plan, adopted by the Government as its response to the European employment guidelines, included a commitment to more systematic engagement of the employment services with the unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Implementation of this commitment in respect of young people aged under 25 years commenced on 1 September 1998. From that date, persons in this age group who reach six months on the live register are being referred by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for interview by FÁS. Commencing from 1 March 1999, persons aged under 25 who reach 18 months on the live register are also being referred. Persons aged 25 to 34 years, approaching 12 months on the live register, have been included in the referral process from May 1999 onwards. Persons aged 35 to 55 were engaged with as they crossed the 12 month threshold from February 2000. This <Col N="1518" /> threshold was reduced to nine months on the live register for all those over 25 from July 2000 onwards.</P>
    <P>By the end of July this year, a total of 39,054 unemployed have been referred to FÁS under the employment action plan activation process. Of these, 27,019, or 69%, have now left the live register.</P>
    <P>When referred to FÁS, each individual's progress and career guidance process is tracked using a sophisticated caseload tracking system. The aim is to refer within one month as many clients as possible to a job, training or education course or some other support such as a job club.</P>
    <P>Depending on the age category, between 17 to 25% of interviewees are placed in jobs, training or education within one month. This percentage improves radically over a three month period.</P>
    <P>After one month, depending on the age category, between 35% to 42% of those interviewed continue with FÁS support in the form of intensive guidance and counselling. The remaining interviewees are either awaiting training, are not ready to progress due to health problems, etc., have dropped out of the process or have signed off the live register of their own accord.</P>
    <P>A detailed report is published each month by my Department covering all those referred under the employment action plan. The report is sent to the Dáil Library and is also available on my Departments website at:</P>

My Department is now giving priority to finalising draft passenger boat regulations with a view to their introduction next year.</P>

      <P>A further study has been undertaken by the Department of Environmental Resource Management in University College Dublin, on behalf of BIM, in the period 1997-99. This EU funded study examined the seal population by reference to, <i>inter alia</i>, diet, parasites, population and interaction with fisheries. The results of the study are currently being finalised and will be submitted to the European Commission before the end of this year. I anticipate that the results of this latest study will be published shortly thereafter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the resignation in 1998 of the previous occupant of the post, the Irish Ambassador to Pakistan, who resides in Tehran, interviewed 12 people in Pakistan who had expressed interest in the position and/or who had been recommended for it. On the basis of reports from the Ambassador and taking account of the advice of the Department of Foreign Affairs, my predecessor, Deputy Andrews, in September 1999 decided that Mr. Hasib Ahsan Mozzaffar was the most suitable of those considered. The Pakistani authorities in December 1999 conveyed their approval of Mr. Ahsan's appointment, the formal letter of commission was signed by my predecessor on 14 January 2000 and the exequatur formally recognising the appointment was issued by the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs in February 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1522" /> As with all honorary consular appointments, the appointment of the Honorary Consul in Karachi is subject to the following terms: The appointment is an honorary one, unsalaried and non-pensionable and is limited in duration to three years from the date of issue of the exequatur by the Pakistani authorities. This initial period of three years may be renewed by mutual agreement; the appointment may be terminated for any reason by the Minister for Foreign Affairs upon the giving of three months notice of termination in writing to the appointee and no compensation will be payable on such termination. The appointee may resign the appointment by giving three months notice of resignation in writing to the Minister for Foreign Affairs; the appointment may also be suspended with immediate effect by the Minister for failure or inability on the part of the appointee to discharge effectively his/her functions as Honorary Consul, if he/she is charged with a criminal offence or for conduct which, in the opinion of the Minister, is unbecoming of an Honorary Consul. Such suspension is without prejudice to the right of the Minister to terminate the appointment for any reason by giving the appointee three months notice in writing of termination of his/her appointment; an honorarium of IR£500 per year and a sum equal to a half of the consular fees collected during each period of six months will be paid after receipt and checking of the account of the Consulate for that period; however, this is subject to a maximum payment of the equivalent of IR£100 for any one fee; the following are supplied by the Department of Foreign Affairs but the appointee is expected to provide other necessary office items, including a safe, an escutcheon, two flags, the &ldquo;Consular Instructions&rdquo;, details of consular fees and stationery, Consulate rubber stamps, a selection of passport, visa, etc. application forms, accounts forms and directories and other reference and information material about Ireland; communication expenses incurred on Consulate business may be charged to the Department in the account of the Consulate. Accounts are to be furnished every six months, at the end of March and September; and the supervising mission is the Embassy of Ireland in Tehran through which communications with the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin should normally go. A report on the work of the Consulate is to be submitted to the Department by the Honorary Consul in the prescribed form at the end of every calendar year.</P>
    <P>The main duties and responsibilities of the Honorary Consul are to assist the Embassy in Tehran by looking after the consular protection of Irish citizens resident in or visiting Pakistan, by processing visa applications and transmitting them to the Department or the Embassy and by helping generally in the promotion of trade and other relations between Ireland and Pakistan and with official visits by Irish Government representatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have statutory responsibility for rural public transport matters I have no responsibility for the operation of the school transport scheme, the transport services of the health boards or the free travel scheme for the elderly. These functions are the responsibility of my colleagues the Minister for Education and Science, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs respectively.</P>
      <P>There is a provision of £3.5 million in the national development plan for the development of pilot public transport initiatives in rural areas and this scheme will be administered by my Department. The aim will be to encourage local or community-based initiatives to provide rural bus services where these do not exist or which are insufficient for the needs of the local population. It is hoped that, as the scheme rolls out, the maximum possible use will be made of transport vehicles, such as school buses, which may be unused for a significant portion of the day. The projects to be funded will be selected following a national call for proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1524" /> The Public Transport Partnership Forum, which was established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, has decided to establish a sub-committee on public transport in rural areas. The sub-committee will prepare, for consideration by the forum, draft recommendations in relation to the public transport pilot schemes and on rural public transport policy generally.</P>

      <P>The number of compensation claims settled by my Department with members and former members of the Defence Forces over the period in question is contained in the tabular statements which will be circulated in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>In addition to the claims referred to in the tabular statements, some 8,688 claims are outstanding in respect of alleged hearing loss and some 458 non hearing loss claims are outstanding.</P>
      <P>Some of these claims contain elements of compensation for medical expenses and/or loss of earnings. However, because of the very large number of files which would have to be reviewed to extract the information requested by the Deputy, the deployment of the necessary personnel and other resources in my Department which would be required to do this work cannot be justified.</P>

    <P>The past three years have been particularly successful in terms of exports of food and drink, with export earnings in 1999 valued in excess of £5.2 billion. This success is attributable in no small way to the marketing strategies of Bord Bia in pursuit of its overall objective to increase the sales of Irish food and drink. An important aspect of these activities is attendance at trade events, fairs and exhibitions aimed at identifying and developing new market opportunities in an increasingly competitive environment. I recognise the importance of these events as a platform for increasing the profile and enhancing the image of Irish food and drink products. Ministerial attendance at these events is particularly useful in conveying the high regard that we in Ireland have for our valuable food industry.</P>

In the 1999-2000 marking year, 161 samples were taken for analysis.

    <P>(Mr. Walsh): The management and use of nutrients are covered by the following protocols: recommendations on the collection, storage and use of farm waste and usage rates for nitrogen for all crops, including food crops, are contained in the Code of Good Agricultural Practice to Protect Waters from Pollution by Nitrates, which was jointly drawn up by my Department and the Department of the Environment in 1996. The recommendations in the code with regard to timing of applications of chemical fertilisers and appropriate precautions to take to prevent pollution of waters etc. are equally applicable to nutrients other than nitrogen e.g. phosphorus and potassium.</P>
    <P>Participants in the rural environment protection scheme are required to use nutrients in accordance with a nutrient management plan. All farmers have access to the advisory services provided by Teagasc which provides advice and specific recommendations on the use of nutrients. In addition, for the purposes of the CAP Rural Development Plan 2000-2006 and the capital investment schemes detailed in the two regional operational programmes, farmer participants will be obliged to conform with the code of good farming practice.</P>

    <P>(Mr. Walsh): Article 6.5 of Commission Regulation 3887/92 as amended states: &ldquo;On-the-spot checks shall be unannounced. Advance warning limited to the strict minimum necessary may however be given, although as a general rule, this should not exceed 48 hours.&rdquo;  As this is the rule which currently exists it is not within the <Col N="1529" /> discretion of my Department to extend the period further. However, in relation to cattle inspections the policy of my Department is to announce inspections and generally such announcements are given at the earliest possible time. This approach is in compliance with the requirements of the regulations and also recognises the difficulties of farmers with off-farm employment.</P>
    <P>The question of extending the period of notification was raised during negotiations of the arrangements under Agenda 2000. However, there was very little support from other member states for the proposal and as a consequence the EU Commission was not prepared to alter the existing provision.</P>
    <P>Under the Protocol on Direct Payments my Department undertook to raise this matter again with a view to having the period extended. In this context I can assure the Deputy that the matter is still on the table and will be pursued in the context of simplification of the CAP rules.</P>

    <P>(Mr. Walsh): I am very aware of the significant growth opportunities available to Irish food companies in the food ingredients sector.</P>
    <P>The initiatives contained in the national development plan will assist the sector to meet the market requirements arising from changes in consumer preferences foreseen in the period ahead, with increased emphasis on convenience and innovation. Trends indicate that the main potential for growth in mature markets is in the prepared consumer foods and food ingredients sectors.</P>
    <P>To prepare the industry to respond and adapt rapidly to changes in the market, the national development plan provides for a total funding allocation of £282 million for the food industry as follows: £120 million for capital investment; £83 million for research, technology and innovation; £48 million for marketing and promotion, and £31 million to address the human resources needs of the food industry.</P>
    <P>The actions outlined in the national development plan provide a cohesive and comprehensive <Col N="1530" /> response to the needs of the food industry. It takes account of the recommendations of the Food Industry Development Group and the Agri Food 2010 Committee, with the emphasis on competitiveness and market-orientation. I am confident that the measures and the financial allocations contained in the plan for the food industry will play a significant role in assisting the development of the food ingredients sector.</P>

      <P>Leader type activity in the period to 2006 will be delivered through the European Union Leader+ Programme, together with a mainstream national rural development programme. Funding of over £117 million has been allocated to the two programmes. Work on the preparation of the operational programme for Leader+ is at an advanced stage and it is expected that it will be lodged with the European Commission shortly. The programme will also be presented to the Special North-South EU Programmes Body for its endorsement in tandem with the Northern Ireland Leader programme in respect of cross-Border aspects.</P>
      <P>A period of five months is provided for to facilitate the commission's consideration of the programme prior to deciding on approval. While I will be pushing for early approval of the programme, it is unlikely that approval will be forthcoming before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The national rural development programme forms part of the regional operational programmes and will be funded under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Given their complementarity, the European Commission has indicated that the approval process for the national rural development programme and the Leader+ programme should take place simultaneously.</P>
      <P>Advertisements inviting interested groups to submit full business plans for either or both programmes were placed in the national and provincial papers and farming press with a closing date for receipt of applications of Friday next, 27 October 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An independent consultant will be commissioned to examine applications for assistance made under the programmes and make recommendations on selection. The Department will consider this assessment and a report will be made to Government who will make the final decision on groups. The process for selection of groups to operate the new programmes will proceed contemporaneously with the commission's consideration of the programmes. I expect that the decision on the successful groups will follow shortly after the commission's approval of the programmes. Detailed programme operating rules are being drafted at present for clearance by <Col N="1531" /> the European Commission and these will form the basis for the operation of groups when appointed.</P>

      <P>A new IT strategy was produced earlier this year for my Department. This strategy recognises the importance of the effective use of IT in the delivery of our schemes and services to all our customers and it sets out a plan for the redevelopment of all the major systems in use in my Department over the next five years.</P>
      <P>A significant part of this strategy is the redevelopment of both the headage and premia computer systems to provide a more modern and efficient service to our clients and, <i>inter alia</i>, provide the necessary changes required as a result of Agenda 2000. When redeveloped, it is envisaged that the new systems will be capable of being used for direct online scheme application submission by farmers through their own PCs or through a &ldquo;kiosk&rdquo; service. It is also envisaged that such redevelopment would include facilities for farmers to check the progress of their application(s) online.</P>
      <P>In fact, in July of this year my Department issued a protocol on direct payments to farmers and one of the major protocol principles is the greater use of information and communications technologies for the purpose of communicating information and receipt of applications and notifications, where this is legally possible.</P>
      <P>The Government recognises the importance of modernising the mechanisms used by all State agencies in the provision of their services and has consequently set up a new agency, REACH, under the auspices of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. The new REACH agency has been tasked with developing a strategy for the integration of public services and developing and implementing a framework for electronic government.</P>
      <P>My Department will be working closely with the REACH agency to ensure that we not only develop our systems to provide access to our customers but to also ensure that we integrate our services with all other State agencies to provide a single point of contact to all customers and to ensure that our customers are not repeatedly requested to provide the same information to different State agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the many major issues to be addressed in providing the services envisaged is the issue of security. When an automated service is provided it is incumbent on the service provider to ensure <Col N="1532" /> that both the communication and the information being accessed is both secure and private.</P>
    <P>REACH has been charged with the provision of both a single point of contact or &ldquo;broker&rdquo; for government services and also for the delivery of a security framework within the context of the delivery of these services. This &ldquo;broker&rdquo; will provide significant authentication services for all Government Departments. My Department is working closely with REACH, in the development of the government services broker and the provision of electronic government services and to this end I have set up a special unit within my Department to co-ordinate the implementation of this strategy.</P>
    <P>In the meantime the application process for the various direct payment schemes has undergone substantial simplification over the past few years. The introduction of printed cattle identification documents (passports) and the use of associated bar-coding has facilitated a very major simplification of the application forms for the special beef premium scheme. It is intended to introduce a similar simplified application procedure for the suckler cow premium scheme in 2001. Next year's applications will be further simplified by the replacement of the current animal based headage schemes in disadvantaged areas by an area based compensatory allowance scheme based on the annual area aid application.</P>

      <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006 provides for a total funding allocation of £282 million for the food industry. Of this amount, £83 million has been allocated towards the food research technological development and innovation, RTDI measure, with the primary aim of enhancing the innovative capability of the food sector. The RTDI strategy for the food industry comprises a number of elements involving in-company research, technology transfer and public good research.</P>
      <P>As a result of a recent call for project proposals under these measures, a large number of projects selected for grant assistance are concerned directly with new product development, many of which relate to the pre-cooked or oven-ready market. In addition, several projects in the consumer foods, ingredients, dairy and meat sectors are devoted to investigating the underlying behaviour and functionality of product raw materials. Research in these areas will provide a base of expertise in generic technologies which will underpin the development of new food products well into the future.</P>

      <P>The agri-food 2010 report drew attention to a number of issues facing the pigmeat industry. These included increased competition from imported product, need to optimise structure and scale at processing level and the ability to cope with the cyclical nature of the pigmeat market. These are all questions that the industry itself needs to address in order to ensure its future development.</P>
      <P>I, with my colleague the Northern Ireland Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, commissioned a study of the pigmeat processing industry on the island of Ireland. The consultants were appointed in April this year. The report of the study is currently being finalised and it is expected that it will be available in November. The report will consider in particular the issue of processing capacity in the context of the future outlook for the pig industry. I look forward with interest to seeing the findings and recommendations of the study and I hope that it will provide useful pointers for the future development of the industry.</P>
      <P>As regards the cyclical nature of the industry, the EU Commission and the member states have been considering what measures might be taken to alleviate the effect of the cycle on the incomes of producers. These discussions are continuing and it remains to be seen whether any consensus emerges from these deliberations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 191 and 194 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland enjoys uninterrupted access for beef exports to all member states of the European Union and to all of our traditionally important markets worldwide. I am actively pursuing the small number of markets, both in Europe and elsewhere, where market access problems for Irish beef still exist.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that Irish beef exporters are competitive on the international market, although I am concerned that the current commission policy on export refunds could adversely affect our competitive position relative to other third country suppliers. I have made known my concerns on this matter to Commissioner Fischler. However, I would encourage Irish beef exporters to refocus their efforts on the European market which, I believe, represents the most stable long-term outlet for Irish beef.</P>
      <P>While my Department, in conjunction with Bord Bia, will continue to assist the Irish beef industry to exploit market opportunities, it is, however, primarily a matter for the industry itself to capitalise on the high quality of its product in securing export contracts. I am satisfied that the Irish beef industry is well positioned to maintain and increase its market share.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 193 and 199 together.</P>
      <P>As a result of the highly favourable outcome of the Agenda 2000 negotiations on the reform of the CAP, it is estimated that some £10 billion will be provided by the EU over the period 2000-2006 to fund market supports including export refunds, premia, REPS payments, farmer retirement payments and compensatory allowances in disadvantaged areas. In addition, the National Development Plan 2000-2006, involving total public expenditure of £900 million, towards which the EU will contribute some £110 million, will fund measures to improve the structure and competitiveness of the agriculture and food industries.</P>
      <P>Because of changes which may result from the enlargement of the EU and from the WTO negotiations, as well as factors such as changing consumer tastes, new food distribution channels and general technological developments, I established a group to make recommendations on the development of the Irish agriculture and food industries over the present decade. That group's report entitled &ldquo;Agri Food 2010&rdquo;, was completed earlier this year and I have approved and published a plan of action for the implementation of its recommendations.</P>
      <P>As a result of the Agenda 2000 negotiations, the measures provided for in the national development plan and the implementation of the 2010 plan of action, I am satisfied that a sound foundation has been laid for the development of the agriculture and food industries over the current decade.</P>

These include provisions for comprehensive follow-up action to be taken when BSE suspect animals are detected and are underpinned by a regime of inspections, sampling and laboratory analysis. My Department has recently augmented existing protections by the introduction of an active surveillance programme which features a highly reliable, rapid test for the BSE prion.</P>

      <P>I see the ability to withstand competition, scale of processing facilities and the need for development of more market oriented and value added products as the main issues to be addressed by the poultry sector. While demand for poultry-meat is expected to continue to grow the industry is facing considerable competition from imported product in its attempts to maintain market share.</P>
      <P>The Agri-Food 2010 report stressed that the Irish poultry processing industry must seek economies through rationalisation and the development of quality differentiated products. Accordingly, under the implementation programme for the national development plan, financial aid will be made available, through Enterprise Ireland, for suitable projects that address the issues of rationalisation, processing efficiency, competitiveness, product development and meeting the requirements currently being supplied by imported product.</P>
      <P>My Department will be encouraging the poultry processing industry to evaluate its future needs and to address these, taking into account whatever financial assistance is available under the national plan. Best practice in terms of quality, safety and traceability of poultry meat products will also be encouraged and highlighted in Bord Bia funded market promotion initiatives.</P>

      <P>Ireland's CAP rural development plan for the period 2000-2006, which was submitted to the European Commission at the end of December 1999, has recently been approved by the commission. This plan covers early retirement along with REPS, compensatory allowances and forestry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the commitment entered into in the protocol on direct payments to farmers arising out of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, my Department has been consulting the farming organisations about the detailed provisions of the new early retirement scheme for farmers. These consultations have now been com <Col N="1538" /> pleted and every effort is being made to finalise the necessary scheme documentation, including terms and conditions and application forms, at an early date. The new scheme will be open to applicants in about four weeks, and application forms will then be available from the local offices of my Department.</P>
    <P>EU Council Regulation No. 1257/1999, under which the new scheme is being introduced, does not include the requirement that retiring farmers and transferees practise farming as a main occupation. It also replaces the previous requirement for transferees to enlarge the holdings, and requires instead that they meet a viability requirement.</P>
    <P>I welcome these changes, which have enabled the new scheme to be drafted in a way that will make it more attractive to potential applicants and to younger farmers who may consider taking over the retirees' holdings. Under the previous scheme, the requirement to have practised farming as a main occupation meant that in each of the ten years before retirement, the retiring farmer had to have spent at least 50% of his or her time in farming and derived at least 50% of his or her income from it. Under the new scheme, the retiring farmer must have practised farming in the ten years prior to his or her retirement and derived not less than 25% of his or her income from farming in the last year. Transferees, too, will no longer have to practise farming as a main occupation for the duration of the pension period and will not be required to enlarge the holding; instead, at the time they take over the holding, they must meet a viability threshold of 50 income units, of which at least 20 income units must be derived from farming. In addition, the new scheme provides for a higher rate of pension, with a maximum payment of £10,644. The maximum available under the previous scheme is £9,509.</P>

      <P>Under Agenda 2000 headage payments are moving from a payment per animal basis to a system of payments based on area. At present some £120 million is spent annually on headage whereas under the new area based scheme annual expenditure is expected to be closer to £180 million. Of the 109,000 farmers who are expected to participate in the scheme, 81,000 will gain substantially to the tune of £812 each on average. While it is accepted that there will be approximately 28,000 losers, I have arranged with the EU Commission that losses in 2001 will be compensated for the extent of 90% in 2001, 80% in 2002 and 50% in 2003. This compensation package will have the result of reducing losses to £32 on average in 2001 and to £64 in 2002. I have also asked my officials to review the scheme with a view to dealing in the longer term with the problem of reduced payments. Under all other areas under Agenda 2000 substantial additional funding is being put in place with the consequent prospect that the schemes involved will impact only in a positive way over the duration of the agreement from 2000 to 2006.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the context for the recent taxation measures on housing, including these stamp duty measures, is the difficult housing market situation. These market conditions, which are fully elaborated on in the most recent study into the housing market by Peter Bacon &amp; Associates, Economic Consultants, required prompt action. In particular there was a pressing need to strengthen the position of first time owner-occupier buyers compared to investors. The third Bacon report pointed to speculative demand which was helping to drive up housing prices. The restructuring of the stamp duty regime to benefit owner-occupiers as against investors is one of the measures designed to help first time and other owner-occupier buyers.</P>
    <P>The 9% stamp duty rate now applies to all categories of investors buying new or second hand residential property. The increase in the rate payable &ndash; compared with the previous rates that applied &ndash; will of course depend on the price of the house. The Government decided to apply this flat rate of 9% to all non owner-occupier purchasers of new, and second-hand, residential property, irrespective of the value of the property, as it was considered that the previous graduated scale of rates might encourage investments in the lower end of the market. This would not be a desirable development from the point of view of the first-time owner-occupier purchaser as it would bring further pressure on prices at the lower end of the market.</P>
    <P>I consider that the latest package of measures should assist in restoring balance in the housing market and curbing price increases. This price moderation is in the interests of all in the property sector whether first-time buyer, owner-occupier or investor.</P>

It has received no complaints about the service being provided at present. The health board keeps the matter of services under ongoing review in order to ensure that general practitioners are meeting their contracted responsibilities to their patients and in this regard initial talks have commenced with general practitioners in the area which aim to extend the CAREDOC scheme to the Wexford area. If the Deputy is aware of any specific case or complaint, I will be happy to have that matter examined by the board.</P>

      <P>The maintenance of a high level of prices for tobacco products is an important factor in preventing children from experimenting with tobacco. I support the removal of tobacco products from the CPI so as to ensure that price will continue to be used as a key public health instrument in the tobacco free initiative now under way. The majority of smokers become addicted in their childhood and teenage years and research has clearly shown that price is an important factor in young people deciding not to smoke.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of the particular criticism referred to by the Deputy. The Deputy will, no doubt, be aware that the terms and conditions for junior hospital doctors have improved very significantly following the agreement negotiated by my Department, the Health Service Employers Agency and the Irish Medical Organisation. Included in this agreement is a substantial increase in the rate of pay for overtime worked, a training package to be put in place amounting to IR£10 million and the appointment of a senior manager in each major hospital with specific responsibility to manage non-consultant hospital doctors hours.</P>
      <P>My Department has contacted all of the relevant health agencies informing them of the new agreement and has, as is normal procedure, requested an estimate of the likely cost of the improved rate of pay for overtime to junior hospital doctors. My Department is committed to the agreement reached at the Labour Relations Commission earlier this year. There is no question of my Department reneging on this agreement.</P>

      <P>The administration of the registration system for births, deaths and marriages is primarily a matter for An tÁrd-Chláraitheoir, Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages, and for local registrars who operate under his general direction. Persons appointed registrars, who are not permanent and pensionable employees of the health boards, derive income from fees for registrations and fees for the certificates issued by them. These fees are set out in statutory instruments including S.I. No. 278 of 1987, which sets out the principal fees for the registration of events and the issue of certificates. In particular and limited circumstances a registrar may issue a certificate which is compiled from an entry in a register, in which amendments have been made, and the fees for <Col N="1548" /> such certificates are set out in S.I. 234 of 1987.

I have considered this report, and while having taken no final decisions on its implementation, I accept the broad thrust of its recommendations. However, I feel that some further refinements are needed in relation to implementation arrangements at local level. In this regard, I established an advisory group, chaired by Professor Niall O'Higgins, St. Vincent's Hospital, to assist and liaise with health boards in formulating their plans for the development of specialist breast cancer services. I am confident that the development of symptomatic breast disease services which will result will greatly enhance the quality of the services currently available to the women of Ireland.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I have initiated a national review of bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute sectors. This review is in line with the commitment contained in the &ldquo;Programme for Prosperity and Fairness&rdquo;. The review is being conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. I have presented the interim findings of the review to my Government colleagues and identified a range of short to medium term investment proposals aimed at addressing identified service difficulties in both sectors. Further work is now being undertaken to develop a longer term investment strategy for the acute and non-acute sectors. The second phase of the review will be completed in spring 2001.</P>
      <P>As part of Phase 1 of the review an analysis of bed needs in the eastern region was conducted by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and submitted to my Department. The authority is now undertaking a more detailed assessment of need including an analysis of future bed requirements by specialty. This study will further inform the work of the review and I look forward to receiving the authority's final report in due course.</P>

      <P>Under arrangements for public hospital services introduced in June 1991, on foot of the Health (Amendment) Act, 1991, everyone, regardless of income, is entitled to public hospital and public consultant services subject only to modest statutory charges, from which medical card holders are exempt. Alternatively one can opt to be the private patient of both the consultant and the hospital. Private patients are liable for the appropriate accommodation charges and consultants' fees in addition to the statutory charges.</P>
      <P>The requirement that patients make an explicit choice between public and private care was recommended by the Commission on Health Funding on the grounds of equity since, under the previous system, it was possible that some public patients of the hospital could receive preferential treatment over other public patients by virtue of either being private to the consultant or by obtaining a private bed.</P>
      <P>However, I have asked the Eastern Regional Health Authority to examine the circumstances of the case to establish whether they can assist this person towards the payment of costs.</P>

      <P>The provision of paediatric accident and emergency services at St. Columcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown, is a matter in the first instance for the Eastern Regional Health Authority. I am informed that the level of accident and emergency consultant cover generally at St. Columcille's Hospital and across the south east Dublin region is under examination at present by a joint sub-committee of the south east Dublin departments of surgery and medicine.</P>
      <P>I am further advised that the Eastern Regional Health Authority is considering a proposal to appoint consultant paediatricians to the region with a special interest in community paediatrics.</P>
      <P>The current policy on paediatric accident and emergency services is for children presenting at the A&amp;E department at St. Columcille's with major medical or surgical problems to be assessed, stabilised and immediately transferred to the appropriate children's hospital with a view to ensuring timely access to the appropriate level of care. The provision of an effective triage system in A&amp;E will be facilitated further by the recent approval of a £5 million development programme for the hospital, announced by the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Hanafin. The development will involve an extension to the existing accident and emergency department at St. Columcille's Hospital.</P>
      <P>The Council for Children's Hospital Care was established in 1999. The role of the council is primarily to assist the three paediatric hospitals to work with each other and the ERHA to plan and develop acute paediatric services on a co-ordinated basis in the functional area of the authority. I am informed that the issue of paediatric services in Dublin south east is receiving priority attention and that the council has established a sub-committee to address this service.</P>

My Department issued explanatory notes and guidelines to local authorities in 1989 on the making of such schemes and advising authorities that it should be the aim of their schemes to promote equality of access to local authority housing based on relative housing needs to ensure that a dwelling, if suitable, is let to the person in greatest need and to ensure that no category of needy persons is at a permanent disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> other categories. Subject to compliance with section 11 and regard being had to the guidelines, it is a matter for each local authority to determine the detailed criteria to be included in their scheme of letting priorities. The making or amendment of a scheme is a reserved function of the elected members of the authority. The letting of houses in accordance with the scheme of letting priorities is an executive function performable by the manager. Schemes of letting priorities are generally available in local authorities for examination by members of the public during office hours.</P>

      <P>Under the Town Renewal Act, 2000, it is a matter for the relevant county councils to propose sites for designation for tax incentives within the area covered by a town renewal plan. In doing so they are assisted by the detailed guidelines issued to them; these set out the purposes and aims of the schemes, the criteria to be used in selecting towns for which plans are to be prepared, and advice on the approach to be followed in preparing their plans, including selecting sites for designation. County councils were advised that the extent of designation must necessarily be limited and well targeted and that only sites that clearly fulfilled the objectives of the plans should be designated. The award of incentives can only be justified where it can be shown that they will assist in overcoming identifiable barriers to development.</P>
      <P>The role of the expert panel set up by me was to assess the council's proposals and recommend sites for designation on the basis of the plans submitted by county councils. In a number of cases additional information was requested from the relevant county council to facilitate examination of the proposals. The panel was confined to examining the sites recommended by county councils by reference to the criteria contained in the guidelines; this process did not involve the panel carrying out inspections. Therefore the panel did not visit Bellaghy-Charlestown.</P>

      <P>The primary objective of this Bill will be to amend the integrated pollution control licensing provisions of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, and the waste licensing provisions of the Waste Management Act, 1996. These amendments are necessary to give full effect in national law to EU Directive 96/61/EC on integrated pollution prevention and control &ndash; IPPC. The principal amendments will be to change the technical basis of the licensing systems from BATNEEC &ndash; best available technology not entailing excessive costs &ndash; to BAT &ndash; best available techniques; give more formal recognition to emission limit values &ndash; ELVs &ndash; as the operational basis of integrated pollution control licensing and waste licensing by the EPA; make additional provision for the impact of transboundary emissions to be considered and addressed in individual cases; provide for the adoption and application of general binding rules to replace individual licence conditions for certain categories of licensable activity; and provide for the EPA in determining licences to have regard to national or sectoral ceilings for emissions of pollutants or greenhouse gases.</P>
      <P>The integrated pollution control and waste licensing regimes administered by EPA under the 1992 and 1996 Acts are well-established and substantially in line with the provisions of the IPPC directive. The amendments outlined are technical refinements to the legislative basis of both regimes in order to bring them fully into line with the directive.</P>
      <P>I also propose to take the opportunity to include in the Bill a number of amendments to strengthen the Litter Pollution Act, 1997, details of which I hope to announce shortly.</P>

      <P>Forecasts of road noise levels are included in all environmental impact statements for major road schemes. Objections can be made on a wide range of grounds to proposed road developments, including the impact of increased noise, and objectors may raise their concerns at a public inquiry. The approval process for road projects, now operated by the Minister for the Environment and Local <Col N="1560" /> Government, but soon to be transferred to An Bord Pleanála, can require modifications to be made to the scheme in relation, <i>inter alia</i>, to noise mitigation, and such modifications have been imposed as required.</P>
      <P>In relation to British standards, it is the practice that they are used in Ireland as the basis for noise forecasting and calculation.

      <P>A flat stamp duty rate of 9% applies to purchases of new and second-hand residential properties bought by investors, while graduated scales of rates apply for first-time buyers and owner-occupiers purchasing for their own occupation. The changes made in June of this year were in response to evidence of speculative demand in the housing market which was operating to exclude some first-time purchasers. More recently, there is evidence that first-time purchasers are gaining an increasing share of the new house market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 251 and 252 together.</P>
      <P>The office of county or city planner only exists in Dublin and Cork cities and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, Fingal, and South Dublin counties. I understand that proposals currently under discussion in Cork city and the Dublin counties involve the suppression of the city and county planning officer posts in favour of the creation of new senior management posts of director of services with a wider management remit and I support this approach.</P>
      <P>The new structures proposed will not result in any diminution in the level or quality of the planning advice available to local authorities. Under the new arrangements, the planning function will be headed up by a director of service at management level who will oversee both the technical and administrative staff. The new structures will have adequate numbers of senior planning staff to deal with technical matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of planning applications made to each county and county borough area for each of the years 1995-1999 as published in my Department's annual Planning Statistics publication are set out in a table attached. The data for each county council includes the data for the urban district councils and borough corporations.</P>
      <P>With regard to staffing, my Department's Planning Statistics publication includes figures for the number of technical, i.e. planners, technicians, etc., and administrative staff in planning authorities by county and city area and the data for the years 1995-1999 is set out in a table attached. The table shows that overall staffing levels increased from 1,033 in 1995 to 1,309 in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As outlined in the reply to Question No. 346 of 17 October 2000, a number of measures have been taken to ensure an increase in the availability of professional planners in the planning system. My Department has written to planning authorities on a number of occasions asking that they consider the adequacy of their professional-technical and administrative/clerical staffing in <Col N="1562" /> order to ensure that the planning system does not cause bottlenecks in meeting demand and delivers the best possible service to the customer. While my Department has approved requests from planning authorities for sanction for additional professional planner posts, I am aware that some authorities have experienced difficulties in recruiting to fill these additional posts. However, an additional 64 planners were employed by the local authorities between March and July of this year.</P>
    <P>In June of this year, I made the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 2000, which increased the size of exempted domestic extensions from 23 square metres to 40 square metres. This was designed to remove about 30% of planning applications for such extensions from the planning system in major urban areas, to allow planners to concentrate on forward planning issues.</P>
    <P>I have been in contact with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, and the third level education sector with a view to identifying ways of producing more planners through the education system. As a result, from September of this year new and expanded courses in University College Dublin and Dublin Institute of Technology, Bolton Street will treble the output of graduate planners in two years time to approximately 75 planners graduating per annum. Further additional courses are also under consideration.</P>
    <P>In the interim, to meet the short-term demand, the possibility of employing planners from abroad on fixed term contracts is being examined. My Department will also pursue with the local authorities and the Local Government computer services board the use of information technology to streamline planning procedures.</P>
    <P>With regard to financial resources, it is a matter for each planning authority to determine its own expenditure requirements in the context of its annual estimates. Expenditure arising in relation to planning would be dealt with by local authorities in this estimates context. Such expenditure is funded from a variety of sources including the local government fund and other State grants, rates and fees and charges. Planning fees were increased in 1998 and the Department wrote to planning authorities at that time asking them to consider the possibility of employing more professional planners. For future provisions from the local government fund, regard will be had to the resource implications of the Planning and Development Act, 2000.</P>

      <P>At present driving test candidates must be able to demonstrate that they are able to perform standard driving manoeuvres in safety in normal traffic situations. Candidates are expected to take all the necessary precautions, including observing potential or actual risks, showing due respect for other road users and reacting appropriately in actual risk situations should circumstances demand.</P>
      <P>Candidates are, <i>inter alia,</i> assessed on their ability to observe and to react to situations that arise in the course of the practical driving test. Such situations would include observing and reacting correctly to motorcyclists and cyclists. The driver theory test to be introduced next year will, among other matters, test the candidates' knowledge of their responsibility towards other road users including specific risk factors related to vulnerable categories of road users, including cyclists.</P>

      <P>My Department, in association with the Dublin Transportation Office, has published a design manual for pedal cycle facilities entitled Provision of cycle facilities &ndash; National Manual for Urban Areas, 1998, which was circulated to all local authorities. The manual includes advice in relation to the provision of advanced stop lines which may be provided in conjunction with cycle tracks for the exclusive use of pedal cyclists at traffic light controlled road junctions. Regulations to provide for the provision of advanced stop lines in association with cycle tracks were made in July 1998. The provision of such facilities gives dedicated room to cyclists to wait in front of all other traffic and enhances their safety by allowing them to start crossing the junction before motorised traffic.</P>
      <P>The use of advanced stop lines is particularly suitable for pedal cyclists making right turning movements and for straight-ahead traffic where cycle volumes are high. Motorcyclists, on the other hand, have more power than pedal cyclists and can maintain their position to a larger degree in the traffic stream and so are not at risk in the same way. There are no proposals to extend the use of advanced stop lines to motorcycles.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if he will increase the national fuel allowance from £5 per week to a more reasonable amount in the context of the forthcoming budget.</Quest>
      <QRef>[23574/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid October to mid April regardless of the temperature. £8 per week is paid in smokeless zones.</P>
      <P>The fuel schemes were reviewed in 1998 as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The group concluded that the present rates of payment should remain unchanged if improvements in primary payment rates fully compensated recipients for all price inflation, including fuel price inflation. Increasing primary payments gives people greater flexibility in meeting their needs and, of course, the increased rates are payable for all 52 weeks of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that regard, substantial increases in all the social welfare primary payments of either £4 or £7 came into effect at the beginning of May 2000, a month earlier than last year. In addition, the qualified adult allowance was increased by amounts ranging from £3.80 for people on disability benefit, £4.70 for old age contributory and retirement pensioners and £8.50 for invalidity <Col N="1568" /> pensioners where the qualified adult is aged 66 years or over.</P>
    <P>Fuel price inflation was much lower than general price inflation up to last year, with an overall cumulative increase of less than 10% over the 14 years between 1985, when the current rate was set, and last year. However, fuel prices have risen sharply recently. An increase of almost 7.9% was recorded in the fuel and light component of the consumer price index in the 12 months up to last August.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the extent to which general price inflation, including fuel price inflation, is impacting on the significant improvements in social welfare payments which I have made. The Deputy will know that I cannot give specific details of the measures that will be contained in this year's budget but improving the overall position of social welfare recipients will receive a very high priority in that budget.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I would point out that fuel allowances are not the sole mechanism through which assistance is provided to people with heating needs. There is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>
    <P>Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment. Exceptional needs payments are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.  </P>

      <P>Supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, is paid to every person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The fact that they might previously have been in receipt of another social welfare allowance that has been discontinued is not recorded, as this is not material to their entitlement to SWA. Consequently, the information sought by the Deputy is not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Information is available in relation to the number of people who are paid SWA while awaiting the outcome of an appeal against a disallowance of either disability benefit, unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance. This includes appeals made by people whose initial claim was rejected with no payment having been made, as <Col N="1569" /> well as appeals in cases where payments were made and subsequently discontinued.</P>
    <P>On 20 October last there were 1,109 people in this situation. A table is attached showing the number of people over the past 12 months who <Col N="1570" /> received supplementary welfare allowance while they were awaiting the outcome of an appeal against a disallowance of either disability benefit, unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.</P>

      <Quest>if there are plans to integrate transport in rural areas provided for school transport, health board other than acute ambulance transport, free travel for the elderly and buses and minibuses provided to voluntary organisations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The free travel scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by semi-State companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as services provided by some 75 private transport operators. The vast majority of these private contractors operate in rural areas. My Department is always willing to consider further applications from licensed private transport operators who may wish to participate in the free travel scheme.</P>
      <P>A review of the free schemes was published in April this year by the Policy Institute, Trinity College Dublin. The review considered the difficulties involved in access to public transport services. In this regard it notes that there are two </P>
      <P>main groups affected: those who have a disability which prevents them using the service and those for whom a service does not exist, which mainly affects those living in rural areas. This problem is part of a wider social and infrastructure problem affecting all those who are disadvantaged and who can neither afford their own transport nor avail of access to public transport.</P>
      <P>The report notes that while my Department pays transport providers to operate the free travel scheme, the scheme itself cannot provide services where none exist, nor is it in a position to provide vehicles accessible to people with disabilities. These are matters for the transport providers concerned and for my colleague the Minister for Public Enterprise who has responsibility for public transport. Similarly, my Department has no remit in the integration of different transport providers.</P>
      <P>However, the review of the free schemes does recommend that a social transport fund be supported and made available to voluntary and community based organisations for the provision of local transport initiatives that would be unlikely to operate without a subsidy. Such a fund would be mainly social in nature and could facilitate the provision of wheelchair accessible vehicles. The review considered it appropriate that such a fund could be managed locally, perhaps by the local authorities, in view of their knowledge of local services and to maintain community autonomy.</P>
      <P>The recommendations made in the review are being examined in the context of future budgets and available resources.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if he will address the anomaly for means-testing of REP scheme payments whereby those in receipt of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit and farm assist can disregard the first £2,000 REPS money but those on disability allowance are means-tested on this amount; if those in receipt of disability allowance could be approved a back-payment to the date when the disregard of REPS money was first introduced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the disregard of income arising under the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, was originally introduced in 1996, it was confined to those social assistance schemes which were considered to be of most direct relevance to farmers, i.e. unemployment assistance, smallholders assistance, pre-retirement allowance and old age, non-contributory, pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the introduction last year of a specific farm-related income support payment scheme, i.e. the farm assist scheme, it was considered more appropriate to confine, as far as possible, all farm related exemptions and incentives to this <Col N="1573" /> scheme. The existing REPS disregard has, therefore, been applied to this new scheme.</P>
    <P>The REPS disregard is not relevant in the case of the unemployment benefit scheme, as this is a social insurance payment and is not, therefore, subject to a means test.</P>
    <P>While the REPS disregard does not apply in the case of the other social assistance schemes, it should be noted that many of these schemes already have their own separate income disregards which would apply to REPS payments. For instance, under the disability allowance scheme, the first £75 of weekly earnings from rehabilitative employment is disregarded for means test purposes. This disregard was extended to earnings from rehabilitative self-employment from April of this year and this means that it now applies to income from REPS payments.</P>

      <Quest>the number of people in County Mayo who have been refused unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance in 2000 on the grounds that they are not genuinely seeking work; the number of these who have submitted an appeal; and the number where these appeals have been finalised, giving details of the number of cases which were allowed and disallowed.</Quest>

The corresponding national figure was 8,889.</P>
      <P>Records held in local offices in County Mayo show that from 1 January 2000 to 31 August 2000 a total of 151 decisions relating to people genuinely seeking work and who were available for work were appealed to the social welfare appeals office. As at 3 October 2000, 99 of these cases had been finalised and returned to the local offices, of whom 16 had their appeals allowed, 81 were disallowed and two claimants withdrew their appeals.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme is administered on my Department's behalf by the health boards. An interdepartmental committee is currently <Col N="1574" /> reviewing the scheme as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations.</P>
      <P>The current review is a fundamental appraisal of the scheme aimed at improving customer service and administrative efficiency. It also provides an opportunity to re-focus the scheme, and the health boards' community welfare service of which it is part, to become more effective in tackling poverty and social exclusion.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 265 and 266 together.</P>
      <P>Under social welfare legislation decisions on claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions. However, I have inquired into the situation and the following is the position.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of disability benefit of £80.50 per week from my Department. He is also in receipt of rent supplement of £35 per week from the Eastern Regional Health Authority. His spouse receives lone parent's allowance in respect of herself and a dependent child. Between them, they are in receipt of the maximum amount payable by my Department to a couple in their circumstances.</P>
      <P>The person concerned applied to the Eastern Regional Health Authority for payment of supplementary welfare allowance in February 2000 arising from a court order which directs him to pay £15 per week towards the upkeep of his children. His application was refused on the grounds that he was already in receipt of disability benefit at a rate above the basic rate of supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
      <P>The person appealed this decision to the Eastern Regional Health Authority and his appeal was disallowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1575" /> His subsequent appeal to the social welfare appeals office was considered by an appeals officer and, following an oral hearing on 7 June 2000, his appeal was disallowed. The person was notified of the decision on 5 July 2000. It was drawn to his attention that it was open to him to seek a variation in the court order in the light of his circumstances.</P>
    <P>I understand that in the light of representations made by the Deputy inquires are being made by the health board as to the present position in regard to the court order.</P>
    <P>The free fuel allowance is payable to persons dependent on long-term social welfare payments. The person concerned is in receipt of short-term disability benefit which includes a weekly allowance of £3 towards the extra cost of smokeless fuel.</P>

      <P>Lands at Commons East, Woodford, County Galway, lie within Slieve Aughty Bog which was proposed for designation as a natural heritage area, pNHA, in 1995 and were subsequently advertised as a proposed candidate special area of conservation, pcSAC. Some commonage is included within the site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The site was re-examined as part of my Department's on-going review of all proposed sites and <Col N="1576" /> was delisted as a pcSAC as it was felt that the fragmented blanket bog contained therein did not justify SAC status. It was concluded however that the area should be retained as a proposed natural heritage area.</P>

      <P>To date, a representative of the named landowner has made in excess of 20 requests under the Freedom of Information Act. Most have been answered but three are currently being proposed, following clarification of certain requests with the requester. If the landowner is unhappy with any of the replies received she has the option of having her requests examined at a higher level within the Department or she may refer them to the Information Commissioner.</P>
      <P>The person named informally appealed against the designation of her lands. The appeal was not granted on internal review by Dúchas. She was afforded and accepted the opportunity to have her case referred to the SAC appeals advisory board. The appeal is currently with the board. As the board considers appeals independently and then advises me, I am unable to comment on any deliberations which may be taking place at the board concerning this appeal in advance of receiving their advice.</P>

      <P>I am aware of ongoing representations from schools for increased funding, including for the reasons referred to by the Deputy. Grant aid towards school funding costs is provided by my Department by way of capitation grants. The day to day running of schools, including matters such as heating, is a matter for school managerial authorities.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding many competing demands on budgetary resources, the capitation grant at primary level has been increased substantially since the Government assumed office in 1997. It has been increased from the £45 per pupil that applied in 1997 to the £64 per pupil that was issued to schools this year. In addition, the grant will be increased by a further £7 in the current school year which will bring the standard level of the grant to £71 per pupil. This constitutes an increase of 65% in the level of the standard capitation grant over that period. Furthermore, an additional grant of £30 per pupil is paid in respect of all pupils of schools designated as disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>At second level, the standard <i>per capita </i>was increased to £184 from £177 last year and has been further increased by £8 from September this year to £192. In addition, a grant of £30 per pupil is paid in respect of pupils enrolled in schools designated as disadvantaged. It would not be feasible for any Department to introduce specific schemes whereby grant assistance would be provided to schools in respect of individual charges such as the cost of oil. However, I am satisfied that the increases in the capitation grants referred to above constitute a meaningful response to the need for increased funding for schools. I am committed to improving further the funding position of primary and second level schools in the context of forthcoming budgets and in light of available resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's responsibility is to ensure that the school transport scheme operates in an efficient and cost effective manner. It primarily operates a basic service countrywide, for the most part in rural areas. There are at present no plans to use school buses for other purposes during the day. I am aware of at least one area in which this approach is taken in the community. I would be very happy if similar arrangements could be made in other communities and I would be anxious to be of assistance where possible.</P>
      <P>To expand the scheme generally to support rural community transport services would raise some practical difficulties. A high proportion of the vehicles used for school transport are contracted by Bus Éireann from private operators. The use of these buses, after they have completed their school contracts, would be a matter for the private operators. The vehicles deployed by Bus Éireann are operated by part-time employees who are contracted to do school work only. In addition, school buses operate for a maximum of 183 days per year. These current limitations on the operation of school buses would have to be expanded greatly, and at considerable expense, to diversify into other community services.</P>
      <P>The size and type of vehicle used for school transport is determined by the number of eligible pupils offering for transport and its legal carrying capacity. If public passengers were permitted to avail of transport on such services, these arrangements would have to be reviewed.</P>
      <P>Individual vehicles are generally required to operate more than one service and this frequently means that some pupils have to make an early start in the mornings and to wait for some time in the evenings. This has always been a feature of the services throughout the country. This could give rise to problems for other potential users who might see this as of very limited benefit.</P>

      <P>The operational arrangements relating to the assessment and certification of apprentices under the standards based apprenticeship system, as agreed by all relevant groups, was set out in a letter from my Department to the various institutes of technology in December 1995. The assessment arrangements for phase 4 apprentices consist of two separate occasions of testing. Because some institutes have conducted both of these occasions of testing at the end of phase 4 of TUI, on behalf of its members, are seeking examination payments in respect of this testing on the basis that such testing constitutes a terminal examination.</P>
      <P>Circular Letter IT 9/99, dated 6 August 1999, instructed institutes of technology to ensure that they adhere in future to the procedures agreed in 1995. Specifically they were instructed to ensure that there would not be any terminal examination at the end of phase 4. As an exceptional measure, in the interests of resolving the matter, my Department authorised institutes to make a once off examination payment in the 1998-99 academic year where examinations had taken place at the end of phase 4.</P>
      <P>Since Circular Letter IT 9/99 was issued my Department has been in contact on a number of occasions with the institutes of technology involved in the apprenticeship programme and has met with representatives of the TUI in an effort to resolve the dispute.</P>
      <P>Most recently, my Department wrote to the TUI on 15 September proposing that the union withdraw the instruction to its members regarding the submission of results for phase 4 assessments pending the outcome of an external syllabus review for phases 4 and 6 which has been initiated. In this letter it was pointed out that, arising from this review, the current assessment system for phases 4 and 6 may need to be modified to take into account syllabus changes and new practice in a number of trades. The TUI has not acceded to this request.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that this dispute will delay the progress of certain apprentices in completing their studies and am anxious that a satisfactory resolution be found as a matter of urgency. Efforts to resolve the dispute are ongoing.</P>

      <P>The National University of Ireland, Galway, is an approved institution, for tax relief purposes, under a number of provisions.</P>
      <P>Section 15 of the Finance Act, 1996, provides for tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, on tuition fees paid in respect of students attending approved part-time under-graduate courses of at least two years duration at colleges approved for the higher education grant scheme.</P>
      <P>Section 21 of the Finance Act, 2000, provides for the introduction of tax relief, from the 2000-2001 academic year, for post-graduate fees paid in respect of approved courses in publicly funded colleges here and in other EU member states, as well as in private colleges in this State. This new relief, which applies at the standard rate of tax, is available to full-time and part-time post-graduate students.</P>
      <P>Further details and application forms to claim tax relief on tuition fees are available from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>Tax relief is not available in respect of fees paid for full-time under-graduate courses in publicly funded third level colleges, including the National University of Ireland, Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1587" /> A number of other schemes are in operation which provide measures of tax relief in the third level sector.</P>
    <P>Section 485 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides for tax relief on gifts made by private individuals or companies to approved third level education institutions, including NUI Galway, for specified projects &ndash; mainly the undertaking of research, the acquisition of equipment and the provision of facilities designed to increase student numbers in areas of skills needs.</P>
    <P>Section 843 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides for tax-based relief for financing packages involving the construction, sale and leaseback of capital investments, buildings and equipment, considered to be of particular importance in approved third level education institutions, including NUI Galway, where the institution has obtained not less than half the funding from private sources.</P>
    <P>Section 50 of the Finance Act, 1999, was introduced to mitigate the impact on the student population of current supply pressures in the private rented sector by providing tax incentives for the provision of rented residential accommodation in the third level sector. This relief will be available under the legislation for expenditure up to 31 March 2003 and allows investors to offset 100% of the costs of construction, conversion or refurbishment of purpose built student accommodation against all rental income over a maximum period of ten years.</P>
    <P>My Department is unable to trace any record of receiving the Deputy's letter of 27 July 2000. I wish, however, to confirm receipt of his letter, dated 8 September 2000, which was acknowledged on 12 October 2000.</P>

      <P>The change introduced by Circular 11/79 does not mean that, from 1980 onwards, a candidate had to secure a pass in one subject rather than in four for the purposes of award of the art teachers' certificate.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the terms of Circular Letter 11/79 full-time students had the option of making a submission on one of the main areas of study &ndash; drawing, painting, sculpture, design, craft &ndash; and to submit a personal source diary and a thesis or making a submission in a main area of study, which could straddle more than one area as designated, in addition to subsidiary areas of study together with a personal source diary and a thesis.</P>
      <P>The circular also stated that, as drawing was a basic tool in art, it should be an integral part of any submission under either option.</P>
      <P>Under this revised process, a full-time student, whose work was being assessed, had to show a fuller expertise of acquired skills and a more developed and complete accomplishment in his-her work.

A higher standard of attainment was required in line with the established art education norms of that time.</P>
