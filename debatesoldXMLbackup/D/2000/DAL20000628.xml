      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with two different topics. I propose to deal with these two topics separately and I will call Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office. In regard to the first topic, I received notice from Deputy Joe Higgins and I now call on him to state the matter.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Under Standing Order 31, I seek leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil on this following issue of urgent public importance, which is, the threat of imminent layoffs of workers in certain industries and ongoing hardship for thousands of commuters arising from the dispute in Iarnród Éireann and the continuing refusal of Iarnród Éireann management to engage in dialogue with the Irish Locomotives Drivers' Association which represents 48% of full-time train drivers in the State.</P>

      <P>Under Standing Order 31, I seek leave to move that the Dáil be suspended in order to address the following issue of urgent public importance, namely, the questions which still remain following the former Supreme Court judge, Hugh O'Flaherty's, media interview regarding the procedures adopted by the Judiciary and especially as the relevant Dáil committee has now abdicated its responsibility to have former Justice O'Flaherty answer questions and the fact that the Government, in particular, has to account for its actions to the Dáil on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 23, motion re appointment of Ombudsman; No. 45, the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 2000 [<i>Seanad</i>], Order for Report and Report and Final Stages; No. 46, the Electronic Commerce Bill, 2000 [<i>Seanad</i>], Second Stage (Resumed) and No. 1, the Harbours (Amendment) Bill, 2000 [<i>Seanad</i>], Second Stage.</P>
      <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. and business shall be interrupted not later than 10.30 p.m.; (2) No. 23, shall be decided without debate; (3) Report and Final Stages of No. 45 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 6.30 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and (4) Second Stage of No. 46 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 10.30 p.m. Private Members' business shall be No. 101, motion re Government Policies (Resumed) to conclude at 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not agreed. It is only required because this Government is running away from the Dáil and does not want to sit next week, does not want the Dáil to consider next week the outcome of the Taoiseach's appearance at the tribunal and does not want the Dáil to consider the Tánaiste's total lack of accountability to this House for her appalling misjudgments.</P>

The fact the rail strike is continuing without any visible intervention from the Minister or without even any outrage in this House shows how this Government and this House are completely distracted by sleaze, and will conmtinue to be, as long as this Government continues in office.

The latest tragic suicide in Wheatfield Prison, where the deceased was in jail for road traffic offences, brings to nine the number of deaths in prisons in the past 18 months.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 3, to delete &ldquo;or Good Friday&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>For a long period it has been illegal to sell intoxicating liquor in public houses, off-licensed premises and restaurants on Good Friday. This is perfectly understandable given the strong Christian ethos and tradition within the country. The argument I put to the Minister on Committee Stage and on which he volunteered to reflect was that, given that the nature of Irish society is changing and evolving to the point where there are now resident in the State persons from a variety of cultures and with different religious beliefs and none, all of whom should be cherished equally within our legal system, it is an anomaly to retain this provision which provides for closure on Good Friday. My colleague, Deputy Barnes, made the valid point that a growing number of people visit this country for the Easter break and that many of them regard it as an anomaly that public houses and clubs are closed on Good Friday.</P>
      <P>The Minister is very sensitive, as I am, to the commemoration of Good Friday and the Easter celebrations in general, a time of extraordinary importance to the overwhelming majority of people living on the island but their adherence to or understanding of their religious beliefs would not be in any way diminished if the law of the land allowed others to take a drink in a public house on Good Friday. It is inevitable that this will change. On Committee Stage the Minister indicated that he would not be anxious to run back to the House with a new Bill. It might be some time therefore before we have another opportunity to achieve this objective. This is the opportune time to make the change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister has had an opportunity to reflect further on the matter. From the list of amendments tabled, I know he has responded positively to a number of the amendments tabled by me on Committee Stage. Alas he has not spoken to these amendments. Either he is minded to leave things as they are or he is <Col N="582" /> minded to accept the amendments. I await his comments with anxiety. This is an issue of some importance. It would be an indication of our maturity that we can accommodate different views and do not need to legislate from one religious perspective. As we are all aware, even the most religious and fervent of Christians often look for ways to circumvent the law which provides for closure. They do not consider that this diminishes or demeans the importance and significance of Good Friday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments seek to permit licensed premises and premises to which special restaurant licences are attached to open on Good Friday as if it were an ordinary day of the year. If the amendment was successful it would not extend this concession to registered clubs and thereby it would create an anomaly as to the current practice. Good Friday is one of the two &ldquo;closed&rdquo; days in the year in relation to the licensing laws. It is the only day of the year on which licensed premises are expected to remain closed for the sale of intoxicating liquor under any circumstances.</P>
      <P>There are certain traditional aspects to the licensing laws which command significant support in the community and there is good reason not to provide for change in the area. The joint Oireachtas sub-committee on the licensing laws was of the view that there should not be a change to the law concerning Good Friday. The Government accepts and supports that view. Some might say that the business sector, particularly shops and supermarkets, has changed during the years in relation to Good Friday. However, we should not equate the licensing sector with those sectors.</P>
      <P>While I am not prepared to accept an amendment with regard to the sale of intoxicating liquor on Good Friday, I have relaxed the provisions with regard to the sale of non-licensed goods for those premises which engage in mixed trading and removed all restrictions on the sale of non-licensed goods. This effectively means that premises will be able to open at any time on any day, including Good Friday, to engage in the business of selling groceries or other non-alcoholic products. Consequently I regret that I cannot support the amendments proposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to push the point further. I thought this was the opportune time to table the amendment which was included in the Labour Party Bill tabled by my predecessor and much missed colleague, the late Deputy Pat Upton. It will eventually be made. If the Minister is not minded to think that the moment is now, there is no point in pursuing the matter further and I will withdraw the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="583" /> Amendment No. 2 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 21, to delete &ldquo;11.00 p.m.&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;11.30 p.m.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The import of this amendment is to regularise closing hours by providing for two rather than three regimes. This will mean including Sunday under the regime applying to Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. The Bill proposes a stand-alone closing time for Sunday. The Minister has said the Taoiseach holds the view that, somehow, an extra 30 minutes opening on Sunday would incapacitate the workforce. That is not convincing.</P>
      <P>There should be as little variety as possible with regard to closing times. Part 2 is the most convoluted part of any Bill I have read. A water diviner and soothsayer would be required to work out when it is possible to open to sell intoxicating liquor. We should do our best to rationalise these provisions. The extra half hour opening proposed in the amendment is not of such earth-shattering importance that it would damage the Bill, or hit the economy or productivity because people might drink an extra pint, leading to mass absenteeism on Monday.</P>
      <P>Previously the Minister made a nanny-type response to this proposal. For the sake of simplicity there is no point in having three closing time regimes, two is enough. The argument in favour of this proposal was put on Committee Stage. It makes sense and there is little merit in the argument made by the Minister. Perhaps on mature reflection, he has had the opportunity to conclude that the simpler formula of two closing time regimes is preferable and that he will accept the amendment.</P>

        <b>:</b> I do not understand how the Minister can stand over the proposal to have three different closing times in a seven day period. It is proposed that closing time will be 11.30 p.m. to 12 midnight on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday; 12.30 a.m. to 1 a.m. on Thursday and Friday and 11 p.m. on Sunday night. That will be inoperable and it will be flouted. The Minister's argument that the impact of later closing time on Sunday will affect workers on Monday morning does not add up. It has already been acknowledged that closing time on Thursday will be 12.30 a.m. to 1 a.m., even though Friday is a working day. If it does not have an impact on Friday, how can it be argued that having everybody out of the pub by 12 midnight on Sunday will adversely affect the numbers turning up for work on Monday morning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is sensible. The provision in the Bill has not been fully thought through. Publicans have also questioned how it is proposed to police three different closing times &ndash; 11.30 p.m. to 12 midnight, 12.30 p.m. to 1 a.m. and 11 p.m. &ndash; within a seven day period. The Minister has been sensible in relation to closing times. He <Col N="584" /> should relent on this aspect and accept that two closing time regimes within a seven day period should be the maximum provided for by the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to permit licensed premises to remain open until 11.30 p.m. plus 30 minutes drinking up time on normal Sundays. I again emphasise that the issue of Sunday opening hours has been given very careful consideration by the Government. One consideration is the high rate of absenteeism in the labour force on Monday mornings. The consumption of alcohol on Sunday nights is a related factor to the rate of absenteeism the next morning. On Second and Committee Stages, Deputies pointed out that Friday was also a working day and that opening hours were being extended considerably on Thursday nights. However, many employers maintain that absenteeism on Friday mornings is not a major problem, but that it is on Monday mornings because it follows the weekend, a natural break in the working week for many.</P>
      <P>During the debate in the Seanad, reference was made to the fact that a number of factories in urban areas have had to reschedule their shifts on Monday mornings to take account of absenteeism. Excessive drinking over the weekend, especially on Sundays, is undoubtedly a contributing factor. If I decided to accept the amendment with regard to Sunday, I would only accentuate the problem of absenteeism. I have already put on record the Taoiseach's strong views on this point. He believes that to extend those hours would increase absenteeism in the workforce and would not be in the best interests of society.</P>
      <P>As I said before, it is extremely difficult to obtain consensus on reform of the licensing laws, particularly with regard to permitted hours. When legislating in this area there is a need to maintain a correct balance that reflects not only the legitimate commercial concerns of the different groups in the trade, but also the interests of society as a whole. With regard to the issue of permitted hours in general, I have achieved an unprecedented level of consensus on what would be suitable opening hours for licensed premises. The package of permitted hours proposed in the Bill represents the greatest level of consensus, not just from within the trade and among customers, but also in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most reasonable people would agree that the package of measures relating to hours provided in the Bill is remarkable in that it has already found general acceptance and is, therefore, workable. I accept that not every single licence holder or every member of the drinking and non-drinking public would be happy with every aspect of the package, but as a general scheme of permitted hours it represents the most acceptable package. The Bill already provides for a considerable extension of the licensing hours, including the abolition of the 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. closing on Sunday afternoon. I am not prepared to extend Sunday <Col N="585" /> opening beyond the existing hours. Sunday closing will be 11 p.m. with a half hour drinking up time the whole year round.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have stated, I will not support the amendment. Deputy Jim Higgins said it would be impossible to police the hours set out in the legislation because there will be three different regimes in respect of opening and closing. Deputy Howlin made the same point.</P>

There will be three different regimes in any event because Sunday opening is 12.30 p.m. while normal opening during the week is 10.30 a.m. We all accept it would be impossible to propose hours of opening that would be acceptable to all. I did not engage in nannyism, to use Deputy Howlin's phrase. Nannyism is not a trait of my character. I tried to consult as much as I could. An Oireachtas joint committee considered the matter in great detail. In that regard I have acknowledged the enormous contribution made by all parties to the legislation. I have also acknowledged the enormous contribution made by outside groups. Not only would it be far too doubtful, but nobody would accept any suggestion on my part that I am a repository of full knowledge on this subject.</P>

      <P>All one can do is put forward what appeared to be the consensus that emerged from the Oireachtas joint committee and the groups I met over a two and a half to three year period. There are as many different opinions on what the legislation should provide for in terms of correct opening hours as there are varieties of drink. There is no way we will fully agree on what the opening hours should be. All I can do is to reflect the consensus as best I can, and that is what I have sought to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response. On Committee Stage we asked him to provide data on the direct correlation between absenteeism and the licensing hours, and on how this important half-hour will be the bridgehead which will safeguard the productivity of the economy. The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, stated that the evidence was anecdotal or that he was told that there was significant absenteeism and somebody somewhere had made the connection that absenteeism on Mondays had to do with drinking on Sundays as opposed to conflict in the home because the husband is at home on Sundays, sporting injuries or other matters which could arise. The Minister has decided that the anecdotal evidence of which he is aware is accurate. More importantly, the Taoiseach believes it and he has more clout than a majority which can be cobbled together here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see the empirical data which states that that half-hour of drinking time on Sun<Col N="586" /> days would have an impact on productivity and absenteeism. I have seen no such analysis from any source to date but in the intervening couple of days perhaps the Minister has had an opportunity to find that data and will present it to us today.</P>
    <P>My other point has to do with the changing nature of the economy. This is not the 1950s, when most people worked from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Monday to Friday and had Saturday and Sunday off. The Minister knows well that his working hours are not confined to such a regime. For a growing number of people the 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday regime does not apply. They work shifts and weekends.</P>

        <b>:</b> I genuinely believe that is the case. We must take a common sense approach to putting in place a regime which will be with us for the next 20 years. There will be chaos, confusion and charges because it will be hard to say to somebody that on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays closing time will be 11.30 p.m. with 30 minutes drinking up time, on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays closing time will be 12.30 a.m. with 30 minutes drinking up time and on Sundays the red card will be shown at 11 p.m. It simply will not work.</P>
      <P>The Minister has relented on a number of amendments and indicated that he would be prepared to consider others at this Stage. I cannot understand why he will not do what he knows is right. The Taoiseach has obviously looked at the Bill and made some kind of <i>prima facie</i> determination on it. It is the Taoiseach's diktat rather than the Minister's common sense which is being applied on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essentially a good Bill. This is a fundamental issue. The publicans, hotel owners and restaurant owners do not see how three closing times <Col N="587" /> in a seven day period can be operated in a sensible manner. It is inoperable. Again I would ask the Minister to do what he believes in his heart is right, that is, to confine it to two closing times. I would suggest that closing time on Sundays should be the same as that on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. It should be an early closing time, in other words everybody should be off the premises at 12 o'clock. If the Minister accepts the amendment, there will be no trespassing on Monday mornings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>Most people work on Thursdays but most people do not work on Sundays. There is a far greater amount of time available to people to go drinking on Sundays than on Thursdays. We all know that, unfortunately, there is a small minority of people who go out after Mass or lunch on Sundays and do not arrive home until closing time. These are facts. There are other people who drink more on Sundays than they would normally. Of course, I am not saying that the vast majority of the population do so, but there is a minority of people who do that and no doubt employers accept that absenteeism is a problem on Monday mornings more than on any other day of the week. I do not have empirical research for that but I know it to be true, and I think Deputies Higgins and Howlin know it to be true also.</P>
      <P>The position is that there is plenty of time for drinking. We are giving until 12.30 a.m. on Thursdays with 30 minutes drinking up time and the same on Fridays and Saturdays. For goodness sake, it is not asking a great deal that we would leave closing time on Sunday as it is. I do not see the Deputies' difficulty with that.</P>
      <P>I cannot go any further than that. I stress that there is no repository of knowledge which could be Solomonic &ndash; it does not exist and I accept that. I am just putting forward what I regard as a common sense view. It happens to be the view of the Taoiseach and many others. It is also the view of the vast majority of employers and a considerable number in society. People will have different views on this. There is no perfect solution. If there were, I feel certain that somebody would have thought of it by now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because it is not worth labouring the point when the Minister has <Col N="588" /> a closed mind on it, but it is unnecessarily confusing to have a third regime of closing hours for the sake of a half-hour. It would have been much simpler to have Sundays, Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays falling into one slot and Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays falling into a second slot in order that people would know where they stood.</P>
      <P>Sunday is an important day for families. Often families go out to dinner, to the theatre or to a film on a Sunday night and the notion of being able subsequently to go for a drink sounds eminently reasonable. On these lovely bright evenings &ndash; long may they last &ndash; people might go out to the beach on Sunday afternoons, come home and make dinner, and then decide to go out. The tourism industry depends on that.</P>
      <P>This seems unnecessarily restrictive. The Minister has a closed mind in this regard and, therefore, there is no point in arguing, but it is not good enough for him to state that &ldquo;I believe this to be a fact but I do not have the data to prove it&rdquo;, that it is anecdotal or somebody says it is so.</P>
      <P>Considering the amount of work done in preparation for this Bill, which was a long time in gestation and the enactment of which was promised this time last year, at least the premises on which we base our decisions should be sustainable. The Minister's statement that he knows the view of employers or that he has a view on it is not good enough to convince somebody that it should be the case.</P>
      <P>Ireland has changed and people's working hours are different. We should not have a 1950s regime which reflects a work pattern which increasingly is not relevant to a majority of people. This is one of the issues which, no doubt, we will revisit. It is not of huge moment but acceptance of the amendment would add to the simplicity of the Bill and of the licensing regime, which is convoluted enough if one reads the section to which I refer. I regret that he will not do so and I certainly intend to press it.</P>

        <b>:</b> I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(1C) The provisions of this section shall operate for a period not exceeding two years <Col N="589" /> from the date of their enactment, during which time an impact study shall be conducted in order to measure the personal, medical, domestic, economic and social effects of the extended trading hours to assist in determining if the provisions of this section are to be renewed.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is the nub of my concerns and those of many people about the implications for society of the extended drinking hours. One of the most impressive submissions made to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights when it held oral hearings was made by the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association, the thrust of which I agree with.</P>
    <P>Earlier this week, the Association of Secondary Teachers, Ireland, the representative body for secondary school teachers throughout the 26 counties, produced a report on the abuse and misuse of alcohol at secondary level. It pointed to something we have known to be the pattern over the past decade, namely, that the age threshold for first taking alcohol has now fallen to the pre-teens. We are now talking about 12 year olds in first year sampling alcohol. Vox pops confirm that trend.</P>
    <P>We have reached a stage where we are indulging ourselves in a culture of alcohol which is leading to wholesale social, economic and domestic desolation in this country. The consequences are obvious. Pupils at all stages in post-primary schools suffer hangovers on a Monday morning because of excessive intake of alcohol the previous night. Alcohol abuse is now of epidemic proportions. In the 1940s and 1950s, the epidemic which wrought havoc in society was tuberculosis. There is an equal if not greater threat now to the fabric of society from under age drinking, excessive intake of alcohol and alcohol abuse. It is eating into the fabric of society. The hooliganism, vandalism and domestic violence on Saturday and Sunday nights, the refuges to which women go who are regularly beaten up on Saturday and Sunday nights, and the increased demand for the services of the Legal Aid Board speak for themselves. These, along with the pressure on hospital wards and accident and emergency services at weekends, are alcohol-related in that they are caused by the abuse of alcohol.</P>
    <P>We need to get a grip on ourselves. Last Monday evening, I saw 50 youngsters in dress suits outside a pub preparing for their graduation. The dinner was not until 9 o'clock but they already had pints of Guinness, Heineken and other beers in their hands. One can only imagine what condition they would have been in by 9 o'clock not to speak of the condition they would have been in by 1 a.m. What sense of enjoyment is there in that? Have we completely lost the run of ourselves? We have a serious alcohol problem and we are not facing up to it. We put this forcefully to the unit in the Department of Health and Children charged with monitoring the alcohol problem but it is still only talking about mobilising and <Col N="590" /> organising and promoting an alcohol awareness campaign.</P>
    <P>Given the extended licensing hours proposed in the Bill, a review provision should be included to ensure that, after two years, we objectively examine the effects of the extended hours. We should measure the social, personal, medical and domestic consequences and the economic effects to see if the worst fears of a number of organisations, especially the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association, are realised.</P>
    <P>The Minister will probably say that including such a provision leaves the Bill open to review after two years. That is exactly what I intend. Last week, we debated the Offences against the State (Amendment) Bill to renew a provision we introduced two years ago in the wake of the Omagh bombing to ensure we continued to combat on an ongoing basis terrorism from paramilitaries who had not signed up to the peace process. If we can do that following the Omagh bombing and the Offences against the State (Amendment) Bill, I do not see why we cannot include a review provision for this Bill. In the interim, while the extended opening hours are in place, we should charge the unit in the Department of Health and Children with conducting an assessment and presenting a report to the House. If the effects are not as deleterious or damaging as people feared, we could then renew the provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems I am damned if I do and cursed if I do not. At least Deputy Higgins will be pleased that people will be home a half hour earlier on Sunday nights as a result of my refusal to accept his earlier amendment.</P>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to limit the life of the new package of opening times for all licensed premises and, I assume, registered clubs for a trial two year period. While the intention of the amendment advocated in the submission of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association is laudable, it is not practical. Most people agree that the range of permitted hours provided in the Bill is reasonable in that they cohere with public expectation and demand. If I had proposed in the Bill a full deregulation of opening hours allowing for 24 hour access to alcohol in licensed premises, I might see more merit in the proposal. As the Bill stands, the hours proposed reflect the market trend towards later socialising. The amendment would introduce a certain degree of uncertainty into the code and that would not be useful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. Furthermore, what result could be obtained from research work that would have to report on the personal, medical, domestic, economic and social effects of the new range of permitted hours in such a relatively short time frame? It would be extremely difficult to gain insights in such a short period as to the effects of the new hours as opposed to the exist<Col N="591" /> ing ones. In any event, I doubt this is an issue proper to legislation. The question of research into the negative aspects of alcohol consumption and the measures which need to be undertaken to limit those effects can be addressed outside the context of a licensing measure. They are, in effect, measures which fall to be addressed in the context of health promotion generally.</P>
      <P>In this context, the national alcohol policy is directed at reducing the prevalence of alcohol related problems through an emphasis on moderation in alcohol consumption. As alcohol problems are multi-dimensional, the policy sets out multi-sectoral solutions requiring both environmental and individual strategies. Since the publication of the policy, a number of elements of an action plan have been put in place. The most significant of these are the establishment of a national alcohol surveillance centre and a national lifestyle survey. In addition, an advertising campaign emphasising the message of moderation in drinking has been carried out and evaluated and a new campaign aimed at young, high risk drinkers is in the planning stage and research is being carried out on the impact of alcohol advertising on young people.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies expressed concern on Second Stage about the effects of the advertising of alcohol and the research now being carried out should provide important information on how to tackle the issue. Work is also ongoing on a number of the longer-term elements of the policy, including developing the school curriculum based on a life skills approach, development of health promotion policies for schools, hospitals, workplaces and campuses, which will include policies on alcohol use, discussions with the drinks industry and the development of responsible server training.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, intends to continue with the elements of the plan already commenced and to make progress on other initiatives. Co-operation with industry groups will continue with a view to encouraging the industry to play its part in encouraging moderation in alcohol consumption and to look at the issue of underage drinking. Actions taken on the basis of the plan are evaluated on an ongoing basis, so that the policy continues to be focused and effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real challenge is changing attitudes to drink. We know this is extremely difficult to establish, but not impossible. Public intolerance of drinking and driving shows what can be done through constantly making people aware of the unacceptable consequences of driving and drinking. Parents can deliver a very clear message to their children about the evils of underage drinking and the dangers, generally, of drink abuse, but the impact of the message is greatly diminished if the parents themselves do not have a responsible attitude towards the use of alcohol. Deputy Higgins is correct that the place of alcohol in the lives of our young people and the growing perception <Col N="592" /> that the principal pastime of some young people now is to go out and get drunk is a sad indictment of our society. However, it is because I recognise that such a problem exists that this Bill introduces the toughest possible measures against underage drinking. In doing this, I am playing a major part in addressing the problem. I have been greatly encouraged by the very positive response, incidentally, to the underage provisions.</P>
    <P>We must not lose sight of the fact that the majority of drinkers exercise a reasonable attitude towards consumption of alcohol. The measures in the Bill are directed at providing such moderate drinkers with the opportunities, within reasonable limits, to enjoy sociable drinks at the times of their choosing. For the reasons I have outlined, I cannot accept Deputy Higgins's amendment.</P>

        <b>:</b> In regard to the last issue we dealt with, the third closing time provision on Sunday nights, we pointed out to the Minister that there was a lack of empirical evidence to support his contention that it would have an effect on Monday morning working patterns. There is certainly no lack of empirical evidence in relation to the devastating effects of underage drinking and alcohol on Irish society. If the Minister wants statistics, he need only go to the emergency and casualty units of hospitals, graveyards and women's refuge centres.</P>
      <P>While I accept that health policy is a matter for the Minister for Health and Children and his Department, we are responsible for this legislation which will determine the entire pattern of drinking afforded by the new regime of opening hours we are bringing into effect. The problem in relation to alcohol in Irish society is that what is everybody's business is nobody's business. It is obvious that education policies are not working because primary school children who are barely out of short trousers are drinking. At post-primary level, there is a separate set of flash cards, data and documentation which is not working because it is not being sold due to pressure from the points system. The Department of Health and Children is not doing its business either. The Minister's Department has overarching responsibility for the regulation, implementation and enforcement of licensing hours and so on.</P>
      <P>We are running from reality and we will rue this day. We have an opportunity here to carry out a reappraisal and re-evaluation of what we are putting in place. That is all I am asking for. It is a sensible suggestion that after this legislation has been in operation for two years there should be a short debate in this House, perhaps for two hours, to re-evaluate it and decide whether our fears were ill-founded, that matters are under control and the regime in this Bill should continue. It is irresponsible to run away from conducting a social, economic and domestic re-evaluation of the impact of this measure. However, it seems the Minister will not agree.</P>

      <P>This is, as I said, a licensing measure which does not involve sociological or health factors. It just relates to licensing hours. I have explained what is happening in the Department of Health and Children, in so far as I could gather the information for Deputy Higgins. I cannot say any more than that. This is legislation from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which deals with the licensing of public houses and other premises selling alcohol. I am not dealing with other matters. If the Department were to extend into these matters as well as everything else, the place would be overrun. It would not be possible to do that.</P>

      <P>In page 8, line 6, to delete &ldquo;8.00 a.m.&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;7.30 a.m.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 5 provides for a further extension to the extension provided for in the Bill in relation to the hours during which premises engaged in mixed trading will be allowed to sell licensed products. I indicated on Committee Stage that I was open to this further liberalisation of the law. Businesses engaged in mixed trading, typically supermarkets, will, by virtue of the amendment, be permitted to open for the sale of licensed products off the premises from 7.30 a.m. rather than 8 a.m., as was originally proposed, on all week days and on a Sunday which falls on 23 or 24 December. They will, of course, be entitled to open at any time for all other business.</P>
      <P>However, I am not in favour of amendment No. 6, which would permit the sale of alcohol off the premises from 7.30 a.m. on all Sundays. There is no particular demand for this. I can understand&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;the view that there may be some sensitivity relating to trading on Sunday mornings. At this point, the Government view is that the <i>status quo</i> should prevail in relation to Sundays, that is, the sale of intoxicating liquor can be conducted from 12.30 p.m. I have relaxed the law considerably in the Bill with regard to those premises engaged in mixed trading and if amendment No. 5 is accepted, alcohol will be available from 7.30 a.m. on weekdays as opposed to 10.30 a.m. under current law. The extended trading time for licensed business in places such as supermarkets will greatly benefit customers on those days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, I have removed all time restrictions on the sale of non-licensed goods. Premises engaged in mixed trading will be able to open, not from 7.30 a.m., as originally proposed, but at <Col N="594" /> any time on any day to engage in their business of selling groceries and other non-alcoholic products. This, effectively, means that supermarkets will be permitted to open for non-licensed business at any time on Sundays should they so wish.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to accept the amendment on the sale of liquor before 12.30 p.m. on Sunday. However, I think I have gone some way down the road with Deputy Howlin on this one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Minister for a number of issues he has addressed in the amendments published today, some of which were quite complex. In the very short time available, he has sought to accept arguments from this side of this House, as far as he could, which is always a good sign.</P>
      <P>On this issue he has accepted the notion that supermarkets and other premises, such as garages, increasingly open at 7.30 a.m. There should not be an anomaly whereby they would have to have a shotgun guard on the drinks section for half an hour until 8 a.m. I am grateful the Minister has accepted the amendment I proposed.</P>
      <P>In regard to amendment No. 6, we had some debate about allowing the sale of alcohol in supermarkets, garages and other licensed places on Sunday mornings. It would be handy if people buying something for Sunday lunch, going on a picnic or settling in to watch the Sunday afternoon match could buy wine or beer with their petrol and other goods. A few years ago supermarkets did not open on Sunday, but that is now a very busy day for them. With the pressures of work and the changing patterns of life, people buy a lot of cooked goods, such as chickens and turkeys, from the delicatessen sections of supermarkets on Sunday mornings. It seems an anomaly that they cannot buy a bottle of wine to go with their Sunday lunch at the same time. The Minister said they should have the foresight to buy it the previous day. However, this is an interference with people's rights, although the Minister could argue that, by definition, the whole licensing regime is an interference with people's rights as it sets the boundaries within which we can operate.</P>
      <P>My predilection is to give people as much freedom as possible. The Minister stated that if supermarkets were allowed to sell alcohol, young people on their way to Gaelic games on Sundays might be tempted to buy drink. I do not believe that is a realistic argument. If people wish to purchase alcohol, they will find ways of doing so. My purpose is to try to facilitate families and individuals by introducing a liberal regime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is always difficult to make laws, but bad laws are made when one considers the worst case scenario and decides to introduce restrictions on the great majority of people to remove temptation from those who might abuse the system. That is a bad way to consider matters of this nature. We should provide support and assistance to those with problems with alcohol. We must accept that alcohol is part of social life and that, by and large, <Col N="595" /> it is good. However, we must also recognise that there are excesses and that people and families are terribly damaged by it. In that context, we must put in place supports to assist those that are damaged and not introduce undue restrictions on people's normal lives.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Minister's acceptance of the amendment I tabled on Committee Stage &ndash; this has been incorporated in amendment No. 5 which has been jointly tabled in our names &ndash; I regret he is continuing with his embargo on Sunday sales. Amendment No. 6 proposes to liberalise the position in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>We must recognise that this legislation will bring about the first substantial change in licensing hours in this country in over 40 years. I gave careful consideration to Deputy Howlin's proposal regarding Sunday opening times. Public houses open at 12.30 p.m. and the Deputy suggests that off-licence sales should also commence at that time. In the case of major sporting occasions and other events, there is no doubt that if supermarkets, for example, were allowed to sell, by way of off-licence or off-licences, beer or spirits before 12.30 p.m. there would undoubtedly be a very great temptation for young people in particular to gather and start drinking prior to such occasions and events. That would not be desirable.</P>
      <P>We have decided that Sunday opening time will continue to be 12.30 p.m., for that and other reasons, and if I were to change the position in respect of off-licences or supermarkets I would be circumventing the rules which apply to public houses. That would not be wise. If I agreed to the Deputy's amendment, I am certain I would regret it. While I have no doubt that in the future there will be a full liberalisation of the licensing hours, I am restricted at present to doing my best in terms of reflecting the views of the Joint Oireachtas Committee, the House, the various interest groups and the general public. As I have stated on numerous occasions, I do not pretend to possess the wisdom of Solomon in respect of this matter but I believe the provision, as it stands, reflects public opinion.</P>

However, I do not agree with the position he has adopted because people buying provisions for their lunch on Sunday mornings should be allowed to purchase a bottle of wine. That said, we are making good progress on a range of issues and I do not intend to divide the House in respect of this one. The Minister is correct in stating we will return to this issue and amend the position in due course.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 8, to delete &ldquo;year.&rdquo;,&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;year.',</P>
      <P>(2A) The name and address of premises to which an off-licence is attached shall be stated on any packaging in which intoxicating liquor for consumption off the premises is placed when the said intoxicating liquor is sold.',&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I must again express my gratitude to the Minister in respect of this group of amendments. While he accepted on Committee Stage that there was merit in my proposal, I did not believe he would return, in the time available to him, with an amendment on Report Stage. I thank him for doing so, for accepting the sensible nature of the proposal I put forward on Committee Stage and for drafting an amendment which is better framed than amendment No. 7. The Minister's amendment makes it an offence to sell, or permit to be sold, intoxicating liquor in contravention of section 17(1) and sets out a regime of penalties. I commend the Minister on responding in such a positive manner because it is not always the case that Committee Stage amendments from the Opposition are taken on board. On occasion, arguments are made for the sake of making them and I am grateful this is not the case in this instance.</P>
      <P>The import of amendment No. 7 is to require that off-licence products should be labelled. On Committee Stage I argued that there are two good reasons for this. First, where off-licence products fall into the hands of minors, the source of such products could be identified and those responsible for providing them could be more easily traced. This would give the Garda authorities better access to information in respect of the source of such products and allow them to alert the owners of particular off-licences that those products are falling into the hands of minors and that they had better take action in that regard. If the offence is repeated, the Garda authorities will be empowered to take action.</P>
      <P>The labelling of off-licence products is required because it will go a long way towards dealing with the real scourge of underage drinking. As Deputy Jim Higgins stated earlier, it is extraordinary that young people, from a very early age, believe it is acceptable not only to drink but also to get drunk. That is a relatively new development. Young people have always been excited by the prospect of obtaining alcohol. However, there is now a growing view among them that the objective is not just to obtain alcohol but also to get drunk. This has become part of their definition of what it means to celebrate a significant occasion. We must address this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> On Committee Stage we discussed the effectiveness of the law in the United States. It is perverse that a person can encounter almost no difficulty in obtaining an automatic pistol at a young age in the US. However, it is virtually impossible for young people to gain access to alcohol in that country because severe penalties accrue to those who facilitate or supply them. We have a much more liberal regime and our level of tolerance is higher. In many ways that is not a bad thing because people are introduced to alcohol in a more structured way. This often happens in the family environment where the dangers as well as the benefits can be explained and understood. The new phenomenon of young people going out to get drunk with their peers is a matter on which we must take a clear stand. Amendment No. 19 in the Minister's name will go a long way towards addressing it.</P>
    <P>The other argument I put forward in respect of this matter, which is a legacy of my time as Minister for the Environment, involves litter enforcement. I refer to the fact that the source of packages which are discarded can be identified by the labelling on such packages. The major environmental nuisance posed by discarded packages can be addressed by my proposal. The Minister's amendment states:</P>
    <P>17.&ndash;(1) The name of the owner, and the address of the premises to which an on-licence or an off-licence is attached shall be clearly indicated on a label affixed to any container in which intoxicating liquor is sold for consumption off the premises.</P>
    <P>(2) A licensee who sells intoxicating liquor or permits it to be sold, in contravention of subsection (1) is guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding&ndash;</P>
    <P>(a) in the case of a first offence, £250, or</P>
    <P>(b) in the case of a second or any subsequent offence, £500.</P>
    <P>That proposal is compact and good. I heartily commend the Minister and I believe this will be one of the most effective amendments we will introduce today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Government is putting forward amendment No. 19 as a means for providing for the labelling of any container in which intoxicating liquor is sold from an off-licence premises, I ask Deputy Howlin to withdraw his amendment. The appropriate place for this provision is the section relating to underage drinking. Amendment No. 19 introduces a new section to Part III of the Bill. The object is to ensure that licence holders engaged in the off-licence sales of liquor would identify the premises concerned on the containers in which the alcohol is sold. I would consider this to be more effective than providing, for example, that the identification would appear on the bags in which the product is placed as the first thing an underage <Col N="598" /> person buying alcohol would do would be to get rid of the bag.</P>
      <P>The amendment is intended as a further provision in the law to assist in the curbing of underage drinking. It is a useful initiative although it will not offer a panacea. It will assist in the overall campaign to track down those irresponsible licence holders who engage in the criminally irresponsible act of supplying intoxicating liquor to young people. The House will be aware that measures are contained in this legislation which are aimed at addressing the problem of underage drinking. Those measures will be the most effective ever introduced to tackle this problem from a law enforcement perspective.</P>
      <P>To date, the position was that if a person put up the defence that he or she had reasonable grounds for believing that a young person was over the age of 18 years, then the court could not convict the person concerned for the simple reason that the case could not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. That defence is being removed. The sale of alcohol to an underage person will be an offence of strict liability. In April last year, I moved to introduce legislation, by way of regulation, to provide for the introduction of identity cards for young people and I will ensure that a major public awareness campaign is implemented in that regard.</P>
      <P>The message to those people over 18 years of age who may look younger than 18 years of age is that they should obtain a card if they wish to purchase alcohol and the message to licence holders is quite simple, namely that if they have a doubt about a person's age, they should ask for the card. If they do not ask for the card and serve alcohol to an underage person, the offence will be one of strict liability and this legislation contains tough provisions on that. Following on a conviction, the court will be obliged to close down the premises for any period up to seven days for a first offence. Provision is also made for fines. Only a small minority of people is involved in the irresponsible trade of serving drink to young people. This legislation, in part, represents a major attack on this problem.</P>
      <P>Deputy Howlin was correct when he said there are young people who drink to get drunk and that this is reflective of a very irresponsible attitude. The parents of young Irish teenagers are appalled by the prospect of their sons and daughters coming home helplessly drunk. On occasions such as the night of the junior certificate results, young teenagers arrive home to their parents helplessly drunk. Obviously, this problem must be tackled in a meaningful way and this legislation will ensure that happens.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Howlin for his amendment and for bringing the entire issue of putting the name and address of the licence holder on the container which contains the drink. That will be of assistance, particularly in the context of all of the other measures in the legislation to tackle underage drinking.</P>

        <b>:</b> I support this amendment and welcome the Minister's decision to accept the thrust of the amendment proposed on Committee Stage. I welcome his addition to Deputy Howlin's amendment of &ldquo;a licensee who sells intoxicating liquor or permits it to be sold in contravention of . . .&rdquo;. In other words, the name and address of the licence holder must appear on the container, otherwise the licence holder will be guilty of an offence for which specific penalties are outlined in the form of £250 for a first offence or £500 for a second or subsequent offence.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of publicans are very responsible people, as are the vast majority of off-licence holders. In an era where &ldquo;traceability&rdquo; is the buzz word, it is crucial that we put in place the tightest possible mechanisms through which to establish the source from which alcohol was made available to children or people under the age at which alcohol is permitted to be sold.</P>
      <P>On the Minister's comments that parents are appalled at their children coming home drunk, that is the parents' responsibility at the end of the day. If a young person arrives home drunk once, there is obviously a problem which must be addressed. Parents must ensure that their children do not arrive home drunk a second time. Unfortunately, many parents are abdicating their responsibilities in this. They do not know where their children are, who they are with, what time they will arrive home at night or what condition they are in when they come home. They never even bother to check. A simple check on a person of 15 or 16 years of age when they come home at night would tell the tale.</P>
      <P>Parents are not being fair to their children by abdicating their parental responsibilities, drawing lines in the sand and imposing strictures to be observed by their children. Many children are great, to survive their parents. While we might like to blame the Garda, the schools, the health service or the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for this problem, the primary and constitutional responsibility rests with parents to look after their children's welfare. That is not happening at present and this matter must be revisited if we are serious about addressing the prevailing culture of alcohol abuse which is becoming progressively worse.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 9 is an alternative to amendment No. 8 and is an improvement on it. Similarly, the Minister's other alternative amendments are an improvement on the amendments I tabled. The Minister and Deputy Higgins will recall our debate on these matters on Committee Stage. It seemed that an extraordinary regime existed in the past which allowed drinking between designated hours on Christmas Day in restaurants, registered clubs, hotels and restaurants with special exemptions. One could have a glass of wine or a celebratory drink between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. One could commence celebrating Christmas with a glass of champagne at 1 p.m. and conclude by 3 p.m. No further alcohol was to be consumed on the premises until 7 p.m. when one could get into festive mode again. Even if someone had not had his Irish coffee by 10 p.m., the shutters went down again. Although I would have preferred the Minister to extend the opening hours until 11 p.m., the new proposed hours of between 12 midday and 10 p.m. are acceptable. People will be able to have their Irish coffee with their morning coffee before they go to a hotel, club or restaurant.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister's willingness to take on board the logic of the arguments which existed. Notwithstanding his statement that nobody pointed out this anomaly to him, nor did anyone make representations to him on the matter, he is still willing to address the issue. He is prepared to accept the thrust of the proposed amendments relating to hotels and restaurants, to clubs under the 1927 Act and to premises having special restaurant licences under section 12. There would not be too many zealous gardaí going into restaurants on Christmas Day to check whether people might be having a glass of wine before the appointed hour of 1 p.m. but in order to avoid that potential embarrassment and to make the law more sane, I welcome the three amendments in the Minister's name and do not intend to press my own amendments.</P>

      <P>Sections 6, 7 and 12 of the Bill as it stands permits the sale of alcohol with a meal in hotels, restaurants and clubs for up to one hour after normal closing time on all days except Christmas Day and Good Friday which are closed days. The sale of alcohol with a meal is allowed, however, on Christmas Day between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. We all agreed that was to cater for former Deputy Mark Killilea's clients who eat their dinner in the middle of the day and those who do not do so are allowed to have a drink with their meal between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 9, 11 and 14 to sections 6, 7 and 12 will relax the times during which it will be lawful for premises that are hotels, restaurants or registered clubs to provide alcohol with a meal on Christmas Day. Instead of the present position where premises may open for three hours in the afternoon, from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. and a further <Col N="601" /> three hours in the evening from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m., they will be permitted to open from 12 midday right through until 10 p.m. These amendments are proposed in place of amendments Nos. 8 and 13 which would seek to allow hotels, restaurants and registered clubs to open on Christmas Day from 10.30 a.m. until 1.30 a.m. the following day.</P>
    <P>As the purpose behind the exemption is to permit persons to enjoy a drink with a meal on a day that is, for the purposes of the licensing laws, a closed day, I do not go so far as to agree that these premises should be permitted to open as if it were an ordinary day. My amendments give ample opportunity to people who wish to enjoy a drink with a meal outside their own homes on Christmas Day to do so. I hope Deputy Howlin accepts these amendments are reasonable and that he will withdraw his amendments.</P>

I did not re-table my amendment but I am grateful to the Minister for dealing with this matter. It is one of the most contentious and difficult issues and is the one on which the licensed vintners made the strongest case. Family premises felt extremely vulnerable to compulsory closure. Mistakes can happen, as Members frequently discover, in all walks of life. The consequences of a mistake could be very expensive for licensees.

Addressing an anomaly where a single offence could have a disastrous consequence for people is wise, particularly when we consider that a number of youths can look well over the age. It does not limit the impact of the legislation to tackle underage drinking. I look forward to seeing how it will apply in practice and I welcomed the detailed explanation given by the Minister on Committee Stage of the flexibility afforded to the courts in terms of the times the compulsory closure will apply &ndash; it can be any period up to a week for a first offence. It could be an hour, an afternoon or a morning and it could apply to part of a premises, perhaps a lounge as opposed to a bar. It is good to give such flexibility to the courts, but there must be a big stick available to them to deal with those who are engaged in this type of offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is well aware that in many urban and rural centres there are premises with a repu<Col N="603" /> tation. Young people can tell you that if they go there they will be served. It is time we took a very hard line on this matter. I wish these proposals well and hope they will have the impact the Minister clearly intends.</P>

        <b>:</b> I welcome the amendment and compliment Deputy Howlin on pointing out what was a legal anomaly. The clarification helps to tighten up the Bill in both its structure and presentation. Why did the Minister not go further as regards temporary closure orders? As far as I am concerned, any measure, irrespective of how punitive it is, that tackles the scourge of underage drinking is welcome. My understanding is that a temporary closure order applies only to underage drinking. Did the Minister consider introducing such orders where publicans irresponsibly manage their affairs as regards continuous after-hours trading, where people tumble out of public houses in the early hours of the morning, roaring and shouting and making life intolerable for settled communities and elderly people whose houses are more like fortifications than homes because they live next door to a public house where there is constant loud noise, music and raucous behaviour? Did he consider introducing temporary closure orders in cases where there is manifest disregard for the welfare of local communities?</P>

      <P>Under the Bill temporary closure orders relate to underage drinking. It has been stated that on a first offence the court will have power to close down the premises in question for any period up to seven days. All the circumstances will be taken into account by the court in assessing how long a closure order should be. As Deputy Howlin correctly pointed out, the period during which the closure order can operate will be any period from one minute to seven days, depending on the circumstances. In addition to that, any part of the premises can be closed. Everything will hinge on the offence. If it is deemed to be a relatively minor offence, I have no doubt that the sanction imposed will be much less than if it were a more serious one. As regards Deputy Higgins' question on whether consideration was given to having temporary closure orders in respect of people tumbling out of licensed premises, as he described them, there are enormous difficulties in holding a licensee responsible for what happens on the street outside his premises and in imputing the conduct of one individual to another. Those situations create many legal difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem, as I and the Government saw it, is that there was and is a serious problem all over the country with underage drinking. It is not just confined to Dublin or the cities but is in every town and village. In those circumstances the target was underage drinking in terms of the temporary closure orders and I feel we have succeeded admirably in achieving the objective of <Col N="604" /> having a major sanction for those who regularly flout this law. Any subsequent offence would carry a greater degree of closure than is provided for in the case of a first offence. In addition, the offender will be obliged to place a notice setting out the period of the closure in a prominent position and setting out precisely why his premises has been closed down by order of the court. All these provisions are meant for those who are involved in serving underage persons and I believe they will be successful. We decided not to extend the closure order beyond what is contained in the legislation because the target was underage drinking. These temporary closure orders have already been legislated for by the House with regard to dealing in drugs. Premises can be closed down for drug dealing by an order of the court and this has happened in several cases. It has proven to be quite effective and I am satisfied this measure will also be effective against that small minority which does not care and which serves young people irrespective of their age.</P>

        <b>:</b> I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 14, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;14.&ndash;The Act of 1988 is hereby amended by the substitution of the following section for section 40:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;40.&ndash;(1) The Minister shall provide for a national identity card to be administered by An Garda Síochána. Each identity card shall display the date of birth, the revenue and social insurance number and a photograph of the person to whom the card is issued.</P>
      <P>(2) A licensee or person authorised by the licensee may refuse to sell alcohol to any person who fails on request to produce the official Garda Síochána-issued identity card.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 40 and 41 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, deal with the issuing of official identity cards by the Garda. For some reason successive <Col N="605" /> Administrations and Ministers have ignored this provision and last year the Minister made the necessary order to give effect to it. We welcomed the announcement at the time, but the Minister would acknowledge the scheme got off to a slow start. Availability was intermittent and the take-up among the young people for whom it was intended was sparse, to put it mildly.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I pointed out that nowadays the vast majority of identity cards are almost irrelevant, as forgery of such cards has become a national industry. Forged cards of a very high standard are readily available; they can be bar-coded and laminated and photographs on the cards can be changed. The result is that we have a farcical situation regarding identity cards providing evidence of one's age as proof positive of one's entitlement to something. I pointed out to the Minister that gardaí have informed me that even the official age card issued by the Garda is now the subject of forgery.</P>
    <P>I favour a national identity card scheme. That issue was addressed by the vintners in the written submission they made in advance of their oral presentation to the joint committee. The vintners made a very strong case to the effect that if one removes the defence of reasonable belief, another defence should be provided, such as that offered by a national identity card. I know those with civil liberties inclinations would say this is an infringement of people's civil liberties, but I do not subscribe to that view. Such schemes operate under other regimes without infringing on people's civil or individual liberties.</P>
    <P>An identity card can be a valuable ally on occasions. When children reach 16, within seven days they receive a social welfare card with an RSI number by post. That is why we should tighten up the provisions of the Garda identity card scheme. We could call it an identity card rather than an age card and it would contain a person's name, date of birth and RSI number. The reason for including the RSI number is that one would then have a definite database against which the individual's age could be checked. There are no RSI numbers on the cards at present, but given that the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs issues the cards and operates hand in hand in different areas with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I do not see why it is not possible to include the RSI numbers. Anyone wishing to check a person's age could then check it against the RSI database. I was minded to go further on Committee Stage and to suggest the inclusion of a person's blood group on the card, but that might be a step too far. Civil libertarians would probably have genuine problems with including blood groups. However, as I said on Committee Stage, everyone's blood group is rightly determined at birth; they are notified of same and this information could be included on an identity card in order that the person could get a blood transfusion after an accident. However, this may be a step too far.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="606" /> The second part of my amendment deals with the concerns of the publican and states: &ldquo;A licensee or person authorised by the licensee may refuse to sell alcohol to any person who fails on request to produce the official Garda Síochána-issued identity card.&rdquo;  In relation to an earlier section the Minister referred to the possibility of a publican being able to demand that a person produce not just an identity card but the official Garda card, with all the details specified by me in the amendment printed thereon. The publicans would then become part of the mechanism to ensure that if people want to prove positively they have reached the legal age to be entitled to drink, they will be obliged to go to the local Garda station, furnish the necessary data and be given the official Garda card with their photograph inserted thereon. They can then produce this card. The Minister should consider this matter for the welfare of the publicans and the cardholders in order to curb the growing tendency towards underage drinking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment seeks to abolish the national voluntary age card scheme provided for under section 40 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, and to substitute what would in effect be a mandatory identity card scheme for those who want to buy alcoholic drink in a licensed premises. As I have said before, a mandatory identity card scheme is not the appropriate response. The national voluntary age card scheme provides a practical method for consumers and those who sell alcoholic liquor to establish proof of age where doubt exists. It must be remembered that we are speaking here of persons who are legally entitled to consume alcohol on licensed premises. A mandatory scheme would apply to persons of all ages, even those about whom no doubt as to age remotely exists. Yet under the amendment the licensee would be entitled to ask for an identity card and if none were forthcoming, he or she would be entitled by virtue of the Deputy's proposal to refuse to serve the person. An old age pensioner might ask for a half pint and a half whiskey, but the publican could ask for an identity card. If the pensioner did not have the card, the publican could refuse to serve him or her. That is obviously not desirable.</P>
      <P>The proposal is a recipe for disaster. It could be open to abuse in that it could be used by some to deny access &ndash; this is where it could get serious &ndash; to a licensed premises without good reason to a person or a group of people, and that is something which would be most undesirable in the context of the equality legislation which has been introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national voluntary age card scheme, on the other hand, contains all the robust protections required to make it effective. It is administered by the Garda Síochána. It is a high quality card with inbuilt security features against tampering. Forgery of the card is an offence punishable with strict penalties amounting to a fine of up to £1,000 <Col N="607" /> or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or both. Regulations to provide for the introduction of the national voluntary age card scheme came into effect on 19 April 1999. The number of cards being issued by the Garda is increasing steadily from just over 7,000 at the end of March this year to the present figure of 9,750 cards. I said already that I introduced the age card in advance of this Bill so that its presence would be established and licence holders and others would get used to the idea of asking for the card. I accept that the value of the card would increase if it were publicised and, as Deputies will know, I have undertaken to do this following enactment of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The scheme will help to provide an effective deterrent against underage drinking coupled with the substantial changes provided for in the Bill to deal with underage drinking, particularly, as I said earlier, the removal of the reasonable grounds defence in any proceedings against the licensee. A greater onus is placed on the licensee of a licensed premised to ensure that intoxicating liquor is supplied only to those who are legally entitled to purchase it or consume it on licensed premises. The removal of the reasonable grounds defence is complementary to the voluntary age card scheme and will serve to make reliance on it by licensees more important because no defence will be permitted where a person wilfully supplies liquor to an underage person, and I have outlined that already.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I make no apology that these provisions are tough. They must be tough if they are to contribute in an effective way and not be just window dressing in our attack on underage drinking. As I said, the national voluntary age card scheme serves to assist both consumers and licensees where a doubt over age exists. Where a doubt exists, the best advice to a licensee is to ask for the card to establish proof of age.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's proposal that the card might contain a person's PRSI number is a worthy one and I am prepared to have this looked at further. The regulations governing the card might, for example, be amended to make provision for a PRSI number. I would like more time to consider this matter further. Deputy Higgins's suggestion regarding the PRSI number is a good and worthy one and one which I should take on board. I cannot accept the amendment but I will, however, give an undertaking in relation to the PRSI number because it is a very useful suggestion. In those circumstances, I ask Deputy Higgins to withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the arguments on Committee Stage and again today and I am minded to accept the view of the Minister, although I thought he made a better case on Committee Stage because he put forward a set of clear proposals. He might outline, in the couple of minutes he has to respond, the exact promotion he intends to undertake for the voluntary <Col N="608" /> scheme which has been allowed to languish in non-action since it became part of the original Intoxicating Liquor Act.</P>
      <P>I was reassured on Committee Stage that the Minister intends to be extremely proactive in this with a dedicated budget, an advertising campaign and a promotion among young people's organisations and clubs and in the education system. I hope he will have direct contact with some of his colleagues, including the Minister for Education and Science, in relation to this. I welcome the reiteration of that determination to have widespread uptake of the voluntary scheme which is already part of the national statute.</P>
      <P>I raised this issue on Committee Stage and the Minister undertook to reflect on it further. This amendment seeks to amend the 1988 Act. If we look at the Acts referred to in the Bill, there is a long list of intoxicating liquor and licensing Acts. On Committee Stage I said these Acts dated back to Victorian times but the Minister reminded me that they dated back even before that. There is an urgent need for a consolidation Bill. I ask the Minister, once this Bill is enacted, to commission &ndash; externally, obviously, because he does not have the resources and the pressures are great within the Department &ndash; a consolidating Bill so that those involved in the trade, the public and the legal profession will have access to a single consolidated Act rather than cross-referencing legislation which goes back centuries. It is extremely daunting to work on amending legislation such as this because one must cross-reference so much other legislation. I hope the Minister will reassure me in regard to the promotion of the voluntary scheme and take it upon himself to make the decision to commission a consolidating Bill.</P>

        <b>:</b> I put it to the Minister in relation to his comments on my amendment that there is a national identity card scheme in vogue which is working, all one has to do is to look at the figures. The Minister said it is gaining in popularity and availability. Some 9,700 identity cards have been issued to date. Some 62,000 young people did the leaving certificate last week and 65,000 young people did the junior certificate. Of the cohort of leaving certificate students, 51,000 do not have the official Garda identity card and no junior certificate student has one. The title national identity card is a total exaggeration and misnomer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister suggested that this, in some way, will create havoc from the point of view of an old age pensioner being refused in a pub because he is not able to produce his identity card to prove he has arrived at the age of 18 years. I do not think there would be a difficulty in relation to the majority of old age pensioners. Indeed, there would be no difficulty in relation to the Minister or me going into a pub. I do not think it likely <Col N="609" /> that we would be confronted with a demand for an identity card.</P>

        <b>:</b> I will be brief. The Acting Chairman has been very tolerant. I ask the Minister to integrate into the advertising campaign some warnings or messages in relation to underage drinking from the point of view of the obvious effects on young people and the consequences for publicans in regard to how the law now operates and how it should be applied.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of the promotion of the scheme, it is fine to have a mass advertising campaign on radio, television and in the newspapers, but I ask that in every Garda area a garda is selected to visit the schools, talk to classes and promote the identity card scheme on a one-to-one basis in the classroom. It is crucially important that they communicate the message on a one-to-one basis. The Minister claims this is a mandatory amendment but that is not the case. It is mandatory and non-mandatory. It is mandatory if one wishes to prove that one is entitled to be served alcohol, but it is non-mandatory in that it is optional and no one is obliged to carry a card. One can produce the card if one wishes to prove one's age. I ask the Minister to accept this amendment from the point of view of making the card as widespread as possible. Publicans have stated that such a system is what they need and want.</P>

      <P>It is intended to launch an advertising campaign for the national voluntary age card and to target schools, youth clubs and so <Col N="610" /> on. It is also intended to use Garda liaison officers to get the message across to young people. The card is not meant for people doing the junior certificate, for example. It is not meant for anyone under the age of 18 but for those over that age who wish to purchase alcohol. The card is targeted at such people because there may be a doubt about their age in the minds of licensees or their staff.</P>
      <P>As regards the old age pensioner situation being an exaggeration, it might sound funny but if, for example, a licensee wished to exclude someone, such as a member of a minority group, under the Deputy's proposal, the licensee could exclude that individual if he or she could not produce an identity card. That would not be desirable, particularly when one considers the Employment Equality Act and, particularly in this context, the Equal Status Act.</P>
      <P>The intention is that there will be a fairly large take-up of the card by people over the age of 18 who believe their ages might be doubted by licensees. For the first time there will be statutory provision whereby a licensee will place a sign in his or her premises to the effect that it is unlawful for him or her to sell intoxicating liquor to anyone under 18 years of age. The package of measures is coming together like a jigsaw to create the entire picture which is one of a massive legislative response to the problem of under age drinking.</P>

      <P>In page 16, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="611" />&ldquo;(iii) the floor area of the new premises is not in excess of 2,000 square feet,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to insert a cap or stricture on the floor area of a new licensed premises created because of the extinguishing of an old licence. It is undesirable that a pub licence transferred from Gweedore to Glanmire, or from Ballyhaunis to Blanchardstown, where the original pub might have had a floor area of 500 sq. ft., could overnight give a licensee the right to build a superpub of up to 10,000 sq. ft.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister said a cap would be unfair but I do not accept that view. By and large, superpubs are undesirable because of the problems they create in a locality. They are also undesirable because of the undue competition they pose for the traditional Irish pub which is recognised as part of Irish life. Traditional pubs have a maximum square footage and a unique atmosphere and, in most cases, are supervised by family members or staff under the supervision of family members who are the owners.</P>
    <P>However, we are now talking about huge industrial-type complexes of advance factory proportions to which a person is appointed to manage and supervise. Invariably excesses and breaches of the law will occur in such premises. I am particularly concerned about the effect of superpubs on the peace and tranquillity of local environments. I am also concerned about the abuse of alcohol by under age people. Supervision has to be lax in large pubs with huge floor areas due to the number of people hoarded into them and this leads to a greater possibility of under age drinking.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that a licence applying to a premises of 500 sq. ft. in a rural town should become a 10,000 or 15,000 sq. ft. superpub overnight. Publicans who are fearful of this kind of development as regards the extinguishing and transfer of licences have a valid argument and I ask the Minister to take on board these concerns.</P>
    <P>The Minister is against imposing a cap in terms of a specified square footage. I asked him to consider between Committee and Report Stage taking regulatory powers onto himself and to insert an amendment to the effect that the square footage of a new premises could not be commensurably disproportionate to the old premises. Such a provision would mean the Minister, the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners would at least retain some say as to the dimensions of the pub being created.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment which seeks to limit the size of a new licensed premises in an arbitrary manner and only in certain circumstances. The amendment is a protectionist measure designed to protect existing publicans who may fear competition from substantial new outlets. A positive element of the new licensing arrangements is that existing licensees will not be able to object to the granting of a new licence on the basis of the effect such <Col N="612" /> a premises would have on the trade of existing premises. To do so would be to ensure no premises would be capable of being established in areas of need. In that context I see no merit in this amendment. It would have the same effect in that while existing licensees would be able to increase the size of their premises, new entrants to the trade would not be able to do so and would suffer a competitive disadvantage.</P>
      <P>If I were to accept the argument that a potential licensee who extinguishes a licence should be statutorily constrained as to the size of the premises he or she wishes to construct, should we not also debar existing licensees who operate small pubs from increasing the size of their establishments? Many publicans in cities and towns have extended their premises to meet a demand and we should not exclude new entrants from doing likewise.</P>
      <P>The size of a new licensed premises is best determined in the context of planning and market force considerations. These are the factors which will impact in a reasonable way on the size of a licensed premises. While the motivation behind the amendment is protectionist, I accept the Deputy has concerns about the growth of superpubs and the undesirability of this development This may, in some cases, be related to the inflexibility of the existing licensing system, and that is part of the answer.</P>
      <P>There is a certain market for such premises, particularly involving the 18 to 35 age group, where a variety of bars offer different forms of entertainment and opportunities for social interaction in different parts of the same premises. Changes to the licensing system which will follow the enactment of this Bill will address the true market situation where a market need is identified by permitting greater mobility of licences from areas which are over provided for &ndash; mainly rural areas &ndash; to locations where there is a demonstrable need for such licences. Once the provisions of this legislation regarding the licensing of premises are implemented, there will be a greater number of licensed premises in areas of greatest need. This should result in opportunities for the establishment of the more intimate type of premises to which some Deputies referred during the passage of this legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas. I would not be confident that this is what would be demanded in all circumstances. For the reasons given, I cannot support the amendment.</P>

        <b>:</b> I move amendment No. 21:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 18, line 7, after &ldquo;licence&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or who has held a restricted licence within 10 <Col N="613" /> years of the passing of this Act and who has not been disqualified from holding such a licence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I instanced the circumstances I am trying to address in this amendment on Committee Stage and my case was strongly supported by Deputy Coughlan. A number of premises have been technically operating illegally but in ignorance of this fact for many years. This particularly applies to premises which were formally designated as hotels and to which a hotel licence applied. Because they ceased to be hotels but continued to trade as pubs, their licences were renewed annually, but in most cases innocently and in ignorance of the law. They met all of the requirements, including having tax clearance certificates, were totally in order and continued to trade.</P>
    <P>In a number of cases they have ceased trading because they or a local person became aware of the circumstances or the Garda notified them they were in breach of the licensing regulations. I know one case where the premises has gone out of business in the past three months. The court was extremely lenient because when the case was explained, the judge fully understood the technical difficulties which had arisen and that the person had been bona fide in operating a licensed premises, albeit in breach of the law. We asked the Minister to try to address this situation on Report Stage. He has introduced an amendment and perhaps he will outline to the House the merits and substance of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>This was a particularly difficult matter which was raised by Deputies Higgins and Coughlan on Committee Stage. Amendment No. 21 proposes to rectify a certain anomaly with regard to hotel licences. As the Government proposes to put forward an amendment to cater for premises which were first licensed under section 2(2) of the Act of 1902, on or before July 1902, I ask the Deputy to withdraw his amendment.</P>
      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 25 is to introduce clarity in circumstances where some premises started out as hotels and received a licence under the 1902 Act. I am proposing a conversion scheme modelled on the scheme that is provided for six day and other restricted licence holders under section 18 of the Bill. The amendment applies to premises which were first licensed as hotels on or before 4 July 1960. This date is an important starting point because from then, premises that were hotels were permitted to install public bars on their premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection 2 in amendment No. 25 addresses the position of the relatively small number of premises which did not avail of the provision in section 19 of the 1960 Act to install a public bar and which now, because of their location in mainly isolated rural areas, would not be in a position economically to come within the terms of section 19. Under this subsection, those premises will continue to operate as hotels but will be permitted to operate a public bar as part of the licence. The amendment, from subsection 3 on, addresses a further issue which is anticipated in <Col N="614" /> amendment No. 21 in the name of Deputies Higgins and Flanagan. My amendment addresses the issue in a more comprehensive manner. I can hear Deputy Higgins say &ldquo;You would say that, wouldn't you?&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It has been brought to my attention that there is a small number of premises that started as hotels some time after 1902 but before 4 July 1960, which over time have become <i>de facto</i> public houses. This arose as the hotel part of the business fell away and the premises continued to operate as a public house which would have had its licence renewed annually as if it were a public house. In many cases, the present occupiers of the premises would not even have been aware that it was originally a hotel. This appears to be a problem that is confined to rural areas and sometimes relatively isolated areas off the tourist circuit. The amendment means that all such licences will be deemed to be full publicans' licences but will be subject to the same arrangements relating to their future disposal as applies to other premises with restricted licences which come within section 18 of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 18, line 21, to delete &ldquo;or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 24 provides that licensees who are leaseholders with short leases and who are trading with restricted licences would be eligible to avail of the scheme offered by section 18 to convert restricted licences to full licences. As I am putting forward two technical amendments, Nos. 22 and 23, which will provide for such a provision, I ask Deputy Ring to withdraw his amendment. Amendments Nos. 22 and 23 will ensure licensees who are leaseholders and who are trading with restricted licences will be also eligible to avail of the amnesty offered by section 18 to convert restricted licenses to full licenses.</P>
      <P>Section 18, as it stands, provides a mechanism whereby the holders of restricted licences can convert them to ordinary seven day licences. The provision, however, does not take account of a situation where a premises to which a restricted licence is attached has been leased. The licensee trading on the basis of the lease is excluded from the amnesty. Where the lease extends beyond the one year amnesty period provided for by this section, the owner of the licence would also be excluded. This could give rise to a situation where licence owners would attempt to break leases with a view to availing of the amnesty. Amendments Nos. 22 and 23, therefore, provide for the inclusion of leaseholders in the scheme and will permit the leaseholder to convert his or her licence in the same way an owner of a premises who is the licence holder can. The leaseholder would be subject to the same restriction as an owner of a premises with regard to the fee, but the provision at subsection (2)(c) which restricts disposal of the licence for five years would not apply as the leasehold would not be in a position to dispose of the premises or licence for reward.</P>

        <b>:</b> I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In page 21, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;24.&ndash;A person who is the holder of a wine retailer's on-licence attaching to a supermarket may, subject to the same conditions specified in his or her wine retailer's licence, offer beer for sale.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" /> Effectively what we are seeking to do here is to allow supermarkets which have an ongoing licence to sell beer also. Of all of the groups that have lobbied us on licensing, apart from the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association and other groups, the most vigorous and vociferous campaign has been that launched by the small supermarket owners. These are the people who fear the possible abolition of the Groceries Order, 1968, and the devastation to business that would cause. These people have a genuine fear of being cannibalised by the larger super chains, many of which are owned by people from outside the country who are moving into large centres of population and closing down RGDATA members and small supermarkets. These people are in many cases the pillars of local communities in that they are family-owned businesses which provide and excellent accessible service, where one does not have to drive. Their backs are to the wall in terms of keeping their heads above water and their businesses afloat. They can sell wine at present because they have an on-licence for wine. What they are seeking, and what we are seeking to do in this amendment is to allow them to sell beer as well as wine. They make the point that at this time of year backpackers and tourists call into these supermarkets looking for a can of beer or a six-pack only to be told they can buy wine but that there is no beer available. They are not seeking to be able to sell spirits. I do not have the empirical evidence to back up an assertion that that is the largest segment of the market, but that is where the big profits and the real costs lie. From the point of view of increasing the viability and economic welfare of small supermarkets, they should be allowed to sell beer as well as wine. They make the point that in the majority of cases they simply do not have the resources to buy a licence. If one wants to buy a licence now, one has to buy a pub licence which will cost £100,000 to £120,000. That licence can then be converted to an on-licence or an off-licence to permit the sale of spirits as well as beer. However, in most cases, they cannot come up with £120,000. They have developed, enhanced and improved their facilities. They have changed from small traditional across-the-counter businesses to being small supermarkets. However, their backs are to the wall and they are being pushed every single day in relation to their survival and their viability. This is a reasonable amendment. They make the point, which the Minister will deny, that of all the groups who have been looked after in this Bill &ndash; and it is in general a good Bill &ndash; theirs is the only one which was excluded. The pubs have been looked after in terms of hours and so on. The clubs have been looked at in terms of what they can now offer by way of amenities to the general public. Restaurants have been looked at. Hotels have been accommodated. Every segment of the industry is accommodated in one way or another in this legislation, but there is not a word about supermarkets.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept this sensible <Col N="619" /> amendment as the supermarkets have a justifiable grievance and a justifiable case. That case is underlined by the argument they make that if the Minister is making an exception for restaurants where the availability of wine can now be added to by making beer available, why not do the same for this segment of the retail outlet business which is one of the planks of the community and provides an excellent service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the amendment. On Committee Stage, the Minister had a listening ear for amendments and arguments coming from this side of the House. However, for some peculiar reason, he did not address this issue. It is a segment of industry that feels aggrieved that in the very large measure of consensus that was built about the enactment before us, although it will not satisfy everybody, most people were satisfied with the arrangements that are now laid out, and a reasonably good Bill has been further improved on Report Stage by the further additional amendments the Minister has accepted today. However, there is no amendment in the Minister's name on the issue of supermarkets, most of which are family owned, small and often in small communities rather than in the large towns which have licences to sell wine. they want to be accommodated in this enactment and allowed to sell beer as well.</P>
      <P>There would be no damage or danger to the Bill if the Minister were to accept this amendment. It would be very welcome to that sector of industry which is often choked out by very large companies which can afford to buy full licences for their premises. The very large multiples have no difficulty in providing a full off-licence facility within their supermarket chains. This small group of mostly family-focused businesses, many operating garages or small supermarkets in communities that depend on them for their everyday shopping, should be allowed to sell beer, which is often generated and produced locally, as well as wine. This is a reasonable and worthy request. I am surprised the arguments put forward on Committee Stage have not been as positively addressed as all the other issues the Minister seemed well disposed to address.</P>
      <P>Of all the issues, this is one on which we will divide the House. As the House is being suspended now, I ask the Minister to reflect further on this. It is the final issue that remains unaddressed. Rather than leaving any group aggrieved, the Minister would greatly improve the Bill by accepting the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and I met representatives of ICTU on Wednesday last to discuss further steps to reduce inflationary pressures. This was followed on Friday by meetings with IBEC and the CIF, as well as the IFA.</P>
      <P>The Government shares the concern of the social partners that inflation is running at levels significantly above those envisaged when the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness was negotiated. A number of the principal factors which have contributed to the current trend are however of a once-off nature or are unlikely to continue to impact negatively on inflation. Accordingly while measured inflation will show a further increase in coming months, this will have fallen back significantly by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The Government has given careful consideration to the proposals and views put forward by the social partners. There is common ground between us that all appropriate steps should be taken to ease existing pressures, building upon those measures already taken by the Government, such as the allocation of new resources to the Competition Authority and the housing package. In addition, there is general agreement that a wage-driven inflationary spiral would be highly undesirable from the point of view of businesses and employees, as well as the achievement of the ambitious economic and social aims of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, including the incomes area.</P>
      <P>Against this background, the Government yesterday decided on a package of measures, including a decision to bring into force immediately the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, which is due to be passed by the Dáil this week, in order to secure a significant increase in competition in the licensed trade, especially in urban areas. A commission on licensing to consider the issue of further liberalisation of licensing, in particular with regard to the off-licence sale of alcohol in the interest of greater competition, will be established immediately and required to report within three months. Pending the impact of the new competitive measures, current circumstances justify the imposition of temporary controls on the price of drink, which will be announced separately by the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt. New increases in charges or levies by public bodies will not be approved by the Government for the remainder of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government will consider the question of <Col N="621" /> the role which indirect taxation might play in the context of preparations for the next budget. That budget will also be an important opportunity to progress the objectives for living standards set out in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Relevant Ministers will initiate immediately, detailed consultation with representative bodies for the main sectors of the economy to impress on them the need for a sense of social responsibility and restraint in the setting of prices and margins, especially over the rest of this year. In coming weeks the Government will review the outcome of these consultations. We will consider in that context, the question of whether additional measures, over and above those announced yesterday, should be taken.</P>
    <P>The office of the Director of Consumer Affairs will be significantly resourced to initiate a vigorous programme of price monitoring and publicity, to highlight trends and patterns in prices and to encourage greater price sensitivity on the part of consumers in the interest of stimulating further competition. The Government will maintain close surveillance of movements in prices arising from the enhanced monitoring through the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
    <P>In addition to progressing measures to accelerate the commitments made in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness in respect of a number of issues impacting on quality of life, such as housing, public transport, and support for gain sharing at enterprise level, the Government has decided that the establishment of the new National Centre for Partnership and Performance should be brought forward. In recognition of the importance, for the quality of life, of the quality and cost of child care, the Government has decided to allocate an additional £40 million over and above the £250 million allocation in the national development plan, to the further development of child care. This additional funding will be allocated in coming weeks following further consultation with the social partners, as provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>The Government believes the package of measures announced yesterday represents a balanced response to legitimate concerns about the effect of higher than expected inflation, while at the same time maintaining a focus on the underlying importance of adherence to the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the speed at which the reply was delivered, not the quality of the content. A number of questions arise. At <Col N="622" /> what rate is it projected officially that inflation will peak before it subsides? I know the Taoiseach has received such reports which are part and parcel of the information available to a Taoiseach and a Minister for Finance. In relation to the Taoiseach's comment regarding indirect taxation, costs and levies, is the Government prepared to consider reducing public transport fares, in particular bus and rail fares? In my case the rail fare was increased by 5p, from 80p to 85p. On child care, an additional allocation of £40 million has been announced. How will this be allocated? Will capital grants be made available, for example, to recognised or bona fide applicants who wish to establish child care facilities or will it be allocated by way of capital allowances as described previously by the Minister for Finance? This does not address the need for such facilities in some areas. The radical measures to be announced by the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, are so insignificant that they have been delegated to a Minister of State. Any Minister with the power to control the price of the pint would keep that function to himself or herself. May I presume therefore that the price control order will be confined to the price of the pint as sold in a public bar and will have no effect on the price charged in lounges or any other drinking establishment?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but that is based on prices not increasing in the domestic sector. Two thirds of the increase in the current rate derives from three areas &ndash; interest rate rises, fuel and cigarettes. On price inflation on the domestic side, there continues to be concern about prices in other categories, mainly from the sterling area. The supermarkets have argued that they have not passed on some of the price increases from the sterling area. For competitive reasons, I hope they do not do so.</P>

      <P>If transport charges were to be reduced by 10% it would not even take 0.1% off the inflation index. When we looked at these issues, child care was considered to have a far greater impact not in reducing the index, but on people. As we said yesterday, there should not be any price increases in any area between now and the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The child care issue is based on the supply side. A mechanism has been established for use of supply side moneys, which the Department of Health and Children is using. It is working well, but ICTU has views on this area. It believes it might be addressed more effectively. Yesterday it presented us with a paper and asked us not only to follow the other scheme but to look at its new proposal. At the last moment we decided to consider it, rather than including it with all the other measures. I am not sure if we will adopt it, but the ICTU appears to have done a great deal of work on the paper, so we will look at it. It is concerned with the supply side.</P>

      <P>Is the control on the price of drink a stand still order or a control order? Are prices to be frozen at their present level or will it be a requirement that henceforth, each individual price increase be sanctioned? Has a survey been done on all licensed premises to establish their current prices so that it will be possible to monitor whether there have been increases? Without knowing a base line it will not be possible to know if there has been an increase. Will the Taoiseach indicate if the drink price controls will apply to all drinks on sale in public houses, including spirits and mixers, or a few, such as stout, ale or lager?

      <P>These are points relevant to the order. I have not seen the order, but there is a price freeze to a retrospective date.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The data is based on the normal surveys undertaken in the section. It does not include everywhere but tries to take into account as much as possible. It is fairly widespread. From the data I have seen, it is extensive. An enormous number of inspectors would be required to cover every licensed premises and all other venues where drink is sold, be they clubs or whatever. The numbers of inspectors will have to be increased to allow for the kind of monitoring that is required. However, the information is fairly widespread.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the statement published by the Government, item No. 4 refers to an extensive campaign of awareness and enforcement of price monitoring. The Government cannot do that with a new recruited army of inspectors for logistical reasons which the House understands. Is it the Government's intention through the appropriate <Col N="625" /> agency, be it the Competition Authority or a new body to be established by the Minster of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, to ensure that there is a helpline which aggrieved customers of public houses, who are the victims of the non-implementation of price control, could use and that, in consequence, an electronic or telephonic pub spy could inform the Minister of State that the publican in question had not implemented the price control? Is that what is meant by what is described as &ldquo;an extensive campaign of awareness and enforcement of price monitoring&rdquo;? As the staff will not be available, will the public be recruited and facilitated in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been much discussion on this and the social partners and others have expressed their views. It does not relate solely to the drink area. For a number of years inflation has been very low, so a number of the mechanisms available to try and curb price increases have ceased, especially the ones used in public media studies. For this to be successful, the consumer must be involved. I was amazed to see the differentials in some of these issues.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It includes that, but there will also be an advertisement campaign. Over the past ten years, advertisements set out information on a range of areas. It was, and could still be an effective system, showing the prices for individual products. This would be very useful. These campaigns were stopped 12 or 13 years ago. However, to involve the public, the information must be given through advertisements or other means. Advertising was very successfully used before, where the products and the range and the differentials were shown. It is a model which would work again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Taoiseach about this before. There seems to be a trend in admin<Col N="626" /> istration that the urban areas do best in all of these price competitions. Is the Taoiseach aware that there is at least a 10% gap between petrol prices in urban and rural areas, that this is impacting heavily and causing poverty in rural areas? It is mainly because there is no competition in the retail petrol sector in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly there are differentials, but the prices of the three main companies which each hold about 25% of the market in this area, vary across the country and are quite competitive. It seems as if different locations are picked and the situation changes, but there is price competition.</P>
      <P>On petrol, the Deputy is correct. On drink, the surveys show that prices of drink in rural areas are far more competitive than those in city areas. I suppose that is the reason there are about 10,000 licensed premises for about two thirds of the population and only 1,000 for the 34% of the population in the greater Dublin area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>I note and welcome the additional £40 million for child care to which the Taoiseach referred in his reply and look forward to hearing exactly how it will be spent. I note also that the Taoiseach mentioned that this was a contribution towards improving quality of life. Does it have as much to do with that as it has to do with the shortage of labour and the need to ensure as many parents as possible are involved in the conventional workforce? If he is to pursue the quality of life issue and given that the issue is now coming to a head, at this point would he give a commitment on the introduction of an indicator, to which he referred before and which he considered before?</P>
      <P>On the inflation figures in general, would he agree that direct subvention would be preferable to cutting indirect tax, certainly from an environmental point of view? Given that transport costs, including congestion, and accommodation costs are a large factor in inflation, in that regard would he consider that subventions in those two areas are badly needed? Will he make a more radical proposal regarding subvention in both the accommodation and transport areas to come to grips with both the quality of life issue and inflation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>On child care, it was agreed in the PPF that following a completion process with the social partners the Government would adopt before the end of this year a strategy to support parents in meeting their child care needs and implement it over the period. We are trying to put more resources into that and look at the submissions which have been put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Quinn asked me about the areas included in that. The submissions made include proposals regarding grant aid for private child care providers; increased levels of grant aid for non-profit child care providers; funding for a greater number of those who have applied for grant aid for disadvantaged areas; and enhanced <Col N="627" /> training programmes. Some of those would fit into the original programme and some of them would be looked at in the context of the £40 million to which I referred.</P>
    <P>On Deputy Sargent's other questions, no option has been ruled out on this issue. We must keep monitoring it. It is the only area of the economy which requires close attention and therefore there must be an ongoing way of looking at proposals and suggestions. There are different views within the sectors about the different means of tackling inflation and there are different views among the social partners, and among economists also. However, cutting indirect taxation could have negative consequences for inflation as well as for the overall performance of the economy and therefore these issues must be looked at. That option must be looked at in the context of the budget and a balanced assessment of all the factors over the next few months.</P>

      <P>Regarding the standstill on price increases by Government bodies and agencies, could the Taoiseach indicate the areas in which there were proposals in the pipeline for increases which have now been stopped? How many additional inspectors will be needed to police the drink price controls? Why did the Government choose to focus on reducing the price of drink? Does he see some irony in the fact that the Government is simultaneously spending resources on an anti-alcohol policy in view of the fact that alcohol contributes more to domestic violence than any other cause and that it is almost equal to cigarettes in terms of its contribution to premature deaths, and yet it is the one area where the Government will spend resources to keep prices down at a time when it is deliberately increasing the price of cigarettes for an opposite purpose? To put it at its mildest, does the Government see irony in focusing on this area or is this simply a CPI manipulation exercise without social vision?</P>

      <P>The Intoxicating Liquor Bill, which will be passed in the House this week, contains a range of measures which have been debated for many years which we hope will be effective.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not fair to say the licensed trade does not make efforts to try to control under age drinking, but there is a particular problem about under age drinking the difficulties of which have been debated at length in this House, and that is addressed in the Bill. There is a need for greater responsibility in the licensed trade in dealing with people who drink excessively irrespective of their age, but the license trade is conscious of that. The days of allowing somebody drink until he or she falls down are long gone. Publicans are far more responsible nowadays.</P>
      <P>These issues, cigarettes and drink, are both health issues. The reason the focus is on drink is that in CPI terms for years and not just recently, the price of drink has been far higher than anything which could be justified.</P>

        <b>:</b> Nevertheless it should be stated. If the rate of inflation over the next 12 months is likely to be at least 6% and the first 12 months of the PPF involves a wage increase of 5.5%, does the Taoiseach agree that the increase has been completely wiped out for ordinary workers; and other areas of Government policy are also wiping out the tax cuts in the most recent budget? Does the Taoiseach agree that the increase in inflation added to the introduction in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown of a refuse charge of £150 per year, for example, completely wipes out the <Col N="629" /> tax cuts for low paid workers and that both together mean a reduction in the living standards of low paid workers in that instance? The Taoiseach stated that he does not want to see wage-driven inflation. Does he agree that the current rate of inflation is not wage-driven but has been caused by profiteering and that workers now naturally want to catch up?</P>
      <P>It is pathetic that an important part of the Government's solution seems to be to advise people to change pubs so they can buy cheaper drink. Does the Taoiseach consider it pathetic that the Government wants to control the price of the pint but the price of rented accommodation is allowed to go through the roof? Does he understand that low paid public and private sector workers now pay more than 50% of their income on a monthly basis to rack-renting landlords, that they work two weeks out of every four for the landlord and that the Government does not have a single proposal to deal with that?</P>

      <P>Was the Taoiseach surprised that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions was prepared a few months ago to sign a partnership agreement involving these wage provisions without tying in a provision for workers in the background of increasing inflation, and that it is unconvincing for it to now make noises when the inflation horse has bolted? Does the Taoiseach understand that the ICTU is increasingly out of touch with hundreds and thousands of its rank and file members? Is he aware of the anger and disillusionment of ordinary working people because of what is happening and because of how they are being made the sacrificial lambs while the profiteers are allowed to get away with murder?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy concerns himself with working people, I remind him of an important point, which is that people are at least working now, which is due in part to the great work of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. Some 1.7 million people are at work today which is unlike the way it used to be when we had 18% unemployment and only one million people working. The policies of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, along with others, have succeeded in bringing that about, so the Deputy's criticism neither stands up to scrutiny nor is it fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The combination of the reduction in taxation which came into effect in April last, the standard pay increases under Partnership 2000 and the first part of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness will ensure that the vast majority of workers will have increases in take-home pay of a minimum of 9% and a maximum of 14%, and it may <Col N="630" /> be higher for other categories. That is significantly in excess of even the most pessimistic forecast this year on inflation.

      <P>We still have to deal with the supply side, and the report on the private rented sector will be published in the next few days. It will contain recommendations which must be dealt with. I know the Deputy will welcome the provisions we made under the Finance Bill which tie people into adhering to the proper standards and regulations for private landlords. This means they will not be able to be racketeering landlords because they will be subject to the new regulations. There is a significant incentive for private landlords to adhere to the new regulations and to sign up to the report on the private rented sector when it is published.</P>

      <P>This question deals with measured inflation and, as Deputy Joe Higgins rightly said, rents are not factored into that measurement. They are not being controlled and the Government's attitude leaves a lot to be desired. We await the report on the private rented sector. It may be Bacon four or bacon cure, but it will have the same impact on the housing market as the three Bacon reports.</P>
      <P>I wish to return to a question I asked the Taoiseach earlier. I ask this of a former Minister for Finance as a former Minister for Finance myself, and with another former Minister for Finance present. Am I right in thinking that this package was brought to the Cabinet by the Minister for Finance and that it proposes the spending of £40 million on additional child care provision? The Taoiseach outlined in reply to a supplementary question some of the measures on which that £40 million could be spent. Under the normal conventions which apply to the Minister for Finance or to any Minister bringing a memorandum to Government involving a cost, a precise costing within what is available from known statistics is required before that memorandum will be tabled. Will the Taoiseach elaborate, confirm and finalise what precisely is intended in that £40 million package? Am I correct in presuming that that memorandum set out clearly how that £40 million would be spent and how it was costed? Why is that not in the public domain, if it is real?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in the public domain. It is envisaged that £40 million will be allocated to support the overall strategy and that the money will be used to enhance the supply side of child <Col N="631" /> care. Specific options have been identified but these remain to be finalised pending discussions with the social partners, because the social partners were asked under the PPF to make submissions. A scheme is already in operation with the money which has already been allocated, but the social partners, especially the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, have asked that other areas be examined. Some of the supply side options in child care which have been put forward are grant aid for private child care providers, increased levels of grant aid for non-profit child care providers and funding for greater numbers of those who have applied for grant aid for disadvantaged areas or enhanced training programmes. The money, as with the £250 million designated in the national development plan, is for the supply side and this has been well spelled out in the child care report.</P>

Is that information available? Was that funding signed off? I am working off what was published in <i>The Irish Times</i> today. It states £40 million in the round. Is there a detailed breakdown? If the Taoiseach does not have it available to him today, can it be made available? Is this an aspirational sum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not. In response to the child care report in which many areas were highlighted where it was thought the best effect would be had on the supply side, £250 million was allocated in the national development plan. The social partners, in the examination of how best that would be spent, found that there were other areas that could be usefully examined which could have immediate effect but which would not affect the existing programme. This is the £40 million and that will deal with the areas they have specified and put forward in their latest report. The ICTU report arrived on Tuesday. Rather than have it as part of the scheme that has already been devised, which is working well and which deals with the supply side, the £40 million might well go to some of the suggestions put forward by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>

Why can a pint of Guinness or Carlsberg be bought in my native village of Goleen for 50p less than in Dublin, although it has to be delivered 240 miles from St. James's Gate to Goleen?

      <P>At the outset, I extend my sympathy to the family of the woman referred to by the Deputy. I was also deeply concerned at the account presented in media reports of her admission to hospital. I understand that the Mid-Western Health Board is currently undertaking an investigation in relation to the circumstances surrounding her death and that it will be completed at an early date. Until all the facts and findings have been established, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further.</P>
      <P>However, I would like to assure the Deputy that when the board's investigation is completed my Department will evaluate the situation with a view to ensuring that any appropriate follow-up action is taken which will prevent similar incidents occurring in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty in having such reports published, subject to the normal legal requirements. It is regrettable and unacceptable that people should have to go through what this <Col N="635" /> lady went through. In the first instance, it is important, for a whole raft of reasons, that the health board conducts an investigation to ensure such a situation does not reoccur. We will assess the situation following the completion of that report. I understand legal representatives of the family of the deceased have also been in touch with the health board and it is possible that legal proceedings could arise from this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree there is a vital public interest in having an independent inquiry conducted and that the health board has a vested legal interest in not reporting comprehensively and truthfully on what occurred? Does he agree it is a scandalous outrage that a 66 year old woman spent ten hours trying to gain admittance to a hospital, that she had four separate ambulance rides, that she spent five hours in Limerick regional hospital, which refused to admit her, that she was then taken to Our Lady's psychiatric hospital in Ennis, which refused to admit her, and then ultimately Ennis General Hospital, where she died the following morning?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister accept this is a total indictment of the Government's failure to provide a proper health service? Does he agree the bereaved family of the woman concerned should be given the fullest possible information and assistance so that the total background is known publicly? The Minister has a duty to take action at departmental level to ensure such an appalling, scandalous event is never repeated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I regard as unacceptable the delay and the manner in which this lady was treated, having to go to so many hospitals and so on over such a lengthy period. As already stated, I will await the outcome of the investigation that has been undertaken by the health board. I would not be satisfied if we were to take it as given that health boards should have a vested interest in concealing the truth. Health boards are statutory bodies and they are accountable to their members, the Government and the Oireachtas. It would be unthinkable and unacceptable if any health board considered itself to have a vested interest in suppressing the truth.</P>
      <P>Everyone is interested in discovering the truth in order to ensure that the family of the woman concerned may obtain the fullest information possible and that steps can be taken to ensure that a similar incident never occurs. Before we make definitive conclusions regarding whether this incident is an indictment of the overall system or whether it was peculiar to the particular circumstances that obtained, it would be prudent to await the outcome of the investigation. Incidents of this nature are not, in many instances, caused by a lack of resources but occur because certain systems and procedures did not, for whatever reason, fall into place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that, to <Col N="636" /> use the old legal terminology, no body should be a judge in its own court? Does he agree that there will be a total lack of public confidence in whatever report is produced by the health board into what, on the face of it, is gross and appalling negligence and a failure of the systems for which the board is directly responsible? Does the Minister further agree that he has a responsibility to ensure that the fullest and most comprehensive information is obtained and that wide-ranging recommendations are issued in order to guarantee that there will be no repetition of such a tragedy? Is it not correct that he has a serious obligation to ensure that this sad event is independently investigated?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>As already stated, the first step in the process is to obtain the report from the health board. I will then evaluate that report and decide on what action to take. Such action could involve establishing an inquiry but such a development will depend on the quality, content and nature of the report we receive from the health board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The staffing requirements of hospitals and the deployment of staff within hospitals is a matter for local management, having regard to the services which hospitals are expected to provide. There are particular staffing difficulties being faced by the health services at present across a wide range of areas, particularly in the medical, paramedical and nursing areas.</P>
      <P>Action is being taken on a number of fronts to address these difficulties. However, in relation to the medical staffing of hospitals, the issues are currently being addressed by the Medical Manpower Forum. With particular regard to non-consultant hospital doctors the forum is seeking to redress the imbalance between career posts and training posts, the need to improve post-graduate medical training to keep more Irish medical graduates in the country and the need to look at the position of women in medicine in Ireland with a view to redressing the number who leave medicine. The Medical Manpower Forum is due to publish its first report shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of consultant posts is regulated by Comhairle na nOspidéal. According to Comhairle na nOspidéal, the consultant establishment on 1 January 2000 was 1,440. There were 147 vacant approved posts on that date. However, a post approved by Comhairle na nOspidéal is classified as vacant until an appointee takes up duty in a permanent capacity. In most instances, replace<Col N="637" /> ment posts are filled by locums until the permanent appointee is installed. In relation to the filling of new consultant posts, I recently received and accepted the recommendations of a working group established to speed up the appointment process, namely, the time it takes from initial approval to putting a consultant in place. I have consulted with Comhairle na nOspidéal in respect of that issue.</P>
    <P>Health service employers and the Health Service Employers Agency are continuing to monitor the take-up of employment offers made to non-consultant hospital doctors for 1 July 2000. The situation is likely to remain fluid until then as an NCHD may have an offer of employment from more than one hospital. Accordingly, I am not at this time in a position to give a precise figure of the number of vacant posts on 1 July other than to say that about 132 of the approximately 3,000 posts remain unfilled as of Tuesday, 27 June. I expect further positions to be filled up to and after 1 July. Hospitals are exploring different options in an effort to ensure that essential posts are filled. In the event that some posts remain unfilled, hospitals will be asked to ensure that essential and critical services are not affected. With full co-operation from all concerned, and a commitment to making the best use of available resources, the effect on services can be minimised.</P>
    <P>As I have said, while primary responsibility for the staffing of hospitals rests with hospital management, I am seeking the co-operation of the Opposition in amending the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, to extend the period of temporary registration for NCHDs from five to seven years. This will remove one obstacle for some NCHDs and allow them to remain and work in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. I welcome the fact that he has finally agreed to bring forward an amendment to the Medical Practitioners Act, although I fear that its arrival is too late to have any real impact at this stage. The Opposition will support the Minister's amending legislation but it has not yet been published. In that regard, every day counts and people whose contracts are nearing their end are already making alternative arrangements. The retention of even one position would be valuable in the current situation.</P>
      <P>It is strange that the Minister's reply was so vague. What does the Department estimate will be the impact of changing the contract period from five to seven years? Will 20 positions, two positions or 30 positions be retained as a result of this development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that his open-ended and vague comment that the effect on services can be minimised is simply not adequate. Will he inform us how he and his Department intend to ensure that the impact on services is minimised? What action is being taken to fill the vacancies that will arise? In terms of accident and emer<Col N="638" /> gency services and the provision of anaesthetics, what specific strategy is the Minister putting in place to ensure that patients will be guaranteed such services? Does he accept that the tragic case to which he referred in the previous question may well be replicated?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate the number of hospitals which will be directly affected by the fact that NCHD positions have not been filled and will not, it appears, be filled by 1 July? Newspaper reports indicate that six county hospitals will be affected, although reference was also made to Tallaght.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not been in contact with a number of health boards about the position, but we are introducing the amending legislation this week and hope to put it through both Houses on Friday. The Opposition has tabled a vote of no confidence in the Government to which the Government has responded with a motion of confidence which must also be taken on that day. However, it is hoped that the Bill, which was published today, will be passed by the Dáil and the Seanad by Friday. We estimate that this measure will help to secure 20 posts.</P>
      <P>The position relating to the remaining vacant posts is very fluid. Only yesterday, for example, I met representatives of the Irish Hospital Consultants Association and I was informed about a particular hospital which is short a doctor.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to avail of this opportunity to offer my sincere condolences to the family of the person concerned. I consider it totally unacceptable that any patient, particularly an elderly patient, should be obliged to endure such long waiting times in accident and emergency departments for necessary medical treatment or admission to an acute hospital ward, especially when the first priority of such departments is to provide appropriate care and treatment for patients presenting with serious injury or illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="639" /> As the Deputy may be aware, the provision of health and social services, which includes accident and emergency services, in the eastern region is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority. I have, therefore, asked the regional chief executive of the ERHA to examine this case and forward a full report on it to me. I assure the Deputy my Department is committed to ensuring that accident and emergency departments are in a position to respond to the need for their services, particularly during periods of peak demand. Specific additional funding has been targeted at accident and emergency departments in acute hospitals providing such services, mainly in the eastern region, aimed at the enhancement of accident and emergency services. This additional funding, which amounted to £2 million in 1998, £2.3 million in 1999 and a further £2 million in the current year was used to fund measures to free up beds for emergency admissions, enhanced staffing levels, the continued development of treatment-observation areas in accident and emergency departments and improved access for general practitioners to urgent specialist opinion, among other measures.</P>
    <P>The hospitals seek to manage surges in activity by a faster throughput of patients through the system, improved admission and discharge management, redesignation of day care and five day beds as emergency in-patient facilities, rostering of additional staff where feasible and the provision of additional long-term care and chronic sick beds outside the hospital setting.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, the pressures with accident and emergency are felt most acutely in the eastern region. This is where the major problems are arising. The Eastern Regional Health Authority has already decided that improvements in accident and emergency services are a priority matter for the authority this year and it has established a dedicated team to review accident and emergency services in the eastern region as a whole. As a result of this review, the authority intends to put forward a comprehensive policy for accident and emergency services which it expects will overcome many of the problems currently experienced in accident and emergency departments.</P>
    <P>The authority has stated that it will seek to redress any imbalance in emergency care in terms of access, timeliness, appropriateness and quality.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>The review will examine issues such as the physical and human resource requirements to reduce waiting times for treatment and admission in accident and emergency departments. The review will also seek to improve emergency access to treatment through a detailed examination of policies, procedures and protocols for emergency services. It will also consider the provision of alternative care options for persons presenting with minor injuries. These options will <Col N="640" /> include general practitioner &ldquo;out of hours&rdquo; services in community or hospital settings.</P>
    <P>I am confident this approach will lead to a continued enhancement of our accident and emergency services and will, in future, prevent a recurrence of the very regrettable incident referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that, in the context of this tragic case involving an 85 year old woman who was left unattended in the accident and emergency unit of St. James's Hospital for 14 hours and subsequently died and in the context of the previous case I brought to his attention involving a 66 year old woman who spent ten hours trying to find a hospital bed and being ferried by ambulance to three different hospitals and who also subsequently died, the health service totally failed these people? Will the Minister acknowledge and accept that part of the reason for that failure is that hospital accident and emergency units are overworked, under resourced and lack the appropriate number of accident and emergency consultants for hospitals which regard to accident and emergency services as a speciality? Does the Minister accept that for far too long, junior doctors with limited experience have been left in charge of accident and emergency units for lengthy periods of time? Will the Minister acknowledge that the fact that he has had to express sorrow to two different families for gross failures in our health service in a single Dáil Question Time represents a gross indictment of this Government's capacity to properly manage our health service and provide proper patient care?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation outlined in regard to the case raised in this question was unacceptable. The accident and emergency consultant involved in the case has issued an apology to the family. I read the background to this case which was the subject of a coroner's review and I acknowledge the enormous and increasing pressures under which accident and emergency personnel work.</P>
      <P>The events which occurred in this case are difficult to comprehend. Certain recommendations flowed from the coroner's report to the accident and emergency service in this case. One must be careful not to tarnish the entire service or to suggest that these cases, tragic and regrettable though they are, are symptomatic of what occurs in our hospital or health services generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I took up office, I am on record as stating that accident and emergency services and waiting lists are two of my main priorities. While I acknowledge that we must appoint more consultants to hospitals which do not have accident and emergency consultants, we must also change what happens in accident and emergency departments over a 24 hour period in terms of senior decision makers. The current deployment of manpower is not acceptable. Agreement has not yet been achieved in the context of the Medical Manpower Forum on how we could resolve the problems <Col N="641" /> which exist. That has been one of the key issues for the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>The pressure on accident and emergency departments has increased due to a dramatic increase in the number of people attending accident and emergency departments, particularly in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area. I have held consultations with the Chief Executive of the ERHA about accident and emergency services in the Dublin area&mdash;</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that in two hospitals (details supplied) epidurals are only available every second day to mothers giving birth; if he regards this service as adequate; and the action he will take to ensure that an epidural service is available seven days a week to mothers giving birth in all of our maternity hospitals.</Quest>

      <P>The provision of hospital services in this instance is the statutory responsibility of the health boards concerned. My Department is committed to working with the health boards to ensure that comprehensive pain relief is made available for those women who wish to avail of such relief in labour, as set out in the Plan for Women's Health.</P>
      <P>In line with this objective, the North Western Health Board has provided a 24 hour epidural service at Sligo General Hospital since July 1997. At present, there are five consultant anaesthetists at Sligo General Hospital who have responsibility for the provision of the epidural service. The board is currently in the process of filling a sixth post and a further consultant anaesthetist post has recently been approved by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the ongoing development of anaesthetist services at the hospital, I am aware from the North Western Health Board that recent difficulties have arisen in relation to an epidural service at Sligo General Hospital. The board has experienced particular short-term difficulties with regard to the availability of non-consultant anaesthetists which has affected the availability of an epidural service on a number of occasions since May of this year. However, I am advised by the board that it anticipates that these short-term difficulties will be resolved with the July NCHD intake. I understand from the board <Col N="642" /> that it is satisfied that all anaesthetist posts will be filled at Sligo General Hospital with effect from 1 July next. This will enable a full epidural service to be restored at the hospital.</P>
    <P>In relation to St. Luke's Hospital, I understand from the South Eastern Health Board that it is the board's policy to provide a full epidural service to all women who wish to avail of the service. However, as a qualified midwife must always be present to observe a patient who has received an epidural, there may, on occasion, be a slight reduction in service depending on the activity within the maternity unit at the hospital. However, the South Eastern Health Board has advised that with the occasional exception of such circumstances, a full epidural service is currently being provided at St. Luke's Hospital.</P>
    <P>The medical staffing of hospitals, including issues in relation to non-consultant hospital doctors, is currently being addressed by the Medical Manpower Forum. With regard to non-consultant hospital doctors, the forum is seeking to redress the imbalance between career posts and training posts, the need to improve postgraduate medical training to keep more Irish medical graduates in the country and the need to look at the position of women in medicine in Ireland with a view to redressing the number who leave medicine. I mentioned these points already and also mentioned the measures which are being taken in regard to the filling of vacancies by NCHDs from 1 July.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>The Medical Manpower Forum is due to publish its first report shortly. Health service employers and the Health Service Employers Agency are continuing to monitor the take-up of employment offers made to NCHDs for 1 July 2000. The situation is likely to remain fluid until then as an NCHD may have an offer of employment from more than one hospital. Hospitals are exploring all options in an effort to ensure that essential posts are filled. In the event that some posts remain unfilled, hospitals will be asked to ensure that essential and critical services are not affected.</P>
    <P>While the primary responsibility for the staffing of hospitals rests with hospital management, I am seeking the co-operation of the Opposition in amending the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978 to extend the period of temporary registration for NCHDs from five years to seven years. This will remove an obstacle for some NCHDs and allow them to remain and work in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In line with the Plan for Women's Health, I am committed to the provision of an appropriate pain relief service to women in labour who seek such a service. I will continue to work with the health boards to further develop services and to constructively address current manpower challenges to ensure that this and other services are provided in line with the needs of those who require hospital services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that women giving birth who wish to avail of epidural services and who have booked those services have a right to expect them to be available within the maternity hospitals? Will the Minister acknowledge that Sligo General Hospital has not provided an adequate, 24 hour, seven day a week service and that St. Luke's Hospital in Kilkenny is not currently providing an adequate 24 hour, seven day a week service? It is completely unsatisfactory that people are engaged in a game of epidural roulette; if a person's baby is born on the right day, the epidural facility will be available to her in the named hospitals but it will not be available if the baby is born on the wrong day. Will the Minister accept that the situation which pertains in these hospitals mirrors that in other hospitals such as Tralee General Hospital and Cavan General Hospital? Will he guarantee that as and from 1 July, a 24 hour, seven day a week epidural service will be available in Sligo General Hospital and the other three hospitals to which I referred in order that the worries of the many pregnant women serviced by these hospitals who have booked epidurals can be allayed?</P>

I already stated that the North Western Health Board is satisfied that all anaesthetist posts at Sligo General Hospital will be filled with effect from 1 July and this will enable a full epidural service to be restored at the hospital. That is the black and white position outlined by the board and I must take the board at face value. Likewise in St. Luke's Hospital a full epidural service is being provided.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 65 and 116 together.</P>
      <P>After an intensive series of negotiations held under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission an agreement has been reached with the Irish Medical Organisation on all the major concerns of non-consultant hospital doctors &ndash; NCHDs. The proposals are now being balloted on by NCHDs. As the NCHD committee has recommended that the proposals be accepted, I hope that this dispute is now resolved.</P>
      <P>The proposals include a very significant improvement in the overtime rates paid to NCHDs. In addition, a senior manager is to be appointed in each major hospital with specific responsibility to manage NCHD hours. A concerted effort is to be made to improve the working conditions and to reduce NCHD working hours with particular attention to long periods of continuous duty. There is also a substantial training package to be put in place amounting to £10 million per annum. New procedures are to be put in place to deal with NCHD grievances at local level. Relocation expenses are also to be paid to NCHDs who have to move residence as part of formal rotation schemes.</P>
      <P>In tandem with these significant improvements to the terms and conditions of employment of junior doctors, the medical manpower forum is looking at the medical staffing in our hospitals. Improving the career prospects for junior doctors is one of the main issues which has been identified from the early stages of this review. The main service, training, research and career issues, and the principles and approaches to be adopted have, to a large measure, been agreed by the Medical Manpower Forum. It has also been agreed that the introduction of these changes should coincide with an extension of the core hospital working day. This is necessary if one of the key principles of the forum is to be achieved, the need to provide the highest quality of medical care for those who require the services of hospitals. This will require an increase in the present number of hospital consultant posts. The Medical Manpower Forum is due to present its first report shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the issues which affect NCHDs working conditions cannot be resolved immediately. <Col N="648" /> Among these are the twin issues of working hours and the restructuring of the medical career hierarchy. The working hours of NCHDs have been the subject of negotiations at European level in the context of the proposed extension of the 1993 EU Directive on Working Time to doctors in training. Deputies will be aware that different stances on this issue had been taken by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. I am glad to note that the agreement was reached on a formula which provides for a nine year transition period to apply the directive to junior doctors. Ireland has always stated that it will reduce junior doctors' working hours to an average of 48 per week at least as quickly as required by any European legislation. I am confident that with the full co-operation of the profession we can achieve that objective in the nine year period.</P>
    <P>As part of our preparations for this eventuality we are conducting a major study of NCHD working hours on a joint basis with the Irish Medical Organisation. The study is being undertaken at eight hospitals by PA Management Consultants. The report of the study will be available shortly.</P>
    <P>This is a substantial and comprehensive response to the issues raised by NCHDs. I appreciate the effort put into resolving the dispute by all the parties involved and, in particular, I thank the officials of the Labour Relations Commission for their assistance. As part of our preparations for this eventuality we are conducting a major study of NCHD working hours on a joint basis with the Irish Medical Organisation. The study is being undertaken at eight hospitals by PA Management Consultants and the report of the study will be available shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister acknowledge that as of 1 July we will be short approximately 140 junior doctors or NCHDs in hospitals across the country? Does he acknowledge that the confrontational approach to industrial relations taken by him and his predecessor has contributed to the number of NCHDs graduating in this State who are obtaining positions outside the State and has added to the difficulties in recruiting medical personnel for our hospitals? Can the Minister assure the House that if future industrial difficulties arise they will be addressed in a sensible and constructive way and will not be left to the last hour of pending strike action?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject all the Deputy's assertions. I have not taken a confrontational approach to industrial relations since taking office. I take a personal interest in all the issues raised by the different partners in the health area and I have worked tirelessly to make sure we resolve the problems. I am conscious of the industrial relations difficulties in the health services over the years and I am determined to resolve those difficulties. We have already put in place a Labour Relations Commission audit to examine industrial relations in the health services and I am looking to develop a new era of constructive part<Col N="649" /> nership involving all participants in a future vision for the health services.</P>
      <P>The treatment of junior doctors through the years, that tradition and history, has placed us in this position. I accept we must change that. We have negotiated a very significant package so far with NCHDs and it will make a difference in the working conditions of junior doctors. We are not finished yet; we have a lot to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister depends a great deal on the Medical Manpower Forum report, which we have been waiting a very long time to see. He should clarify the position regarding that report. He says it is due shortly, but we have been waiting 20 months and we are coming into the holiday period. What does he mean by &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>Given that there will be a shortage of NCHDs, can the Minister ensure the package that has been agreed will hold up in terms of the appointment of roster managers, for example? When will they be appointed? Will they come from outside the present system or will they be drawn from within the current management structure? That structure has been part of the problem rather than the solution. Also, how can the Minister guarantee that NCHDs will be able to take up training grants? Will leave be guaranteed for those who need to take it up or will the result of the shortage mean NCHDs will not be able to get the time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The roster or manpower manager matter is a key issue that has emerged from the talks and it is something about which we are insistent. We want to recruit the best people for that position because it is a key post which involves ensuring that hours are managed properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>From within?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>We want the best. Therefore, some could come from within and some from without. There will be open advertisements and they will be then recruited. It is important that from the outset these posts have the status they require and that those appointed have the authority required to ensure the agreement sticks at hospital level. There will have to be due consultation with all those involved, but everyone will have to realise who ultimately has responsibility for managing the hours of NCHDs. Having met with junior doctors, I feel this is one of the key weaknesses in what has been happening over the years.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned the manpower forum report and we are equally frustrated with the delay. The NCHD dispute meant it went on the back burner, but in a matter of weeks we hope to finalise negotiations on this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept junior doctors have been treated like skivvies and have been exploited over the years? Does he share my concern that people in such responsible positions could be suffering from sleep deprivation, as some of them have complained? When will we see the 48 hour working week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the hours junior doctors have to work are unacceptable. I have spoken to many individual doctors and the hours they work, given the positions they hold, are extraordinary. The PA Management Consultants study is very important as it will give us a geographical read and an idea of what is happening on the ground in large and small hospitals. That study has been entered into jointly by the Department and the IMO and it will give us an idea of how many extra positions we will need in the future. The findings will be linked to colleges, universities and the medical schools, as we will need more doctors to get down to 48 hours per week. It is not possible to give the exact timeframe now, but both sides are committed to doing this and doing so in the context of this study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that if we speeded up the process of achieving the 48 hour week, it might result in having more doctors available and in more of our graduates staying here to work as NCHDs as opposed to working outside the country? One of the reasons for large numbers of them leaving the country is the huge pressure they are placed under in our hospitals, such as working extended hours without always having consultancy backup that would be available to them in other EU states or the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>A 48 hour week and better conditions will improve our capacity to retain doctors in the country, but it is also important to have good career paths for young people in medicine. That is the key. We must also have good educational packages for young doctors in our system. We hope the package we have concluded will significantly improve the educational and training package available to junior doctors. We have some distance to go to make that even better and we will have to do so if we are to compete <Col N="651" /> effectively with other countries for what is becoming a much valued resource &ndash; young doctors. It is a mobile market. Other countries are endeavouring to recruit from Ireland, while we are endeavouring to recruit from other countries. Given recent changes in terms of higher standards of entry into the system here &ndash; by virtue of the Irish Medical Council's new regulations &ndash; we will have to step up our efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a question earlier about the educational package which was not answered. Will the Minister be able to ensure NCHDs can take up this opportunity when certain hospitals will simply not have enough NCHDs and people will have to work extended hours as cover? Can the Minister ensure that all NCHDs will be able to avail of this opportunity, which is very welcome?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>

    <P>*Unpublished information received from An Bord Altranais</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>It is clear that there has been an increase in the number of nurses available for employment over the period 1997 to 1999.</P>
    <P>The Department's annual personnel census is the principal source of data on employment levels among nurses. The total number of nursing staff, whole time equivalent, in employment at 31 December 1997 was 27,426. The corresponding figure for 1998, the most recent census available, was 26,695. It should be noted that nursing students participating in the registration-diploma programmes were excluded from the 1998 census as they are supernumerary to service requirements.</P>
    <P>The provisional figure for 1999 based on initial returns from agencies is 27,338. I stress that this figure is provisional and has not yet been audited by the Department. It should also be noted that <Col N="652" /> the figures quoted exclude 550 practice nurses working with GPs in their surgeries.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also be interested to know that agreement has been reached between the relevant Departments on a procedure for fast-tracking immigration clearances and work permits for non-EU nurses. Data maintained by An Bord Altranais indicates that in recent years there has been a net inflow of nurses to Ireland. Inflow figures for 1999 show a dramatic increase to 3,181 in the number of nurses seeking to register here. Employers have stepped up their recruitment from abroad, with significant success in Scandinavia and the Philippines, for example, in addition to ongoing recruitment within Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>The information I received from the Minister does not quite get to the point I wanted clarified. Information we received from the Department some time ago indicated that two out of every five nurses registered were not employed as nurses. Will the Minister clarify the current position because this information was received some time ago? If that proportion has not fundamentally changed, what will he do about it? Great play has been made by the Minister and his predecessor about additional training places being provided and more people coming into nursing. Surely he would accept that there is not a huge amount of value if nurses who qualify are moving into other areas. Many attractive positions are being offered by pharmaceutical companies and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 47,157 nurses on the active register in 1997, 48,759 in 1998 and 50,940 &ndash; this is unpublished information but it has come via An Bord Altranais &ndash; in 1999. There were 8,998 nurses on the inactive register in 1997, 10,431 in 1998 and 10,389 in 1999. As the Deputy suggested, we have increased the number of places significantly. The diploma programme also had an impact on service levels. I am not so sure about how valuable the active register is in terms of quantifying the numbers. I have met people who are retired from nursing for ten years and who are in other positions but who are still on this register. That said, it is clear there is a significant number of nurses who could be recruited to the service if changes take place. We are weighing that up in terms of the impact changes would have on the existing workforce. We are talking about job sharing and so on.</P>

      <P>It covers all the areas to which the three Deputies have referred. Nurses from the Philippines have to do a six week training course and the figure is not as high as 500. The Mater Hospital in particular has been successful in recruiting up to 70 nurses who are in the country. Other hospitals, particularly in Dublin, have been successful in recruiting both at home and abroad. I do not have details of the most recent survey available.</P>
      <P>Dublin is still the major issue, although there were other issues around the country. We are in dialogue with the health boards to ensure they take a proactive recruitment appraoch to this issue. I have also been in touch with FÁS in regard to its international work to make sure there is an ongoing campaign to entice people back to this country. Dublin is an issue in terms of the matters which affect the capital. Because of the development of specialties and the provision of extra resources for a range of nursing specialties in the regions, many nurses are taking up those opportunities and are moving from the capital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 167 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the difficulties in the orthodontic services. There has been considerable investment <Col N="654" /> over the past few years under the dental health action plan in the setting up by the health boards of orthodontic services. All boards, with the exception of the Midland Health Board, have a consultant-led service in place. The Midland Health Board provides orthodontic services by arrangements with private orthodontists. Nevertheless, despite these developments in the service, waiting times for treatment are in some instances unacceptably high.</P>
    <P>I am continuing to develop the orthodontic services in accordance with the dental health action plan. This year I am making an additional £1.45 million available to the health boards on an ongoing basis for the further development of their orthodontic services.</P>
    <P>The Moran report, made to the chief executive officers of the health boards on the future development of orthodontic services, has been under discussion between my Department and representatives of the chief executive officers. Some interested parties have also commented on the report. A number of recommendations in the report are being implemented as part of the dental health action plan. My Department has issued a comprehensive response to the various recommendations in the report.</P>
    <P>The report, in conjunction with my Department's response, provides an agreed framework for progressing various issues in relation to the orthodontic services. In particular, there is agreement on the recommendation that specialist orthodontists appropriately trained, qualified and registered be employed in the orthodontic services. The Dental Council has agreed to set up a specialist register. This issue is now being advanced with the staff association at the Health Service Employers Agency. The creation of the grade of specialist orthodontist will considerably enhance the service provision and help to retain trained staff in the services by providing them with a suitable career structure.</P>
    <P>My Department recently gave approval for two additional posts of consultant orthodontist in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area. The authority is in the process of filling these posts in conjunction with the Local Appointments Commission. The filling of these posts, combined with the setting up of two new regional orthodontic units at Loughlinstown and Beaumont hospitals, should help to significantly reduce the current waiting times for treatment in the area of the Eastern Regional Health Authority. I have indicated approval of additional funding of £100,000 per annum to Cork Dental School to support the appointment to the school of a professor in orthodontics so that priority can be given to the provision of specialist training programmes in orthodontics for health board dentists in the orthodontic units. In addition, I have invited the Southern Health Board to consider the appointment of an additional consultant orthodontist.</P>
    <P>I have also recently asked health boards to submit proposals to me as to how waiting lists and waiting times for orthodontic treatment in their <Col N="655" /> areas might be further reduced. Proposals from some boards are still awaited. I hope to respond to all boards on their proposals by end July.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree the orthodontic service is a catastrophe and that there has been total inaction? The Minister should ask why the additional resources have not reduced the lists but rather increased them. Why has the Moran report not been implemented in full? Why has the Midland Health Board, which employs private orthodontists, one of the shortest waiting lists and times? Why are private orthodontists not used to reduce the four and a half year waiting list in the Western Health Board area? The Minister has not contacted that board to find out what additional resources it needs.</P>

Patients are suffering and I am not prepared to stand for that. We had useful discussions with the health boards. We held discussions with the ERHA and the Southern Health Board because of the particularly long waiting lists in those areas and because they have particular difficulties.</P>

Is he aware, for example, that <Col N="656" /> young people who are patently in need of urgent attention are not accessing treatment? Some young patients received orthodontic treatment and had retainers and braces fitted. In some cases these devices should have been removed but they have not been, so the treatment is now causing problems. Will the Minister ensure these people are attended to in some way? It does not matter how they are attended to as long as they are attended to. Otherwise, the actual treatment is doing damage to their teeth.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister further ensure that when people obtain an appointment date, and that is a rare enough occurrence, they do not receive a telephone call from the health board on the day of the appointment to the effect that the appointment is cancelled until further notice? This is unacceptable and disgraceful. I am glad the Minister is taking this issue seriously, but he needs to tend to the reality of the matter.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the issue raised by Deputy McManus. I recently met the ERHA's orthodontic team and we have sanctioned the appointment of two additional consultant posts as well as other additional measures. The ERHA estimates it could significantly reduce the lists by Christmas. I will raise the issue of young people who have already received treatment with the ERHA's orthodontic team to see if we can facilitate it in its plan.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gormley asked why lists are increasing. I do not think this is due to cosmetic reasons alone. However, this is a sensitive issue for young people. Some people are of the view that too many people are looking for too many services. I do not accept that view and we should not turn away customers. We should respond to the very real needs of young people in terms of their social and psychological development. That is the approach I am taking to this issue.</P>
      <P>Lists have been increasing for a long time and not just in the past three years. This has more to do with issues in the orthodontic and dental fields than many other issues. I will say no more than that at this stage. We have run out of time and neither I nor the Oireachtas can tolerate this situation any longer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I concluded by saying the Minister would have an opportunity during Question Time to reflect further on this issue. By and large he has gone a long way to meet the views of the Opposition and accepted a number of amendments. However, we are dealing with an amendment which has a consensus of support on Opposition benches and, I believe, among Members of the Minister's party. This involves a simple net issue involving small supermarket owners and retailers, including those who operate supermarkets attached to garages and so on. This sector is a growing feature or rural Ireland in particular, and I am seeking to afford an opportunity to those who have a wine licence to also sell beer.</P>
      <P>The Minister has gone a long way to meet the requirements of virtually every other category of licensee, such as restaurateurs, off-licence holders and on-licence holders. The category to which I refer feels aggrieved. They have made a strong case to the Minister and the Opposition parties which could be acceded to without damaging the principles of the Bill. I hope the Minister had a good and wholesome lunch and that on a full stomach, he will accept the amendment and the views I and Deputy Higgins expressed.</P>
      <P>Many supermarkets are small family concerns in a business which is marginal in comparison with the multiples. The multiples are well placed to buy full off-licences for their supermarkets. The categories affected by this amendment are not so well placed and do not have the resources to buy out a licence. Acceptance of this amendment would be good and proper. It would be useful to the drinks industry if people have a choice of beer or wine in a supermarket. Spirits do not come into it &ndash; it is not a matter of asking for a full licence. If they want to take that step, they should be obliged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Acceptance of this amendment will not damage the structure and balance of this Bill. It will please a section of the community, give more choice to the consumer and help to support busi<Col N="661" /> nesses which are a focal point of small rural communities. I hope the Minister is now in a position to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment put down by Deputy Higgins. As a holder of an off-licence, which I had a huge difficulty in obtaining some years ago, and a special restaurant licence, I support the case made by Deputies Howlin and Higgins. The Bill provides for granting a beer licence to the proprietor of a restaurant which has a wine licence. It is extraordinarily difficult for a supermarket to get an off-licence. Some years ago there were many legal difficulties involved as one had to get two licences and reduce them. Many legal books have been devoted to this single transaction.</P>
      <P>I welcome the changes in this Bill, particularly the provision for a special restaurant licence. However, it is important to look at the granting of off-sales licences to supermarkets. I am a Pioneer but as a practitioner in the field, I know the service supermarkets provide in small towns and the part they play in their growth. This week, there has been a debate among the licensed vintners on profiteering by certain establishments and the differences in price.</P>
      <P>It is important to encourage competition, which is levelled by the free trade in off-sales. Deputy John Bruton spoke about the abuse of alcohol this morning. However, the opportunity for supermarkets to provide a comprehensive service in small communities is important for their survival. We want free trade and open competition. The prohibitive cost is an important factor, especially in our economic development. The profit margin on off-sales in a successful off-licence is 10% to 12% &ndash; not 100%. Significant investment is required to get an off-licence.</P>
      <P>Some ten bottles of wine are sold to every one bottle of spirits. There is huge potential in the sale of beer in supermarkets. It will offer the consumer more choice. Those with off-licences, including me, have a vested interest in this but it is important that those in the trade do not prevent others getting into the market. When one goes to the Continent one can see the huge availability of beer in liquor stores and supermarkets. The Minister has a unique opportunity as this is the first major legislation introduced on this important issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The transfer and reduction of licences has been manipulated and results in huge legal costs. To create an off-licence, one must buy a seven day licence and reduce it. The Minister has introduced a provision whereby one does not need two licences. However, a licence is currently worth more than £100,000. We are talking about introducing more competition. The Government is determined to keep inflation low. The best way to do this is to introduce more competition. Acceptance of this amendment would do that and offer more choice to consumers in every village <Col N="662" /> and small town. This is being prevented. I know several villages and towns who do not have an off-licence in their catchment area. This is being manipulated by the licensed trade who operate off-licences on their premises, which are different to off-licences in supermarkets. I appeal to the Minister to accept Deputy Higgins's amendment and to allow holders of wine licences to sell beer. This would be of huge benefit to and much appreciated by consumers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. I cannot understand the Minister's difficulty in accepting it. It is a gross injustice to ignore this sector. These are decent people running small supermarkets and shops who cannot compete with the multiples, who have huge resources at their disposal. They have no fear of competition but they should be allowed put the same products as other supermarkets on their shelves.</P>
      <P>I understand why someone living in a rural community must pay pub prices for beer if he wants a drink at home. As the Minister knows, many people travel with their families to holiday homes in Castlegregory, Ballyferriter and Caherdaniel. They like to have a drink in the evening but are unable to buy a can of beer in a shop. They must go to the pub and pay its prices. This is grossly unfair in a country trying to promote tourism. If we were in any other European country, these shops would have no difficulty getting an off-licence. We are talking about beer, not spirits, so we are not promoting equality with pubs.</P>
      <P>The people getting these licences know their communities and would not sell drink to under age people. They live in the community and most are parents. I ask all rural Deputies in the House to support this amendment and remember their communities who are at a disadvantage compared to those living in towns who have the facility of off-licences. The case made by these people is justifiable. They feel the Minister did not listen to them in a meaningful way. They first contacted the Minister in 1988 when they made an excellent submission. They feel let down. They are not huge in number and I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by previous speakers. I hope the Minister will accept what is a common sense amendment. I would have thought the underlying concern in this Bill was an attempt on the part of the Government to codify this legislative mess where we have so many different types of licences allowing for alcoholic drink to be sold in many ways. The Bill has failed to do that. The Minister spoke about the possibility of a commission. In the meantime, however, this is one area to which he might turn his mind in terms of changing what is, in essence, a trade restriction. One can buy a bottle of wine in any shop that has a wine retailer's licence, but only wine and nothing else, apart probably from sherry or port and so on <Col N="663" /> which are derived from grapes. One cannot buy a can of beer.</P>
      <P>In terms of the control of the sale of alcohol, many beers and lagers contain less alcohol than wine. I fail to see therefore that it would open the floodgates or in some way endanger the public. The amendment states that any shop or supermarket that is currently selling wine should be allowed to sell beer. The previous speaker, Deputy Moynihan-Cronin, mentioned under age drinking and appropriate policing and enforcement of the law. However, the same law applies to the sale of wine. One cannot say this will give rise to problems because clearly it will not. The main problem the Minister may address himself to is that people operating a supermarket or shop can, under law, sell beer if they have an appropriate licence, and the appropriate licence, in the current scheme of things, is an off-licence or an ordinary seven-day publican's licence, the cost of which is prohibitive. I saw one sell on the market last week for £125,000. It was not envisaged, when the intoxicating liquor legislation was framed, that a publican's licence or a licence to sell drink would be coupled with such an extraordinary monetary value, to the tune of £125,000. It is quite outrageous. People who wish to expand and develop their small businesses simply cannot compete with the larger supermarkets which can buy such a licence. There is evidence that the large supermarket multiples are hoarding licences and holding in-pocket licences for future development of megastores up and down the country. A sum of £125,000 or £150,000 is mere peanuts to these people who are, in effect controlling the market and prices to such an extent as to restrict the trade of the local supermarket in the provincial town or urban area. This is a common sense proposal. I ask the Minister to accept it without delay because it will not give rise to social difficulties as envisaged by people from time to time. I hope the Minister will accept the amendment in the circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes:</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been through this on Committee Stage, but we need to briefly reinforce the very cogent arguments made at that Stage and also by the lobby groups who made powerful presentations to us based on very sound social reasons. The Minister rebutted to a certain extent the arguments put forward on Committee Stage by saying that a full licence is so valuable at this stage that allowing supermarkets to sell beer would mean they were getting off very lightly in respect of money spent in the context of their licence.</P>
      <P>However, we need to see it in the wider context. Deputy Flanagan has referred to the inflated price of licences which offer undue and discriminatory competition from very large supermarkets which can afford that type of licence fee for an off-licence on their premises. Smaller supermarkets, particularly within villages and tourism areas cannot afford such licences.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="664" /> All of us, and the Minister &ndash; given the area from which he comes &ndash; would agree that one of the biggest concerns of legislators is not to undermine small businesses and communities. At a time when large wholesale supermarkets outside villages and towns are drawing people from the villages and towns, acceptance of this amendment would indicate our commitment to communities and tourism areas and to smaller supermarkets in their efforts to cope with competition from larger outlets that will overwhelm us, particularly if larger supermarkets from abroad are allowed to come in.</P>
    <P>This is a very important amendment. The Minister has gone a long way in opening up this area. For the sake of the future of the small towns and villages of Ireland, and the supermarkets that keep those communities going, I hope the Minister will take this amendment on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment would allow the holder of a wine retailer's off-licence to sell beer. I expect that this amendment is prompted by section 24 which permits members of the public to enjoy a glass of beer with a meal in a restaurant holding a wine retailer's on-licence and a restaurant certificate. However, it is not correct to argue that because a shop has a wine off &ndash; or on-licence attached, it should be permitted to sell beer as well. A beer retailer's off-licence is granted on foot of an application to the District Court. In common with all such other applications, for example, an application for the grant of a certificate for a spirit retailer's off-licence or a full publican's licence has a condition that an existing licence or licences should be extinguished. No such requirement exists for the grant of a wine retailer's licence or off-licence. There is, therefore, no examination of the character of the applicant for a licence and no opportunity to examine the fitness of the premises in terms of its location or suitability. The amendment, if it were accepted would mean that every shop would be able to apply for a licence to sell beer without the need to submit to a court examination. It would have profound implications in relation to the availability of alcohol and the enforcement of the under age provisions if liquor were suddenly to be made available in such a multiplicity of outlets. The proposal would also have many implications for small family-run off-licences who have bought a beer retailer's off-licence, for whom the off-licence trade is their only trade, as opposed to the retail grocer for whom the licensed trade is ancillary to the main business. It would also have implications for small family-run pubs which are also located in all the villages and towns to which Deputies have been referring. There seems to be a view abroad that all public houses make a great deal of money. Many public houses do not make much money and business is just turning over. That is true in rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to the issue of the future of off-licences in due course. I do not agree with Deputy Flanagan. It is very much the point, because there is an issue of being licensed or not being licensed, of having a licence attached to a premises or not having a licence attached to a premises. If licensing was not an issue we would not have this legislation before us. Under the Bill I am providing for a relaxation of the law in relation the extinguishing of licences so that in future a licence may be sourced from anywhere in the State and only one extinguished licence is required in all cases. In addition, a publican's licence can be offered directly in substitution for an off-licence. These provisions should provide greater mobility of licences and increase opportunities for access to the trade. The arrangements for the acquisition of an off-licence are the same as those which apply for the acquisition of a publican's licence &ndash; the applicant must extinguish an existing licence and submit to a court examination. Therefore, if a supermarket owner wishes to have a beer retailers off-licence and a spirit retailers off-licence, he or she must extinguish an existing beer retailers off-licence and an existing spirit retailers off-licence. However, these can be sourced from anywhere in the State as opposed to the current city-rural rule. Only one of each is required and no population proofs or one mile rule will apply. Alternatively, the applicant can extinguish an existing publican's licence in substitution for such licences.</P>
      <P>Lest there be any misunderstanding I wish to again say I do not agree that supermarkets have been ignored in the Bill. I have relaxed the law considerably in the Bill with regard to premises engaged in mixed trading and have removed all restrictions on the sale of non-licensed goods. This effectively means that premises engaged in mixed trading will be able to open at any time on any day to engage in the business of selling groceries and other non-alcoholic products. I have also relaxed the law with regard to the sale of licensed products in that they can now be sold from 7.30 a.m. on weekdays as opposed to 10.30 a.m.</P>
      <P>For the present I have gone far enough in opening up the licensing trade and I feel a proper balance has been achieved in the Bill while at the same time it achieves a good deal of updating and progress in the licensing system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the amendment would allow a large number of premises to sell beer without any examination of the character of the applicant or the suitability of the premises, there are other factors which must be considered. This is not a simple matter, though it may seem to be simple until it is examined in depth. The amendment would mean, for example, that any garage or service station which by virtue of existing law has a wine on-licence would be entitled to sell beer. I <Col N="666" /> am not convinced this would be a desirable outcome.</P>

      <P>The UK Government, for example, has published a White Paper on reform of the law which promises significant change. It has held the view that garage forecourts are not suitable premises for the sale of liquor. The argument is that the supply of liquor in such circumstances and the association of drinking and driving should not be promoted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a case for such a restriction. The difference between a supermarket and a garage is that petrol can be bought at a garage. Many such premises also operate on a 24 hour basis and often attract young people, particularly later at night, and I believe that enforcement of the law would arise in certain circumstances. The case that wine is similar to beer does not stand up as one will not find crowds of young people swigging bottles of wine in open spaces while one will find young people swigging beer in open spaces. These are the facts and there is nothing very funny about them. There has been an attempt in the Bill to tackle underage drinking, which we discussed all morning.</P>
      <P>The sale of beer in supermarkets is worth examining, but it must be examined in a structured way. There could be no situation where the sale of beer could be allowed without applying the relevant rules which apply to the sale of intoxicating liquor by other outlets. In these circumstances, and recognising the desire in some quarters for change, I will ask the licensing commission to immediately examine this concept with a view to bringing a report to Government within a very short period &ndash; I anticipate in the region of three months if that is possible. I want to examine the proposals which will come forward so that we can see how the matter may be progressed. I am by no means ruling out the Government changing the current law in relation to the sale of beer in off-licences. However, I am cautioning that this involves practical difficulties and policy issues.</P>
      <P>The price of alcoholic drink has contributed relatively significantly to the current rate of inflation of 5.2%. This figure represents many factors over which the Government has no control whatsoever. However, we do have control over the price of alcoholic drink, the contribution of which to the rate of inflation was 1.2%, a relatively significant percentage. For this and other reasons which have been mentioned I will be asking the commission to seriously examine the matter. When I have its report I will take it to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="667" /> I wish to point out that in bringing forward the Bill there was a very wide ranging consultative process and the balance achieved in the legislation seeks to bring as many interested groups on board as possible. I have already acknowledged the excellent role of the joint committee which was chaired by Deputy Flanagan. The difficulty is that I must bring forward a proposal which is reasonable, structured and operable. When these factors are considered by the commission and when it brings forward a proposal, I will bring it to the Government for discussion. That is the best I can do at present. There is no question of me ignoring any group &ndash; in fact I went out of my way to accept meetings with groups in discussing the legislation&mdash;</P>

        <b>:</b> I am disappointed. The Minister has come a long way in the Bill and I am sorry he did not make another gesture in relation to this issue because these people feel genuinely excluded. The Minister made the point that this is an issue of licences. However, these people have a wine licence, but they must formally go to the courts to get a wine on-licence. We are simply asking that this be extended to include beer, a very common sense proposal. The Minister made the point that if these people want to get a licence to sell beer and spirits they should involve themselves in the very costly process of extinguishing their existing licence. My colleague, Deputy Perry, tells me that in this regard I under-estimated the cost, which is £125,000. We are blue in face saying the reason we are asking that they be allowed sell beer is that these are small, family owned supermarkets which have invested much and taken out mortgages to develop their premises, keep body and soul together and trade viably. This would make an enormous difference. It is not on to expect these people to come up with a lump sum of £125,000.</P>
      <P>The Minister said there is no character check. All one has to do is examine the structure. We all know that in rural areas we are talking about premises run by families who are often the bedrock of society and good, solid pillars of the community. The supermarkets are not owned by multinationals or multiple chain stores where there is no character check and which can involve an anonymous person from outside the jurisdiction setting up a hypermarket and employing a staff to operate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also made a point about undue competition for pubs and the off-licence sector. We are talking about totally different hours of trading. Public houses and off-licensed premises <Col N="668" /> can trade up to a late hour; most supermarkets trade within normal hours, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. We are talking therefore about the vacuum period within which public houses and off-licensed premises are not open.</P>
    <P>On revisiting the issue whenever we see the report of the commission on licensing, it is a case of &ldquo;live horse and you'll get grass&rdquo;. That is a long-term project. The Minister is talking about a set of proposals which will probably not see the light of day for many years. I am sorry that he will not relent because the number of Deputies who have come into the House to add their voices in support speaks volumes for the merits of the argument.</P>

Small family supermarkets do not want to spend £125,000 to open an off-licence to sell spirits. We are talking solely about beer. There are many such supermarkets in my constituency from Adamstown, Clonroche to Taghmon.</P>
      <P>The Minister was being disingenuous in stating that the commission will report back. He has already informed the House, honestly, that he has no intention of bringing another intoxicating liquor Bill before us. Whatever is agreed now therefore will be in place for a very long time.

      <P>Deputy Higgins has highlighted fully the situation of small supermarkets and shops which hold wine licences and which face enormous competition from the large supermar<Col N="669" /> ket groups. They are finding it very difficult to survive. It would be of great assistance therefore if they were allowed to sell beer. The Minister quoted from the White Paper published in Great Britain where the situation in villages is very different, particularly in England which has a vast population. I therefore ask him to re-examine the matter on which I have received a large number of representations from constituents who are anxious that this facility be granted to them.</P>
      <P>There has been an increase of 1.2% in the consumer price index. It is my understanding that tax accounts for 0.75% to 0.9% of this. The Minister was being disingenuous therefore in blaming the public.</P>

      <P>While I am aware that the Vintners Federation would not fully support this proposal, I am very disappointed that RGDATA which represents retail grocers has not been more vocal on the issue. It has been mentioned that the issue of a licence would be subject to court approval. This would not present any difficulties given that the issue of a wine licence is already subject to Garda and court approval. As Deputy Higgins correctly stated, in most instances the character of multinationals is not called into question. That argument therefore does not stand up to scrutiny. Those who come here on holiday during the summer find it hard to believe they cannot buy a can of lager in outlets where wine is sold.</P>
      <P>Most businesses, be they members of the Vintners Federation or supermarkets, are run correctly. They are in business to provide a service, whether it be on a forecourt or in a supermarket, and as established taxpayers have a set code of conduct. We are talking about convenience trading and must not lose sight of the customer. It is very unfair that the current provisions strongly favour vintners who have gained considerably under the Bill. The small grocer who is most vulnerable should not be omitted at a time when such massive changes are being made.</P>

      <P>In page 21, line 8, to delete &ldquo;beer&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;any alcoholic beverage&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to address a problem in the operation of restaurants. We applaud the concession the Minister is making to restaurants, namely, that restaurants which hold licences that entitle them to sell only wine will be entitled to also sell beer. They can now sell beer as well as wine as a beverage with a meal. That is the genesis of the argument of supermarket owners. If restaurants are allowed to sell beer on top of wine, why are small family supermarkets not so allowed? However, that argument is closed for the present.</P>

        <b>:</b> If the Minister is into Molotov cocktails, so be it. We in Mayo would certainly have the constitution for it. People in Kerry have a problem even with wine. We drink pints of green Chartreuse with no problem. <i>C'est la vie</i>. The point at issue is that if restaurants are now allowed to sell beer, the logical extension is that they should also be allowed to sell spirits as part of a meal. The argument has been made, rehearsed and repeated and we mentioned repeatedly on Committee Stage that Irish coffees are now part of the norm, part of what we are, and are provided in most restaurants. Tourists who come here expect them to be provided as part of the ordinary fare, so there is no reason spirits, in a limited form, are not allowed to be served in restaurants. That is why I tabled these amendments which substitute &ldquo;beer&rdquo; with &ldquo;alcoholic beverage&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Higgins's amendment. The special restaurant licence was introduced so that restaurants could sell alcohol, but it had to be from a concealed bar. One could not have an open bar in a restaurant. I am a holder of a special restaurant licence and it is very beneficial to promote business by having alcohol with food. However, it defeats the purpose if a person who can have a glass of wine cannot have an Irish coffee with a meal. As the Bill stands at present, one would be breaking the law by serving an Irish coffee in a restaurant. There is something very wrong with that. Deputy Higgins's amendment allows, within the controls of the special restaurant licence, the consumption of an Irish coffee with a meal from an <i>à la carte</i> menu. That must be incorporated in the Bill and I appeal to the Minister to accept it so that the sale of alcohol in restaurants is incorporated within the structure of the special restaurant licence. It is an important area which should be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment from the point of view of having a modern European city and country. It is a joke that a person can have a glass of wine or a bottle of beer with a meal but not an Irish coffee, a glass of port or a gin and tonic. Some people do not drink beer because they are allergic to it. Some like a small whiskey. This is all about vested interests. I understand this because I was spokesman on justice in 1988 when the Intoxicating Liquor Act was passed which introduced restaurant licences for the first time. This issue is about vested interests and has nothing to do with serving the public, although politicians are supposed to serve the public which elects them. That visitors to the country would be breaking the law were they to have an Irish coffee in a restaurant is nothing short of a joke. We are sufficiently mature to know that those who own licensed premises are doing very well. They would not pay between £4 million and £7 million for pubs if they were not making substantial profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter what part of the country a restaurant is located in, surely if a person has a meal he or she can have a drink. The fear of publicans that people will go to restaurants instead of bars is out <Col N="675" /> of date. People who want to drink will go to a pub or hotel and those who want a meal will go to a restaurant and will have a drink with their meal. The irony is that if one goes to a hotel and has a meal, one can have whatever drink one likes, but if one goes to the restaurant next door, one can only have wine or beer. One might receive the same steak in the restaurant next door, but one cannot choose from the same selection of drinks. It does not make sense to enact legislation with a provision which states that people can have wine or beer with a meal but not an Irish coffee or a gin and tonic. It makes a joke of us. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment so that we can bring in modern law for a modern European country and not protect vested interests by confining people to beer or wine.</P>

      <P>While we may wish to be a civilised society with a good social sense of drinking, part of our cultural inheritance has inculcated a sense of binge drinking because of restrictions on where we can drink. This is a civilised amendment for what Deputy Barrett described as a modern society and it is also beneficial to the tourism industry which we are attempting to encourage. An ironic point which should be taken into consideration is that wines are imported, yet there is every right to sell wine in a restaurant. Unfortunately, our climate does not allow us to produce our own wine, but it allows us to produce our own whiskey. Scotland has managed to obtain a patent on Scotch whisky, yet Irish restaurants are not allowed to serve whiskey, even for an Irish coffee. It is ludicrous, ridiculous, anti-competitive and damaging to our indigenous industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 24 introduces a relaxation of the laws relating to the sale of alcohol in restaurants by permitting the holder of a restaurant certificated wine on-licence to serve beer in conjunction with a meal. This amendment provides that restaurants to which a wine on-licence attaches will be permitted to sell any alcoholic beverage. A restaurant which operates under the special restaurant licence as provided for in the Act of 1988 or a restaurant to which a publican's on-licence attaches may already supply all forms of intoxicating liquor, that is, wine, beer and spirits, with a substantial meal during the hours set out in the legislation. The amendments to the law relating to the special restaurant licence contained in the Bill will have the effect of encouraging more restaurants to apply for that licence, thereby increasing the number of outlets which will be able to offer the full range of drinks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am complementing this desirable change by permitting restaurants with a wine on-licence to serve beer with a meal. Taken together, these measures greatly assist the restaurant sector and it has acknowledged that. The bizarre situation where wine could be supplied in a licensed restaurant but not local beers has now been corrected. This provision reflects consumer demand <Col N="676" /> and will also facilitate the tourism trade. It affords the opportunity to restaurateurs to provide the type of service they wish to provide or what would be workable in a locality.</P>
    <P>If spirits were to be permitted in restaurants, the only practical way to provide for this would be through the introduction of a full licensing procedure, perhaps modelled on the special restaurant licence. Under current law and arising from this Bill, a person with a wine on-licence does not submit to a certain court examination of fitness. If restaurants were to be permitted to stock the full range of alcoholic drinks, a Circuit Court licensing process would be desirable. The implications that such a change would have for existing restaurants operating on the basis of the special restaurant licence would also have to be considered. In effect, such a decision would spell the demise of that form of licence. Having considered the matter further and because of the complexities which will inevitably arise and which will need to be teased out, this is an issue best left to further examination by the commission on licensing in the context of an overall review of licensing procedures.</P>
    <P>The argument made regarding the sale of spirits in a restaurant does not stand up to close examination. It is not as if a restaurant is being asked to buy a full publican's licence to enable it to sell an Irish coffee. That is not the case. All a restaurant is asked to do is to purchase a special restaurant licence under the 1988 Act. This only costs £3,000. A person may apply to the Circuit Court for this licence, which will be granted if the person is deemed fit. It is not as restrictive as it might appear at first sight. It is anything but is restrictive. It is not unreasonable to ask people who want to serve spirits in restaurants, and who have been catered for as far as I reasonably could cater for them in this legislation, to obtain a special restaurant licence. That would not be a difficulty for many of them.</P>
    <P>The Government and I wanted to allow the serving of beer with a meal &ndash; I stress it is with a meal &ndash; and I know it has been welcomed here. Some people do not like to drink wine with their meals. They certainly do not drink it by the pint, which Deputy Higgins said some people do. Such people might welcome a pint of Guinness or beer.</P>

      <P>It is not as if we are preventing people from getting these licences. We have taken away the need for Bord Fáilte inspections, waiting areas, sectioned off areas and so on.

The final step that is being requested in relation to serving spirits in restaurants is not being legislated for in this Bill but is clearly available with a special restaurant licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that a special restaurant licence is available. However, when this was introduced in 1988 it was done on the basis that the regulations attaching to the use of such a licence would be set by the Department of Tourism. Bord Fáilte and the Department went bananas, looking for extra toilets, seating areas, certain counter sizes and so on. When we enacted this special licence, we were unaware this was going to happen.</P>
      <P>The weakness is that some restaurants do not have the facilities to apply for a special restaurant licence. There is an argument for a fee of £3,000 for a licence to serve all kinds of alcohol. However, the real stickler is that in some areas, particularly in rural Ireland, some of the smaller restaurants do not have the space to provide the facilities required by this licence. I suggest the Minister ask his colleague to have these regulations reviewed and modernised, so that people do not have to go through the nonsense of having to put in special toilets, seating areas and so on. It has been proven over the 12 years that the special restaurant licence has not affected public houses, which was the big fear at the time. It is those regulations that are causing the problem.</P>

I know he was his party's spokesman on justice in 1988 when the legislation on special restaurant <Col N="678" /> licences was passed and that he made an excellent contribution to it. We are taking out all those regulations and they will no longer apply. It will be possible to apply <i>simpliciter</i> for the restaurant licence under this legislation and there will not be any more of these regulations. Therefore, it will be quite simple &ndash; a person will apply to the court for a restaurant licence and, if he or she is fit, it will be granted on payment of a fee of £3,000.

        <b>:</b> I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 23, to delete lines 35 and 36 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;(d) any notice published in a church newsletter, club publication or displayed in a public place within the functional area of the club.'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister accepted our amendment to section 27 in relation to the functions of registered clubs. He agreed to broaden the scope of the Bill in the use of clubs by outside bodies by including the word &ldquo;community&rdquo;. In other words, provided the proceeds are, after deduction of all legitimate expenses, devoted to benevolent, charitable or community purposes, the club can be used.</P>
      <P>The Minister will recall that during the debate on this section he also agreed to examine another amendment I had tabled, which I withdrew on the basis of that undertaking by the Minister. As I have said before and as all Members of the House agree, clubs do an excellent job in the promotion of healthy activities for the local community, particularly youth activities. It is the accepted norm that virtually all funds raised by a club go directly back into the retention, maintenance and development of club facilities for the local community, which is why we pushed the community aspect so hard and the Minister kindly agreed to accept our amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the problem is that advertising of any such function can only take place within the precincts of the club itself. There is a very strong argument for a broadening of the scope of such advertising, which is why I proposed the amendment, which I understood the Minister was, at least, favourably disposed towards examining. The amendment proposed that any notice published in a church newsletter, club publication or <Col N="679" /> displayed in a public place within the functional area of the club would be permitted. We are not talking here about wide scale advertising on local or national radio or in local or national newspapers. We are talking about four kinds of advertising &ndash; bush telegraph, local club publications, a poster within the functional area of the club itself and church newsletters. In other words, it would be kept under control and within the general scope and parameters of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 30 provides that the ban on advertising of any function held on the premises of a registered club should not apply to any notice published in a church newsletter, club publication or displayed in a public place within the functional area of the club. This amendment, if accepted, would permit private members' clubs to advertise widely, through posters, billboards and so on, all events at which alcohol will be served. However, the Government is putting forward an amendment to provide for further relaxation with regard to the advertising of functions by registered clubs and, in the circumstances, I ask Deputy Higgins to withdraw his amendment. In the circumstances, I ask Deputy Higgins to withdraw his amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 31 to section 29(b) relaxes further the ban on the advertising of functions held by registered clubs. I propose this amendment as an alternative to amendment No. 30 in the names of Deputies Jim Higgins and Flanagan. It provides that, in addition to functions at which no alcoholic liquor is being supplied, other functions of a community, charitable or benevolent nature permitted under section 27(2) of the Bill may be advertised. This should adequately meet the needs of registered clubs without doing damage to the underlying principles by which a club is permitted to supply intoxicating liquor, namely, that it is a private institution for the benefit of its members and not a licensed premises. The amendment strikes that proper balance between the fundamental private nature of a club, in terms of the conditions under which it can supply intoxicating liquor to its members and their guests, and the position of a club in the wider community, where its facilities may be made available to groups in that wider community and where the club organises functions that will be of benefit to the community or which will have some other charitable or benevolent purpose.</P>
      <P>I have gone a considerable way towards meeting the concerns expressed by Deputy Higgins. While I cannot accept his amendment, I believe he will accept that I have taken it on board, in spirit, and that it will be inserted in the legislation.</P>

      <P>A great deal of debate took place in respect of this matter on Committee Stage. Most Members held the view that a Government health warning is meaningless and would not provide a deterrent from the point of view of either alerting people to the dangers of alcohol or having the effect of making the consumption of alcohol less attractive. A number of Members made the point that health warnings have not worked in the case of cigarette advertising. I do not subscribe to that view but it is a moot point because the case has yet to be proven.</P>
      <P>Alcohol is a legal drug which, in many instances, can be mind-altering. I see the Minister is again treating my argument with a certain degree of derision.</P>

        <b>:</b> We discussed the effects of alcohol on previous occasions but I must reiterate the point that it is a mood-altering substance. It has been established, and I am sure the Minister for Health and Children will confirm, that pancreatitis, cirrhosis of the liver, brain damage, cancer of the throat and mouth, etc. can all be caused by the consumption of alcohol. Unfortunately, however, people in this country seem to have an endless inclination to inflict damage on their bodies.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that including a Government health warning on all cans, bottles and other containers of alcohol would not be a good development. Such warnings should be placed on alcohol products by those responsible for their manufacture and not by retailers. A Government warning that alcohol can seriously damage one's health is valid and should be supported. Packets of aspirin, Dispirin, Anadin and paracetamol carry warnings that excess consumption can damage one's health. In that context and given the havoc being wreaked on our society by a legal drug, I cannot see why consideration cannot be given to including Government health warnings on alcohol products which can seriously damage one's health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I also spoke on this matter on Committee Stage and I hold a number of views <Col N="681" /> on it. As a former Minister for Health, I was responsible for building a form of European consensus in relation to the inclusion of warnings on cigarette packaging. In my opinion, health warnings on tobacco products have some effect. I am also of the view that tobacco products are completely and absolutely damaging and they have no redeeming characteristics because they involve the intake of a poison. However, I do not believe alcohol falls into the same category.</P>
      <P>The excessive consumption of can be extremely damaging. However, alcohol can be used for recreational purposes and it is chosen by many people &ndash; I am sure these include Members who have contributed to this debate &ndash; as a recreational drug. What we require is a responsible attitude to alcohol. I am of the opinion that including on alcohol products a health warning which states that &ldquo;Alcohol can seriously damage your health&rdquo; will not inculcate among people a notion that alcohol is intrinsically good but that it can do immeasurable harm if abused.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins referred to paracetamol and other drugs. Medicines can be poisonous if taken in excess. Likewise, people can poison or kill themselves if they consume too much alcohol at one sitting. In addition, if a person consumes a large amount of alcohol on a regular basis he or she will do considerable harm to oneself.</P>
      <P>I have considered the position in the United States in relation to this matter. Bottles of alcohol sold in that country carry a warning from the US Surgeon General. A number of alternative wordings are used in this regard, one of which is that women should not consume alcohol when pregnant. I suggest that we need to introduce a more wide-ranging educational programme that will build respect for the consumption of alcohol in moderation and highlight the dangers posed by drinking to excess.</P>
      <P>The proposal put forward is inadequate because it implies that we should only warn people and they will then be free to go about their own affairs. Young people would perceive alcohol to be more attractive if bottles and cans carried Government health warnings. When the debate about the inclusion of warnings on tobacco products was ongoing, one manufacturer produced a brand of cigarettes called &ldquo;Death&rdquo;, packets of which displayed a skull and crossbones. The idea appeared to be to undermine legitimate efforts to warn people about the effects of tobacco consumption. If we go down the road of labelling everything which can be potentially damaging, we will diminish the message. What is required is an educational programme which will have a greater impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the objective behind the amendment tabled by Deputy Higgins. However, the Bill is designed to regulate the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the drinks industry and opening hours. We have a responsibility to legislate for the public. However, we have another responsibility, namely, to provide the means of education and support. The social consequences of alcohol abuse must be <Col N="682" /> addressed in the context of legislation of this nature. However, from personal experience, I am not convinced that the route outlined by Deputy Higgins is the best one to take.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Jim Higgins's amendment because excessive consumption of alcohol can damage one's health. The amendment is particularly important when one considers the number of underage drinkers in this country. Health warnings on tobacco products have been quite effective in creating an awareness of the dangers of smoking and I would welcome the inclusion of such warnings on alcohol products. The consumption of alcohol in moderation is acceptable but there is a great deal of anecdotal evidence available about the risks of alcohol abuse. We must ensure that we make people, particularly the young, aware of the dangers involved in drinking.</P>
      <P>The responsibility for not selling alcohol to people who are under age rests with the owners of established outlets. Regulations have been introduced in respect of the sale of cigarettes to minors and, in my opinion, warnings should be included on alcohol products about dangers involved in consuming alcohol. Alcohol is one of the biggest pitfalls in today's society. It is a dangerous drug which should not be under estimated. Placing a warning on a bottle or can to the effect that excessive consumption can seriously damage health would convey a very important message to vulnerable teenagers who, unfortunately, are beginning to drink at a very young age. Successive Governments have tried to ensure that publicans and supermarket owners act responsibly, which they do, but it is important that the consumer would be made aware of the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption.</P>

      <P>I support the underlying principle of this amendment. Deputy Howlin's point was a very valid one because Irish people do not have any respect for drinking alcohol in moderation. There is a need for a change of attitude among members of the public. In the past, young people used to drink and drive but they will no longer go into a pub or club and boast that they drove home the previous night after consuming alcohol. Drinking and driving is socially unacceptable among young people although that mind-set has not changed among older people.</P>
      <P>A person who goes into a pub and says he consumed 15 or 16 pints of beer the previous night is perceived as a hard man and that attitude must change. The principle informing this amendment and the proposed establishment of a Government warning is that people would be conscious of the dangers of alcohol. Such a warning should be accompanied by educational back-up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More people here abuse alcohol than any other drug. Alcohol abuse far outweighs cannabis, heroin and other drug abuse. Some 98% of addiction in the west of Ireland is alcohol addiction. Alcoholism is a very serious disease although <Col N="683" /> there is no harm at all in drinking in moderation. Perhaps in addition to the health warning, the Minister would consider stating on bottle or can labels, that people should not drink and drive. Placing such an advertisement on a bottle of beer would not do any harm and could make some people conscious of the need to respect alcohol.</P>
    <P>I did not have an opportunity to speak about under age drinking and identification cards. Under age drinking is a huge problem; the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation has acknowledged that it is the single biggest problem facing us. We must raise awareness of this problem among the public. People do not respect alcohol and that lack of respect leads to abuse.</P>

While the Minister has the power to incorporate Deputy Higgins' amendment into the Bill, there is a need for co-operation between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Health and Children in regard to a well thought-out advertising campaign which would seek to make young people aware of the potential damage to their health of smoking and excessive alcohol intake.</P>

      <P>Deputy Higgins seems to have misinterpreted my sign language. Far from treating his amendment with derision, I see merit in the intention underlying the amendment. However, I do not believe this issue is either feasible or appropriate to the Bill before us. That was the overwhelming view expressed in the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware that excessive alcohol intake can cause significant health problems but the effects of alcohol abuse do not merely pertain to the health of the abuser. Social and economic consequences can also result from alcohol abuse. One possible approach might be to place the warning proposed by Deputy Higgins on the product. On the other hand, it could be questioned whether such a warning should be placed on a product some would claim is beneficial to health when taken in moderation. A more appro<Col N="685" /> priate way to ensure alcohol is treated with the respect it deserves is through a public education programme or programmes that stress the negative as well as the positive aspects of alcohol. Deputies Howlin and Enright referred to this. While I appreciate that alcohol can, in some cases, endanger health when abused it may be that it should not be placed in the same category as tobacco consumption which, by definition, is unhealthy and injurious.</P>
    <P>In any event, the matter is one that comes within the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Children and will, no doubt, continue to be taken into account in any review of this general area. I agree with Deputy Howlin that one might devalue the warning notice by placing it on too many products. That seems to have been his experience as Minister for Health. I imagine it is true that, taken in moderation, alcohol can be, if not good for one's health, at least not bad for it. On the other hand, cigarettes are always injurious to health. I gave them up four years ago after 20 years of smoking. It is a very difficult thing to do.</P>

        <b>:</b> I move amendment No. 33:</P>
      <P>In page 24, after line 41, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;38.&ndash;The consumption of alcohol in all public places, both indoor and outdoor, which are not licensed for same shall be illegal. A person found guilty of contravening this section shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £500 or to a community service order.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to get the balance right. This was a suggestion made by the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association to the joint committee. I agree with the thrust of what it proposed but it is difficult to get the precise wording to achieve what I want to achieve.</P>
      <P>I am trying to address a problem that is in vogue particularly at this time of year, and that is cider parties held in public places late at night where hordes of young people gather. They pool their resources and acquire flagons of cider. They light fires and drink until the early hours of the morning. There are outdoor beer orgies that result in incredible disrespect for the welfare of the local community. In my two and a half years as spokesperson on justice I have accumulated half a filing cabinet full of letters from people who, at this time of year, are subjected to this kind of outdoor terrorism. Young people band together in huge groups and show a total disregard for the welfare of others, particularly elderly people. The Garda move them on but they come back again. I appreciate it is a problem for the local authorities to invoke the necessary by-laws but thankfully some of them do so. Is there some kind of national prescription that could be put in place such as that suggested by Fr. MacGréil and the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association?</P>
      <P>Our local radio station, MWR, was invited by the Garda in Castlebar to accompany them one Saturday night in a patrol car. In the space of two and a half hours, from 1 a.m. to 2.30 a.m., they came across five cider parties or beer orgies under railway bridges, in culs-de-sac and public parks. The report was issued the following day unedited, undiluted and uncensored. The condition, language and performance of those people had to be heard to be believed. They were bombed out of their minds and gave the gardaí lip, which shows the difficulties the gardaí must cope with in policing this type of operation which is so prevalent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge each local authority to introduce its own by-laws but there is also an obligation on us as we are introducing legislation to regulate alcohol, to lay down a general prescription. However, I <Col N="687" /> acknowledge it is difficult to get the precise wording.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the objective outlined by Deputy Higgins. I can see the difficulty in trying to frame an appropriate amendment. There is an enormous problem of youth drinking in public places. It is having such an effect that communities are seeking to close off culs-de-sac and have railings and gates put on the access to housing estates. Some are seeking to diminish the open space in housing estates. For years we argued for open space for children to play in and so on.</P>
      <P>People are terrorised by young people out of control at cider and beer parties. As I said this morning, there seems to be a mindset among some young people not just to drink but to get drunk. That is appalling. Society must take action against them. A number of local authorities have invoked by-laws. In Arklow there is a notice on the poles in the street stating it is an offence to consume alcohol in a public place within the functional area. Wexford County Council has taken similar action in relation to the beach resorts because of young people congregating at the weekend, literally taking over some resort areas.</P>
      <P>The amendment, as drafted, would make the consumption of alcohol illegal in all public places. If one went on a picnic to Curracloe Strand with one's family and had a glass, litre or pint of wine it would be illegal under the amendment. There are obvious occasions where people consume alcohol in public which would not be regarded as untoward or something that should be outlawed. The Minister has not tabled an amendment on this matter and I look forward to hearing his thoughts on one of the most significant social issues of our time, young people drinking in public, menacing people and doing great damage to themselves. Squads of police are required in some areas to deal with this issue. One of the consequences of this is the horrific scenes of violence that are, unfortunately, all too common. I said in another debate that violence caused by young men against other young men is a phenomenon reaching epidemic proportions. There are now communities where young males fear for their lives because others are going out and getting tanked up and will do terrible damage to people. It is mindless and savage and I do not know how we are to deal with this as a community, but we will have to make an attempt.</P>
      <P>I support the concept behind this amendment and I wonder if there is a formula that could be included in the Bill which would achieve the objective without outlawing every occasion on which people want to consume alcoholic drink safely in public.</P>

There is no control of underage drinking. Nobody objects to people having a drink in public if they behave in an orderly manner, but cider is so cheap that young people can have cider parties. We must ensure that disorderly behaviour beyond a reasonable hour is dealt with severely by the courts, though perhaps not through this Bill.</P>

      <P>This is one of the most important amendments we have dealt with. This is not only a problem in Dublin and other cities but is a disaster in every town and village. Elderly people are terrorised every Saturday night in Roscommon town by louts coming out of nightclubs who press doorbells and break windows. Young people, cider and lager louts, occupied a derelict house on an estate not too far from where I live and sex orgies are going on. Elderly, middleaged and, as Deputy Howlin said, young people are trapped in their own homes. It is one of the biggest social ills and a lot of blame for it is being laid at the Minister's door because we have failed to tackle this problem.</P>
      <P>It comes down to underage drinking and identity cards, but it is also a matter of clamping down on the scumbags who are involved in this. In the Minister's county, the rally in Killarney was almost abandoned because of the riots there and we had the same problem last year when there was a rally in Galway. We must look at this issue and examine the UK approach, where legislation has been introduced to deal with antisocial behaviour. We must ensure that those involved in such activities are banned from particular areas, but the gardaí do not have the powers or resources to do so at present. This is a huge problem in every large housing estate in the country, be they local authority or private estates, and something will have to be done. It is unacceptable that in this age, where the Minister speaks about zero tolerance, elderly, middleaged and young people are forced to stay inside.</P>

      <P>I can readily agree with Deputy Higgins and other speakers that the abuse of alcohol in open public places, leading to antisocial and disorderly behaviour, is something that should not be tolerated. However, the amendment is too wide in its application as it means that adults having a picnic in the park, at the seaside or some other public place could not enjoy a bottle of wine or a glass of beer. We must be able to distinguish between persons drinking in antisocial circumstances and possibly causing a disturbance and adults drinking in a non-threatening atmosphere, such as having a beer at a picnic. Deputy Higgins referred to a pint of wine, but if one had a pint or two of wine, the following morning would be no picnic.</P>
      <P>The difficulties of implementing this amendment if it were to succeed were discussed thoroughly on Committee Stage and the general view was that it would not be practical. However, there are means open to society to protect itself from threatening or antisocial behaviour. Local authorities, under the Local Government Act, 1994, are empowered to make by-laws governing the consumption of alcohol in public places. We heard on Second Stage that this provision was used to some effect in Cork and subsequently in other towns. I am confident that other local authorities experiencing problems with people drinking in public places could follow the lead given in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where public drinking leads to disorderly behaviour, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1993, strengthens the capacity of the gardaí to deal with such incidents. Offences created by that Act include intoxication in public place, disorderly conduct in a public place and threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour in a public place. <Col N="690" /> The Act also gives gardaí important new powers to deal with persons committing such public order offences. Section 8 provides that a garda may, where a person is acting in a manner contrary to the relevant public order provisions of the Act or otherwise loitering in a way that causes apprehension for the safety of persons or property, direct that person to desist from such behaviour and to leave the place concerned in a peaceful and orderly manner and it is an offence for a person to fail to comply with such a direction. I also draw Deputies' attention to the fact that the licensing laws already contain a number of substantive measures to deal with drinking in public places, specifically where underage persons are concerned. Section 33 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, makes it an offence for any person under 18 years of age to purchase alcohol, whether in an on-licence or off-licence, or to consume it in any place other than a private residence.</P>
    <P>Gardaí have the power to confiscate alcohol in the possession of under age persons. While the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, contains a very wide range of controls designed to tackle the problem of under age drinking, this Bill will strengthen the provisions regarding the supply or sale of intoxicating liquor to under age persons. The code of law which will now apply is adequate.

      <P>I agree fully with what the Minister and Deputy Power have said. This amendment does not tackle the nub of the issue and Deputy Higgins said it was a difficult amendment to word. I am disappointed the Minister has not come up with any solution. Will he give the Garda the resources to implement that legislation? Will he ensure that legislation is strengthened so we can clamp down on this? I do not know whether the Minister is living in the real world &ndash; this is a huge problem. I am not talking about someone having a beer outside a public house after a football match but about scumbags in the middle of estates terrorising elderly people who cannot get in or out of their homes. Bottles, used condoms, etc. are being thrown into their gardens.</P>
      <P>It is unacceptable in this day and age that anyone should have to accept that behaviour. We seem to be doing nothing about it. We, as the legislative assembly, are being blamed for not bringing in the legislation. This Government is being blamed for not enforcing the legislation which is there. We have to do something about it. I am disappointed the Minister did not come up with suggestions or proposals in regard to what he plans to do to ensure we eradicate this problem once and for all. We cannot leave it to the local authorities which do not have the powers and which cannot enforce the legislation applying to them at the moment.</P>

        <b>:</b> As I acknowledged in my opening comments, I agree it is very difficult to find clear, precise and definitive wording to achieve what we want. I agree with Deputy Naughten in that the Minister is in denial in respect of the huge public order problem. The cider parties are not confined to Roscommon, Castlebar or Dublin but are in Kildare and every other county. Life will be a nightmare for the rest of the summer for a huge tranche of the settled community, particularly the elderly. We are failing in our duty if we do not protect the right to privacy, solitude and tranquillity of elderly people in their own dwellings.</P>
      <P>Elderly people, particularly women, are being terrorised in their homes as a result of these open-air orgies of drink and drugs and very often a combination of both. It is fine to talk about the legislation and to trot out the various provisions of the 1994 public order legislation and so on, but the legislation is not working. Enforcement and implementation are important, not legislation. The legislation, however, is not being implemented at present.</P>
      <P>The Minister really needs to address this issue. He needs to sit down with the Garda Commissioner and point out that there is a huge problem which, based on previous years, will reach even higher thresholds of crisis than in previous years because it is almost accepted that these people have the right to congregate in public places and drink openly into the early hours of the morning. This problem should be tackled now and the Minister should sit down with the Garda Commissioner who should call in his divisional people and the chief superintendents. They should put in place some kind of emergency action over the summer period to rid the urban and rural landscapes of this plight which, unfortunately, has befallen us.</P>

      <P>The best way to approach the problem which has been posed is obviously the rigorous enforcement of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994. The legislative framework is there but it requires rigorous enforcement. It is certainly my intention to have dis<Col N="692" /> cussions with the Garda Commissioner in the context of the introduction of this legislation to deal specifically with any problems which may arise.</P>
      <P>Specifically, I have explained on many occasions that it is the intention to rigorously enforce the under age provisions in this legislation. The legislation is deliberately tough in this area to try to stamp out under age drinking, in so far as it can be done through legislation. I accept that at night people living in residential areas can face great disturbance as a result of people leaving certain premises. I accept it is necessary to address that problem and that it is not right that people, and very often their young children, should be wakened by serious disturbance. That is a matter I will certainly discuss with the Garda Commissioner in the context of this legislation and the more rigorous enforcement of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been a tortuous enough process and the consultative process took almost two years to reach this stage. It is far from comprehensive legislation despite the comments of the Minister but, I suppose, in trying to serve the various interests and to make sense of all the enactments in place, it is as good as we can do at this stage. I would have preferred if more of our amendments had been accepted but I am grateful to the Minister and acknowledge the amendments he has taken on board. This will improve the general body of licensing law.</P>
      <P>I use this opportunity to pose once again a question I posed on Committee Stage and this morning on Report Stage. Since the Minister said he does not have the resources within his Department, will he commission a consolidation Bill incorporating all the enactments which date back well over a century and which are a minefield for anybody to navigate in order to find out the exact legal position? When discussing one amendment the Minister acknowledged that it would be a surprise to a certain category of license holders to discover that they are in that category at all.</P>
      <P>We need a consolidating Act and I would like the Minister to indicate that he will commission such an Act so that when we come to the next set of amendments to the licensing hours or to the intoxicating liquor regime, there will be one set of enactments at which to look because it is extremely difficult to cross reference so many existing Acts. I thank the Minister for his work on this Bill.</P>

        <b>:</b> I concur with Deputy Howlin's comments. I welcome the Minister's <Col N="693" /> commitment to meet the Garda Commissioner to see what can be done about the public order problem. That is very important and I hope it happens at an early date. It has been a mammoth task to put this Bill together. First, one is talking about the report of the review group and then the degree of consultation with the various interested bodies. I have to acknowledge that, by and large, the Minister has struck a fair balance between the different interest groups and has managed to come up with legislation which treads a very neat and delicate path between the different interest groups apart from the small supermarket owners who have a genuine grievance.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister and his officials who have done a good job. I am sure he will announce with some fanfare the new opening hours before the end of the week.

I also thank the groups with whom I consulted and, in particular, I thank the staff of the Department for the wonderful work they put into this legislation over a prolonged period.</P>
      <P>For the first time in 40 years we are implementing major changes to our intoxicating liquor laws. This change is balanced, reasonable and fair. As to the consolidation of legislation, Ireland's first intoxicating liquor legislation dates from about 1635. That law is not extant and much drinking up time has gone under the bridge since it was passed. The oldest Act concerning this issue dates from 1833 and 55 Acts govern this area. There are few experts on all Acts but one is sitting nearby. He is an official in the Department. It would be a major task to consolidate legislation of this nature but we will have to consider such a course of action.</P>

      <P>When we last debated the Bill I stated it is crucially important to the availability of e-commerce and competition that we achieve local loop unbundling. I hope the Minister will signify in her reply when she hopes to ensure this takes place. Such unbundling is fundamentally important to the enactment of this legislation and the development of e-commerce.</P>
      <P>The Minister intends to make Athlone an e-commerce hub and it is fundamentally important that a town such as Athlone receives such designation. I support the Minister in this objective as Athlone would be an ideal capital for e-commerce. However, we should also consider developing Athlone as a hub for other towns in the area, including Mullingar, Tullamore, Roscommon and Longford. These towns are serviced by fibre optic cables and this would be a great benefit to the midlands region which has been disadvantaged with regard to industry.</P>
      <P>E-commerce offers significant opportunities for institutes of technology, including Athlone Institute of Technology, to base courses in other towns through the use of information technology. We should consider such a development which would bring courses closer to people as the upgrading of skills, including IT skills, is fundamentally important to the enactment of this legislation.</P>
      <P>E-commerce has developed dramatically in the US in the past number of years. For example, one can place an order for groceries from one's workplace and they will be delivered at a specified time. One pays by credit card, there is no hassle with cash and the groceries are delivered without the need for one to go to the supermarket. I am sure such a system would suit the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister would manage that also. E-commerce has developed dramatically in the US but is only beginning to take off in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="695" /> One of the Minister's other responsibilities is for the postal service, An Post and the retention or rural post offices. E-commerce could play a significant role in supporting the postal service and post offices by transforming them into Internet access points and local e-commerce hubs. There is no reason rural post offices should not have Internet access points such as can be seen in pubs and shopping centres. However, a fundamental problem is that many rural post offices are not even electronic. This problem requires substantial investment if we are talking about keeping rural post offices open and ensuring every person has access to the Internet.</P>
    <P>We should also examine the provision of banking services through post offices. A major announcement in the UK today outlines that post offices will link up with banks to provide services in communities. Banks have closed in many of these locations, as is the case in Ireland. Changes in the new Social Welfare Act encourage elderly people to keep money in banks as their social welfare entitlements will not be adversely affected. There is a significant opportunity for post offices to provide services in local communities rather than people having to travel to banks in large towns. However, post offices must be equipped with the computer facilities, they must be electronic, which many are not, and they must provide Internet access.</P>
    <P>Post offices could also be used as hubs from which goods purchased on the Internet could be collected. We should reverse the decline in post offices and implement a vision of how to develop post offices into the future. They have great potential and a large network, and I hope the Minister will seriously examine this issue and provide the necessary investment.</P>
    <P>The objective of this legislation is to transpose the EU Electronic Signatures Directive, 1999, into Irish law. However, what happens when we deal with locations outside the EU? There is concern about this issue. The web is world-wide but this legislation applies only within the EU. What happens to companies trading outside the EU who face potential risks? The situation is open for cowboy operators as the agreements in place are not sufficient to ensure the necessary protection is provided.</P>
    <P>Security is the largest concern that SMEs have about e-commerce. A recent survey indicated that 34% of them see security and confidentiality as major problems with the Internet and e-commerce. We must overcome these fears if we are to develop a proper e-commerce hub. Such a development offers great opportunities for Ireland to attract e-commerce companies and develop SMEs into international companies selling Irish products worldwide via the Internet.</P>
    <P>The greatest challenge is to get SMEs to run with this issue. There are concerns and we are failing to ensure SMEs take up this opportunity. The Government was criticised in a recent survey for not providing information to SMEs. This will <Col N="696" /> be an uphill struggle. Technology is mainly used to source information. We must change that to ensure it is used for on-line purchasing and on-line banking &ndash; which is beginning to take off here &ndash; but mainly for on-line payments to suppliers and customers.</P>
    <P>There is huge potential for SMEs. However, the recent survey conducted by the Information Society Commission highlights the fears and prejudices and the lack of investment by SMEs in staff training. This is a huge problem we must overcome. Some 46% of SMEs provide no IT training for their workers. In five years, certain jobs will not exist because the economy is changing so rapidly and people must continually upskill. I know the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, is hoping to tackle some of these problems in the White Paper but the Government can only do so much in providing that training. Industry must grasp the nettle, which it is not prepared to do. This is a hurdle we must overcome if we want to develop Ireland as an e-commerce hub and ensure it is the main player in the European Union.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation which provided an opportunity to raise some points with which I know the Minister agrees. I hope she will consider the points I raised on competition, that she ensures resources are put into post offices so that they can remain open to provide a service to the community and that SMEs take on e-commerce wholeheartedly so that they are the leaders of new technology, not only in Europe but the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh" hpid="Mr. Ardagh Mr. Ardagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill. This is important legislation which provides the foundation for all the legislation necessary to facilitate the growth of electronic commerce and electronic transactions in Ireland. The Bill deals in particular with the legal framework for the development of electronic commerce. In this context, it clarifies that &ldquo;writing&rdquo; shall be construed as including electronic writing, for the purposes of the interpretation of other laws.</P>
      <P>Many laws refer to writing &ldquo;under hand&rdquo; and under section 2(2), electronic writing shall also be deemed to be writing &ldquo;under hand&rdquo;. This will lead us in the direction of a penless society where all communications will be electronic. When one thinks of the pen, one normally thinks of schooling. We have an opportunity in this information age to eliminate the digital divide. For too long, people such as those in Dublin South-Central, particularly the south-west inner city where third level participation in education is minimal, have been denied equal opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a vision of every home, office and business in the country having fibre-optic wireless connectivity. I have a vision of every child, from first class in primary school through to university, being given a laptop or schoolbag computer with wireless local area network connectivity. A local area network of schools, libraries, local health boards, local authorities and local community and family affairs offices would be provided. I see <Col N="697" /> every child doing his or her homework on computer. I see every parent being able to access local services by using their children's computer. If the child is working at home, in school or at the local library, their computer will always be connected to the local area network through the wireless connectivity.</P>
    <P>How can this vision be financed and operated? A national backbone of cables is being installed by Iarnród Éireann, the ESB and the National Roads Authority, with the fibre being leased to internet service providers and telecommunications companies at an economic price. A separate utility company could be set up, funded by the telecommunications companies and the internet service providers to wire the last mile, so to speak, with assistance from the Government for remote rural connections and tax incentives for the less remote areas. The local loop would have to be completely unbundled to allow for full competition. In this regard, I am delighted the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, yesterday announced her plans to introduce legislation to provide for the early unbundling of the local loop. This effectively means liberalising the final length of copper wire which runs into local telephone exchanges. It is also necessary, when considering unbundling of the local loop, to ensure the fibres that cable companies are putting into homes are unbundled and can be accessed by other ISPs and telephone companies.</P>
    <P>Eircom has stated that their telephone exchanges are crowded and there is no room for others to come on board. When the legislation promised by the Minister is introduced, any land adjacent to telephone exchanges will become valuable because it will be necessary for the location of equipment provided by companies other than Eircom. That is a pointer for anyone with land adjacent to exchanges.</P>
    <P>What would be the result if a computer was provided for every child, home, office and school? Every person in the country would have full, unfettered access to the best broadband services available. Ireland would be positioned at the forefront of the Information Age, ready to assume global leadership in electronic commerce and the digital industries. It would significantly increase the number of jobs which would inevitably be created in the &ldquo;infotainment&rdquo; sector, driven by the massive demand for good quality content. The recent AOL and Time Warner merger is evidence of the importance of this sector.</P>
    <P>The cost to the Government, based on recent Swedish costings, would be approximately £2.1 billion, which is about £1.8 billion for the State's share of the fibre cost and £300 million for computers for our one million schoolchildren and university students. The price of computers will come down dramatically when looking for one million, one for every child in the country. There would be further local costs to set up the local area networks, which could be financed at local level. The total package would cost less than the moneys raised on the flotation of Eircom last year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="698" /> On a more parochial level, the hard-pressed investors in Eircom would see a significant increase in the value of their investment as it would be the largest player in a much expanded market. There is an opportunity to successfully fight the battle against deprivation, exclusion and the digital divide while at the same time leaping forward into the information age.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill provides for the fundamental principle that information shall not be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability solely on the grounds that it is in electronic form. This will be a jolt to the legal system. The archaic ways in which the legal system operates will be totally revamped and the operation will be like reinventing the wheel. There is an impression that judges will be appalled at the radical transformation the legal system will have to go through. However, barristers widely use computers in a most effective manner. The information methods available at the tribunals of inquiry in Dublin Castle are at the leading edge of technology. The Committee of Public Accounts' DIRT inquiry would not have been as effective without the tremendous capabilities of information technology and its mastery by the staff of the committee secretariat.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill provides that documentation such as wills, trusts and enduring powers of attorney are excluded. One wonders why this is so. Allowing exclusions like this appears to defeat the whole purpose of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I note that it is the intention to extend the electronic commerce enabling provision of this legislation to all excluded laws as soon as this is feasible. This is very desirable. I would like to see a target date put on the implementation of the new provisions that would be necessary in this regard.</P>
    <P>Section 12 states that the information must be accessible in electronic form and that the software and hardware that might be necessary to render such information readable should be retained. I hope one would be allowed to transfer the information into an updated version compatible with new advanced hardware and software. In this regard, there is a need to ensure that software upgrades protect the integrity of the electronic information.</P>
    <P>Public bodies can set down requirements when receiving information, and these can be based in law. This is different to private bodies who may set out terms and conditions, but these would not be backed up by law. This emphasises the responsibility of public bodies and Government generally to lead in the development of e-commerce, and not only to lead but to coax and convert those private bodies with which they do business to transact that business electronically. Deputy Naughten mentioned a few moments ago the great challenge of getting the SMEs up to speed as quickly as possible in this technology. This is not just for the sake of doing business electronically but because it allows for freer competition, transparency, faster transaction times, much greater efficiency and, in the final analysis, <Col N="699" /> will allow for more prudent spending of taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>Government should, in the near future, include e-procurement. Broadly similar e-procurement should be installed in Government Departments, local authorities, health boards, vocational education committees and semi-State bodies. A State virtual private network should allow access by the different agencies to supplies, products and prices so that the best deal can be achieved across the board by all of the different agencies. This system would be suited only to suppliers who could interface electronically with the agencies. Notices could be put in the newspapers and sent to all suppliers that tendered for goods in the past that from a certain date, say, 1 October 2000, all procurement for future supplies would be done openly and transparently by an e-procurement system. That would certainly get the SMEs up to speed quickly. This would allow for different firms to quote different prices, offering different levels of service, be it JIT &ndash;&lsquo;just-in-time' facilities &ndash; special delivery times or any other special facilities.</P>
    <P>As the number of companies who do business with the Government is huge, the number of companies that would gear up and offer an electronic platform would also be huge. The competitors of these companies in the non-State area would also have to get up to speed and install e-commerce solutions if they wished to compete on an equal basis.</P>
    <P>One of the benefits of an e-procurement system in Government is that it would allow a reduction in the cost of finding suppliers of particular items, improved information measurement and management, improved communication between suppliers and buyers, eliciting information about supply market participants and trends, providing strategic information to those involved in purchasing within the agencies, reducing transaction processing costs, especially for low value easy-to-access items, managing or reducing holding costs of stocks, improving the controls and compliance with procurement policies.</P>
    <P>More specifically, electronic commerce can be used to automate many procurement processes by offering flexibility and utilising any back-end systems to automate purchasing of commodities through the use of agency-wide electronic contracts, allowing self-service buying. Internal users <i>via</i> the use of electronic catalogues could requisition direct from authorised suppliers. Right across all of the agencies and all the Government Departments there will be no difficulty because in respect of authorised suppliers who supply pens, for example, all those pens will be bought at the price in the contract, the same price, by all those Departments.</P>
    <P>It would allow ongoing data gathering and performance monitoring, providing real-time activity reports on commodity expenditure by cost centres within agencies. It will allow information sharing between agencies by e-mail. For example, <Col N="700" /> information on supplier&ndash;held stock levels, price changes, new products and lead times. It would allow the generation of comparative statistics and figures which would help the Committee of Public Accounts for instance, in its work in seeing whether taxpayers' money is being spent wisely.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides that an electronic signature can be used to meet the requirement of a written signature. This is the core of the legislation. Along with the use of advanced electronic signatures and qualified certification for witnessing and sealing documents, it is innovative and most welcome.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides that a contract may be concluded using electronic communications, and lays down the principle that a contract may not be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability solely on the grounds that it is in electronic form. This brings Ireland to the forefront of electronic commerce, ahead of the UK and the US.</P>
    <P>The use of electronic contracts raises the question of privacy of communication. Alan Greenspan, who is the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board in the States, at the Conference on Privacy in the Information Age stated: &ldquo;It is clear, however, that security and privacy will be very important if confidence is to be established in these new systems.&rdquo;  Consumers should have the right to choose whether a firm can share electronic signature information with third parties and affiliated firms. Data collected by way of electronic signature should not be allowed to be used for any purpose other than the purpose intended by the individual when signing. Data hoarding and data mining or using these signatures as personal identification numbers to trace or to track across cyberspace is a terrifying vista. This is where one big computer will hold all of the information that has ever been signed off by anyone on an electronic signature. That must not be allowed.</P>
    <P>The Constitution does not explicitly protect the right to privacy. The Supreme Court has ruled that privacy is protected under Article 40.3.1 which states: &ldquo;The State guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.&rdquo;  The Supreme Court in 1987 found that the right to privacy is one of the fundamental personal rights of the citizen and flows from the Christian and democratic system, and that the nature of the right to privacy is such that it must ensure the freedom and dignity of the individual in a democratic society. This cannot be ensured if his communications, whether written or telephonic are deliberately and unjustifiably interfered with. This right to privacy should pervade all the workings of the information age.</P>
    <P>Along with privacy, there is the question of interception of Irish data communication by foreign spy agencies. Irish telecom companies should be mandated to ensure that all precautions are taken and that the necessary equipment is put in place to avoid unlawful or third party interception of communications. In the <i>Irish Independent</i><Col N="701" /> in July 1999 Duncan Campbell and Paul Lashburn had an article on how Britain eavesdropped on Dublin. The Ministry of Defence had a mysterious 150 foot high tower, an electronic test facility situated in a BNFL site at Cappenhurst in Cheshire. Locals did not know what dark secret this tower held. It happens to be in a direct line of sight between the telecommunications mast on Three Rock Mountain and the BT receiving site in the UK. It is ideally situated to intercept all telephonic communications between Ireland and the UK. It was alleged in that article that there was an interconnection of the BT network with the new £25 million sterling eavesdropping facility. It is alleged also that there is a hardware connection into GCHQ in Cheltenham for interception purposes and that there is a determined effort being made to MI5 to stop everyone from using high-class improved encryption levels. Ireland is leading the way, as was seen at a recent conference in the Berkeley Court Hotel on mobile commerce.</P>

    <Title>Private Members Business. - Government Policies: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy John Bruton on Tuesday, 27 June 2000:</P>
    <P Just="Center">That Dáil Éireann:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;noting that the Government's economic policy lacks coherence and foresight and that the latest inflation rate of 5.2%, which is the highest level for 15 years and three times the EU average, is threatening the stability of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and is impacting most severely on the most vulnerable people in society particularly pensioners and those on fixed income;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;aware that if current trends continue, the average peak hour travel speeds in the Dublin area will fall from 14 km per hour now to just 8 km per hour by 2016 which will result in huge economic, social and environmental costs; and that demand for public transport will increase by 450% over the same period;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;noting that in the absence of any coherent spatial planning, house prices have risen by 70% over the past three years, putting home ownership beyond the reach of most first time buyers, and that during the same period rents have doubled and local authority housing lists have increased by 40%;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;conscious that since this Government took office there is a deepening crisis in the health services, evidenced by an increase of 18% in hospital waiting lists, the fact that over 14,000 adults and children have been waiting for over a year for a hospital bed, the shortage of nurses and doctors and industrial <Col N="702" /> unrest and low morale among medical and paramedical staff;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;concerned about the rise in violent crime, with 30 deaths in the first half of the year, and the growing level of public disorder and attacks in public places;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;noting the fact that the Government has failed to produce a comprehensive child care package and has introduced tax policies that are divisive between families;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;noting that the Government's environmental policies are failing to deal with crucial issues such as waste disposal and Ireland's international obligations to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;aware that despite numerous promises, the Government has failed to publish new ethics legislation and the Taoiseach has been dilatory and evasive in dealing with problems concerning former Deputy Ray Burke, Deputy Denis Foley and Deputy John Ellis;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;recognising the widespread public outrage regarding the Government's decision to nominate Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty to the position of Vice President of the European Investment Bank, despite the acknowledgement by the Taoiseach that Mr. O'Flaherty has questions to answer in relation to his role in the Sheedy case;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;noting the recent public comments made by the Tánaiste which may have profoundly damaging implications for a current criminal trial,</P>
    <P Just="Center">condemns the Government's abject failure to adequately address any of the fundamental problems facing the country.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P Just="Center">To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;notes the major progress made over the past three years in addressing fundamental issues of concern to all communities throughout the country and in particular:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the restoration of ceasefires, the negotiation and implementation of an agreement which can help build a lasting and just peace and the major breakthrough on arms achieved this week;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the implementation of employment action plans and economic policies which have led to the creation of almost 300,000 jobs, a dramatic reduction of unemployment from 10% to 4.6% and of long-term unemployment from 5% to 1.7%;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the publication and funding of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 which provides the blueprint for sustainable social and economic development <Col N="703" /> and the first serious targeting of resources towards developing all regions;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the decision to prepare the first ever national spatial strategy;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the provision of £20 billion for the development of public infrastructure, such as roads, public transport, water and waste-water services, environmental protection, telecommunications, energy, housing and health;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the provision of over £250 million as part of the first ever national child care package;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the increase of pensions by £18 compared to £7 during the previous Government's term;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the introduction of tax cuts, which have meant real increases in take home pay for all sections of the labour force;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the implementation of an unprecedented programme to reform and develop local government;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the publication, this week, of the Standards in Public Offices Bill, 2000, which will provide a permanent mechanism for addressing allegations against office holders and the preparation of a series of other measures;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the implementation of a series of initiatives which have increased the number of housing units being built by almost one-third and have provided almost £7 billion for a multi-annual social housing programme;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the development of an integrated policy to improve traffic management in Dublin;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the unprecedented decrease in crime figures of 21%;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the increase of direct funding of schools by almost two-thirds, the hiring of 2,500 new teachers, the reduction of primary class sizes to their lowest ever level and the provision of unprecedented supports for pupils with special needs;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the successful negotiation of Agenda 2000 and the restoration of live cattle trade and the creation of positive conditions which will underpin farm incomes into the future;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the introduction of the highest minimum wage in Europe;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the increase in health funding by an unprecedented 56% and treatment of 70,000 more people per annum; and</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the fact that this progress has been achieved over a short period and involved replacing the record of a previous Government which <i>inter alia</i>:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;failed to tackle the crime problem;</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="704" />&ndash;refused to take any measure to address housing shortages;</P>

    <P Just="Center">&ndash;froze school funding and voted to cutback teacher numbers;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;implemented child care policies which have caused a reduction in child care places; and</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá an-áthas orm a bheith anseo anocht mar Theachta Dála tofa ar son muintir Thiobraid Árann Theas. Beidh mé ag labhairt sa Teach ar son ghnáth-dhaoine atá dearmadta ag an Rialtas agus ag an Celtic tiger, agus go mór mhór ar son muintir Thiobraid Árann Theas agus na bailte ansin, cosúil le Carrick-on-Suir, Tiobrad Árann agus Caiseal Mumhan, áit a bhfuil monarcha folamh le fada an lá, atá dearmadta ag an Rialtas agus ag an Celtic tiger. Tá mé ag cuidiú le rún Fhine Gael.</P>
      <P>By refusing to bring Hugh O'Flaherty before a committee of the House to explain his position, the Government is continuing to show complete disregard for the widespread concern at the implications of his appointment. The public wishes to know whether the existence of a two-tiered society is being maintained by the Government and by sections of the Judiciary. Are disgraced individuals and vested interests in a position to blow the whistle on leading politicians? These questions are being widely asked throughout the country and the public wants answers.</P>
      <P>My vote does not at all mean I have confidence in the Opposition parties. The tax amnesty was co-sponsored by the Labour Party in Government while Fine Gael Ministers for Finance turned a blind eye to widespread tax evasion by the rich through bogus non-resident accounts. All three parties are responsible for the two-tiered society and that is why they lost the South Tipperary by-election.</P>
      <P>The message from South Tipperary is that people are no longer prepared to tolerate a two-tiered society. I received thousands of votes from traditional supporters of all parties. It became very clear to me that there is a deep anger among Fianna Fáil supporters in particular. Thousands of honest people who have worked hard for their communities, who never got or expected any reward, are enraged that their loyal service to Fianna Fáil should have been so abused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the economic field the gap between the two tiers in our society has widened under the past three Governments. It is shameful that according to a recent UNICEF report one in four of our <Col N="705" /> children under 14 years of age continues to live in poverty despite a budget surplus of £6 billion. Every Deputy should blush with shame on hearing the appeals of the child poverty initiative today on radio. For too long the rich and powerful have formed the golden circle and it is now time we made our children our golden circle. Let us do the right thing for once. Let us not adjourn the House until child benefit has been raised to European levels of around £100 per month per child.</P>
    <P>The recently announced Government measures to combat inflation and rising prices are completely insufficient. Social welfare benefits and the minimum wage must be raised immediately to compensate for the huge increases in inflation, which is expected to rise further to 6% in the coming month.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have also maintained a two-tiered approach to economic development. The constituencies of Ministers have been given high priority while entire regions have been neglected. In effect, a system of political patronage operates. In South Tipperary we have missed out on decentralisation and on the priority development areas announced in the 1997 budget by the previous Government. Now, we are to lose out on the 8,500 incubator high tech jobs recently announced by the Government. It is not surprising that the small areas research unit at Trinity College recently found that almost 50%, or 36,000 people, in South Tipperary live in areas designated as deprived, including Carrick-on-Suir, Tipperary Town, Cashel, Fethard and Ballingarry.</P>
    <P>The people of South Tipperary have sent me here to demand honesty and justice in public affairs and fair play in the allocation of resources and I will spare no effort on their behalf.</P>

      <P>The Government hopes the people have very short memories, but it seems the Government is suffering from terminal amnesia. On RTE radio this evening the Tánaiste denied she said the O'Flaherty affair would be forgotten in three months. However, when the tape was replayed her words were clear: &ldquo;We must move on. I will predict three and four months from now will anybody remember this?&rdquo;. The meaning could not be plainer, and it is a measure of the state of the coalition Government that the Tánaiste could seek to deny it in her first public comment since the judgment in the Haughey case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the motion and will also support the motion of &ldquo;no confidence&rdquo; in the Government. As a member of a health board and a public representative who has daily experience of the many shortcomings of our health services, I want to focus on health issues in the short time available to me. I acknowledge that progress and improvements have taken place in many areas. The spending commitments in the national development plan are sound. However, what has not changed and what daily grows more glaring is the <Col N="706" /> growth in inequality in our health services. Health is for sale as a commodity in Ireland today &ndash; that is the sad fact. A constituent recently told me she was informed by a specialist that she could avoid a two year waiting list if she paid a hefty extra sum in fees. If a person has the wealth to avail of expensive private care he or she need not worry about escalating waiting lists. The health care services are only one example of the failures of the Government over three years. It is a shocking indictment and must be addressed.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> The entity which purports to run the State cannot be described as a Government. We have a discredited Fianna Fáil Party with increasing numbers of terrified backbenchers resting on ten wobbly legs, four nervous members of the Progressive Democrats, four pseudo-Independents and two strays from Fianna Fáil, cast &ndash; temporarily at least &ndash; into the wilds. The real nature of Fianna Fáil, the main component of this excuse for a Government, was dramatically displayed today at the Moriarty tribunal when a former chief fundraiser explained how the party opened shop in the plush Westbury Hotel three weeks before a general election and from 9 a.m. until late at night party personnel received the rich and powerful as they came to give large financial contributions to assist Fianna Fáil. Big businessmen, developers and builders &ndash; and no doubt speculators and hucksters of all kinds &ndash; lined up to buy their way into the favour of the party which they hoped would form the Government and repay them through policies favourable to them. Is it any wonder the Government sat on its hands while the very same cabal is responsible for the terrible housing crisis because of profiteering?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Deputy Healy and congratulate him on his maiden speech. I hope he will have many happy years in the House. I look forward to his further contributions and to listening and talking to him. One could not help but share in the huge joy of his wife and young family on the day of the count.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak about public transport. On taking office I found a public transport system in urgent need of investment. There was no strategy for its development and revitalisation. There was also a serious situation in relation to rail safety and an absence of any serious analysis of the need for institutional and regulatory reform. During the past three years I have addressed each of these issues with the full support of my colleagues in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The clearest possible evidence of the Govern<Col N="707" /> ment's determination to improve public transport is to be seen in the national development plan which sets out a clear strategy for its development and provides for an unprecedented level of investment, totalling £2.2 billion over the seven years to 2006. The strategy has three principal elements: a £1.6 billion investment programme to radically transform the public transport and traffic management systems in the greater Dublin area; a £500 million investment programme to revitalise the rail network, and a £150 million regional public transport programme.</P>
    <P>We commissioned the first ever independent review of rail safety. The Government acted rapidly approving a five year £430 million rail safety programme for which the Exchequer is providing almost £180 million in 1999 and 2000. I have put in place a system of independent and transparent rail safety audits and announced a framework for the independent regulation of rail safety.</P>
    <P>Under the Cabinet committee we are developing a radical programme of institutional and regulatory reform to complement the investment strategy. I have published the two papers which were approved in principle by the committee, one on a new institutional framework for public transport and the other on the regulation of the bus market in Dublin. These are the subject of consultation with the public transport partnership forum and, having taken account of its views, will provide a framework for action on institutional and regulatory reform.</P>
    <P>On taking office we revitalised and gave new direction to the Dublin light rail project. I published an indicative timetable and established an independent action advisory group to monitor implementation of the project in accordance with the timetable. We acted with great urgency in response to the DTO short-term action plan in mid-1998 and gave approval to the immediate purchase of 150 additional buses and the upgrading of rail services. We convinced the European Commission to co-finance buses for the first time and provided Exchequer support for bus and rail investment. An investment of more than £70 million was approved at that time.</P>
    <P>We have provided £1.6 billion for public transport investment in the greater Dublin area. This will allow for substantial expansion and development of the bus network, the implementation of the light rail network, the enhancement of suburban rail services, the improved integration of public transport services and better traffic management. There are 225 buses for delivery this year, of which 125 will be additions and 100, replacements. An order for 60 suburban rail cars was placed recently for use in suburban services. This is in addition to the 20 on order for delivery this year. The Estimates for 2000 provide for Exchequer capital grants of £235 million.</P>
    <P>We are also planning for the future. The Dublin Transportation Office is nearing completion of its work on an updated transportation strategy for the period to 2016. The figures quoted in the <Col N="708" /> motion have been taken from the DTO's work and identify what would happen if nothing was done up to 2016. We will work immediately on the DTO's recommendations. The DTO's work is being assisted by two recently completed studies, the strategic rail study of the development of the suburban rail network which I asked CIE to commission and the bus network review which sets out a plan for its development and expansion. Clearly these studies and the DTO work will have implications for the investment programme under the national development plan.</P>
    <P>I published a policy paper on the introduction of market forces into the bus service in the greater Dublin area &ndash; I thank the Opposition for its support &ndash; which proposes to introduce franchising on a phased basis. The Cabinet infrastructural committee approved my proposals in principle and I will shortly seek formal Government endorsement for them. As a first step additional route licences will issue next week and Dublin Bus will expand subcontracting of its services having recently reached agreement with the trade unions. In the autumn the Cabinet committee will complete its work on the institutional and regulatory framework by addressing the institutional arrangements for transport in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that people will look on this as the period within which the Government took far-sighted decisions which charted the future for a renewed and revitalised public transport system. I challenge Fine Gael to point to a similar record during its period in office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I was appalled and outraged at the performance of the leader of the main Opposition party, Deputy Bruton, in the House this morning when he alleged that this was a Government of sleaze. At a time when there is no allegation against any member of the Government in relation to any matter connected to corruption, it was an extraordinary statement, from a man who said at the beef tribunal in June 1992 that he might have received contributions personally at election times but that &ldquo;these contributions were not sought by me at all, entirely unsolicited, but people would just make contributions which would be used towards the local campaign, or passed on to party headquarters.&rdquo;  He further said that there was &ldquo;no systematic informing of politicians of contributions . not even the party leader of the time.&rdquo;  He admitted at the Dunnes tribunal in April 1997 that he did personally seek funds from Ben Dunne in 1991 and said, &ldquo;. . . in the circumstances of early 1991 I did become involved in seeking contributions directly from business.&rdquo;  These two statements are directly contradictory. I therefore advise the Leader of Fine Gael to give over the fascism and produce a few policy documents if he is to convince the people that he is fit for government. That kind of smear tactic will not work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition motion before the House is as <Col N="709" /> good a piece of sham parliamentary tactics as one will find in a parliamentary democracy anywhere in the free world. It has originated from a party which has over-reached itself yet again in its anxiety to demonstrate to the public its preparedness for government. If this is the best it can offer to the people as an alternative to the most successful Government in the history of the State I am afraid that its tenancy on the benches opposite is destined to be a long one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

      <P>What about Hugh O'Flaherty?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Opposition has sought to criticise the Government's anti-crime policies and its unprecedented programme for child care. Throughout my tenure as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform I have reiterated that there are three essential components to the Government's policy on tackling crime: a clear and determined focus on tackling those engaged in crime; a determination that the law enforcement agencies will be properly equipped and resourced to deal with crime, and a commitment to address and, where possible, ameliorate the causes of crime. As a Government we are unyielding in this approach.</P>
      <P>This three pronged approach to tackling crime is working and we are well on the way to achieving the ambitious targets set three years ago on entering government. Perhaps the most significant example of this is that indictable crime has fallen by more than 21% in the three years since we took office. No one can dispute that this is a sizeable achievement.</P>
      <P>This fall in crime did not happen by itself. It was the result of a number of initiatives and innovative legislation which I introduced to tackle crime and make our streets safer. It happened as a result of the Government's determination on entering office, to fight crime as never before and to ensure the incoherent and incompetent efforts of the rainbow Government's attempt at fighting it remained a distant memory.</P>
      <P>Alongside the drop in crime, the detection rate for recorded crimes has increased significantly in recent years. Ireland has a detection rate of 44% compared to 21% in the US and 26% in the UK. We have one of the world's highest reporting ratios. This has come about due to a number of factors, including the priority given to the funding and resourcing of the Garda Síochána. Since taking office we have increased the strength of the Garda Síochána from a base line of 10,800. The number of gardaí has now increased to 11,458 and is on target to reach the planned strength of 12,000 by 2002. Furthermore, the Estimate for the Garda Vote has increased from £472 million in 1997 to £671.6 million for 2000, while the overall Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform budget has increased from £698 million under the last Administration to £1 billion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year I launched the Garda high speed boat to police the inland waterways and ordered a second helicopter for the Air support <Col N="710" /> Unit. These resources allow the Garda Síochána to police the streets, waterways and airspace as never before. It is also my intention to finalise the provision of 1,300 extra prison places by the end of the year, with Government approval secured for an additional 700 prison places. This has enabled me to bring into force all of the provisions of the Bail Act, which is finally putting an end to the so-called revolving door syndrome and will ensure that those apprehended by the Garda are punished accordingly.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau, which was established consequential upon the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, which I introduced from the Opposition benches, is having unprecedented success. Within the framework of extensive criminal legislation, including the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, and increased resourcing and funding of the Garda Síochána, criminals are being brought to justice and are paying for their crimes on a scale hitherto unknown. Today in the House, my Department's 31st Bill since I took up office was passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>It coincides with the 31 murders since Christmas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>While the mechanisms and the legislation are in place to tackle crime, it is equally important to tackle the causes of crime and prevent young people entering the downward spiral that so often marks a life of crime. Social inclusion is a theme that runs at the heart of the Government. With this in mind I introduced a number of measures in an attempt to ensure that young people have an alternative to a life of crime. It is imperative that today's children and young people have a chance to develop and participate as fully integrated members of society. In this regard I introduced the Children Bill, which is a blueprint for the development of the new juvenile justice system. The new Bill updates and reforms the law and takes a realistic but humane approach to juveniles who get involved in anti-social and criminal activities. I have also greatly increased the resources available for the Garda youth diversion schemes, which have proved very successful in diverting young people from criminal activity. Other crime prevention measures include the continued funding of crime prevention projects under the umbrella of the probation and welfare service.</P>
      <P>As the sponsors of this opportunistic motion, Fine Gael is seeking to exorcise the ghosts of the middle 1990s as the party sat on its hands and wailed helplessly as crime spiralled out of control. It cut the party to the core. Fine Gael, the self styled party of law and order, lost the plot and its nerve when its rainbow colleagues balked at taking the measures my party proposed as necessary and appropriate. The poodles of Government have attempted to become the rottweilers of Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today and over the past three years the Government has instilled a new sense of urgency, <Col N="711" /> self confidence and hope into the criminal justice system. Of course there are difficulties. I would be the last to deny that. However, we are fully engaged in the task, with a sense of purpose and a clear focus. Unlike the rainbow Government, which floundered and thrashed around like a headless chicken by way of responding to the crime crisis, we remain on course and undiminished in our determination to tackle crime.</P>
    <P>One would have thought that having pored over the entrails of the 1997 general election, Fine Gael would have got the message loud and clear. However, since then, the party has attempted to oppose and thwart the Government's consistent and successful anti-crime policies. Fine Gael is no longer a party of law and order, it is a party of smear, smoke-screens and it is without policy or direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The priority afforded by the Government to the housing area is clear. We must both address social housing needs and help create the conditions where those who seek to own their homes have a chance to do so. Housing is not a short-term issue and we must implement sustainable solutions which last over generations.</P>
      <P>The Government has prioritised the development of a modern, efficient and effective planning system. We are preparing a national spatial development strategy, which will identify broad spatial development patterns for areas and will attempt to deliver more balanced development between and within different regions. Strategic planning guidelines have already been launched by the Government, which will form the basis of a development strategy for the overall Dublin and mid-east region.</P>
      <P>Residential density guidelines were issued by the Department of the Environment and Local Government to all planning authorities last September. Local authorities and An Bord Pleanála have taken on board the principles set out in the guidelines. The Planning and Development Bill, 1999, has extended and updated the planning code and contains a fundamental development in Irish planning law. Part V requires local authorities to prepare housing strategies, addressing the housing needs in their area covered in their development plan, including the need for social and affordable housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national development plan, published last November, provides for massively increased investment in economic infrastructure, such as road, water, sewerage services and public trans<Col N="712" /> port, which are all essential to support housing development in the period 2000-06 and beyond. Never before has State investment in water, sewerage services, roads and other services, required for the opening up of building land for development, been increased so substantially as it has been by the Government since it took office. For example, funding for water and sewerage services has increased from £163 million in 1997 to almost £290 million, an increase of 78%.</P>
    <P>The degree to which the Government's investment in housing and related infrastructure is yielding positive results in a period of extraordinary and unprecedented growth in housing demand should not be under estimated. Measures taken by the Government has led to us achieving a record housing output of 46,512 units nationally in 1999. The indications are that the upper trend in new house completions is set to continue. We are building new houses at by far the highest rate in Europe in relation to our population and at five times the rate being achieved by our nearest neighbour, the UK.</P>
    <P>In spite of continuing high demand, the effects of increased output are reflected in moderating house price trends since house price inflation peaked in 1998. Average prices for the first quarter of this year in Dublin are showing reductions of 1.1% and 2.7% for both new and secondhand houses respectively, the first time that prices have dropped since 1995. Year on year, new and second hand house prices rose by 13% and 14% nationally, the lowest increase since 1996.</P>
    <P>We have for the first time provided a long-term framework for the funding of social and affordable housing through the inclusion of £6 billion in the national development plan. Funding under this heading and for housing related infrastructure was further increased by £984 million in the Action on Housing programme, announced two weeks ago, again reflecting the Government's commitment to tackle social and affordable housing need. This investment will ensure that the housing needs of almost 100,000 households will be met with Government assistance over the period of the plan.</P>
    <P>We have provided for an increase of 6,000 starts in the local authority housing programme, with funding for 41,500 starts over the plan period, front loaded to meet existing demand more quickly. A multi-annual approach to the local government housing programme has been adopted which will allow for greater forward planning and efficiencies of scale in delivering the increased target for 25,000 additional local authority houses to be started over the coming four years.</P>
    <P>When I became Minister of State with responsibility for housing, the voluntary sector was practically on its knees because the funding available had not kept pace with the increase in building and tender costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The levels of assistance available for the provision of voluntary housing has been increased substantially on two occasions, in November 1997 and October 1999, to take account of rising construction costs and to stimulate greater activity in the voluntary housing sector. In addition, for the first time, additional assistance for site acquisition costs by voluntary bodies was introduced, a very significant step. These steps have resulted in significant increases at local level in the voluntary housing sector, with output expected to reach 1,000 units this year, double the 1998 output.</P>
      <P>The Government is also fully committed to tackling the problem of homelessness and recently launched an integrated strategy on homelessness which offers a new approach to the way in which services for the homeless are to be planned, funded and provided. This strategy aims to provide an integrated response from all the statutory and voluntary agencies providing services to the homeless. The Government has made substantial current and capital funding available to ensure that the measures outlined in the strategy are implemented and are effective.</P>
      <P>The Government's response to overall housing needs forms a coherent, connected strategy response. I have outlined some of the range of actions being taken by the Government across the housing spectrum. The recent action by the Government in conjunction with the series of measures already in place will result in further moderation of house price increases, and involve a more effective provision of social and affordable housing and the establishment of a pattern of balanced growth.</P>

      <P>I will address specifically the health elements of the Opposition motion. This is a frivolous and vexatious motion which flies in the face of the facts regarding the Government's record on health services. As a member of the board of Beaumont Hospital, I can claim some insight and practical experience of what we are doing on this vital issue. From time to time at board meetings I have questioned Mr. Pat Lyons, the chief executive who is doing a great job there, because there is a spin being put by the Opposition that the Government is not giving the financial assistance and aid required to the hospital. He stated categorically to me that the hospital received all the financial assistance it required and finance is not a problem. It is contemptible of the Opposition to play scare politics with health and the lives of ordinary people in a vain attempt to secure short-term electoral advantage. It is both nauseating and hypocritical.</P>

      <P>I will touch briefly on four topics: health spending, hospital waiting lists, the nurses issue and tobacco. In 2000, the total spending on health amounts £4.222 billion. This represents an increase of 14%.</P>

      <P>I will outline a number of facts. The capital allocation for 2000 is £321 million, an increase of 35% on 1999. This is the first year of the national development plan, which has committed £2 billion for the period 2000-2006 in respect of the capital programme for health. This is almost a trebling of the capital funding in the period 1993-99. This year there will be an increase of £95 million for people with disabilities. This represents a 116% rise over 1999.</P>
      <P>What are we doing to reduce the waiting lists?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brady:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is providing for the validation of existing information, the maximum utilisation of all capacity in the system, the flexible use of resources and a more focused effort in implementing the range of medium and long-term measures affecting the hospital and non-hospital sectors recommended in the 1998 report of the expert group.</P>
      <P>On the nurses issue, the Government's priority is to press ahead with the agenda recommended by the Commission on Nursing. This will be done in partnership with all of the key players involved, including SIPTU. The monitoring committee has been established to review progress on a quarterly basis on the implementation of the report of the Commission on Nursing. The National Council for Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery has been established to develop new clinical career pathways for nurses and midwives involving the creation of clinical specialists and advanced practitioner posts. There is also an increase in the number of nurse training places. This year 300 extra nurse training places will be created, bringing the total to 1,500 training places in new schools of nursing. These have been established at Castlebar, Tralee and Monaghan. These are all facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of tobacco, the Government takes cigarette addiction very seriously. We should attack this killer with some virulence as we attacked tuberculosis in the 1940s and 1950s and because 30% of all cancers are linked to smoking. Cigarettes kill and we will do everything in our power to reduce tobacco addiction. The strategy <Col N="715" /> funded by £12 million in 2000, which will have the full effect of £21 million in 2001, is funded from taxation on cigarettes. That, in itself, is a positive step.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion comes at a time when the Government, having been in perpetual crisis, is now in a deepening new crisis. We have seen a serious loss of its authority and we now see stripped bare, the one remaining goal of the Government which is to hang on to power for its own sake. It is now a lame duck Government <Col N="717" /> which has lost all credibility and that situation is worsening daily.</P>
      <P>Her holiness, the Tánaiste, has been shown to have feet of clay with two body blows being dealt to her in the past week. One was the Haugh judgment which shows the injudicious nature of her remarks about Mr. Haughey. This comes hard on the heels of her lack of judgment in not having any reservations about the appointment of the former Supreme Court judge, Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty, to the board of the European Investment Bank.</P>
      <P>This is nothing compared to the tailspin Fianna Fáil is in. The latest evidence of that is its candidate's elimination in the recent by-election on 22% of the vote and this in the party heartland of south Tipperary. We have seen from the time of the difficulties of the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Ray Burke, a daily dose of difficulties from the tribunals and an ever-increasing number of newly established Independent Deputies of Fianna Fáil origin who are bolstering the Government. The previous election saw Fianna Fáil receive its second worst result in the history of the State. I confidently predict it will receive its worst ever in the next election.</P>
      <P>What does it have to show after three years in Government? It has taken short-term options every time. There have been neither structural policies, serious structural reforms in the economy nor a spatial plan. The bedrock of the economy is competitiveness, yet we now have an inflation rate of 5.2%, which is the highest in 20 years, the highest in the EU and three times the European average. This will be the seed of decline of the terrific growth Fianna Fáil inherited from the rainbow Government.</P>
      <P>In terms of the lives of ordinary people, it is more difficult to get to work and it takes longer to get through traffic. The gap between what people can afford for a house and the price of houses, which has increased by more than 70%, speaks for itself. The Government has done little or nothing to improve the lot of people on local authority housing waiting lists. Planning permission applications are fraught with delay because local authorities cannot recruit enough planning staff, and this is symptomatic of the overall labour shortage in the economy. In a hospital in my constituency, long-term patients are taken out of day beds every morning to let in day patients and they are put back again in the evening. Such is the pressure on beds, not to speak of the waiting lists for orthopaedic and other vital surgery. In terms of child care, the Government has commissioned endless reports but has done nothing to make it more affordable by increasing the supply side of child care nor has it adopted the Fine Gael proposal of doubling the child benefit for children up to five years of age. In waste management, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has lectured local authorities but has copped out himself in terms of a future strategy to deal with this critical area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nowhere is the failure of the Government <Col N="718" /> more evident than in the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke. Only now a major debacle is emerging regarding Eircom. We have come a long way from dizzy heights of the balloons and champagne corks this time last year when Eircom shares were launched at 3.90. Today, that price has fallen to 2.68, which is sickening for the 500,000 people who bought shares. We now discover that the Minister refused to put in place a share option scheme for management, which means its performance will be assessed on any improvement of the share price over 2.68 instead of 3.90. It will be rewarded because she failed to put in place a share option system.</P>
    <P>The traffic gridlock speaks for itself. Given the failure over the past three years, it is utterly predictable that we will see peak hour traffic in Dublin from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. and from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. reduced to a slow walking pace of 8 kilometres an hour from 14 kilometres an hour. Essential decisions need to be taken such as putting a single Minister in charge of transport and setting up a proper Dublin transport authority which can take charge of Operation Freeflow, the Dublin Bus subvention and all aspects of traffic management. We need someone with whom the buck stops. The Government has failed to implement the quality bus corridors and the park and ride facilities to make them work. The port tunnel has still not been constructed. There is no better example of the Government's transport policy than Luas. When it came into office, the proposal was dropped and then reinstated but with a tunnel for which money was not provided. The Government has spoken about extending it to the airport, yet by the end of its tenure in office, the lines to Tallaght and Dundrum will not have been built.</P>
    <P>The Government is now on borrowed time. An election is the only way to clear the air. If we do not have it in the lifetime of this session, it will happen before the year is out.</P>

        <b>:</b> The year 2000 has been the most violent since we established a civil society after the Civil War. To date, in less than six months, 30 people have died in violent circumstances. On the first day of the new millennium, 21 year old Dermot McKeever was shot dead in Ashbourne, County Meath, and the killing has gone on unabated since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In January, six people lost their lives in a variety of violent circumstances. Two of the most gruesome were the killings of 19 year old Peter Murray and 20 year old Darren Clarke who were shot in the head and dumped in a canal in County Kildare because they withheld drugs money. In the first week in February a young teenager was murdered in Mahon in Cork and a young man from Donegal was stabbed to death in Ardee, County Louth. On the same day a man was stabbed to death in St. James's Hospital, Dublin. Ten days later the body of retired school teacher, Mrs. Nancy Nolan, was discovered inside the <Col N="719" /> door of her home in Ballygar, County Galway. Two days later a 75 year old man was beaten to death in Athlone and, a few days later, 34 year old Joe Foran was shot dead in what was obviously a gangland killing in Finglas.</P>
    <P>The month of March started with the especially horrific killing of an 18 month baby who was thrown into a quarry in County Louth with a rope around its neck. Ten days later a young innocent 19 year old teenager was set upon by a mob in Orwell Estate, Templeogue, and kicked to death. Thirty four year old Michael Shannon was beaten to death in Ennis, County Clare, at 4.20 a.m. on Sunday, 2 March. It is of small consolation to his family that two men were charged with his death the following day.</P>
    <P>The country awoke on Monday, 10 April to learn that an innocent Welsh rugby fan, Dorian Vick, had died as a result of being kicked and beaten in Roscrea, County Tipperary. The following week a young woman was found strangled in Thomondgate in Limerick and an 18 year old was arrested and charged. Three days later on Holy Thursday, John Carthy was shot dead by the Garda emergency response unit at Abbeylara, County Longford. Nine weeks later we still do not know exactly what happened. We still await the report. Six days later an inmate was stabbed to death in Mountjoy Prison. The final weekend in April was particularly bloody. The second toddler killing of the year occurred when a three month old baby was stabbed in Newbridge, and the child's father was charged with murder. Patrick Neville was shot dead from behind in a gangland revenge killing at St. Michael's Estate, Inchicore. The following day, Thomas Byrne of Sheriff Street was drinking outside a pub in Summerhill when a young man walked up to him and shot him dead at point blank range.</P>
    <P>On 4 May a man in his 80s was stabbed to death in Gurranbraher, Cork, having just returned from hospital where he had been treated for previous stab wounds. A particularly brutal killing occurred on Saturday, 13 May when Derek Benson, aged 33, was first beaten to death at Ballymun flats and then burned after his body was doused in petrol. Towards the end of May a man was stabbed to death in County Meath and, on the same day, a young man was mown down by a car after a fracas in Buncrana, County Donegal.</P>
    <P>We had the third tragic killing of a baby on the 5th of this month when a little 18 month old was stabbed to death in Tallaght. At the other end of the age spectrum and on the same day, Patrick Logan was preparing a meal while at the same time listening to a football match between Meath and Offaly on the radio with his brother in Castlejordan, County Meath, when two young men broke into their home and demanded money. The brothers refused and Paddy was brutally beaten, suffered a heart attack and died as a result of same. The raiders only got £45. Two weeks later a man was shot dead in Limerick. The 30th killing was that of a woman in her 20s who <Col N="720" /> was found dead this day last week in her flat in Inchicore with a ligature around her neck.</P>
    <P>A record total of 30 people dead in violent circumstances in less than six months of what should be the dawning of a happy and bright new millennium is a damning indictment of the failure of the much vaunted zero tolerance promised by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The cure all zero tolerance of the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, was going to stamp out violent crime and produce a crime free society. However, under his management crimes of violence have increased dramatically. There have been 111 armed robberies in the first four months of the year. The weekly RTE &ldquo;Crimeline&rdquo; programme, with the assistance of the ever-present security cameras, features the huge increase in brazen smash and grab raids. Unprovoked attacks on ordinary decent law-abiding citizens have become the norm. The sustained barrage of telephone calls to the Marian Finucane programme from the victims of such attacks speaks for itself. All the while the Minister trots out official Garda statistics to bolster his contention that things are getting better when the reality is different, namely, that things are getting worse.</P>
    <P>The Garda figures do not tell the true story. Many people do not see any point in reporting crimes because of the lack of decisive follow-up. Many crimes are not recorded, even when people make complaints. The CSO quarterly survey speaks for itself. The vast majority of people every night live in fear of attack. Too many people, particularly in isolated rural areas, have to go to bed with a shotgun at their side. What a damning indictment of this Government's crime policy.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Yates said, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and every other Minister should go. There is incompetence all around. The Government is in freefall. It is a dysfunctional family with dysfunctional Ministers. Thankfully, the end is nigh. The clean out is imminent, the death rattle is in the throat and we want to send for the undertaker.</P>

It will not happen because the people realise full well the scandals and sleaze at the heart of the Government in 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people understand the Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty case quite well. Mr. O'Flaherty was forced to resign from the Supreme Court under the threat of impeachment by the present Government. Special legislation was rushed through this House giving him an index linked pension of £40,000 per <Col N="721" /> year. It was also made clear to him that he was free to engage in any form of private consultancy work he wished to undertake. It was obviously wrong to appoint this man to the board of the European Investment Bank. He did not have any banking or financial experience.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach should show some backbone at this stage. He should not rely on his wobbly legged backbenchers, to whom Deputy Brady referred earlier, to do the dirty work on the plinth of this House for him. He should admit that he and all the members of his Government have made a fundamental mistake and this nomination should be withdrawn forthwith. He should speak to Deputy Ardagh and the members of the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights who yesterday did a gross disservice to the committees of this House by producing an act of closure on the debate on Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty. Why did that committee not take a leaf out of the book of Deputy Jim Mitchell's committee's conduct of the DIRT inquiry? I urge Deputy Ardagh to call a meeting of that committee and follow the example of the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>The widely accepted arrogance of the Minister for Finance is now being surpassed by the behaviour of the Tánaiste since the postponement of criminal charges laid against Mr. Haughey because of her intemperate and injudicious remarks. These remarks were made with a clear intent to deflect from the pressure she and her party were suffering in the immediate wake of the O'Flaherty appointment. Circuit Court judge, Kevin Haugh, said on Monday there was now a real and substantial risk of Mr. Haughey not being able to receive a fair trial. He was in no doubt that the Tánaiste had created a risk of further damage to Mr. Haughey's character. Her failure to apologise to the Irish people and to her parliamentary colleagues amounts to breathtaking arrogance, in the same mould as her colleague and best buddy, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy. The sad and sorry spectacle of the Tánaiste being secretly shunted through the basement corridors of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to attend a Cabinet meeting was pathetic. There is a procedure under our standing orders for her to make a personal statement and I urge her to do so. This Government has lost its moral authority and is rapidly losing its legal authority also. It should do the decent thing and go.</P>

      <P>I want to focus on the effect the Government's policies are having on the quality of life of many of the people of this State. The stresses and strains faced by many of our citizens are continuing to mount. We are fast becoming a society that is short on time for others and on caring for the less well off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of homeless people, particularly young people and women, sleeping on our streets is increasing. That is a sad indictment of this society. The cost of housing continues to increase. <Col N="722" /> Young people are being forced into the rental sector. Local authority housing waiting lists are continuing to increase. Every Member of this House has seen an increase in the number of people seeking local authority houses since the Government took office.</P>
    <P>Parents of young children live under considerable pressure. Child care costs are continuing to rise. Last week, there were media reports that the cost of child care averages about £100 per week. The Government has done nothing to alleviate that. According to information supplied to my colleague, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, in reply to a parliamentary question, 4,000 child care places have been lost nationally due to inspections under the Child Care Act. Those places have not been replaced. Parents of young children live daily with the stress of trying to find and fund child care. The Government has done nothing to address that.</P>
    <P>The quality of child care must also be addressed. We hear very little about that. We hear about the increased number of child care places under the national development plan but where are they? Where is the issue of the quality of child care being addressed? The Government wants to attract women into the workplace to fill job vacancies. However, there is no focus on the quality and provision of child care. Parents of young children are not being assured their children will be catered for and that they will be able to meet their child care costs. Are we depending on the unregulated black economy? That is not good enough for our children and the future of our society.</P>
    <P>The greatest threat to our health service is the lack of nurses and young doctors. That must be addressed. We have seen nurses, particularly in the Dublin area, voting with their feet and leaving their profession. That situation must be addressed, rather than throwing money at hospitals and Ministers announcing the spending of millions of pounds. We must focus on the lack of personnel, particularly nurses, which is one of the greatest threats to our health service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate and welcome Deputy Healy to the House. I was also elected in a by-election in June and that December we had a new Government. I have no doubt we will have another new Government by the end of this year, although I do not know what part Deputy Healy will play in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know where to start tonight. I will start at the top, with the Taoiseach. He reminds me of Kevin Keegan, the manager of England &ndash; a nice guy but without substance. I am amazed by the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, the conscience of the nation and the lady who lectured us every morning. When she got up and told us what was right and wrong she reminded me of the teacher when I was going to school. I laughed yesterday morning when she had to be rushed into Agriculture House. She was not very fond of farmers and the agriculture sector, but she was relieved yesterday <Col N="723" /> when she was able to get through Agriculture House. Yesterday, the Tánaiste and leader of the Progressive Democrats, who loves the microphone, RTE and being on the public airways, went into Agriculture House, where she was protected by the officials, so she could go through the back door into Government Buildings for a meeting. There is something very wrong.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Brady, who is a nice guy. I am not going to say anything about him because I like him. He is one of the backbenchers who criticised the Government this week, for which I say to him &ldquo;Well done&rdquo;. A few of them were on RTE and all over the newspapers, including a constituency colleague of mine, going into a meeting yesterday, talking about what they would do with Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty. However, Fianna Fáil has a great PR machine and its Members on the committee did what they were told at yesterday's meeting and stated that Mr. O'Flaherty might be upset if the committee wrote to him and, therefore, he should not be asked to answer to the Houses of Parliament.</P>
    <P>Deputy Martin Brady spoke on the issue of health. I am familiar with the case of a 22 year old man in my constituency who became ill with a virus and lost the use of one of his legs. He was waiting three weeks for a bed in Beaumont Hospital. I am also familiar with the case of a child from north Mayo whose mother cried when the child had to be flown from McHale Park, Castlebar, to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast because there was no bed available in the State. It is not acceptable that the child in question had to be flown to another jurisdiction in order to receive treatment.</P>
    <P>Why was Deputy Healy elected to the Dáil? He was elected because the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, the Tánaiste, the Taoiseach and the Government are arrogant and are intent on attacking the sick, the weak and the unemployed. Social welfare officers are informing claimants that there are jobs available, that they must take up employment and that a letter which states that a person is actively seeking work will no longer be acceptable.</P>

      <P>With regard to Deputy Ring's comments about Deputy Martin Brady, Deputy Brady could not but be a decent fellow because he has Cavan blood in his veins.</P>
      <P>When addressing a meeting of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, the Tánaiste stated that she had not had time to examine the Competition Authority's report on under-cost selling because of other distractions. That is a clear admission that a senior Government Minister, because of the distraction of the Hugh O'Flaherty affair, is not addressing the issues that affect ordinary decent people. People the length and breadth of this nation are inquiring about the hold Mr. O'Flaherty has on the Government which has allowed him to strangle its efforts to administer the country's affairs. The only man who can shed light on the situation is Hugh O'Flaherty and he should appear before a committee of the House and provide a clear statement about the hold he has on senior members of the Administration. Government backbenchers owe it to themselves to obtain such a statement because people are not impressed by recent events.</P>
      <P>With regard to the ordinary issues under discussion, there is not a day on which people do not approach me with problems which are not being addressed by the Government. A rising tide does not lift all boats and people are being left behind. There are people on waiting lists for hip and cataract operations. I met an 84 year old man last week who was told he should return to hospital next September for his cataract operation. The poor man thought the operation would have been over and done with and that he could have enjoyed the summer sunshine. However, that was not the case and I hope he is still alive next September. This type of behaviour is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>There is a need to refurbish the school in my locality. I receive representations on a daily basis about the replacement of furniture, the repair of leaking roofs and the provision of reading rooms. However, nothing has happened. There is also a need to provide remedial teaching services at the school for children who require additional help in order that their boats will be lifted with the rising tide. However, these children are being left behind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently raised in the House the matter of providing personal assistants to young people with disabilities who are sitting their examinations and who hope to enter third level education. These individuals, who were born with their disabilities, have shown tremendous courage in their fight to succeed and they have been supported by their parents and teachers. All they are asking is for the State to provide the support services which could make all the difference in terms of improving their quality of life. However, the Government is not listening because, as the Tánaiste stated, Ministers are being obliged to <Col N="725" /> deal with other distractions. If that is the case, the Government should get out and allow us to enter office and cater for the needs of those who elected us to represent them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has failed many groups during the past three years and it is time for it to leave office. The current Administration suffers from a &ldquo;start again&rdquo; syndrome. On each occasion a crisis arises, it asks the electorate to forget about it and to move on because there is a great deal of work to do. That has happened on so many occasions that the people of south Tipperary decided to send the Government a message which prompted it, earlier this evening, to announce that it would start again.</P>
      <P>The Government has failed thousands of third level students. In recent days, it launched its new education grants scheme for 2000 which gives a derisory 5% increase for the coming year. This means that most third level students are obliged to live on a yearly maintenance grant of £1,775. Could the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, afford to live on that amount in a year? Does she believe that third level students will be able to survive on £1,775 per year? The answer is no.</P>
      <P>The Government has penalised one particular group in County Galway, namely, student nurses. Time and again in the past six months the Government has been asked to address the blatant discrimination with which student nurses must deal. These people are not being allowed to train in their chosen profession by the Government. There is a shortage of nurses and junior doctors which means that elderly people and others who require access to health services are being denied the care to which they are entitled. It was not too long ago that the Minister of State's party erected hoardings on our roads and streets which stated that health cuts hurt the old and the people in need. That message is coming back to haunt Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>The Government is afflicted and consumed by hubris, an arrogant pride, an inability to admit mistakes, contempt for the opinions of others and, ultimately, contempt for the people who elected it to office. However, the electorate will soon have its say. That say will take the form of an act of vengeance which will culminate in the ignominious defeat of this Thatcherite Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people have seen through the spin and the hype of the Celtic tiger. The Government has tried to tell them that they have never had it so good but many people know that things have never been worse. Housing is affordable only to <Col N="726" /> the very well off, rents have escalated, security of tenure is a thing of the past, hospital waiting lists are lengthening, the child care facilities on offer are appalling, traffic gridlock continues to hold sway and the public transport system is terrible, polluted air is poisoning our children, we are afflicted by a waste management crisis and our environment is going down the tubes. Allied to this is the constant stream of sleaze.</P>
    <P>Just when people believe they cannot take any more, a further allegation of cronyism and corruption emerges. The Tánaiste stated that people will forget recent events in a few months. She obviously believes that ordinary people are going to behave like members of Fianna Fáil at a tribunal and that they will not remember. I must inform her that they will remember. They will have the hatchets out and they will be ready and waiting. The Tánaiste should remember how every Greek tragedy ends. As Deputy Ring stated, it will be a case of people saying to the Thatcherites &ldquo;Out, out, out&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This Government is pursuing a very strong economic and social agenda. It has wiped out the age old problems of unemployment and emigration, solved the Northern Ireland issue, introduced the national minimum wage and responded to the needs of pensioners and social welfare recipients. This Government is in touch with real people about real issues and is solving real problems.</P>
      <P>Listening to the Opposition, all we hear is an Opposition of personalities, an Opposition of rumour and innuendo and an Opposition of attack. That does not surprise me as the Opposition cannot attack the Government on problems of social and economic policy. Under the former Government, which comprised Members of the current Opposition, people were denied their rights. An autistic child had to go before the courts to obtain her educational rights. Members of an abused family in the west of Ireland had to go before the courts to obtain their rights, as had out of control young children. This Government is providing investment, protection and equality to all of these vulnerable people.</P>

      <P>The previous Government created problems for young people but this Government provided facilities for young people through the youth services fund and invested in the drug task force areas. The Opposition insists on attacking people whereas this Government attacks problems. The previous Government ignored people with disabilities but this Government has ensured that people with a mental handicap now have their due dignity and right to equality.</P>
      <P>The Government has outlined what more needs to be done. There is £40 billion to be spent under the national development plan, including £2 billion in the health area. In my own area of responsibility, the national children's strategy is due to be launched in the autumn, a strategy which will ensure that all children have the childhood they deserve and which will prepare them for adulthood. Children are going before the courts because when it was identified in 1996 that children required special care units, the Government of the day did not do anything to plan for the units, invest in them or build them. This Government put money into those areas. The building project is under way and places will come on stream from next month onwards. Those children should not be before the courts and they would not have to be in that position had the previous Government acted on the evidence available to it in 1996.</P>
      <P>This Government will not be distracted by jeers from the sideline. It continues to work on the real problems. It continues to ensure that its policies of social inclusion work together through various Departments to ensure people will have more money in their pockets and that more resource and remedial teachers and home-school liaison workers will be provided. Over the next six years, the national development plan will ensure that everybody will benefit from our buoyant economy and that those people who return to our country will have jobs and homes to which they can return. The Government is ensuring that people will feel safe in their homes.</P>
      <P>The policies of this Government are evidence that this is a good Government. It would be very easy to carry on the football parlance to which Deputy Ring referred. It would be very easy to listen to the jeers of the crowd. The Government does not listen to the jeers of the crowd&mdash;</P>

      <P>Together with my Fine Gael colleagues, I have returned to this House refreshed by an intensive, three week by-election campaign in Tipperary South during which I was privileged to work with committed colleagues and to canvass in the company of an honourable party leader. Lessons were learned by all parties during the by-election campaign. The Taoiseach admitted that he learned that his party should try harder and listen more. That is the least Fianna Fáil could have learned.</P>
      <P>The Government should now realise that the people in Tipperary South spoke for people throughout Ireland. They showed that people want honest, decent and hard-working politicians. They want an end to sleaze, an end to double speak, an end to golden circles and looking after one's own and an end to the scandals. They also want an explanation for the sleaze and the scandals. They want full explanations, not half explanations or the old Fianna Fáil mantra of &ldquo;that was then, this is now and we knew nothing&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>People want people accused of wrongdoing to provide answers and they want those who are found guilty to pay the price but what they get from this Government is very different. The Government is simply incapable of listening to the people. Last night's debacle in regard to the O'Flaherty affair at the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights was proof positive that Fianna Fáil is incapable of learning lessons, incapable of listening to what the people want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people on the doorstep want accountability. Their hopes were raised yesterday by those Deputies who spoke of accountability and their open minds. Sadly, the public's hopes were dashed when those same Deputies today reverted to the Fianna Fáil tactic of letting sleeping dogs lie. The problem with Fianna Fáil is that it is all talk although the problem with the Tánaiste is quite the opposite. She was all talk recently but <Col N="729" /> we have heard little from her over the past 48 hours.</P>
    <P>In spite of its arrogance and hype, the Government is incapable of responding to people's needs and wants. People with disabilities, their carers and advocates have been treated to lecture after lecture, announcement after announcement, launch after launch, photo-call after photo-call but have received little in real terms. How many people with disabilities or their families have had their lives transformed by real or radical action on the part of this Government? We have heard words aplenty but as the old saying goes, &ldquo;fine words butter no parsnips&rdquo;. The reality is that people with disabilities continue to experience barriers to participation. Those barriers remain insurmountable, people are long-fingered time and again and change is painfully slow.</P>
    <P>The building regulations signed yesterday by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government are full of exemptions and people with disabilities must now wait until December 2003 before they can be assured of receiving a local authority house suitable to their needs. This is a very sad state of affairs for a Government which promised so much but has delivered so little in real terms. It is a tragedy for those who remain excluded.</P>
    <P>We are better off now than ever before, yet many of our citizens are denied the right to a hoist to help them out of bed. They are denied basic rights like personal assistants to help them with dressing and feeding. Their families and carers cope alone without comprehensive, responsive or accessible support from the State. St. Rita's Respite Centre in Clonmel which does sterling work can only open every second weekend due to a lack of resources. That is a disgrace in this day and age.</P>
    <P>I recently attended the funeral of an elderly neighbour and friend in my constituency. Much to the distress of his family and friends, he died on a hospital trolley. After a lifetime of work and dedication, he was denied the final dignity of dying in a bed. No amount of Government hype can hide the sad and despicable reality of what is happening. No carefully chosen statistics can reverse the situation.</P>
    <P>The Government is very good at spin and putting out soft focus stories but, unfortunately, it is spinning out of control. No amount of expensive PR can cover up its mistakes. It is patently obvious that the Government is in a mess and it is time for it to start listening to the people. The message is very clear, the people want it to go and it should accede to their request.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government is a spent force and it is time it packed its bags and presented itself to the people for their judgment. The Taoiseach makes a big fuss about saying it will have to listen to the people as if somehow this has only occurred to him because of the results in the by-election in south Tipperary. He has some cheek to insult the people in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="730" /> Does he not realise that he, his Government colleagues and all of us in this House are elected as representatives of the people? Heeding and listening to the people is what democracy is all about. If the Government had any decency it would present itself in the Dáil next week to deal with some of the serious issues that have arisen in the past few days such as the effect of the Tánaiste's remarks which led to the collapse indefinitely of the trial of former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, and the refusal of the Fianna Fáil members of the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights to support the re-examination of the Sheedy affair. Instead it cannot wait until 4.30 p.m. on Friday, 30 June so that it can scurry into hiding, away from the scrutiny of this House and the people to whom the Taoiseach says he must listen. How much more of this cynicism, incompetence and sleaze must we accept from this failed Government?</P>
    <P>The list of failures was well outlined last night and tonight by our speakers. There are a few more I would mention. The dismal failure of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to put in place a workable system to ensure an adequate supply of labour may well result in the most serious damage to our economy. Announcements and press statements have not been backed up with the necessary resources to allow her Department to process speedily applications for non-EU workers. It is estimated there are 4,000 to 5,000 vacancies in the hotel and catering sector that cannot be filled by Irish workers. It is taking a minimum of eight weeks &ndash; the season will be over &ndash; to process work permit applications. The tourism industry depends on the filling of these vacancies, as do existing jobs in this sector.</P>
    <P>The construction industry estimates it will need 15,000 to 18,000 extra workers this year, 9,000 of whom will have to come from abroad. Without an effective delivery of work permits, the capacity of the construction industry will be greatly diminished, thereby preventing it delivering the extra housing that is needed to tackle the housing crisis.</P>
    <P>A recent survey by the Small Firms Association indicated that 91% of small companies cannot fill vacancies. The expansion plans of 71% of small companies are thus hindered and the survey, according to the director of the SFA, confirms their worst fears. The position is getting worse rather than better. If the Tánaiste was not so preoccupied looking over her shoulder to see where the next missile was coming from the Fianna Fáil ranks, both current and past, if so much of her energy was not spent and consumed rectifying her self-inflicted wounds, she could concentrate on handling her Department and the extremely serious labour supply deficiency which she has allowed to grow to crisis point.</P>
    <P>Equally her failure to properly resource the Competition Authority with adequate staff and <Col N="731" /> resources has meant we do not have an effective competition watchdog. Cartels and anti-competitive practices are adding further to our rising levels of inflation. Despite all the warnings from this side of the House and resignations from the Competition Authority being the order of the day, the Tánaiste only took action in the last month to approve additional staffing for that authority. We have been warning her that there was not adequate staff in the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs to deal with the issues. It is only within the past 48 hours that the Government has woken up to this need.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence after three years of this Fianna Fáil Taoiseach that he has any of the skills so well exhibited by Deputy John Bruton as Taoiseach to lead a coalition Government. There is no evidence of the leadership skills required to tackle in a coherent way the many supply requirements in our economy, housing, transport, workers, child care places, hospital services, probation and welfare services &ndash; the list is endless. If the Government was working as a united team with a skilled captain rather than as a dispirited band of mé féiners, the benefits of the good economic progress it inherited from the rainbow coalition would be more widely enjoyed by all the people in a more equitable and beneficial way. It is time for it to go and, as the bard said, stand not upon the order of your going.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Objectively, I believe, and the House and objective commentators would probably agree, a general election at this stage in the country's history is in its interests. I say this not solely for the reasons that the Government is beset by scandals and instability and that the working relationship between the two parties in Government is obviously not good. The Government's attention is clearly diverted from Government work to waiting for the next revelation that may come from either the European Investment Bank, the courts or a tribunal. The problem is the Government has implemented all the policies upon which it has agreed and has no medium-term agenda for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland faces a deep-seated structural problem. We have a problem on the supply side of our economy. There is a lack of supply of nurses and doctors and that is leading to far greater waiting lists than ought to be the case. There is a problem of supply of child care workers and places. That is leading to tremendous hardship for families where both partners must work to pay very high mortgages but cannot get affordable child care to do so. This leads to great stress in their lives. There is a problem with the supply of serviced land for housing and in getting such land that is available built upon. Sufficient houses are not being built. There is a dramatic undersupply of <Col N="732" /> all kinds of public transport, rail links and road space for cars.</P>
    <P>These are not problems that can be overcome by short-term solutions. The Government has been trying to come up with such solutions, waiting list packages and various short-term initiatives on all these supply side issues. The truth is the only way the inflationary problem in the economy can be overcome is if the supply side of the economy is unblocked. That requires medium to long-term planning. It requires a Government that sees itself as a development corporation, working as a unit to deal in an integrated way with all these problems because each one impacts on the other. The child care problem impacts on the traffic problem which impacts on the housing problem. It is a single problem of malfunction of an overheated economy because of deficiencies in the supply side.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that a Government that, at most, has a year or a year and a half to run is capable intellectually, mentally or psychologically of devising and implementing a five to six year programme to deal with these problems. We need a general election now so that whoever wins will be in place as a Government capable of dealing with these profound structural problems. To be fair, these structural problems are different from those that existed when the Government was elected and most of them have taken the Government by surprise. To some extent it could be said that they are problems of success arising from the growth in the economy which had its roots in the past but which has continued. The Government is not, intellectually, in policy terms or in terms of the perspective of its mandate, looking forward and is not capable of devising this sort of programme. A Government that is preparing for an election, thinking about it and about seats and wondering if it can rely on Independents, wondering about the Tánaiste, the Taoiseach and tribunals is not the kind of Government that can undertake the kind of planning decisions, or their implementation, that this country needs.</P>
    <P>In calling for a general election we are not simply pursuing a political agenda against the Government, though it is the role of Opposition to pursue and harry whoever is in Government. Anyone occupying these benches does that. However, at this point in our economic and social development we have a whole new set of problems to deal with &ndash; supply side and overheating problems &ndash; that a Government such as this, with a one year perspective, is intellectually incapable of dealing with. That is why we believe a general election is in the national interest.</P>

    <Title>Electronic Commerce Bill, 2000  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. The introduction of new legislation to address the issues raised by the advent of e-commerce is of great importance to all of us. The whole concept of trade and business is fundamentally altering and will never be the same again. It is of vital national importance that we stay to the forefront of technology and this new way of doing business. Ongoing capital investment to enable the best connectivity with high transmission capacity is fundamental in ensuring our premier position in the world market.</P>
      <P>We have witnessed the changes in fortune due to the establishment of call centres. These have changed how and where people live. Increasingly, employers and employees will operate from home rather than travelling to and from a set location. This change will have immeasurable effect on spatial planning, how cities develop and the development of modes of transportation. The available market by 2001 will be about 300 million people. It is of real importance that the validity of e-commerce transactions is taken as secure and contracts entered into are beyond question legally.</P>
      <P>The world is facing the biggest single revolution as a result of the capacity to share information at the push of a button. From the North Pole to the South Pole, east or west, all who have a thirst for knowledge are empowered. The concept of the human genome breakthrough becoming immediately available free on the Internet is extraordinary. That type of development will enhance e-commerce and turn more minds towards challenging its potential. As in all matters, some of those who explore the system will not wish to stay within the bounds of honest trade. It is necessary to implement this legislation to comfort the rest of us that remedies are at hand to check the ambition of the ruthless.</P>
      <P>We must foster a proactive community who seek out the limits of legal application on the web and Internet. We, the last generation of the paper society, must educate the generations to come and use this new gift in the most productive way for the benefit of all society. Reference has been made to the possibility of technological advances in the development of democracy because of technology, with each citizen empowered to take part in decision making through the Internet. That opportunity for good is also an opportunity for great evil. We must ensure that those who will be the instant decision makers are fully educated on their responsibility and are comprehensively briefed on all aspects of the topic before they press the empowered button. A world where one turns on one's computer and demands an immediate answer to a question of national or international importance must be resisted.</P>
      <P>The United Nations has drawn up guidelines on international trade law while the European Union tackles the question of electronic signatures. This Bill relies on both as its bedrock and rightly so. Our legislation must be compatible with increasing globalisation while retaining our national character. We must move forward with an air of confidence that e-commerce will have the capacity to liberate all countries of the world, bringing wealth and health to all by opening society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Deputies who spoke on this Bill over the three days it was discussed, Deputies Yates, O'Shea, Ring, O'Flynn, Fleming, Deenihan, Ó Caoláin, McGuinness, Moloney, Naughten, Ardagh, Cosgrave and the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy. The number and range of the contributions clearly demonstrated the great interest in the Bill. I was greatly heartened by the cross-party support. There are very few Bills which have genuine cross-party support, that is, all the parties who contribute firmly state their support of the Bill and ask that it be expedited. There has been a warm welcome for this legislation in the business pages of the local, national and international press. There is a clear recognition that Ireland has got it right and the legislation introduced in other countries, particularly the UK, has proved cumbersome and hard to adapt. I think the legislation in other countries will be proved unequal to the task. This Bill which has been produced through the hard work of our officials, the determination of my policy objectives and the consultation process has proved very acceptable, and I am glad this is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Fine Gael and Labour parties for their contributions and their whole-hearted respect for the Bill, as well as the different points of view which always exist within the parties. I commend Deputy O'Shea who was in the House on all the days the Bill was discussed. As I know quite well, that is difficult to do as Opposition <Col N="739" /> spokesperson. He gave the Bill great attention, as did all the Deputies who spoke. There were a number of queries, but these will arise in amendments on Committee Stage tomorrow and we will be able to answer the various points raised then.</P>
    <P>This is an interesting and exciting Bill which will have massive ramifications for business. However, it is psychological as well as practical. Psychologically, we have shown by the early introduction of this Bill and the way it has gained momentum and respect across the House that Ireland is serious and can reach cross-party consensus on legislation which is amazingly receptive to business. I notice the comments in newspapers that there is consensus on this Bill and it has cross-party support. That is a very great feature. In a time of strife, turmoil, trouble, carping and so on, in which we all engage from time to time, I would like to think in a fanciful way that it is like a beacon of hope for business.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Second Stage commences, I would like to deal with the question of this Bill being a hybrid Bill, which was raised in the House previously.</P>
      <P>I have given careful consideration to the issue of whether the Standing Orders relative to Private Business are applicable to the Harbours (Amendment) Bill, 2000. The Bill deals primarily with matters of public policy, and in so far as private interests could be said to be affected, they are affected in a manner incidental to that policy and, accordingly, I will not refer the Bill to the Examiner of Private Bills.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to introduce this Bill. It has been a long time in coming. It is 25 years since the idea was first mooted. It is interesting that on a number of occasions the Bill was held up by the intervention of a general election. I am glad that will not happen on this occasion and that we will get this very important legislation through the House.</P>
      <P>I published the KPMG Consulting review in March this year and fully supported the recommendations of that report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="740" /> The consultants came to the conclusion that the establishment of a new and single port company &ldquo;is the only arrangement that makes commercial and operational sense&rdquo;. The report recommends that the company, to be called the Shannon and Foynes Port Company, will be responsible for all port related activity in the estuary. The Harbours (Amendment) Bill amends the Harbours Act, 1996 to provide that if the Minister is of the opinion that the functions of a company or companies could be performed in a more cost effective and efficient manner by another company or companies, he may establish a new company resulting in the amalgamation of existing companies. The Bill enables the Minister to amalgamate the functions of Foynes Port Company and Shannon Estuary Ports Company. It also provides powers to the Minister to establish an Implementation Board and Advisory Boards to facilitate the transfer. The Bill allows the Minister for Finance to make available to a company moneys to finance capital works, to inject equity for other purposes and to raise the aggregate amount of moneys that can be made available to companies.</P>
    <P>I recently announced the establishment of a five-member Implementation Board, on an informal basis initially, pending enactment of this legislation, under the Chairmanship of Mr. Proinsias Kitt of Kitt, Noone Chartered Accountants, to initiate the process of overseeing the transition to a new single port company. The other members on the board are Mr. Kieran McSweeney, Mr. Michael Leyden, Ms Susan Bugler and Mr. Kevin Sheehan.</P>
    <P>The Advisory Boards, comprising the directors of the Foynes Port Company and Shannon Estuary Ports Company, will have a real and important role to fill. There will be a serious obligation on the advisory boards to assist in every way in the achievement of the main and subsidiary objects for which the company is established and to tender any advice sought by that board on matters relating to: measures for the management, control, operation and development of the estuary port facilities; the provision of facilities, services, accommodation and lands in its jurisdiction for ships and goods; the promotion of investment in its facilities; the engagement in business activity considered advantageous to the development of the estuary; and the utilisation and management of scarce resources.</P>
    <P>I am aware from discussions both with the staff and management of the two port companies and from discussions with Members of this House that there is a genuine sense of grievance as to certain comments made in the report by the consultants who undertook the Shannon Port industry review. I refer in particular to the comments on the financial position of both ports, the cashflow difficulty at Foynes and the pensions deficit at Shannon. I recognise fully that there are sensitivities here. It has been pointed out to me that dedication, service and commitment shown over the years by the staff members of both companies and their predecessor harbour authorities were <Col N="741" /> not given sufficient credit by the consultants. Following a board meeting on 20 June last, the board of Foynes Port Company forwarded to me a summary of what it perceived as inaccuracies in the KPMG report. I have asked my Department to pass this on to KPMG Consultancy.</P>
    <P>When both port companies were set up in March, 1997 it was without any financial support from the State. The balance sheet positions were inherited by the companies and both had to operate within a very competitive environment from vesting day onwards.</P>
    <P>While it is now time to put the past behind us and move on to a new future, both boards and management will be given an opportunity to vindicate their stewardship since the port companies were formed in March, 1997. Statutory performance audits covering the first three years' trading, to be conducted by independent consultants, will be initiated very shortly with a view to completion within a three-month time frame. These will apply to all port companies, including Foynes and Shannon, and in view of the concerns expressed about aspects of the KPMG report, I am sure priority can be given to the Foynes and Shannon audits.</P>
    <P>Although investment in ports has greatly improved, thanks to EU Structural Funding, the capacity and quality of port facilities, the level of growth in Ireland's international trade and in port activity means that continued investment is required which will be funded in the future through the ports' own resources, available EU co-funded investment, shareholder's equity, public-private sector partnerships or a combination of these funding mechanisms.</P>
    <P>Among the tasks of the implementation board overseeing the unification process, which I appointed on an informal basis pending enactment of the new legislation and establishment of the new port company, will be the need to establish the level of equity that is required to ensure that the new company can trade solvently. KPMG Consulting assess this to be in the order of £5 million to £8 million. The implementation board will investigate the full extent of planned capital works at both ports, the restructuring of loans, private sector involvement, port re-organisation and possible disposal of assets surplus to essential core business so that I can have a fully developed and costed assessment of the financial requirements necessary to enable the two companies to unify into one whole and start with a sound balance sheet.</P>
    <P>The cashflow difficulties at Foynes Port were underlined by the qualified opinion given by the company's auditors in their 1999 annual accounts. This highlighted the reliance of the company on the support of its shareholders, bankers and creditors. Further, the auditors stated in the published accounts that if such support was not available to the company the going concern basis on which their accounts are prepared may not be appropriate. I am underlining this so that Deputies will appreciate the need for action here. <Col N="742" /> It goes without saying that the State as shareholder maintains support for the Foynes Port Company and adopted the 1999 report and financial statements accordingly.</P>
    <P>An urgent priority already identified is to address the critical deficiencies in craneage and handling facilities at Foynes which could cost up to £3 million. The eventual cost will depend on completion of the competitive procurement process which has just been embarked upon by the Foynes Port Company. They cannot afford to buy this equipment themselves because of their acute cash flow problems which I have just mentioned, having invested heavily in the EU co-financed west jetty extension and dredging development, costing £12.5 million. They now have the capacity to load and discharge more and larger ships, but without the handling equipment the day to day business is hampered, current business is constrained, they cannot trade out of their difficulties and new business prospects are diminished. I confirm to the House that I will be making an announcement as to how we will address the issue of the necessary moneys for the new company to meet the cost of the essential craneage and handling equipment.</P>
    <P>At a very early stage of the review process my Department confirmed the position in writing to both port companies that all the employment protections as to salary scales and conditions of service guaranteed by the Harbours Act, 1996, for the members of staff of the predecessor harbour authorities would not be affected by any potential changes to management or operational structures, and this remains the case. A key remit of the interim implementation board is to deal with staffing concerns or issues. I am on record as saying there will be no forced redundancies. Where staff economies or rationalisation become apparent to the implementation board, a scheme of voluntary redundancy will be put in place.</P>
    <P>The proposed Limerick southern ring road will cross the Shannon at a place yet to be decided. There is a decision to be made in relation to the type and form of a new Shannon crossing. This must not restrict the development and long-term viability of the Ted Russell Docks, not only from a commercial perspective but also as a facility for water-based tourism. The potential for Limerick docks must be recognised given that its location takes significant break bulk traffic off the road. Up to now the facility was hampered by lack of warehousing, but this is being addressed in developments planned and under way by Shannon Estuary Ports Company.</P>
    <P>An urgent priority already identified is to advance the construction of the port access road at Foynes. I understand the original scheme for which there is planning permission was costed at some £1.6 million. Extra works have arisen comprising realignment of the N69 and a level crossing at a cost of £1 million. The National Roads Authority will provide £0.3 million of this in addition to the grant aid already committed, leaving a requirement for an additional allocation to <Col N="743" /> Limerick County Council of £700,000. I fully appreciate the importance of completing the Foynes port access road having visited the port and spoken to the local community council. I have initiated discussions with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on providing the necessary funding when required to Limerick County Council for the purpose of constructing the access road and I am confident the money will be forthcoming. In addition, the improvement of the N69, which is especially relevant for the development of the port of Foynes, is scheduled under the national development plan. Significant remedial works are, I understand, currently under way on the N69.</P>
    <P>The hallmark of the implementation structures provided for in the Bill is that they are designed to be simple, effective and non-divisive. It is of vital importance that the implementation board which will have a short shelf life is tightly focused and for this reason I decided to keep the numbers low, with balanced representation from each company and an independent chairperson. It also has a clear-cut and focused remit overseeing the unification process in close liaison with the port company boards and their successor advisory boards in order to ensure the smoothest possible transition to a new single port company structure.</P>
    <P>The advisory boards, comprising the directors of two or more port companies amalgamated, including the employee directors and local authority directors, will have a real and important role to fulfil in assisting the implementation board of the new company to pursue the difficult decisions vital to the future success of the company and the development of business and the port facilities. This arrangement maintains equal and balanced representation of the interests of each of the amalgamating companies while ensuring the vital focus on the part of the implementation board.</P>
    <P>The implementation process should be completed within a 12 to 18 month timeframe and in terms of the proposed amalgamation of the Foynes Port Company and Shannon Estuary Port Company, I hope the task can be completed within the shorter period, when the normal board structure would come back into play.</P>
    <P>As I said, this is a major development initiative for the Shannon estuary with a range of significant benefits identified. These include the provision of a single coherent voice to the marketing of the estuary ports by a more focused management, greater efficiencies and economies of scale, allowing a more structured approach to infrastructure development as well as a more rational approach to the best use of terminals and assets. It is anticipated that port charges will be reduced and that the new single port company will be better positioned to address the current and potential business opportunities that the estuary offers the mid-west region and the State.</P>
    <P>As a shareholder, it is my responsibility to ensure the State's port industry assets are deployed to best effect and that the business is <Col N="744" /> competitive, responsive to customer's needs and operates on a sound financial footing. Above all I want the port industry to be a focal point for development of the estuary as a whole and to deliver to the best extent possible on its potential. It is imperative if this major change is to be successfully carried through that the legislation is enacted as a matter of the highest priority. It is my conviction that we must maintain momentum. The customers of both port companies want the new structures to be put in place quickly and efficiently.</P>
    <P>It is my intention as soon as the Bill becomes law to proceed with making the necessary ministerial orders to set up the new single company, name it, enshrine the headquarters location as Foynes and all the other matters needing determination such as capital formation etc. I wish to reaffirm my earlier commitment that the headquarters of the new port company will be in Foynes. I am leaving the suggested name for further discussion with the advisory boards and the implementation board. This is the most significant ever development for the Shannon estuary. As I said before, we have a fantastic natural resource which is totally undeveloped. I want it to become the premier port in Ireland and to take away traffic going to the west and south-west and especially to Dublin port. I want this to be the main port for the south-west and west. Foynes is a unique deep water facility and already I have had a number of inquiries about possible investment in the Foynes area as a result of the creation of a new single port company. There is immediate and significant development potential for the Foynes and Limerick areas and we will deliver on the commitments we have made.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. As the Minister said, the legislation has a long and chequered history. The original proposal goes back about 25 years and over a period of time it was opposed by the Opposition. One must recognise that we are in a new millennium and that things move on. I have adopted a very pragmatic approach to the legislation from the outset and had many discussions with the Minister. Obviously I believe that what is happening is essentially good for the estuary, for Limerick and particularly for Foynes. I regard it as especially important for Foynes in the context of the west jetty development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact the Minister said it is impossible for Foynes to proceed with craneage and dust hoppers and to find 50% of the funding because of the financial situation of the company and the development of the west jetty. I ask the Minister to move with haste in terms of advancing <Col N="745" /> the finance for Foynes to provide both the craneage and hoppers which are urgently required.</P>
    <P>It is well known that my family made a major contribution to the development of Foynes over the years. My father, who has been dead for a few years, was a harbour pilot for a long time in Foynes and, therefore, I have a tremendous interest in seeing Foynes making good progress and proceeding with the advances made over the years.</P>
    <P>When the KPMG report was first proceeded with in November 1999, with the consent of the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Woods, it was easy to predict its outcome. I predicted it would come to the conclusion that the best way forward was one single estuary authority. I was well aware that senior officials in the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources had favoured this course of action over many years and were disappointed it had not evolved. I am disappointed with the report in the context of Foynes itself and am glad the Minister has corrected the situation in his contributions in the Dáil and Seanad. There was much criticism in the report and much of the focus seemed to be on the finances of Foynes port. Insufficient attention was paid to complimenting the board on building a very strong asset base without great assistance from the State. It was regrettable that the report seemed to focus very much on the negative rather than on the more positive aspects.</P>
    <P>Foynes port has been a vital component in the creation of essential deep-water facilities on the west coast. It has developed because risks have been taken and now has sheltered deep-water facilities second to none. It alone provided a mechanism to the State to identify a project which would benefit the mid-west and western seaboard by obtaining EU funding of £5.8 million for its west jetty deep-water project. This finance was approved by my colleague, Deputy Barrett, when Minister for Defence and the Marine.</P>
    <P>The port, which the Minister has visited, is a vibrant hive of activity. He will no doubt agree that it is a major achievement that a port of this size has been created in a little west Limerick village when all of its competitor deep-water ports are situated in large centres of population close to the United Kingdom and continental Europe.</P>
    <P>I am justly proud of all those who have contributed to the success story that is Foynes. Its opposition to amalgamation until now has not hampered its development. All concerned have forged ahead to create the only major State asset on the estuary. Given the millions of pounds invested by the State in Dublin, Cork and Waterford compared to a sum of less than £600,000 in Foynes in its 110 year history and the battle it has faced with substandard road access throughout the 1980s and 1990s its achievement is unique.</P>
    <P>Thankfully progress is being made with regard to improvements to the N69 route. In seeking the necessary approval of his Cabinet colleagues for the required works, the Minister drew attention to the need for an access road through Foynes <Col N="746" /> and indicated that he would have discussions with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, to ensure the necessary funding would be provided in the short-term. I regard this as an essential component to sustain the goodwill of the people of Foynes who have been very tolerant during the years with regard to spillage and heavy traffic on its main streets generated by port business. Consistent with his commitment I urge the Minister with his colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, to accelerate the required funding for this much needed access road.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Minister that he intends to provide for significant capital investment in the port. His acknowledgement with regard to cranage and hoppers is a step in the right direction. I hope the news will be announced shortly. The Minister has also expressed his favourable view of the performance of the port to date. This is appreciated. I have adopted a pragmatic approach to the Bill because of the assurances given. They relate specifically to the socio-economic wellbeing of Foynes which is the economic nerve centre for a hinterland stretching from the north Kerry border 13 miles to the west almost to Limerick city. Its importance is based solely on it being the premier deep-water facility on the estuary. It is dependent on the Minister and the implementation board taking correct, prudent and wise decisions for its continued success.</P>
    <P>I do not speak solely about the economic wellbeing of the new entity but of the microcosm of social partnership which has developed successfully in Foynes since the 1950s between the port company, port users and dock workers. There is a strong social responsibility on the Minister, as shareholder in this new entity, to ensure their efforts are protected. No impediment should be placed in his way. This would be a sign of good faith with regard to his intentions.</P>
    <P>Since the launch of the KPMG report much has been made of the cash flow difficulties which have arisen in Foynes following construction of the new deep-water facility. The projected overrun of approximately £3 million is due largely to unfavourable ground conditions undetected during geological surveys and not the fault of board and management. I remind the Minister that, as shareholder, he is responsible for all equity invested in the company. A significant injection is required to remedy the lack of investment in the past. The Minister will agree that if the shareholder is not providing equity the only other alternative is to borrow for capital projects. In short, far from being critical of the board and management I would have been far more comfortable if KPMG had praised the company for providing the Minister with a £50 million asset between marine and industrial infrastructural facilities for a total State investment of £571,000. It was a very prudent investment on the part of his predecessors.</P>
    <P>As a board member from 1985 to 1995 I wit<Col N="747" /> nessed at first hand a committed team from board level to the dock workforce. What made Foynes port unique was the pride taken in doing the job better and generating growth for which I pay tribute to all concerned. The Minister will no doubt ensure all the positive attributes which have made Foynes the major port on the west coast are brought to fruition. I will keep an ever vigilant eye on developments to ensure the commitments given to the port are honoured.</P>
    <P>Many members of the dock workforce have worked on a casual basis all their working lives. Because of proposals to alter work practices they face an uncertain period. The recent Baxter-Eadie report on capacity studies projected a tonnage level through Foynes of about 3 million tonnes within a few years. Where changed work practices impact on dockers it is vital that the implementation committee ensures appropriate and adequate compensation is paid. I will monitor the situation closely to ensure there is fair play.</P>
    <P>The Minister recently received correspondence in connection with improvements carried out by Foynes Yacht Club at Cooleen Point. The works were undertaken in conjunction with the capital dredging programme which was part of the west jetty extension project. To facilitate the provision of a successful and comprehensive navigation channel the yacht club engaged in a refacing project to enable the dredging company proceed with the deep-water project to its maximum potential. The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Woods, wrote to the yacht club on 22 June 1999 following a meeting with a deputation from the club indicating his goodwill and outlining his intentions for the financing of the works.</P>
    <P>Foynes Yacht Club was founded in 1962 and has 70 members. As a result of the improvements and its future development plans it has received numerous inquiries from prospective members. It has expended approximately £25,000 to date but it will take a further £11,500 to complete phase one of the project. The yacht club urgently requires finance to meet the commitments entered into based on the goodwill of Deputy Woods to the project. The local community has shown much goodwill to the merging of the harbours and the Minister has scope to provide the necessary finance. He has scope under the Marine Casualties Investigation Bill passed by the House recently to assist marine related projects. I welcomed that Bill as a step in the right direction. I was always of the view that the Department sought to fund such projects in conjunction with other port related activities. The Minister has the scope to help Foynes Yacht Club and I hope he will do so.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minster's assurance that the headquarters will be based in Foynes. He gave this assurance in response to a priority question, in his presentation at the Ryan Hotel in Limerick at the launch of the KPMG report, in the Seanad and here this evening. In the Seanad he stated <Col N="748" /> that it would not be good legislative practice to enshrine in the legislation that Foynes be the administrative, commercial and operational headquarters.</P>
    <P>However, in a similar Bill in 1988 it was enshrined that the headquarters would be based in Foynes. What has changed between 1988 and now? I believe the Minister has encountered opposition from his Department. I will be pursuing this by way of amendment on Committee Stage because it is possible to enshrine it in the legislation and copperfasten what the Minster stated. Ministers come and go and circumstances change. The legislation should copperfasten this. There is no impediment to doing so unless the Minister has reached an impasse with his officials, who in the past would not have been sympathetic to Foynes.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minster ensures this provision in the legislation. We have a high regard for the Bill and for its importance for the future of the estuary. The Minister may object that the acceptance of an amendment on Committee Stage tomorrow will necessitate the Bill returning to the Seanad. I understand the Seanad will meet on Friday and may possibly meet on Monday. I am sure that with the Minster's co-operation such an amendment would be passed. Overall, I welcome the legislation. It sets out the right direction for the future prosperity of the estuary.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on his initiative in introducing this Bill. This is the third Shannon estuary ports Bill I have addressed since I came into politics. I remember the Mitchell initiative in the mid-1980s when I addressed the relevant Bill at length in the Seanad. In 1989 I spoke on the Bill sponsored by Deputy Daly for approximately two hours. I am familiar with the history of the legislation relating to the Shannon estuary.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minster will return to the House before I finish. In the meantime I ask the Minster of State to listen to what I have to say. I have an interest in the County Kerry point of view. Why did the Minister not appoint a representative from County Kerry to the implementation structure? Counties Clare and Limerick are represented, but there is nobody from County Kerry on the five man board. It is inexplicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his contribution to the debate on the Bill in the Seanad, the Minister referred to the Shannon estuary. He stated that he had asked Shannon Development Company in conjunction with Shannon Estuary Ports Company to explore the possibility of establishing a terminal adjacent to Shannon Development Company's landbank near Ballylongford in north County Kerry. The Minister's speech to the House tonight is similar <Col N="749" /> to the one he made in the Seanad, but he omitted this aspect. Has he forgotten about the landbank or has he obtained advice that the terminal would be a non-runner? What is the reason for the omission?</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister's statement that the access road to Foynes needs to be upgraded. I travel this road on my way to and from Dublin and it is not only very dangerous, but the surface and alignment is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>The N69, a national secondary road, is the lifeline of north County Kerry. It runs from Tarbert to Tralee. There is no national primary road. The investment should not stop at Foynes. In whatever programmes or schemes for the road the Minister proposes, I appeal to him to include Limerick to Tralee via Foynes. That is very important from a north County Kerry point of view.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister of State I established the Shannon estuary strategy group in March 1996 to focus on the landbank in Tarbert and Ballylongford. It comprises over 660 acres of State land. There is also private land attached to it, approximately 1,000 acres in all. It is not in use, in some instances that has been the case for more than 30 years. Farmers were forced to leave the landbank, their milk quotas went with them and it took away a very important part of the local economy, which has never recovered.</P>
    <P>I established the strategy group to bring all the main players together, including the Department, the IDA, Shannon Development, Foynes Harbour, Limerick Harbour and other agencies. This resulted in the establishment of the Shannon Estuary Development Company in September 1997. It produced a position paper by Price Waterhouse in November 1998, which contained a number of important recommendations. The company sought a meeting with the previous Minister, Deputy Woods, but he refused. As a result the company lost its momentum and it has not met for almost a year. I went to a lot of trouble to have this company established. It had to be accepted by the Department of Finance and it was only accepted because it had a brief to do something about the land the State acquired at a very high cost in Ballylongford and Tarbert for development purposes. Will the Minister explain why the company has not met in the past year? Perhaps he has no brief on it. Will he consider making it a subsidiary of the new company he is proposing to establish? That would be important. We will consider an amendment to this effect for Committee Stage because I strongly recommend that this be done.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that nothing happened on the Tarbert-Ballylongford landbank because of the attitude by the other stakeholders in the estuary. Limerick Harbour Commissioners were more positively disposed towards the landbank than Foynes Harbour, which was never over-enthusiastic in allowing anything to happen in the estuary beyond its control. One operator made an application for a harbour between Foynes and <Col N="750" /> Tarbert. It was objected to and Foynes Harbour was not enthusiastic about it.</P>
    <P>I compliment Foynes Harbour on its achievements. We would certainly recognise the contribution the Finucane family made to the development of Foynes Harbour in the past, but in the new scenario of goodwill, where all the stakeholders are obviously co-operating, that Tarbert-Ballylongford land bank should not be marginalised or excluded from any future plans. It worries me that the Minister made a major issue of this landbank in his Seanad speech and it was omitted from his speech tonight. He made almost the same speech on both occasions.</P>
    <P>Between contributions in the Seanad and in this House, I have made contributions of about four hours on this matter and therefore I need not add any more here. What I said about the Shannon Estuary and the Tarbert-Ballylongford landbank in 1984 still holds.</P>
    <P>There are just two points I want the Minister to address. Large containers come up the river to Moneypoint, for example, and the Minister asked Shannon Development to carry out a review of the potential for establishing a container facility on the Tarbert-Ballylongford landbank. Will he give us the up to date position on that tonight? It is important that he enlighten us in the regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. We will get another opportunity to discuss it tomorrow. There is a great deal at stake here for that region, particularly, from my point of view, for the Tarbert-Ballylongford area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Finucane and Deenihan for sharing their time with me. I also welcome the Bill. It took some persuasion for me to change my mind having believed fervently for many years that the best interests of Foynes lay in having an authority in charge of Foynes. I believed that because of the success of the boards. Like Deputy Finucane, I was on the board from 1985 to 1998 and I was aware of the success of Foynes in the context of the ports of Ireland. It was far in advance of many other ports in Ireland. It was our most efficient port at one stage but with rationalisation and the restructuring of other ports it has dropped from the top spot. This proposal has the potential to bring Foynes back up to the level it maintained two decades ago.</P>
      <P>It is important that the work done is recognised. Much of it was done with little investment from the State which owned it. Most of the investment was undertaken from the port's resources. It raised finance and often made decisions which looked risky at the time but turned out to be wise. At one stage we decided to purchase land for development and many people were sceptical about that but within two or three years all of that land was developed, resulting in extensive activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister corrected the KPMG report's comment on the financial viability of Foynes which is reckoned to have assets of about <Col N="751" /> £35 million. Many of those assets, warehousing, etc., are disposable. While I do not accept that they should be disposed of, if finance was needed urgently they are available for disposal without compromising the activity of the port.</P>
    <P>More attention should be paid to marketing the port. There was not enough emphasis on international marketing of the port, and marketing was weak. That is improving and will continue to improve, and I compliment the current chief executive, his team and the board for ensuring that marketing is being examined as there is great potential there, as there is for offshore oil exploration. It is unfortunate that these ventures are not operating out of Foynes, but we do not have time to discuss this here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finucane referred to the possibility of addressing the position of the dockers. I have been saying that for years, but it cannot be done without the agreement of the dockers. I was involved in industrial relations for well over 20 years. I know there is no way one can impose an agreement. It would be unjust to impose a system without the full co-operation and agreement of the workers directly involved. I urge the Minister to ensure that that is fully recognised by him and that the finance is made available to do it.</P>
    <P>I bring to the attention of the Minister that last Monday, Limerick County Council proposed and it was accepted unanimously that three councillors from County Limerick would be on the board. The Minister in the Seanad stated that he would consider that issue, but again I raise it. It has the full support of Limerick County Council. It was stated that the headquarters of the new estuarial company will be in Foynes. That would be a pre-condition for any acceptance of the authority by anybody in Foynes.</P>
    <P>When he spoke at Limerick County Council, the then vice-chairman of Foynes port company stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;we believe the State investment should consist of £40 million over five years together with State commitment to invest £30 million on the N69, together with upgrading of rail work. We believe that a duty free zone concept should be pursued, that Foynes should expand its management structure, that it would be desirable that three Councillors from Limerick County Council would be on the Board, . &rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That was the view of the board at the time. We were looking for an investment of £40 million and the upgrading of the N69, which we have asked for repeatedly in this House at every opportunity. It is vital for the success of Foynes that the N69 is upgraded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy O'Shea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of the Labour Party and particularly as a Deputy for Limerick East, I too welcome the legislation. Merging the two authorities, the Shannon Estuary Ports Company and the Foynes <Col N="752" /> Port Company, as a result of the Bill will be for the good of the region as a whole. I congratulate the Minister on bringing the legislation before the House.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the estuary is an area of huge potential for the economy of not just the mid-west but of the country. It is a fine deep sheltered port, capable of handling ships of up to 200,000 tonnes at present and possibly more, if action is taken with regard to the bar at the entrance to the estuary.</P>
    <P>It will offer a number of opportunities in the area, particularly the opportunity to develop further co-operation. In recent years the level of co-operation has increased greatly regarding daily operations, piloted tugs, the anti-pollution team which was set up and operates successfully, the oil-spill tracking which has been implemented in the area and the general running of the operations of the Shannon Estuary Ports Company and Foynes Port Company. This is the first time there has been agreement locally on the amalgamation of the two ports. Obviously this is the opportune time to bring that into effect. If work is not duplicated, it will help greatly and we would all support that.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Neville stated, what is happening will offer potential in a number of areas. I also emphasise the opportunities to develop the port and market it as a port of great potential if it had much greater capacity than it does at present. There is a great deal more to it than simply the Ted Russell Docks and Foynes. Most of the tonnage comes through Aughinish and Moneypoint which are further down the river. Other strategic areas, such as Kilrush, also have much to offer in the development of the port, as does the north Kerry coast to which Deputy Deenihan referred. It must be seen as a whole and there should not be a concentration on the potential of specific parts of it.</P>
    <P>It must also be seen in the context of the Shannon river as a whole. The river north of Limerick will be opened to a much greater extent because a navigation scheme is being developed in Limerick at present. Those who visited Limerick recently will have seen that there is practically no water in one section of the Abbey river in the centre of the city. This is because the river is being deepened and that work is being carried out in conjunction with the main drainage scheme. It will result in both pleasure craft and other boats being able to navigate the Shannon to its source. This offers a great potential, so it should not be seen purely in terms of the estuary, rather as the entire Shannon basin and estuary offering the potential for development, something I hope we will be able to grasp.</P>
    <P>We adopted various water quality management plans for the upper Shannon, the lakes, the lower Shannon and the estuary. All these projects need to be co-ordinated in terms of the water quality and also the various uses to which they can be put. Deputy Finucane referred to yachting, which is one use, but there are many other potential <Col N="753" /> uses. For example, I understand there are dolphins in the estuary on the Clare side and a new sport of dolphin watching has developed there as well as in Dingle.</P>
    <P>The main use is, obviously, trade, that is, importing and exporting goods. Figures suggest that more than 80% of imports and exports come through ports rather than by other methods. The 1999 throughput for the Shannon Estuary Ports Authority was £8.7 million and it was £1.3 million for Foynes. Taking both together, that represents a sizeable amount of trade. With vision and a strong marketing strategy, which I hope the Minister will be able to support financially, that can be greatly developed. It is an area of huge potential. There is a great deal of unused land on either side of the estuary and that can be developed.</P>
    <P>Within my area, the Ted Russell Docks in Limerick are of particular concern. I seem to be the only Limerick East Deputy in House. I hope others will contribute before the debate is over. It is important that the Ted Russell Docks are protected because there is a significant and important trade through them with Limerick and the surrounding area. The Minister referred to the fourth crossing of the Shannon and said it must not restrict the development and long-term viability of the Ted Russell Docks, not only from a commercial perspective but also as a facility for water-based tourism. I welcome that, but I would like him to go further and give us a commitment that he will argue in Cabinet to ensure that that river crossing does not impede the development of the Ted Russell Docks.</P>
    <P>There are proposals for a lifting bridge, a high level bridge or a tunnel. Will the Minister rule out a lifting or low level bridge and ensure his colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, also rules it out? We will not agree to a crossing which interferes with the docks in Limerick. I would like a categoric assurance that that will not happen and that there will not be a Cabinet decision to provide a crossing which interferes with the Ted Russell Docks. A high level bridge or a tunnel are the two viable possibilities in that area and perhaps the Minister would address that issue in his response because it is very important. The docks are continuing their operations and whatever new programmes are planned in terms of infrastructure should not interfere with what already exists and works well. On infrastructure, I support my colleagues on the issue of the N69 which has been in need of upgrading for a long time. However, I also ask that the needs of the Ted Russell Docks in Limerick be given the necessary consideration. I hope other Deputies from Limerick East support me in that regard.</P>
    <P>Another area where I have had a problem with the Minister's decision-making process is in regard to the announcement about the headquarters of the company. The Minister said it will be located in Foynes. KPMG did not recommend that the location of the headquarters be decided <Col N="754" /> at this stage and suggested the incoming board should decide on its location. I hope this decision and the gazumping of Limerick as a headquarters had nothing to do with the floating nature of the third seat in Limerick West. I hope it was not made for anything other than the best of reasons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan:</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to be the only <i>fait accompli</i> and the only change from the recommendations of the KPMG report. That is why I wonder about the motivation behind it. While I am not grudging in recognising the good points of the legislation, I regret that this decision has already been announced. It would have been better to fully implement the recommendations of the KPMG report.</P>
      <P>The implementation board obviously has a difficult task ahead of it, such as dealing with staffing, ensuring there are no difficulties and that the whole process is implemented smoothly. I welcome the fact that the Minister said there will not be any forced redundancies, but there will be many issues to be thrashed out. I hope that will be done in the interests of the area and of the mid-west as a whole and that they will worked out in a positive fashion.</P>
      <P>Regarding equity and the money which can be invested as a result of the legislation, I note the Minister said that KPMG assessed the amount to be in the order of £5 million to £8 million. That figure may have to be revised upwards judging from discussions I have had with people involved. I hope the Minister will keep an open mind on that and that the amount of funding needed will be made available. The two issues which have been referred to and which have been well debated and flagged are the pensions issue for the workers of the Shannon Estuary port and the cashflow problem in Foynes, and these must be addressed. Our ports are of such importance to the country, it is necessary to ensure that whatever funding is required is made available because there is such great potential, especially in the Shannon Estuary. I hope the Minister will be able to provide the necessary funding. Will the Minister indicate when replying when he expects the provisions of the legislation will come into force, assuming it passes through the House this week? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Shannon Estuary port received the ISO 9002 award in 1997. I think it was the first port in Ireland to receive that award. The standard of expertise in both port companies is very high. Professional staff with the highest of qualifications will be available to the joint authority when it is set up. As I said earlier, the highest standards of safety have already been implemented in the estuary. There is also a high level of technology. However, a certain amount <Col N="755" /> of equipment will be needed and I hope the money will be forthcoming in that regard.</P>
    <P>Overall, this is a win-win situation for both of the ports involved and will be welcomed generally by the movers and shakers in the mid-west. The mid-west has been a very successful region in many ways. It has been to the forefront of development in terms of the airport, technology in the Limerick area, the port and in many other areas. In some ways, the mid-west has operated very well as a region, ahead of other regions in Ireland, and we have benefited in that regard. The estuary, as the core physical centre of the region, has great potential to continue that development. Although the next parish to Loop Head is in America, we can develop. We are obviously constrained to some extent by being on the west rather than the east coast in terms of certain traffic. However, there is great potential there that should be developed.</P>
    <P>I would like undertakings from the Minister on the financial support that will be needed to develop the estuary and, particularly from the point of view of Limerick, the question of the fourth river crossing of the Shannon. I want a commitment from the Minister that he will ensure at Cabinet that the Ted Russell docks will not be interfered with by that crossing.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation. We will table amendments on Committee Stage. They were flagged in the Seanad and the Minister is aware of the issues that are of concern to us. As there will be very little time between Committee and Report Stages, I hope the Minister will have an opportunity to examine them. They will cover much the same issues tabled by the Labour Party in the Seanad. Apart from those, I welcome the legislation.</P>

Fáiltím leis an mBille seo ach ní bheidh mise ag caint mar gheall ar cursaí Luimní, beidh mé ag caint mar gheall ar cursaí Phort Lairge. Ní bheidh morán le rá agamsa ach ní hionann sin is a rá nach bhfuil na pointí go mbeidh mé á chur os chóir na Dála tábhachtach.</P>
      <P>I thank my co-member of the Labour Party, Deputy O'Sullivan, for sharing her time with me. I welcome the Bill, but probably for different reasons from other Deputies who contributed to the debate. I will not allude to the situation in Foynes or Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> Under a technicality, money is waiting to be transferred to the Waterford port company. Until this technicality is removed, this much needed money cannot be transferred. About £2 million is due from central funds to the Waterford port company to meet a European Investment Bank loan. Therefore, I will not delay the House because I want to see this Bill passed as speedily as possible. I ask the Minister to give an under<Col N="756" /> taking when he replies to Second Stage that the money due to the Waterford harbour company will be paid as speedily as possible after the passage of this Bill through the House this week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne):</NameTxt>
      <P>While this is a relatively short Bill, encompassing 11 sections in total, this belies the importance of the Bill for the ports industry in Ireland. Since the nine major commercial seaports were transformed from harbour authority status under the absolute central control of the State to fully fledged commercial State company status in March 1997, the ports industry has surged forward.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Finucane, I was heavily involved in the port of New Ross. I was chairman of the New Ross harbour commissioners, which is now a port company. I was delighted to be there because it gave me the necessary experience to speak on this subject. I also know Waterford port quite well. I am sure, since there will not be any interference with New Ross, we will readily make way for Waterford to continue its expansion. Waterford and New Ross are examples of what can be done.</P>
      <P>The dynamic growth of the economy has been reflected in the increased business and throughputs at the ports servicing the national and regional economies. For example, a recent study conducted by Dublin Chamber of Commerce on Dublin port found that £30 billion worth of goods is handled by that port.</P>
      <P>I would like to give a brief overview of the port companies which underlines their pivotal role in underpinning economic growth and ensuring the sustainable mobility of sea transport. Deputy O'Sullivan alluded to the fact that seaports in the Republic handle just over 93% by volume of our import-export trade and are vital to the operation of all sectors of the economy, in terms of goods and passenger movement. The nine port companies account for 92% of this traffic. Ports throughput in 1999 increased by 6.8% over the preceding year, from 40.05 million tonnes to a record level of 43.28 million tonnes. Some 2.97 million passengers passed through the port companies' facilities in 1999. The total is 4.42 million passengers, including Rosslare in my constituency which is operated by Irish Rail. Turnover in 1999 for all nine companies was £71.6 million, compared to £66.1 million for the same period in 1998, an increase of 9.3%. Total fixed assets for the nine companies, as of 31 December 1999, are valued at £273.7 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's action programme for the millennium recognises that the necessary infrastructure to handle ever-increasing volumes of tourism and trade has to be underpinned by continuing investment and the maintenance of competitiveness. There is a necessity for continued investment in the port companies' facilities, both on a national and regional basis. This is clear, given that almost 93% of all external trade by <Col N="757" /> volume relies totally on seaports for access. The strategic importance of seaport trade to the vitality of the national and regional economy is paramount. Some £46 million has been provided in the national development plan for investments in seaports. Investment will be focused on new infrastructure where deficiencies are identified, upgrading of existing infrastructure, improvement of capacity utilisation, intermodal connections and restructuring of small, non-port company harbours.</P>
    <P>Turning to the KPMG consultancy report on the Shannon estuary ports industry, the consultants recommended that urgent Government approval for necessary legislation be obtained to create a new single port structure in the Shannon estuary. It is good that all the Members who contributed to this debate, and I am sure the other representatives from that area, support the Bill.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on introducing the Bill, which is timely and necessary. I congratulate both port companies which operate in the Limerick estuary. As a former chairman of the Foynes harbour company, I feel compelled to state that it is an example to all.</P>
    <P>The Bill has reached its current stage a short three months after publication of the KPMG report. This is a reflection not only of the need for action on the report's findings but, more importantly, of the Government's commitment to ensuring that all nine port companies are positioned to deliver the best possible service to their customers.</P>
    <P>The Government regards the commercial port companies as a key link in the transport chain. The amendments to the Harbours Act. 1996, contained in the Bill will introduce a degree of flexibility in the powers of the Minister to potentially address strategic issues for the effective management of the ports and their development needs. As an island nation, Ireland is almost totally reliant on seaborne trade to cater for imports and exports. The importance of the ports is reflected by the provisions in the Bill and also by the priority it is being accorded by all Members on all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that Deputy O'Sullivan's wish has been granted and that the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, has appeared in the House. I am sure he will make a significant contribution to the debate and that his support for the Bill will be as trenchant and forceful as that of Deputy O'Sullivan.</P>
    <P>A very significant provision in the Bill is contained in section 6 which amends an existing provision in the Harbours Act, 1996. Essentially, the restrictive provision in the 1996 Act which circumscribes the powers of the Minister for Finance to make available to a company moneys solely for the purposes of capital works is addressed. The Minister for Finance will now have enabling powers to make available moneys for other purposes as well. In addition, the threshold on the aggregate amount of moneys that can <Col N="758" /> be made available to the ports has been increased by 20% to £60 million. I am sure that will be a source of satisfaction to the Member from Waterford, Deputy O'Shea. These relaxations of financial strictures governing the port companies will be heartily welcomed by those companies.</P>
    <P>I commend this innovative and timely Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I have never been a member of the Foynes Harbour Board but I was a member of Limerick Harbour Board for many years and I have a great deal of experience in this area. I assure Deputy O'Sullivan that the Bill will prove very successful.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, on bringing forward this important legislation. In essence, the Harbours (Amendment) Bill will enable the Minister to amalgamate the functions of the Foynes Port Company and the Shannon Estuary Port Company. The Minister correctly stated that the amalgamation of these two companies will ensure that the new single port authority will become the leading authority on the west coast.</P>
      <P>The Bill has received widespread support from interested parties from my constituency of Limerick West. It is important that the ports to which I refer become more competitive in the short and medium term. The amalgamation of the Foynes Port Company and the Shannon Estuary Port Company will ensure that more commercial sea transport operators will use these ports in the future. There will, of course, be key spin-offs for the area as the result of the enactment of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following wide-ranging consultations with both port companies, the Government requested an independent and objective review of the system which operates within the Shannon estuary ports. The report, which was carried out by KPMG Consultants, was published at the end of March this year. It is only right at this point to congratulate the former Minister for the Marine and Natu<Col N="759" /> ral Resources, Deputy Woods, who initiated the process from which the legislation emerged. The consultants stated that the establishment of a new and single port company was the only arrangement which makes commercial and operational sense. The Government has taken this key recommendation on board and included it in provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the spin-offs which could result for the Shannon estuary and the two ports involved in terms of further job creation in the future. However, the establishment of a new amalgamated port will ensure that more coherent marketing strategies can be put in place to enhance the attractiveness of the Shannon estuary to new users. It is anticipated that port charges will be reduced and that a new single port company would be in a much stronger position to promote potential business opportunities for the estuary and for the mid-west region.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill amends section 43 of the Harbours Act, 1996. This section provides that if the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources is of the opinion that the functions of a company or companies could be performed in a more cost effective and efficient manner by another company or companies, he or she may establish a new company which would result in the amalgamation of existing companies.</P>
    <P>Section 1 enables the Minister to amalgamate the functions of Foynes Port Company and the Shannon Estuary Port Company. It also provides for the establishment of an implementation board and an advisory board to facilitate the amalgamation. The Government has already announced the establishment of a five member implementation board on an informal basis initially, pending the enactment of this important legislation.</P>
    <P>I listened attentively to the contribution of Deputy Deenihan who stated that a representative from the Kerry region should have been appointed to the board. I have no objection to that proposal. However, it will be difficult to accommodate the Deputy because I understand that the existing boards will continue to operate in an advisory capacity. I also understand that two members from each board were chosen to serve on the implementation board and that it would be chaired by an independent chairman who is from Galway. At this stage, it does not appear that there will be a representative from Kerry on the board.</P>
    <P>There will be close liaison between the implementation board, both port company boards and their successor advisory boards in order to ensure a successful transition to a new single port company structure. The advisory board, which will be comprised of the directors of the Foynes Port Company and the Shannon Estuary Port Company, will have a real and important role to fulfil in assisting the implementation board of the new company to pursue new strategies aimed at guaranteeing its future success.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for the Marine and Natural <Col N="760" /> Resources stated on 14 June last, a serious obligation will be placed on the advisory boards to assist, in every way, with the achievement of the main and subsidiary objectives for which the company is being established.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment. Blessington, situated in west Wicklow only a few miles from the Dublin border, is subject to the population overflow of the greater metropolitan area. In March-April 1999, St. Mary's primary school obtained approval from the Department of Education and Science to renovate the old school building and turn it into classrooms. To date, this work has not even commenced, resulting in the staff room being used as a classroom and a converted hallway being used as a special needs room for the past year.</P>
      <P>In September 1999, 361 pupils enrolled in the school and 386 pupils are enrolled for September. There will be a need to accommodate 15 classes but there will only be 12 rooms. In April of this year, the school applied for the provision of two permanent prefabs to accommodate growing numbers. There has not been any definite response to this request.</P>
      <P>With only a couple of months to go until September, the school faces a crisis and it is unacceptable that the young children of the area should be subjected to such conditions. I am aware that sanction has been given for a new school but it may be several years before this comes to fruition. What is the updated position and will the Minister address the points I have raised without delay to ensure that problems will not arise in September?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea):</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, the staffing level at St. Mary's National School is a principal plus 12 assistant teachers and a remedial <Col N="761" /> teacher. The school's enrolment level was 361 at September 1999. Due to an increase in pupil enrolments, an existing old church building situated adjacent to the school will be converted shortly to accommodate two additional classrooms.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science is currently examining the tender report received for this work and will be in contact with the school authorities as soon as possible. In the meantime, the temporary accommodation needs at the school are currently being assessed by the Department and a letter will issue to the management authorities of the school very shortly concerning this matter.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there is a very large number of school building projects on hand within the Department. Due to the priority which this Government has given to reversing the neglect of our primary schools evident previously, the spending Estimates show primary school building and renovation funding increasing by an unprecedented 186% from the 1997 budget allocation. In addition, we have significantly reduced the burden of fundraising faced by schools and communities throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that these projects will be progressed as quickly as possible and I thank him again for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane:</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to raise this matter. On previous occasions, I have highlighted the urgent need to build a Gaelscoil in Newcastlewest. In 1995, the then Minister for Education, Niamh Bhreathnach, approved the building of Gaelscoil Ó Dóghair i gCaisleán Nua. The Gaelscoil operates from a collection of prefabricated buildings and a local community centre. The current situation is entirely unsatisfactory. There are 230 pupils in the school which is staffed by 11 teachers, including a principal teacher, eight assistant teachers, one remedial and one resource teacher.</P>
      <P>The planning unit of the Department has been provided with the costings for the work. On 26 May 2000, Limerick County Council granted permission for a new eight classroom school in addition to a general purposes room and ancillary accommodation in Newcastlewest. The laying of sewerage pipes and the provision of water facilities has also been agreed and the Department has been notified accordingly. The Department should indicate that it will reimburse the Gaelscoil for the two and a half acre site it has purchased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no impediments to the construction of this school which, since 1995, has continued to lose its priority building status. The Gaelscoil pupils and parents have suffered a great deal of inconvenience over the years and their tolerance of the situation cannot be taken for granted any longer. There are no obstacles to building the school and I sincerely hope the Minister will con<Col N="762" /> firm that the school will be given priority status. Will he also confirm the Department's approval that the construction of a new school can proceed at this stage?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Finucane for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the Department's current position regarding the proposed new school for Gaelscoil Ó Dóghair, Newcastlewest, County Limerick.</P>
      <P>The school has a current staffing level of principal teacher, eight assistant teachers and a remedial teacher. The school's enrolment at 30 September 1999 was 217. The school is currently based in temporary accommodation in the local community centre and the Department is grant aiding 95% of the rental costs.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science has approved the commencement of architectural planning for the provision of a new school for Gaelscoil Ó Dóghair. A site has been identified and the Department's building unit is currently pursuing the acquisition of the site.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that this case is being dealt with as speedily as possible having regard to the large number of school building projects on hand within the Department. I thank him again for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position to the House.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil don Cheann Comhairle as ucht cead a thabhairt dom an moladh seo a chur roimh an Teach anocht. Cork North West is a rural constituency which does not have the advantage of many industries. The Government has embarked on a decentralisation programme to rural towns, a programme which I endorse. Macroom is my local town which, together with Millstreet and other towns in my constituency, such as Kanturk, Newmarket and Charleville, should be considered for the decentralisation programme.</P>
      <P>I draw particular attention to Macroom which lies at the heart of the beautiful Lee Valley on the national primary route, the N22, half way between Cork and Killarney. Macroom occupies a central position in County Cork. Within a 20 mile radius, one has Cork city, Ballincollig, Blarney, Mallow, Millstreet, Bandon, Dunmanway, Ballineen-Enniskeane, Clonakilty and numerous other villages. Macroom boasts the highest area of population in the county.</P>
      <P>At the last census in 1996, the population of Macroom town was 2,674 and the number is growing rapidly. The decentralisation of a Government Department would help to serve the needs of people in the town, provide employment and commercially enhance the locality. It would also help to stop the depopulation of rural areas and halt rural decline.</P>

    <P>Macroom is very dependent on one industry, a multinational electronic factory. A Government Department, together with increasing employ<Col N="763" /> ment, would recognise and confirm the Government's commitment to the people of Macroom. Macroom boasts strong sporting and cultural traditions and has a variety of facilities to cater for recreational and social needs. There is an 18 hole golf course, a pitch and putt course, soccer and GAA pitches, a leisure centre and swimming pool and the Briery Gap complex which combines a theatre, cinema and library. Essential services such as schools, banks, shops and supermarkets are also available.</P>
    <P>Macroom is located just 20 minutes from Cork city and 30 minutes from Cork airport, ferry port and rail station. A good bus service operates on the main Cork/Killarney Bus Éireann route spanning the tourist locations of Blarney, Killarney and Gougane Barra.</P>
    <P>Macroom is experiencing large scale development and has the potential for further development. The provision of increased housing in the area will lead to an increase in population. The availability of development land is a positive factor in the context of a decision in favour of a greenfield development. In addition to a possible development location, some existing buildings are also available within the town, adjacent to a car park. There is urgent need for decentralisation of a Department to Macroom. This would be in keeping with regional labour market needs, serving the needs of the population and with the Government's commitment to regional equality.</P>
    <P>I have shown that Macroom is the ideal location for such a development due to its central location in the south-western region, its proximity to all services, ancillary facilities and development opportunities. Decentralisation would create the conditions for substantial development economically, socially and culturally for future generations and would be in keeping with the main recommendations of the Government to cater for the needs of the people, both nationally and regionally, over the coming years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Moynihan for raising this important issue. I recognise his deep interest in the issue of decentralisation. It cannot be often that a subject is discussed on the Adjournment of both Houses on the same day, but that is the case this evening. It is indicative of the level of interest which the forthcoming programme of decentralisation has generated that it should be discussed both in this House and in the Seanad tonight. The interest in the subject is not, however, confined to these Houses. To date in excess of 90 cities, towns and villages in every county have made their respective cases for inclusion in the new programme. In addition, the issue has been the subject of much recent media coverage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am an enthusiastic supporter of the principle of decentralisation. As one of the correspondents to my Department said, it is a win-win situation. The relocation of thousands of public servants <Col N="764" /> from Dublin will serve to reduce congestion in our capital, ease house prices and save on the cost of office accommodation while promoting more balanced economic and social development throughout the country. I know that I am far from alone in this House in my support.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies will have seen at firsthand the tremendous economic benefits which accrued to their own localities and communities. I am sure Deputy Moynihan is aware of the benefits which the relocation of public servants can bring to an area and I know that he has set out a very strong case for the relocation of a Department or office to north Cork. I assure him and all those who have made such impressive cases that all of them will be taken into account by the Government as part of the consultative process which my colleague, the Minister for Finance, has commenced.</P>
    <P>This topic has obviously been the subject of previous Adjournment debates as well as regular parliamentary questions. It has been the practice to keep the House informed of the current state of the process and I want to maintain that practice. As Deputies are by now aware, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, has been engaged in a series of discussions with his Government colleagues with the intention that the Government will be in a position to take decisions on the new programme by the end of next month. In addition to these discussions, the Department of Finance has initiated a series of meetings with the staff unions involved and the Minister intends to meet those unions personally in advance of proposals being presented to Government. In response to concerns which have been expressed from time to time, I am happy to take this opportunity to confirm that, as with the previous programme, this forthcoming programme will be on a voluntary basis for individual public servants.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to this process is undeniable and, as evidence of this, I repeat what I told the House last week when I repeated the recent assurance given by the Minister for Finance to the Committee on Finance and Public Service to the effect that the implementation of the programme will be given priority attention within the Department of Finance and that the programme will be pushed out vigorously. Proper co-ordination will be ensured between the various Departments which will have a central role in the delivery of the programme, the Departments of Finance and the Environment and Local Government as well as my office, the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>In addition, I repeat my intention, as the Minister with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, to take a personal interest in the programme's efficient delivery. While I am conscious of the existing constraints in the construction industry, I am confident that with my office working closely with the industry, the programme will be delivered as efficiently and quickly as possible once decisions have been taken.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that I am not alone in my support <Col N="765" /> for decentralisation and I look forward to seeing the impact which the forthcoming programme will have. The current programme, which is coming to a conclusion, has seen almost 4,000 civil servants relocating from Dublin to almost 20 towns throughout the country. This policy of creating a more even spread of public sector jobs has, it is fair to say, been met with widespread satisfaction. This policy will be just one of many which will influence the Government in the determination of those centres to which Dublin-based offices are to be relocated.</P>
    <P>Over recent months I and many of my colleagues have received numerous submissions from local authorities, chambers of commerce, community associations and so on from around the country, all of which put forward convincing cases as to why their respective town or village should be included in the forthcoming programme. I have been tremendously impressed with the quality of those submissions and I congratulate all those involved on the time and commitment which went into their efforts. Obviously not all will be successful on this occasion, but I have no doubt that many of those submissions will form the basis for selling those towns and villages to industrialists and tourists around the world. In their endeavours I wish them every success. It is well deserved.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Hospital Waiting Lists.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for permitting me to raise this important and delicate matter on the Adjournment. The people in my constituency waited for 20 years for their own hospital. During that time access to hospital care for many was problematic, inconvenient or expensive. There were great hopes for the Adelaide and the Meath Hospital, Dublin, incorporating the National Children's Hospital, known colloquially as the Tallaght Hospital. In too many cases their hopes have been disappointed and, notwithstanding the huge controversy of over a year ago, the problems continue. It would appear that the hospital simply cannot cope with the demand.</P>
      <P>I refer to a case of a patient, a constituent of mine, who is badly in need of minor surgery to have a goitre removed. The goitre is assessed as being non-malignant but is so painful that the woman can scarcely speak or swallow. The constituent had been given dates which were cancelled in advance. She is a patient of Professor Tanner who is the consultant surgeon. Mr. Tanner, in a letter to me arising from my representations on behalf of this woman, said, <i>inter alia:</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Little has changed since we last discussed the problems of admitting patients to the Hospital in Tallaght. As things go Mrs. [naming her] will be lucky to be admitted for surgical removal of her goitre within the next 5 years! The chronic bed shortage has not been alleviated by the opening of the new 76 bed wing for as soon as this will be opened the hospital authorities intend to close 70 beds in the main hospital so <Col N="766" /> as they can transfer the nursing staff to the new wing! The ridiculous situation exists whereby I see about 30 new patients in the surgical outpatient each week and on average put 6 patients on a waiting list for inpatient surgery. I would be lucky if I were to be allowed 1 (one) admission per week at present! You don't need to be a genius therefore to work out that my waiting list is increasing on a weekly basis.</P>
    <P>I can see very little light at the end of the tunnel and on a personal note I have to say that the standard of care I can offer my patients here in Tallaght, compared to what I would offer them in the Adelaide &amp; Meath Hospitals, is below my own personal standards. I have therefore taken the decision to retire from active surgery in two years time and let someone else get on with the fighting! As highly paid professionals we should be able to come in and do a days work effectively without wasting our time on these sort of administrative headaches.</P>
    <P>It is simply unconscionable that this should continue. Professor Tanner's remarks are sobering to such an extent that I am concerned about quoting them publicly because I know there are cancer sufferers in my constituency who cannot get a reliable date for necessary surgical procedures. This is intolerable whatever the reason. In a country with a huge budget surplus, nothing can forgive the pain, stress and uncertainty caused by the Government's inability to address these problems. Something has to be done to tackle the residual problems at Tallaght Hospital. It is not acceptable that the people of my constituency, which has a catchment population of a quarter of a million and who have waited 20 years, cannot get access to hospital care. I present this case to show the gravity of the situation and I look forward to the Minister of State's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Rabbitte for raising this matter. As he may be aware, the provision of hospital services including those referred to by the Deputy is now a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority or ERHA. I am advised by the regional chief executive of the authority that the person referred to by the Deputy was placed on the waiting list for treatment on 10 February 2000 and is scheduled for admission on 11 July 2000. This is at variance with what has been said.</P>
      <P>The authority has advised me that while there have been some delays in admissions to Tallaght Hospital for certain types of procedure, it is incorrect to state that there is a serious bed shortage in the hospital. Tallaght Hospital is the most modern and well-equipped hospital in the State and has recently completed a private wing of 75 beds. In addition, it has had direct access to step-down facilities on the site of the old Meath Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Patients requiring non-urgent procedures may have experienced a delay in some instances in <Col N="767" /> accessing the services they require. This is due in part to the increasing demand for services at the hospital in general and to the increasing number of patients attending the accident and emergency department who require admission to the hospital. However, it is a function of management to ensure hospital beds, both in-patient and day care beds, are managed in an optimum fashion. The Deputy may wish to note that for patients who require admission to hospital, the shortage of sub-acute beds has caused problems in that some acute hospitals have not been able to discharge appropriate patients in sufficient numbers and quickly enough to cater for new patients seeking the services of our acute hospitals. This problem has direct links to the ageing of our population. Many elderly patients require acute hospital care initially, but much of their recovery period could be spent in step-down or sub-acute accommodation.</P>
    <P>My Department has already provided additional funding of £5 million in 2000 to provide more than 200 alternative care beds in the eastern region. These beds are a combination of sub-acute, convalescent and long stay places and will provide appropriate accommodation for patients who have finished the acute stage of their care and who require accommodation in a non-<Col N="768" /> acute setting. My Department is committed to reducing waiting lists and waiting times for patients requiring admission to hospital. The Minister for Health and Children has already allocated an additional £5 million to the authority to enable hospitals within their region to maximise available capacity and to enable additional procedures to be performed. I am advised by the authority that Tallaght Hospital is participating in the initiative, which will result in the reduction of the hospital's general surgical waiting list and waiting times for patients requiring such surgery.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also wish to note that my Department is currently undertaking a national review of acute and non-acute bed capacity. This review is critical to assess the capacity of the hospital system to manage periodic surges in emergency admission and the reduction of waiting times for elective treatment. It is intended that the findings of this review will inform decisions which will be taken in the context of the Health Estimate for 2001. I am confident the measures under taken by my Department, the authority and the hospital concerned will result in the provision of services in an enhanced and more efficient manner.</P>
    <P>I would seriously doubt the tone of Mr. Tanner's remarks in his letter.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 29 June 2000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 110 and 111 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, published in December 1996, sets out the requirements for the development of these services, including speech and language therapy services. As also recommended in the report, regional co-ordinating committees for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities have been put in place in each of the health boards. One of the primary functions of the co-ordinating committees is to advise the chief executive officer of each board on priorities <Col N="770" /> for the allocation of funds available for the development of the services.</P>
    <P>Since the report was published, additional ongoing revenue funding totalling £17 million has been provided to the health boards for priority service developments for people with physical and sensory disabilities. Between 1997 and 1999, 24 new speech and language therapy posts have been created in the health boards to provide a service to people with physical and sensory disabilities. The priorities for the development of services, including speech and language therapy services, in 2001 are currently being finalised by the health boards with their local co-ordinating committees. Speech and language therapy services continue to be identified by all health boards as a priority service for development.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the recruitment of allied health professional staff generally is presenting problems throughout the health board regions and it is clear that the demand for the three therapy grades, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy needs to be reviewed. Following a Labour Court recommendation in 1997, an expert group was established to examine and report on various issues relating to the allied health professional grades, including speech and language therapists. One of the issues examined by this group is the problems which arise in relation to the recruitment and the retention of various grades. The expert group submitted its final report in April 2000 and I am implementing in full the recommendations of this report at a cost of £10 million. Among its recommendations was the urgent commissioning of a workforce planning study for the three therapy grades, that is, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy. I have recently agreed the terms of reference for the workforce planning study and this is a priority issue for my Department. Greater expansion in the area of training for these professionals is essential and I will be addressing this issue in the context of the report of the workforce planning study.</P>
    <P>I have asked my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, to investigate the possibility of increasing the number of graduates taken into the courses for speech and language therapists, physiotherapists and occupational therapists. As a result of this request, an additional 18 places have been secured, including three additional speech and language therapy places, from October 2000. Talks are also ongoing to ascertain if additional places can be made available to students in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>On 31 December 1998, there were 238.4 whole time equivalent speech and language therapy posts in the health boards providing services to both children and adults. My Department is currently undertaking a survey of the number of vacant therapy posts in each health board and I hope to have this information available shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 168 together.</P>
      <P>The identification of staffing requirements and the deployment of staff within the overall financial and employment levels set by my Department is a matter for the management of each health agency. There are particular staffing difficulties being faced by the health services at present across a wide range of disciplines, particularly in the medical, allied health professional and nursing areas. Action is being taken on a number of fronts to address these difficulties.</P>
      <P>The medical staffing of hospitals is currently being addressed by the medical manpower forum. With particular regard to Non-Consultant Hospital Doctors, proposals have been put to the NCHD Committee of the Irish Medical Organisation which include a very significant improvement in the overtime rates paid to NCHDs. In addition a senior manager is to be appointed in each major hospital with specific responsibility to manage NCHD hours. A concerted effort is to be made to improve the working conditions and to reduce NCHD working hours with particular attention to long periods of continuous duty. There is also a substantial training package to be put in place amounting to £10 million per annum. New procedures are to be put in place to deal with NCHD grievances at local level. Relocation expenses are also to be paid to NCHDs who have to move residence as part of formal rotation schemes. I am hopeful that this substantial package will aid the recruitment and retention of NCHDs.</P>
      <P>I would also like also to point out that some health boards have been actively trying to recruit junior hospital doctors from countries such as Germany where there is a surplus of NCHDs. I am also aware that health boards have been attending Medical Employment Fairs to encourage junior hospital doctors to work in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the allied health professionals, it is clear that the balance of supply and demand for the three therapy grades, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists needs to be reviewed. I asked the Minister for Education and Science to investigate the <Col N="772" /> possibility of increasing the number of graduates taken into the courses for speech and language therapists, physiotherapists and occupational therapists. As a result of this request, an additional 18 places have been secured from October 2000. Talks are also ongoing to ascertain if additional places can be made available to students on courses in Northern Ireland. I have agreed the terms of reference for a workforce planning study for these three therapy grades and this is a priority issue for my Department. A parallel workforce planning study dealing with chiropodists, dieticians and orthoptists will also be commissioned. An interdepartmental steering group has been established to commission these studies.</P>
    <P>I am aware that difficulties are being experienced in other areas of the allied health professions, such as care workers and physiological measurement technicians. I intend to refer these matters to the health services skills group, established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to say that from October 1999, the number of entrants to the three approved medical laboratory science courses in Ireland has been increased by 20 per annum. I have also funded the creation of a new student medical laboratory technician post. Entrants to this grade have completed a degree programme but lack the required clinical placement. This programme addresses that lack by providing a one year placement. The first of these new graduates will have completed their training by May 2000 and will be available for employment once accepted by the academy for medical laboratory science.</P>
    <P>A service review of psychology services in the health boards is underway, with manpower planning one of the three main areas for action.</P>
    <P>In the nursing area, the difficulties largely relate to the greater Dublin area. Directors of nursing in the Eastern Regional Health Authority have developed a human resource strategy to address the shortages issue. An action plan for implementation of the report's recommendations is being considered by the ERHA at the moment and will be discussed with my Department.</P>
    <P>Agreement has been reached between the relevant Departments on a procedure for fast-tracking immigration clearances and work permits for non-EU nurses. Data maintained by An Bord Altranais indicates that in recent years there has been a net inflow of nurses to Ireland. Inflow figures for 1999 show a dramatic increase to 3,181 in the number of nurses seeking to register here.</P>
    <P>Employers have stepped-up their recruitment from abroad with significant success. For example, the Mater Hospital anticipates that approximately 70 nurses from the Philippines will be employed in the near future while Tallaght Hospital has made 92 job offers during its international recruitment drive, with the first recruits expected in early July.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="773" /> These initiatives represent a very significant effort on the part of my Department to improve the staffing situation in hospitals.</P>

      <P>Following a number of meetings of the working group on needs assessment for carers and care recipients, it was decided to establish a pilot project with the objective of developing a practical instrument which would enable the needs of carers and persons being cared for to be assessed. This pilot project was run in the Western Health Board area and has recently been completed. The results of this project are being presented to the working group at a meeting due to take place today and will then be considered by my Department.</P>
      <P>Since 1999, additional resources have been specifically earmarked for the support of carers through the provision of additional respite services, training for carers, the establishment of carer support groups, the appointment of co-ordinators of services for carers and the provision of assistance to voluntary groups who represent the interests of carers. I might add that older people and their carers are also benefiting from the significant additional funding which has been directed by this Government in recent years towards the improvement of residential and community support services for older people.</P>

      <P>Information on drug related deaths is collected by the Central Statistics Office for the general mortality register in accordance with guidelines developed by the World Health Organisation using International Classification of Diseases Code 9 which includes deaths due to drug dependence and poisoning by opiates and other narcotics.</P>
      <P>Figures provided by the CSO, applying the ICD 9 definition, show that in 1997 there were 55 deaths, in 1998 there were 99 deaths and in 1999 there were 80 deaths in this category. These figures however, should be regarded as provisional at this stage, particularly the 1999 figure as further validation may still need to be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="774" /> A report which was published last year and was conducted in the Dublin City Coroner's Office by a degree student in social care from the Dublin Institute of Technology detailed the outcome of the total inquests which were held during 1998 related to deaths which occurred between November 1992 and July 1998. The report implicated methadone in 37 deaths, while only three of these deaths were from the sole misuse of methadone. The remainder of these deaths resulted from the ingestion of a cocktail of drugs of which methadone was a part.</P>
    <P>Multiple drug use is the norm amongst the drug abusing population and where deaths occur in this population it is often difficult to ascribe a specific cause although drug abuse is identified. In most of the post mortems where methadone was identified, other substances such as heroin and or benzodiazepines and sometimes alcohol were also identified. In October 1998 strict new regulations relating to the prescribing of methadone came into effect. Currently, a major study is under way, analysing in more detail those deaths that appear to be drug related. This study will examine the position both before and after the new regulations came into effect. I understand that the results of this study will be available towards the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Methadone maintenance is the most evaluated form of treatment of heroin addiction. Around 300,000 people are on substitution treatment, mainly methadone, in the European Union. There is clear and consistent international evidence that this form of treatment achieves significant reduction in heroin use and crime and a lower risk of premature death including death from overdose. Methadone maintenance has been found to be effective in reducing the spread of HIV through intravenous drug misuse and counselling and length of time in methadone treatment are both factors associated with a more favourable outcome.</P>
    <P>A recent independent evaluation of drugs services in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area found that methadone treatment programmes managed to effect approximately a 70% reduction in heroin consumption on aggregate in those attending treatment. Such a reduction in heroin use has been reported to be associated with a similar reduction in criminal behaviour. A number of satellite clinics informally reported rates of around 40% returning to work. It is generally acknowledged that treatment is more likely to achieve success where methadone programmes are part of a wider treatment regimen which includes counselling, aftercare and rehabilitation. For this reason rehabilitation has been given high priority in the Eastern Regional Health Authority's service plan for 2000, which recognises that further expansion of rehabilitation services must take place to assist people to break the cycle of addiction and return to a relatively normal lifestyle.</P>

      <P>My Department is responsible for several EU Regulations pertaining to the labelling of genetically modified foodstuffs, namely, Regulation (EC) No 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 1997 concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients; Council Regulation (EC) No 1139/98 concerning the compulsory indication on the labelling of certain foodstuffs produced from genetically modified organisms of particulars other than those provided for in Directive 79/112/EEC, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 49/2000 and Regulation (EC) No 50/2000 on the labelling of foodstuffs and food ingredients containing additives and flavourings that have been genetically modified or have been produced from genetically modified organisms.</P>
      <P>The labelling requirements as prescribed in these regulations ensure that the final consumer is informed of any characteristic or food property, such as composition, nutritional value or nutritional effects or the intended use of the food, which renders a food or food ingredient no longer equivalent to an existing food or food ingredient.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, EU regulations are directly applicable to and binding on all member states. However, my Department is currently drafting national provisions to give effect to these regulations and to lay down enforcement powers for authorised officers and to impose penalties for non-observance.</P>
      <P>It is intended, in the coming months, to designate the Food Safety Authority of Ireland as the competent authority for these regulations. My Department recently provided funding to the authority for the recruitment of a chief specialist and a technical executive in biotechnology. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland will monitor genetically modified food and food ingredients for compliance with relevant legislation on an on-going basis as part of its regular food surveillance programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>On 29 May 2000 I announced the establishment of the Forum on Fluoridation with terms of reference: to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies and the programme of research being undertaken on behalf of the health boards in the area and to report to me, as Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      <P> The forum will also invite submissions from the public. Before announcing the establishment of the Forum on Fluoridation, my officials contacted each person concerned. All of those contacted agreed, in principle, to participate in the forum. It was explained at that point that a formal letter of invitation would issue at a later date. The persons to whom the Deputy refers, who are patrons of an environmental group, requested further information concerning the work and make up of the forum. My officials are responding to their requests. I would like to stress that it is crucial that both pro and anti-fluoridation points of view are heard and discussed in depth by the forum.</P>
      <P>My Department has also invited the environmental group to nominate an additional representative and a response is awaited. Following representations, the Consumers' Association of Ireland has been invited to nominate a representative to work on the forum. On receipt of these nominations, which are expected shortly, I will confirm the invitation to each person on the membership list.</P>
      <P>After that, it will be a matter for the chairman, Professor Pat Fottrell, to contact each member of the forum to arrange a suitable date for their first meeting. It is expected that the forum will need a year to report fully, with an interim report due by the end of this year. I expect that the first meeting of the forum will take place in July.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 46 and 186 together.</P>
      <P>Concerns in this country first emerged in relation to the work of a locum consultant histopathologist who had provided holiday cover in the pathology department of Tralee General Hospital for short periods at various times from 1991 to 1999 in August of last year. It subsequently emerged that this person had also worked in a locum capacity in Sligo and Letterkenny General Hospitals at various times since 1997. The Southern Health Board advised all hospitals within its region of its concerns, including the Bons Secours Private Hospital in Tralee where the doctor in question also worked for a short time.</P>
      <P>As soon as this information came to light, both the Southern and North Western Health Boards put in train measures to identify all work undertaken by the locum pathologist. Arrangements were also made to have the work in question prioritised and reviewed with the assistance of the Faculty of Pathology of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland on the basis of a standard clinical protocol used in similar reviews which were undertaken in the United Kingdom. The over riding priority in this matter has been to ensure that the work of the pathologist in question was reviewed, to identify any problems arising from the review, and to ensure that appropriate action was taken to safeguard the interests of the patients affected.</P>
      <P>In the context of the review it was established that the pathologist in question had provided holiday cover as a locum pathologist in Tralee General Hospital for two to four week periods D522&ndash;B10</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="778" /> on 18 occasions since 1991. He had also provided holiday cover in Sligo and Letterkenny General Hospitals on six occasions for short periods totalling 14 weeks since July 1997. A total of approximately 3,000 pathology tests undertaken by the locum pathologist during his periods of employment in Tralee between 28 January 1991 and 27 June 1999 were identified. In the North Western Health Board a total of 945 tests reported on by the doctor in question were identified.</P>
    <P>All tests which were classified as more serious on the basis of the clinical protocol for the review have been reviewed and in addition, due to the considerably smaller number of tests involved, a review of all the less serious tests in Sligo and Letterkenny has been completed. A review of less serious tests is currently under way in Tralee and the Southern Health Board has advised me that this phase of the review is expected to be completed by the end of August 2000. To date, a total of 625 tests have been reviewed in Tralee, including 268 of the most recent less serious tests.</P>
    <P>In relation to the 625 tests reviewed in Tralee, the review identified 27 tests where a disagreement with the original report was identified on review. However, in all but one case the patients were treated appropriately because the doctor treating the patient had correctly diagnosed the patient's condition. There was, therefore, one case where a change in treatment was required.</P>
    <P>Of the 945 tests reviewed in North Western Health Board, 11 cases were identified which needed to be reviewed by the doctor treating the patient. Of these 11 cases, none gave rise to significant changes in treatment other than a change of diet or minor change in medication.</P>
    <P>The Bons Secours Private Hospital, Tralee has indicated that a review of the tests reported on by the doctor in question has also been undertaken there. The hospital has stated that 150 tests were reviewed and that patient care has not been affected in any case. The Southern Health Board has advised my Department that it has written to the hospital seeking further details of the review.</P>
    <P>I am determined that the lessons of this case will not be lost and I have already put in train a range of measures to identify any further action required to ensure, as far as is possible, that such situations do not arise in future. Firstly, I want to ensure that appropriate measures are in place to ensure the competency of all doctors. I have, therefore, initiated a review of the Medical Practitioners Act. This review will consider proposals that re-certification and re-accreditation for doctors should occur on a regular basis throughout their careers, as a competency assurance measure.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the issues under review in this case arose from the work of a locum consultant who was engaged to maintain services during holidays. My Department is, therefore, establishing a working group which will consider existing recruitment procedures for locum consultants with the aim of ensuring that the highest standards are in place for the employment of locum <Col N="779" /> consultants. All consultants employed in permanent capacity in public hospitals must retire at 65 years of age. There are, therefore, no consultants over the age of 70 employed in public hospitals on a permanent basis. The extent to which doctors over the normal retirement age provide locum cover in public hospitals and the question of age limits for doctors providing locum cover will need to be considered by the working group.</P>
    <P>A primary focus on the interests of patients is evidenced by the action already taken by the Southern and North Western Health Boards to review the work of the locum consultant pathologist in question. Arrangements have been put in place by the health boards to respond to any concerns on the part of patients or their families arising from this case. In addition to the action taken by the health boards to review the work of the locum consultant pathologist, the follow-up action which I have outlined will help ensure that situations like this do not occur in the future. I want to see rapid results on the issues which arise from this case with a view to taking any necessary follow-up action as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Many of the task force's recommendations require continuous development, particularly in the area of training and in the development of services relating to suicide and suicide prevention. Some of the recommendations are the responsibility of Government Departments, for example the Departments of Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform. My Department is liaising with the health boards and the relevant Departments to monitor the ongoing implementation of the recommendations. It has not been possible in the time available to provide a comprehensive update on the progress in relation to the implementation of the recommendations as requested by the Deputy. However, this will be made available to the Deputy by my Department as soon as possible.</P>

The first sectoral meeting on food safety promotion and health sectors was held in Belfast in February 2000. The second such sectoral meeting is scheduled for 4 July in Dublin. I look forward to meeting again with Minister de Brún next week when we will review progress and decide future direction of the issues on our joint agenda.</P>
      <P>Among the areas in which the North South Ministerial Council aims to strengthen co-operation are those of accident and emergency planning and planning for major emergencies. There is already a considerable degree of co-operation between the health authorities on both sides of the Border through the Co-operation and Working Together, CAWT, organisation. Discussions have taken place between my Department and the Department of Health, Personal Social Services and Public Safety with a view to identifying the scope for further co-operation. On the basis of the initial discussions, work is now under way to identify specific areas for action and, in this context, the question of closer co-operation in the provision of hospital services will be considered in consultation with the North Western Health Board and the relevant health authorities in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to avail of this opportunity to offer my sincere condolences to the family of the person concerned. I consider it totally unacceptable that any patient, but especially an elderly patient, should have to endure such long waiting times in accident and emergency departments for necessary medical treatment or admission to an acute hospital ward, especially when the first priority of an accident and emergency department is to provide appropriate care and appropriate treatment for patients presenting with serious injury or illness.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware the provision of health and social services, which includes accident and emergency services, in the eastern region is now a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA. I have, therefore, asked the regional chief executive of the ERHA to examine the particular case and to forward a full report on it to me.</P>
      <P>I want to assure the Deputy that my Department is committed to ensuring that accident and emergency departments are in a position to respond to the need for their services particularly during periods of peak demand. Specific additional funding has been targeted at accident and emergency departments in acute hospitals providing such services, mainly in the eastern region, aimed at the enhancement of accident and emergency services. This additional funding, which amounted to £2 million in 1998, £2.3 million in 1999 and a further £2 million in the current year, was used to fund measures to free up beds for emergency admissions, for enhanced staffing level. for the continued development of treatment-observation areas in accident and emergency departments and for improved access for general practitioners to urgent specialist opinion, amongst other measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hospitals themselves seek to manage surges in activity by faster throughput of patients through the system, improved admission and dis<Col N="782" /> charge management, re-designation of day care and five-day beds as emergency in-patient facilities, rostering of additional staff where feasible and through the provision of additional long-term care and chronic sick beds outside the hospital setting.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, the pressures with accident and emergency are felt most acutely in the eastern region. The Eastern Regional Health Authority has already decided that improvements in accident and emergency services is a priority matter for the authority this year. It has established a dedicated team to review accident and emergency services in the Eastern region as a whole. From this review the authority intends to put forward a comprehensive policy for accident and emergency services which it expects will overcome many of the problems currently experienced in accident and emergency departments.</P>
    <P>The authority has stated that it will be seeking to redress any imbalance in emergency care in terms of access, timeliness, appropriateness, and quality. In particular, the review will examine issues such as the physical and human resource requirements to reduce waiting times for treatment and admission in accident and emergency departments. The review will also seek to improve emergency access to treatment through a detailed examination of policies, procedures and protocols for emergency services. It will also consider the provision of alternative care options for persons presenting with minor injuries. These options will include general practitioner out of hours services in community or hospital settings.</P>
    <P>I am confident that this approach will lead to a continued enhancement of our accident and emergency services and will prevent in the future a recurrence of the very regrettable incident referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 132 together.</P>
      <P>The service provided by the consultant referred to by the Deputy is currently provided as part of a locum service in paediatric urology at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children. As in the case of all consultant appointments the provision of such a service by a consultant urologist is matter for Comhairle na nOspideal which is a statutory body set up under the Health Act, 1970. One of comhairle's primary functions is the regulation of appointments of consultant medical staffs in hospitals providing services under the Health Acts and to specify qualifications for such appointments.</P>
      <P>Comhairle published a report in December 1998 on paediatric surgery services which included paediatric urology services. The report recommended that specialist paediatric surgery for children throughout the State be concentrated in one unit in Dublin with all three children's hospitals providing non-specialist paediatric surgery and less complex urology. Comhairle is satisfied that the report and its recommendation represented the best way forward for the organisation and delivery of high quality and safe paediatric surgical care for children in the State given the presence of three paediatric institutions in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that a Council for Children's Hospital Care has been established <Col N="784" /> and includes representation from the three Dublin paediatric hospitals. The council's primary role is to assist the paediatric hospitals to work with each other and with the Eastern Regional Health Authority to plan and develop acute paediatric services on a co-ordinated basis in the functional area of the authority.</P>
    <P>The chair of the Council for Children's Hospital Care and the regional chief executive of the ERHA met recently with senior officials of my Department to review progress on the council's work programme and to identify a number of priorities, including paediatric surgery, which the ERHA and the council will be addressing during this year. My Department and the authority support the council's view that the area of specialist paediatric surgery merits immediate attention and recognises Comhairle na nOspideal's statutory role in this regard. It was agreed that a further meeting should be arranged between all parties, Comhairle, the Council for Children's Hospital Care, the ERHA and my Department to clarify the respective roles and expectations and to agree a defined timeframe for resolving the outstanding issues regarding consultant appointments in paediatric surgery in the best interest of the patients. Arrangements for this meeting are at present being finalised by officials in my Department.</P>
    <P>I am very aware of the concerns of parents of children who require the specialist surgery referred to by the Deputy and I have requested my Department to ensure that a consultant post in paediatric urology be established on a permanent basis as a matter of urgency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The staffing requirements of hospitals and the deployment of staff within hospitals is a matter for local management having regard to the services which hospitals are expected to provide. There are particular staffing difficulties being faced by the health services at present across a wide range of areas, particularly in the medical, paramedical and nursing areas.</P>
      <P>Action is being taken on a number of fronts to address these difficulties. However in relation to the medical staffing of hospitals, the issues are currently being addressed by the Medical Manpower Forum. With particular regard to non-consultant hospital doctors the forum is seeking to redress the imbalance between career posts and training posts, the need to improve postgraduate medical training to keep more Irish medical graduates in the country, and the need to look at the position of women in medicine in Ireland with a view to redressing the number who leave medicine. The Medical Manpower Forum is due to publish its first report shortly.</P>
      <P>The number of consultant posts is regulated by Comhairle na nOspideal. According to Comhairle na nOspideal, the consultant establishment on 1 January 2000 was 1440. There were 147 vacant approved posts on this date. However, a post approved by Comhairle na nOspideal is classified as vacant until an appointee takes up duty in a permanent capacity. However, in most cases replacement posts are filled by locums until the permanent appointee is installed. In relation to the filling of new consultant posts, I have recently received and accepted the recommendations of a working group established to speed up the appointment process, i.e. the time it takes from initial approval to putting a consultant in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health service employers and the Health Service Employers Agency are continuing to monitor the take-up of employment offers made to non-consultant hospital doctors for 1 July 2000. The situation is likely to remain fluid until then <Col N="786" /> as an NCHD may have an offer of employment from more than one hospital. Accordingly, I am not at this time in a position to give a precise figure of the number of vacant posts on the 1 July other than to say that about 100 of the approximately 3000 posts may remain unfilled. Hospitals are exploring different options in an effort to ensure that essential posts are filled. In the event that some posts remain unfilled, hospitals will be asked to ensure that essential and critical services are not affected. With the full co-operation from all concerned, and a commitment to making the best use of available resources, the effect on services can be minimised.</P>
    <P>As I have said, while the primary responsibility for the staffing of hospitals rests with hospital management, I am seeking the co-operation of the Opposition in amending the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, to extend the period of temporary registration for NCHDs from five years to seven years. This will remove an obstacle for some NCHDs and allow them to remain and work in Ireland.</P>

      <P>Persons presenting with eating disorders are generally treated through the psychiatric services of their local health board. Out-patient services are provided from a network of hospitals, health centres, day hospitals and day centres. Where inpatient treatment is deemed necessary, it is provided in the local acute psychiatric unit or hospital, beds being allocated on the basis of patient need at any particular time. A tertiary referral service for eating disorders is available in St. Vincent's hospital, Elm Park, Dublin, where three in-patient beds are designated for this purpose. A similar service is available privately at St. Patrick's hospital, James's Street, Dublin and at St John of God hospital, Stillorgan, County Dublin.</P>
      <P>The health promotion unit of my Department is involved in a number of programmes available nationally which are aimed at young persons and which seek to promote healthy eating and lifestyle practices. These include: Social, Personal and Health Education &ndash; a broad based health education programme for both primary and post-primary schools; Nutrition Education at Post Primary Schools &ndash; a healthy eating programme for primary schools and Being Well &ndash; a holistic community based health education programme.</P>

This policy has guided developments and initiatives in relation to the promotion of breastfeeding. While many recommendations have been implemented it is acknowledged that the incidence of breastfeeding in this country continues to be lower than that of our European counterparts.</P>
      <P>However, a new health promotion strategy currently being developed will call for a more structured approach to the implementation of the recommendations set out in the national breastfeeding policy. As part of this new strategy, it is proposed to appoint a national breastfeeding co-ordinator who will advise the health promotion unit on the effectiveness of current policy actions in Ireland and on the measures required to increase breastfeeding rates. The question of the re-establishment of the National Committee to Promote Breastfeeding will be considered in the context of this revised approach.</P>

      <P>In view of the current primary immunisation up-take levels generally, my Department wrote earlier this year to all of the health boards, requesting them to make every effort to achieve the national targets in this programme this year and to make particular efforts in relation to MMR. Among the issues which boards were asked to address were the need to undertake an analysis of the reasons for the unsatisfactory level of uptake, to ensure that immunisation databases are regularly validated, to address low uptake in the traveller population and to follow up unimmunised children. Boards were asked to make every effort to devise strategies tailored to local needs, employing innovative approaches if considered necessary, in order to achieve significant improvements in uptake.</P>
      <P>On 31 May, at a meeting between officials of my Department and senior health board management, the importance of addressing the unsatisfactory uptake of MMR and other primary immunisations was again emphasised and all boards were asked to take the necessary measures to maximise uptake levels.</P>
      <P>The health boards indicate that a range of measures is being adopted to improve MMR uptake. Among such initiatives are the following: awareness campaigns being conducted at local level involving press releases and local radio interviews; reminders being issued to parents of children who have not received MMR vaccination; the appointment of senior public health nurses with responsibility for maximising immunisation; traveller families being targeted for immunisation advice and information; and informing crèches and pre-school facilities of the importance of immunisation.</P>
      <P>A new campaign developed by the office for health gain to heighten public awareness about the importance of MMR immunisation is currently being run.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity strongly to urge parents in all areas of the country to ensure that their children receive the MMR vaccine, which is available free of charge from their family doctor. This will ensure maximum protection against measles, mumps and rubella for individual children and the population generally.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>In mid-May a European wide alert was issued in relation to admission to hospitals in Glasgow of 20 injecting drug users, nine of whom had died.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="790" /> On investigation in the ERHA area it was found that from the beginning of April there has been 19 cases, with eight deaths with a case definition of injecting drug user with evidence of a severe inflammatory process. The illnesses that were caused appeared to be related to injecting heroin into tissues which caused severe damage, with a rapid deterioration in health over a number of days which developed into a septic shock syndrome.</P>
    <P>I am also informed that between April and the end of May 2000 the ERHA received notifications of 19 heroin related deaths from the City and County Coroner's Office, eight of these deaths are those related to the case definition as I already mentioned. This information was received in the context of the ERHA's investigation into deaths of heroin misusers with evidence of severe inflammatory process and cannot be validated at this stage.</P>
    <P>The ERHA is working closely with the authorities in Glasgow, the National Disease Surveillance Centre, the UK health authorities, cases have now been identified in Northern England, and the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta to isolate and identify the exact cause of the illness. An expert from Atlanta, Dr. Kristy Murray, has come to Dublin to assist the ERHA's department of public health. The ERHA has sent tissue and blood specimens to the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta to help with identification. A sample of the heroin thought to be responsible for these illnesses has also been sent to the CDC by the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>All avenues in relation to the illnesses are being investigated including the possibility of infection by the bacterium, clostridium novyi type A, which the Greater Glasgow Health Board stated had been isolated in three of the nine cases in Glasgow.</P>
    <P>In response to the heroin deaths the three area health boards in the ERHA implemented a range of measures to discourage people from injecting and to encourage anyone who noticed unusual abscesses or symptoms to seek immediate medical attention.</P>
    <P>A 24-hour freephone telephone helpline was established offering advice and information and referral to treatment centres. In addition, notices issued to all drug treatment clinics, health centres and GPs and in newspapers advising clients and their parents and families of the need for extreme care and vigilance as there may be contaminated heroin in circulation.</P>
    <P>In addition to the 52 treatment locations where assessment and appropriate treatment may be accessed by heroin misusers the following measures were instigated. Additional outreach workers were assigned to Dublin 8 and 12 to make contact with drug users on the street and give advice about the dangers of injecting and refer appropriate clients to treatment centres for emergency assessment. Needle exchange facilities advised active contacts about the danger of continuing to inject. Patients on low dose methadone <Col N="791" /> were given the opportunity for increased enrichment of the dose to discourage the practice of topping up with heroin. All addiction centres had facilities for emergency assessment on demand. Arrangements were made to increase treatment capacity in a number of specific areas including: James's Street, Crumlin, Cabra, Finglas.</P>
    <P>The mobile methadone bus continued to provide emergency services at Dr. Steeven's, Ballymun, Blanchardstown and Empress Place.</P>
    <P>Since the emergency response services were set up approximately 250 people have presented for emergency assessment at local area health board clinics.</P>
    <P>Information on drug related deaths is collected by the Central Statistics Office for the general mortality register in accordance with guidelines developed by the World Health Organisation using International classification of diseases code 9 which includes deaths due to drug dependance and poisoning by opiates and other narcotics. In the past few years there has been ongoing discussion between the drugs misuse research division of the Health Research Board, the Central Statistics Office and other relevant actors and efforts have been made to improve the reliability of reports of drug related deaths. These reports are based on death certificates which often give the main cause of death as a medical condition other than drug use, although drug use may have been implicated in the death. The drugs misuse research division is also working with the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) to apply a new drug related deaths standard definition which would include deaths from causes such as road traffic accidents where drug misuse was involved. The intention would be that this standard definition would be applied across EU member states and thus allow for the comparison of data.</P>
    <P>The number of drug related deaths reported by the CSO in 1999, applying the ICD 9 definition, which includes drug related deaths, is 80. This figure should be regarded as provisional at this stage, as further validation may still need to be carried out.</P>

The Act provides that the board may give effect to any increase unless the Minister, within 30 days of the notification, directs the board in writing not to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>Government policy on the care of older people is to maintain them in their homes for as long as possible. I am conscious that the role played by community groups supporting older people is vital to the success of this policy.</P>
      <P>The funding of groups whose main aim is to promote the interests of and provide services directly to older people takes many forms. Funding is provided by my Department through the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to some organisations by way of ongoing revenue funding or lottery grants.</P>
      <P>My Department provides ongoing revenue funding through the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to the following organisations: Age Action Ireland, Age and Opportunity, The Carers Association, The Alzheimer Society of Ireland, The Federation of Active Retirement Associations,</P>
      <P>Ongoing lottery funding is supplied to: the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament, The Irish Association of Older People and Múintir na Tire, for its community alert scheme.</P>
      <P>Health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority provide funding to a range of voluntary organisations, in their respective catchment areas, who provide services to older people, including meals on wheels.</P>
      <P>In addition to financial assistance, health board staff liaise with and provide practical support to voluntary groups in the assessment of need and development of community based services for older people.</P>
      <P>I should also point out that in relation to health and social support services for older people generally, substantial additional revenue and capital resources have been allocated by this Government in recent years to the improvement of residential and community support services for older people and it is intended to further develop these services as part of the national development plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 129 together.</P>
      <P>I am making a series of tables available to the Deputy which outline: the number of applications waiting assessment, by board/agency at 31 March, 2000; the approximate waiting time for assessment for those joining waiting lists at 31 March, 2000; and trends in receipts and finalisation of applications from 1999 to March 2000. Key data included in these tables are as follows: the backlog at 1 January 1999 estimated in the report Towards a Standardised Framework of Inter-country Adoption Assessment Procedures, was just under 500. Since then almost 500 applications have been processed to completion. There are 1,038 applications on hand at 31 March 2000 and 1,303 applications were received in the two years 1998 and 1999.</P>
      <P>This data suggest that current applications date from 1998 in a number of boards. Looking at the data by health board area suggests that there may be a small number of applications which were submitted prior to this date in the Eastern Regional Health Authority Area and the South Eastern Health Board area. There may also be some deferred cases in all of the boards where the original application date pre-dates 1998. Data for the end of the second quarter of this year is being collated and will be available shortly. In collating such data the boards will be asked to include details of date of receipt of applications. Details of the more current situation will be made available to the deputy as soon as they have been compiled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A key characteristic of the intercountry adoption service is its demand-led nature. The inability of service providers to respond to the enormous increase in demand was one of the reasons which led to the review of the intercountry adoption assessment service in the report Towards a Standardised Framework for Inter-country Adoption Assessment Procedures. There is no doubt but that this service was considerably under-resourced in the past. <Col N="794" /> However, the level of unpredictability experienced in recent years is bound to affect the ability of the individual boards to make rapid responses to such increases. For example, between 1998 and 1999 four of the boards saw an increase in applications, some almost a two-fold increase, the other four saw a decrease in numbers applying. Preliminary indications suggest that applications in 2000 will exceed 1999 figures in some boards.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that additional funding of £1 million was allocated, £500,000 in both 1999 and 2000, to the service following the publication of the report on Inter-country Adoption Assessment Procedures in 1999. The largest beneficiaries of the additional funding were the Eastern Regional Health Authority, formerly the Eastern Health Board, and the Southern Health Board. The additional funding was used to recruit additional social work staff, improve office accommodation, information technology and clerical and administrative support. Several training initiatives on the new assessment model have also been organised and funded on a cross-board basis. Additional guidance on the implementation of the new standardised framework has also been commissioned by my Department and will be available to social workers shortly. These initiatives are contributing to a reduction in waiting times and the duration of assessment. It is acknowledged that there are variations in progress between boards.</P>
    <P>While some boards have a considerably greater number of applications than others, waiting time is obviously dependent on the numbers of social workers engaged in assessment in the individual boards. In that regard, I must point out that there have been considerable difficulties in the recruitment of social workers and this has inevitably delayed the expected impact of the additional funding in some boards. Clearly, the availability, recruitment and retention of appropriately qualified staff will be a key element in reducing waiting times for assessments. I am satisfied that the boards are doing their utmost to recruit the necessary staff. The difficulties being experienced are part of a general shortage of social work staff in the child care area.</P>
    <P>An implementation group was established to plan, prioritise and cost the implementation of the report Towards a Standardised Framework for Inter-country Adoption Assessment Procedures. This group is nearly finished its work and have advised that a report on progress will be made available to me this week. I understand that this report will contain, inter alia, a comprehensive outline of developments arising from the implementation of the standardised framework as well as findings and recommendations in relation to the future of the intercountry adoption service.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 118 together.</P>
      <P>I have received a copy of Cáirde's report HIV/AIDS &ndash; A Fresh Approach, which was launched earlier this month and I am aware of the comments made by Cáirde in relation to the national AIDS strategy. Cáirde is represented on the National AIDS Strategy Committee (NASC) and its care and management sub-committee. Membership of NASC also includes representatives from the Departments of Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, health boards and voluntary organisations. Cáirde has requested that the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, Enterprise Trade and Employment and Tourism Sport and Recreation should also be involved in formulating strategy.</P>
      <P>The committee comprises 28 members at present and efforts are being made to streamline the work of the committee and its sub-committees to ensure that that members' valuable time is not spent dealing with issues which do not relate to their area of expertise.  I understand that the issue of membership of the committee is being discussed at present and the proposal to broaden it to include the Departments suggested by Cáirde will be considered in this context.</P>
      <P>It is important to point out that my Department's representative on NASC who is chairman of the national drugs strategy team has close links with the Departments of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and Enterprise, Trade and Employment. A number of common issues emerge in that forum in the context of social exclusion, poverty and family supports. In addition, my Department is represented on the interdepartmental group which reports to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and through this group there are ongoing links with all other relevant Departments.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the number of people holding medical cards has been reduced by over 110,000 since 1996; and the policy considerations on the part of the Government underlying this approach.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his/her medical needs would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that entitlement to a medical card is based on hardship rather than on any specification that a particular number of the population should have a card. The decrease in the number of persons with a card is a reflection of a general improvement in the economy in recent years.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness refers to the fact that health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme and will consult with the social partners by the end of 2000. Particular emphasis will be placed on the needs of families with children, and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Forum on Youth Homelessness was established by the former Eastern Health Board and reported to the Eastern Regional Health Authority last April. The Eastern Regional Health Authority, which is the statutory body with responsibility for health and social services for people who live in Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow, has identified young <Col N="798" /> people who are out of home as one of the key issues it has to tackle.</P>
      <P>The report of the Forum on Youth Homelessness recommended the designation of one statutory body as the authority responsible for policy and for the co-ordination and delivery of services for young homeless. It also highlighted the need for a more integrated and seamless approach to youth homelessness. In this regard, I am satisfied that the Eastern Regional Health Authority is well placed to ensure that action is taken and that a co-ordinated and integrated response is developed to the provision of services for homeless young people.</P>
      <P>The authority launched an action plan in April this year in response to the report of the Forum on Youth Homelessness. The plan includes: the provision of multi-disciplinary teams to target young people at risk and/or out of home; funding for a new centre for young people who are out of home and abusing drugs; opening a number of local residential centres; contracting of GPs to provide primary health care services for young people who are out of home; specific assignment of psychological and psychiatric service to this group; increased access to drug treatment centres; expansion of aftercare services; commissioning of database to track progress of young people; evaluation of crisis intervention service and out of hours service and the establishment of a provider forum.</P>
      <P>My Department has provided £1.5 million to the authority for the implementation of the first phase of the plan this year.</P>
      <P>The valuable work of the Forum on Youth Homelessness will be taken into account in the national strategy on youth homelessness which is currently being prepared by my Department.</P>

    <P>The provision of detoxification facilities is the statutory responsibility of each health board. People who need detoxification outside the East<Col N="799" /> ern Regional Health Authority area are provided with services mainly in psychiatric hospitals. Admissions to psychiatric hospitals are reported by the Health Research Board in its annual report on &ldquo;Irish Psychiatric Services Activities&rdquo;. The most recent year for which figures are available is 1998. The number of admissions in that year with a diagnosis of drug dependence was 689. Drug-free facilities are also provided through facilities run by voluntary organisations, many of which are part funded by the health boards.</P>

    <P>I understand from a recent inquiry from the board that the numbers on the waiting lists have not substantially changed in the meantime. The board in consultation with the consultant orthodontist has agreed on the need to validate these waiting lists and this validation process is now commencing following the recruitment of clerical staff.</P>
    <P>Health board orthodontic services continue to be developed in accordance with the dental health action plan. The action plan provides for the development by each health board of a consultant-led orthodontic service. This year I am providing an additional £0.250 million on an ongoing basis to the Southern Health Board for the further development of its orthodontic services. I have also indicated approval of additional funding of £100,000 per annum to Cork Dental School to support the appointment to the school of a professor in orthodontics so that priority can be given to the provision of specialist training programmes in orthodontics for health board dentists in the orthodontic units.</P>
    <P>I have also recently asked health boards to submit proposals to me as to how waiting lists and waiting times for orthodontic treatment in their areas might be further reduced. I have had a recent meeting with officers of the board in the course of which I expressed my concern at the waiting lists and we discussed measures to improve service provision and reduce waiting lists.</P>
    <P>Following on these discussions the board will now formally submit proposals to me for reducing waiting lists. I will respond to these proposals quickly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 130 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of an air ambulance service for emergency cases which cannot be safely conveyed by road ambulance is provided by the Air Corps and the marine search and rescue helicopter service of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
      <P>Contacts regarding the provision of a dedicated air ambulance service are ongoing with all interested parties involved with a view to developing a consensus on the most appropriate role for air ambulance in the overall context of pre-hospital care. The cost of a dedicated air ambulance service would depend on a range of issues, including the hours of operation, number of aircraft and operational roles as well as staffing costs. In addition, capital costs in respect of the associated facilities required at hospitals would also need to be taken into account.</P>
      <P>Considerable research has been carried out internationally into the benefits of a helicopter emergency medical service, HEMS, as against ground ambulances. This includes work undertaken by the Sheffield University Centre for Health and Related Research studying the effectiveness of helicopter ambulance systems in London, Cornwall and Sussex, which take in urban, rural and off-shore island settings. This research found little measurable additional benefit using helicopters when compared to land ambulances. In the context of the benefit to patients, available research indicates that the benefits of a HEMS service relative to the benefits of alternative means of pre-hospital care such as a ground based emergency medical service are not significant.</P>
      <P>It is important to acknowledge that an air ambulance service is only one element of an effective emergency medical care system. The development of emergency medical services encompass all areas of emergency care including the ambulance service, general practice and hospitals accident and emergency departments. The potential benefits of a dedicated air ambulance service must, therefore, be seen in the context of the improvements to emergency medical services generally and I am anxious to ensure the development of a consensus in an Irish context of the most appropriate role for air support in the provision of pre-hospital care and inter-hospital transfer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the publication of the Report of the Review Group on the Ambulance Service in 1993 approximately £33 million has been provided for the implementation of the report's recommendations with well over half this funding being provided by this Government. I have provided additional funding of over £10 million in 2000. This is the largest annual amount ever provided for the ambulance service. The funding has been directed at improving the capability of the ambulance service to respond rapidly to emergencies and to deliver the appropriate level of on-scene care. The funding has resulted in major improve<Col N="802" /> ments in the service including improved training for ambulance personnel, the opening of additional ambulance stations and the provision of training and equipment to general practitioners in remote rural areas to enable them to deal with emergencies in advance of the arrival of an ambulance.</P>
    <P>In addition, a range of measures have been implemented to improve inter-hospital transfer services. In response to a report by the Intensive Care Society of Ireland my Department funded the development of a ground based mobile intensive care unit to transfer critically ill patients. I am also pleased to say that a neo-natal transport service for the transfer of critically ill babies will also be launched shortly.</P>
    <P>I remain committed to the continued development of the pre-hospital care system identified both in the review group's findings and in the recent report of the cardiovascular health strategy group, Building Healthier Hearts. Proposals for the development of a dedicated air ambulance service fall to be considered in the wider context of developments in emergency medical services generally. Any initiative in this area needs to complement other pre-hospital resources such as the ambulance service, first responder schemes and other emergency response resources to ensure that the resources invested deliver maximum benefit for patients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of dental and orthodontic services to children in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area is the statutory responsibility of that health authority.</P>
      <P>Dental treatment services for children in national schools are being developed in accordance with the dental health action plan. For the past number of years health boards have been progressively adopting a planned targeted approach to the delivery of dental services to national school children and phasing out a demand led system. This is to ensure the optimum use of dental resources and equal access for all national school children to the same level of dental care.</P>
      <P>Children in second, fourth and fifth classes are screened for dental treatment through the school health examination. Children who, following the school screening, are found to have serious problems and need more frequent review between school screenings will have this arranged at the local clinic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="803" /> Children on leaving national school retain entitlement to dental services up to age 14. These services are provided through an extension of the school-based system. The children are asked to return to the clinic for screening and treatment as necessary on a rotational basis. An emergency service is available by attendance at health board clinics.</P>
    <P>Waiting lists for orthodontic treatment are maintained by the health authority. I understand that as at 9 June, there were 9,797 awaiting orthodontic assessment and 885 awaiting orthodontic treatment. Health board orthodontic services continue to be developed in accordance with the dental health action plan. This year I am providing an additional £0.3 million to the Eastern Regional Health Authority on an ongoing basis to further the development of its orthodontic services.</P>
    <P>My Department recently gave approval for two additional posts of consultant orthodontist in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area. The authority is in the process of filling these posts through the Local Appointments Commission. In addition the authority is setting up two new regional orthodontic units at Loughlinstown Hospital and Beaumont Hospital.</P>
    <P>At my request the Eastern Regional Health Authority has submitted proposals to me as to how waiting lists and waiting times for orthodontic treatment might be reduced. These proposals are being examined in my Department and I hope to respond shortly to the authority.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Eastern Regional Health Authority&ndash;</i>An overall development plan costing around £13 million is currently being implemented in relation to St. Joseph's Services, St Ita's Hospital, Portrane. A new purpose built residential and day services facility for 30 clients is currently being <Col N="804" /> commissioned at Oldtown, County Dublin. The design brief for ten bungalows and a small day services facility for persons with autism on the St Ita's campus has been completed. The design team are now working on both the overall control plan for the campus and the design and siting of the above mentioned facilities. It is intended that all design, planning and tendering processes will be completed by early 2001, with building work commencing in the latter half of the first quarter of 2001.</P>
    <P>It is also intended that refurbishment work will be undertaken on the existing facilities which will continue to be used in the medium to long-term and to develop further off campus facilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The mobility allowance for people with disabilities was introduced by Department of Health circular No. 15/79 and is available to all persons with disabilities, including those with a visual impairment, who meet the eligibility criteria laid down in that circular. Circular No. 15/79 states the following:</P>
      <P>The scheme applies to persons in the age group 16 to 66 years who are unable to walk and who would benefit from occasional trips away from home.</P>
      <P>Although eligibility is confined to persons who are normally living at home, Mobility Allowance may continue to be paid in respect of occasional stays in hospital of up to eight weeks.</P>
      <P>As stated, an applicant must be under pensionable age. However, an allowance, once granted, will be continued after this age as long as the other criteria for eligibility are met.</P>
      <P>The essential medical criterion for the grant of the allowance is that the applicant is unable to walk, even with the use of artificial limbs or other suitable aids, or is in such a condition of health that the exertion required to walk would be dangerous. It is necessary that this criterion should be interpreted strictly. The inability to walk has to be likely to persist for at least one year and the applicant must not be forbidden for medical reasons from being moved. The applicant must be in a condition to benefit from a change in his or her surroundings.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the senior area medical officer in the relevant health board to decide whether the medical criteria are satisfied in any individual case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="806" /> The Deputy may also be aware that the blind welfare allowance comes under the aegis of my Department. The health boards operate this scheme in conjunction with the National Council for the Blind of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the blind welfare allowance is to provide supplementary financial support to unemployed blind persons receiving disability allowance, a blind pension or an old age pension. To be eligible to receive this allowance, applicants must satisfy the following conditions. They must undergo medical assessment for their visual impairment; they must not be maintained in an institution; and they must be unemployed.</P>
    <P>Both the mobility allowance and the blind welfare allowance are means tested schemes. Further details of these schemes may be obtained from the relevant health board.</P>
    <P>Health boards provide a range of support services to enable people with physical and sensory disabilities to live as independently as possible in the community. This range of services includes respite care, day care and home support services. Home support services include personal assistants, home helps and care attendants, all of whom provide different levels of service to the individual. Personal assistants provide assistance at the discretion and direction of a person with a severe disability with everyday tasks, such as personal care, household tasks, interpreting and transport, which the person is unable to do for him or herself. The level of support required by a person with a sensory disability, including a person with a visual impairment, would not usually encompass personal assistance services.</P>

      <P>The North Eastern Health Board's five-year framework policy document for acute hospitals was unanimously adopted by the board in June 1998. It outlines the proposals for the Cavan-Monaghan Hospital Group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A project team, appointed by the chief executive officer of the North Eastern Health Board, with representation from my Department, is currently preparing a brief for the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group which will form the basis for <Col N="807" /> instructing an architect and design team to advance the planned developments. Under the national development plan some £80 million has been approved for the North Eastern Health Board's hospitals and ambulance development during the period 2001-06.</P>
    <P>The North Eastern Health Board is fully committed to the future development of Monaghan hospital and to the provision of a high level of service for the people of Monaghan. There is no question of down-grading the hospital. Substantial refurbishment took place at the hospital last year and work is ongoing to prepare for the further development of facilities at the hospital. In this context, the brief which is being prepared by the North Eastern Health Board will ensure that planned facilities at Monaghan General Hospital are in line with best modern standards in all respects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, the health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care. However, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved.</P>
      <P>There are three rates of subvention payable, £70, £95 and £120, in accordance with three levels of dependency &ndash; medium, high and maximum. The amount of funding allocated to supporting older people in private nursing homes has been significantly increased by this Government in recent years. For example, over £5 million in additional funding has been allocated in the current year to provide for an increase in the number of people in receipt of subventions, their higher levels of dependency, resulting in more people receiving the higher rates of subventions, and the change in the regulations whereby the ability of adult sons and-or daughters over 21 years of age to contribute is no longer taken into account. The amount made available for the scheme this year is £38.4 million.</P>
      <P>The Government's priority this year is to ensure that health boards have adequate resources to meet increasing demands on the scheme. I am keeping under review the scope that exists for effecting further improvements in terms of the scheme. The question of increasing the rates of subvention will be kept under review in light of the availability of funding and competing priorities.</P>

    <P>I understand that the reasons for induction are many and arise for example from post dates, placental insufficiency, hypertension and patient request.</P>
    <P>I am advised that inductions of labour can give rise to a higher risk of intervention following the procedure compared to spontaneous labour. This is evidenced by relatively high rates of caesarean section and longer labour. For example, in the case of one hospital the caesarean section rate in spontaneous labour in first time mothers is 5% compared with a caesarean section rate of 22% in induced labour.</P>

      <P>I would like to state firstly that the Medical Council is an autonomous statutory body established by the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978. The Medical Council is the statutory body established to provide for the registration and control of persons engaged in the practice of medicine under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fitness to practise committee of the Medical Council is called upon to consider the conduct of a registered doctor on allegations of professional misconduct and/or unfitness for health reasons to engage in the practice of medicine. Part V of the Medical Practitioners Act, in defining how the committee processes an application for such an inquiry, precludes the Medical Council or the fitness to practise committee from making public any matter concerning a registered medical practitioner that is being addressed. Section 45 <Col N="810" /> provides that where a practitioner has been found guilty of professional misconduct and/or unfit to practice following a sworn inquiry, it is open to the Medical Council to make such a finding public and it is the usual practice of the council to do so when all proceedings have been completed. Where no finding has been made of professional misconduct and/or unfitness, the matter may only be made public with the consent of the practitioner.</P>
    <P>The matter of revising the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, is under active consideration. I hope to be in a position to bring forward proposals this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Cancer, cardiovascular diseases and accidents are the major causes of premature death in Ireland. I would like to assure the Deputy that I am acutely aware that the life expectancy gap for Irish people particularly those aged over 65 is widening when compared to our European counterparts. This fact was highlighted in both the report of the cardiovascular health strategy group &ndash; Building Healthier Hearts 1999 &ndash; and in the Annual Report of the Chief Medical Officer 1999.</P>
      <P>Considerable improvements have taken place in the delivery of cancer services since the national cancer strategy was launched in 1996. Some £41 million of dedicated funding has been allocated to develop a range of cancer services throughout the country.</P>
      <P>When the cardiovascular health strategy was launched in July of last year, my Department set a medium term objective &ndash; to bring our levels of premature deaths from cardiovascular disease in line with the EU average at a minimum. Our longer term objective is to reduce our rates to those of the best performers in the EU. At age 65, Ireland has the lowest life expectancy in the EU with the single biggest contributor being heart disease. There is room for major improvements before we attain the average life expectancy enjoyed by our European neighbours. Our overall goal is to achieve life expectancy which at a minimum compares with the EU average. The challenge now is to implement the recommendations of the cardiovascular health strategy group by developing structures and mechanisms which promote cardiovascular health, reduce inequalities, ensure a high quality of service provision and reduce variations in access to and quality of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="811" /> Some £12 million has been provided to commence the implementation process in 2000. I am confident that over the coming years the necessary funding will be provided to allow us to achieve our goals in implementing the various actions set out in the strategy.</P>

      <P>The administration of the registration system is a matter for an tArd-Chláraitheoir, the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages, and for local registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
      <P>The Registration of Births and Deaths Acts, 1863 to 1996, and the Marriages Acts of 1844 and 1863 provide that an t-ard chláraitheoir shall retain certified copies of the records of births, deaths and marriages returned to him on a quarterly basis by local registrars and that he shall compile and make available an index to such records at his office. Persons are entitled, under statute, to search these indexes on the payment of the approved fees and to obtain certified copies of entries identified from the index.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, a joint programme of work, aimed at modernising the civil registration service, is being undertaken by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and my Department, which will involve the review of the entire registration system, including registration law, the structure of registration of a national basis in order to identify the changes necessary to capitalise on the use of modern technology to capture registration information in an electronic format at the point of registration in a modern, efficient and legally adequate system. It is the intention that the system will incorporate a link to all life events associated with each person. The objective is to implement a modern, efficient and effective system geared to the needs of the 21st century. Funding of £7.3 million for the modernisation programme was approved in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may also be aware of the steps that are being taken to maintain and improve indexes to the records of births, deaths and marriages including the special project for the capture of the records of births, deaths and marriages and associated indexes in an electronic format which has been ongoing in Roscommon for some time. When this archival records project is completed, it will improve the efficiency, flexibility, access and management of the records and the associ<Col N="812" /> ated indexes and will provide potential for the development of a range of services, which would not be possible in a system on printed indexes.</P>
    <P>The General Register Office is co-operating fully with the Passport Office and certain procedures have been put in place to alleviate the problem, in relation to the use of birth certificates to obtain fraudulent passports, referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it would be a matter for the Garda to investigate any alleged fraudulent use of birth certificates for passport purposes.</P>

    <P>
    </P>
    <P>As Minister for Health and Children, my priority is to address the existing cardiac surgery waiting lists and the ultimate objective is to achieve an average six month waiting period for those on the lists. I am confident that the development of additional adult public cardiac surgery facilities at St. James's Hospital, Dublin and the proposed new cardiac surgery developments at University College Hospital, Galway will greatly increase the procedures performed. Target activity levels are in the region of 450 procedures annually at St. James's Hospital and 300 procedures at UCHG. This additional activity will increase the existing national adult public cardiac surgery capacity by over 50%. I am also developing additional children's cardiac surgery capacity at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin in association with the national cardiac unit, Mater Hospital to provide for up to an additional 100 cardiac procedures for children. This additional activity will increase existing paediatric cardiac surgery capacity by up to 40%.</P>

      <P>It is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment. In this context, following a series of discussions with the chief executive officers of the health boards, I recently announced a £10 million initiative aimed at maximising available capacity in the system to enable an additional 7,600 waiting list procedures to be performed before the end of the year. This funding will be allocated on the basis of the performance of each agency in reaching the activity targets they have agreed. The proposals to be funded are based on a series of innovative measures including use of facilities during the traditional summer closures period, cross-contracting arrangements between agencies and from the private sector, extended theatre and ward opening times, extended weekend work and the contracting of activity from hospitals in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These short-term measures are being taken in tandem with longer term measures associated with the £2 billion investment under the national development plan, the ongoing implementation of the recommendations of the expert review group on the waiting list initiative and the national bed capacity review now under way. It is <Col N="814" /> my intention to continue to take all available steps to address the short and longer term issues associated with lengthy waiting lists and waiting times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Office for National Statistics, London, has indicated to my Department that 6,214 women who gave Irish addresses had abortions in England and Wales in 1999. This figure is equivalent to 11.6% of the 53,354 births registered in Ireland in the same period. These figures are provisional in all cases.</P>
      <P>When the Green Paper on Abortion was published in September 1999, the Government indicated that it had decided to prepare a programme of measures which it is hoped will address many of the issues which have been identified as contributing to the number of Irish women who have abortions in Britain each year. Additional funding of £1 million in 1999 and a further £1.6 million in 2000 has been provided to the health boards for the continued development of family planning and pregnancy counselling services, including measures aimed at addressing the issue of unwanted pregnancy. Health boards are undertaking a range of initiatives in this area.</P>
      <P>The type of issues on which boards are being asked to concentrate when developing policy include the provision of services which are accessible to young people and which meet their need in relation to issues such as confidentiality and hours of operation. Educational and promotional activities should focus on such issues as the need for responsible sexual behaviour of young people at risk, increased awareness of pregnancy counselling services and the cultivation of more responsible attitudes to alcohol, with particular regard to alcohol and sexual activity.</P>
      <P>Where pregnancy counselling services are supported, boards have been asked to ensure that these are available on a drop-in basis, without any waiting period, and that a choice of service provider is available. Steps to increase women's awareness of post-abortion counselling and of the need for medical check-ups are also being considered. Such check-ups also provide an opportunity for women to obtain advice on appropriate contraception for the future and, thereby, reduce the incidence of further unwanted pregnancies.</P>
      <P>In addition to measures which are being developed by health boards, my Department is at present planning a public awareness campaign which will begin later this year and which will aim to encourage sexually active young people to be responsible in their attitudes to relationships and to inform and educate them about the issues involved.</P>

      <P>The cardiovascular health strategy group met on 20 occasions and presented its report, Building Healthier Hearts, to the Taoiseach in July 1999. This completed the work of the strategy group and therefore they have not met since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as a measure of the Government's commitment to implementation of the cardiovascular health strategy report, structures were put in place at national, regional and local level to <Col N="818" /> drive the implementation process forward. These structures include the establishment of a high level heart health task force, an expert advisory forum on cardiovascular health and an interdivisional working group within my Department. The heart health task force has met on two occasions, the advisory forum has met on four occasions and the inter-divisional working group meets on an ongoing basis. These structures are designed to ensure that all 211 recommendations contained in the strategy document are implemented in a planned and structured manner.</P>

      <P>Re-adaptation aid funding under Article 56.2(b) of the ECSC Treaty was secured by my Department from the European Commission in respect of former Irish Steel Limited workers who were made redundant as a result of the 1994 restructuring plan. The application for such funding was made by my Department on the basis that the extra-statutory <Col N="819" /> redundancy payments, made in respect of these workers, constituted the State matching funds. The State's position on matching funding was in line with the 1991 convention between the European Commission and the Government which defines the terms and conditions for the granting of ECSC re-adaptation aid. The State's position was accepted by the commission.</P>
      <P>A legal opinion produced by the Attorney General in September 1999 supported the State's interpretation of the 1991 convention. Therefore, there are no payments outstanding to the former workers in respect of ECSC re-adaptation aid, either from the European Commission or from the State. The group of former steel workers have been advised of this position.</P>

      <P>The Job initiative programme is a three year work experience programme for persons who have been unemployed for five years or longer. The fundamental objective of Job initiative is to progress participants into mainstream employment.</P>
      <P>The new guidelines on the future operation of the programme have not imposed any specific deadlines to Job initiative participation. Workers currently filling phase 1 places on Job initiative, many of whom have availed of a six months extension to the end of June 2000, are allowed to remain on the programme for a further limited period to be determined locally between FÁS and their sponsors. These workers will receive personal guidance from a specific employment service case officer who will have the task of exploring the range of options available to the individual based on their ability to progress to the open labour market.</P>
      <P>Greater emphasis will be placed on the work experience element of the Job initiative programme in future and through more active involvement of the local employment service, employers will be regularly appraised of the skills and competencies of Job initiative participants. A period of placement with prospective employers may be the appropriate option for some workers and other persons currently job ready can avail of the services of FÁS job clubs, which are located around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As identified in the PPF, some people, including those currently on Job initiative, may have difficulties in getting and keeping a job in the open labour market and additional long-term supports will be needed. The issue of identifying and developing appropriate supports for such <Col N="820" /> persons will be addressed by the PPF standing committee on the labour market.</P>
    <P>Some participants have additional training needs which can be accommodated while they remain on the programme and others may choose to opt for full time training. Bridging training programmes will also be provided by FÁS, in co-operation with the partnership companies, which will be used to support the progression of Job initiative workers. Persons engaged in full-time training will be paid the appropriate training allowance similar to other trainees and will be eligible for the £25 training bonus per week.</P>

      <P>Community employment is a temporary work experience programme whose primary role is to assist the progression of participants into jobs and-or further education and training.</P>
      <P>The current restructuring of CE, which was decided by the Government in 1999 in consultation with the social partners, involves a phased reduction in the number of participants engaged on CE to 28,000 in 2003. In this context it is necessary for FÁS, as the operational agency for the programme, including project selection and the allocation of places, to prioritise projects according to needs. Priority is currently being given by FÁS to &ldquo;caring/support&rdquo; projects based in the community and voluntary sector, including child care, care of the elderly and disabled persons, and drugs task force projects.</P>
      <P>On the matter of services currently being delivered through CE to the education sector, my Department, in the context of the commitment under section 4.2.4 of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, is engaged in ongoing discussions with the Department of Education and Science with a view to determining the potential to mainstream such services.</P>
      <P>I hope to have proposals ready for consideration by the social partners through the PPF standing committee on the labour market in the early autumn.</P>
      <P>While there may be some short-term reduction in funding for schools due to the CE restructuring, the proposed mainstreaming of schools services should be a satisfactory end result both for CE participants who are eligible to compete for these positions and for the education sector who would then be able to retain trained staff.</P>

      <P>Community employment is an active labour market programme whose primary role is to progress participants to jobs in the open labour market. Following the restructuring of CE approved by Government in 1999, the following revised eligibility criteria apply to persons who wish to participate in the options available under the programme:</P>
      <P>(a)the part-time integration option is aimed at persons who are unemployed and in receipt of a payment in respect of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, qualified adults, one parent family payment or widows-widowers pension for a minimum period of 12 months. Persons in receipt of a disability payment who obtain approval from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to engage in employment of a rehabilitative nature can also participate in the programme.</P>
      <P>The eligibility age for participation in this CE option was raised from 21 years to 25 years on 1 January 2000 with the following exceptions: travellers, ex-offenders, refugees, people with disabilities, people referred under drugs task force, offshore island inhabitants and 18-24 year olds referred through EAP who are 18 months or more unemployed.</P>
      <P>Participants remain on this programme for a period of one year. A limited number of people can remain for a second year in circumstances where it will facilitate their progression to employment.</P>
      <P>(b)the part-time job option-rate for the job is targeted at persons who need a longer programme in order to become job ready. Participants must be 35 or over and three years unemployed and in receipt of the payments stated previously. Participants can remain on this option for a period up to three years.</P>
      <P>Other changes to the programme forming part of the restructuring process, which were introduced in April 2000, include the duration of participant breaks between schemes increased from six to 12 months, and future participation in CE by an individual will be capped at three years. An individual's previous participation on the programme will not be taken into account. Offshore island residents are exempt from these changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These changes were introduced to discourage repeated participation in CE and to give individuals the opportunity to undertake training programmes where <Col N="822" /> possible, or to utilise the service of FÁS placement officers and-or the local employment service.</P>
    <P>It should be noted, however, that the three year cap will not affect an individual's participation on the programme until 2003 at the earliest and I intend to monitor the programme carefully in the interim.</P>
    <P>Options for persons no longer eligible to participate in CE and unable to find open labour market employment include the standing committee on the labour market which is in the process of identifying appropriate supports for persons unlikely to succeed in getting, or keeping, a job in the open labour market for reasons relating to age and other barriers. I anticipate that proposals in this regard will be available in the autumn; and the new social economy programme which will have potential for some CE workers who wish to continue to work in the community and voluntary sector. When fully operational this programme will have an annual budget of approximately £41 million and will be funded primarily through a reallocation on a phased basis of a proportion of funding currently committed to CE.</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of programmes such as community employment and jobs initiative is to provide a pathway back to open economy jobs for those who need such support. These programmes are prioritised very much towards long-term unemployed people or other specific groups facing particular labour market disadvantage. Persons returning to the labour market or moving between jobs can avail of the services of FÁS, either for employment placement or for training, and such supports can frequently be more appropriate than being placed on work experience programmes.</P>
      <P>As of now I have no plans to change the eligibility conditions for community employment or associated programmes.</P>

      <P>The Health and Safety Authority is the State body with responsibility for the day-to-day enforcement of occupational health and safety. The authority was established under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The authority has informed me that there are currently five inspectors based in their Galway regional office, three of whom are engaged full-time in inspection duties. In the period 1995 to <Col N="824" /> date, inspector staffing levels in the Galway office varied from one to two inspectors to the current level which was reached in 1999 as part of the authority's expansion of its services in the western region. From time to time, in addition to inspections carried out by locally based inspectors, inspections are undertaken by other inspectors based outside the region relating to matters such as occupational hygiene or the transport of dangerous goods. During the period 18 to 22 October 1999, eight additional inspectors participated in a special construction inspection campaign in the area.</P>

      <Quest> the plans she has to monitor the likely inflationary impact of the euro changeover in 2000 and 2001, especially in view of past experience of rounding-up prices during decimalisation. </Quest>

      <P>Euro coins and notes will not be issued for general circulation until January 2002. As such there is unlikely to be any identifiable inflationary or deflationary impact from consumer goods price changes attributable to the euro until the period October to December 2001, as most providers of goods and services are generally not expected to change their prices to euro until close to the changeover date, 1 January 2002.</P>
      <P>Last year, my Department in conjunction with the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs produced a national code of practice on dual pricing in preparation for the introduction of euro notes and coins. The purpose of this code of practice is to provide for transparency in the pricing of goods and services during the changeover from the IR£ to the euro.</P>
      <P>Suppliers of goods and services to consumers may subscribe to this code by notifying the Director of Consumer Affairs in writing of their intention to do so. The minimum period during which subscribers to the code will be required to observe its provisions will be from 1 October 2001 until one month after the withdrawal of Irish notes and coins. Subscribers to the code will be committed to displaying prices of goods and services to the fullest extent practicable in both currencies.</P>
      <P>It is anticipated that the implementation of this code of practice by goods and service providers will both introduce a significant measure of price transparency into the changeover process and facilitate the monitoring of price rounding when the changeover takes place in January 2002.</P>
      <P>I will consider what further action needs to be taken to ensure that consumers are adequately protected when we come closer to the changeover date.</P>

      <P>In May 1999, Waterford County Council applied to my Department for permission under the Foreshore Act, 1933, to carry out works on the foreshore at Cheekpoint, County Waterford in connection with the Cheekpoint sewerage scheme.</P>
      <P>In September 1999, Waterford County Council was requested to initiate the public consultation process by publishing in the <i>Munster Express </i>a notice of its application which it did on 24 September 1999. A period of 21 days from the date of publication of the notice was afforded to all interested parties and the general public to make representations/objections to me prior to any decision being made.</P>
      <P>In November 1999, Waterford County Council indicated to my Department that it had published a notice as requested and provided evidence of this.</P>
      <P>In February 2000, my Department furnished Waterford County Council with a working document which detailed the likely terms and conditions of a foreshore licence, which it was prepared to recommend to me for approval. Waterford County Council sought clarification on a number of the proposed conditions, including necessary conditions for monitoring of effluent standards and provision of additional treatment of effluent if required. My Department is considering these particular matters with its specialist advisers and hopes to make a report to me within a few weeks. That report will detail the proposals, the consultation process that has been gone through, and a commentary thereon, and recommend whether or not to grant a licence and if so under what conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of a number of concerns in relation to the local elections in Albania including the harassment of legitimate political party activity to which the Deputy refers. For the last few years Albania has been prone to instability caused in part by the collapse of a fraudulent pyramid savings scheme under the Government of the former President Sali Berisha, now the leader of the largest Opposition party, the Democratic Party. Relations between the main Government and Opposition parties have been polarised, with the Democratic Party refusing to fulfil the role of an Opposition party. In spite of representations made to him by EU representatives Mr. Berisha still refuses to accept his role in Opposition and may boycott the elections entirely.</P>
      <P>One other concern in relation to the local elections is the packing of the central election commission with the Socialist Party Government's own supporters. Of the eight members of the central election commission, seven are effectively nominees of the Socialist Party. The head of the OSCE presence in Albania, Ambassador Ahrens, has expressed concern at this, as have a number of EU member states represented in Tirana.</P>
      <P>I will instruct our Ambassador in Athens, who is accredited to Albania, to ensure that the incident the Deputy refers to, as well as the other concerns I have mentioned, are raised with the Albanian authorities at the earliest opportunity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The human rights situation in Algeria remains a cause for concern. In particular, although reports indicate that the level of violence has diminished generally, serious outbreaks of violence continue to occur. These outbreaks both violate human rights and jeopardise the programme of national reconciliation and peace. It is clear that the ending of civil conflict is a prerequisite for the effective establishment of civil society and full respect for human rights. Unfortunately, however, there is continued opposition by some groups to any settlement or reconciliation between the Government and its Islamist opponents. We are deeply concerned at the continued activities of the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), who have been responsible for atrocities often involving massacre and mutilation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="827" /> At the recent 56th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, Ireland together with our EU partners welcomed a number of positive developments in Algeria, although it is still our concern that Algeria's human rights past be fully and adequately accounted for.</P>
    <P>Ireland is actively involved in the EU on the human rights situation in Algeria which is a major focus of the EU's relationship with that country. At the recent European Council in Feira the EU member states in adopting a common policy on the Mediterranean region committed themselves again to promote the core values embraced by the EU and its member states, including human rights, democracy, good governance, transparency and the rule of law; to stress the importance of promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms for all including by support for governmental and non-governmental actors in the region through human rights training, monitoring, advocacy and awareness-raising; and in the context of the UN charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to urge accession to international human rights instruments including full implementation of civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion.</P>
    <P>The EU continues to encourage Algeria to honour its human rights commitments and to persevere with the necessary reforms and modernisation, and has offered constructive assistance through the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. Ireland takes an active part in this partnership. The Euro-Mediterranean Partnership is also seeking to develop the judicial co-operation necessary for the effective combating of drug trafficking, international crime and terrorism. The moves by President Bouteflika's Government towards economic and social modernisation and reform, though currently in a delicate phase and resisted by some elements, can in time provide the basis for a peaceful future for Algeria. Full respect for human rights will be an essential element.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the provision of communications infrastructure is primarily a matter for operators in the newly liberalised telecommunications market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recognising that in certain regions of the country competition alone would not provide the required advanced communications and services investment, my Department administered a num<Col N="828" /> ber of calls under the economic infrastructure operational programme 1994-99 and INTERREG II to facilitate the investment in the rollout of advanced communications infrastructure. Following these calls 13 projects received approximately 26 million euros in European funding, leveraging a further 42 million euros of private sector investment. Eircom received EIOP co-funding for one of these projects to rollout 32 km of fibre optic cable through a number of towns, one of which was Westport. This project is to be completed by 31 December 2000 and will provide Westport with a broadband, backbone access point through an SDH transmission multiplex.</P>
    <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, a provision of up to £150 million of EU Structural Funds and Exchequer funds was made to facilitate further investment in communications and e-commerce infrastructure and services. The first call for proposals under the new NDP investment measures was issued on 26 June 2000.</P>

    <P>The trend in recent years for the country as a whole has been for a decline in the total number of farms, mainly driven by a decrease in the number of very small farms. At the same time part-time farming has increased considerably. These trends are likely to be reflected in County Galway.</P>
    <P>The Government is fully committed to helping as many farmers and their families as possible to achieve viability and stay on the land, whether they do this through full or part-time farming. It will be vital to maintain and develop the maximum number of highly competitive full-time farmers, as these farmers are the backbone of the industry. Part-time farming, however, offers an opportunity to a considerable number of families with small farms to achieve a viable household income. The Government's rural development policies aim to ensure people in rural areas will have the widest possible choice of attractive job opportunities available locally.</P>

      <P>Where direct income payments are concerned the current practice in my Department is to furnish information helpsheets to all potential applicants when the main schemes are launched. The information provided highlights the closing date and the payment rates for the schemes concerned.</P>
      <P>In January 2000 my Department issued a booklet entitled <i>Agenda 2000</i> to every herdowner in the country. This booklet highlighted the main changes under the Agenda 2000 arrangements and provided information on new schemes and variations under existing schemes.</P>
      <P>My Department also held a series of information meetings throughout the country in January-February of this year. The purpose of these meetings, which drew large attendances, was to inform potential applicants of scheme requirements and allow producers an opportunity to discuss relevant issues with the various experts on the schemes. My Department is committed to continuing such information meetings as the need arises.</P>
      <P>A &ldquo;Schemes and Services&rdquo; booklet is published annually which is available free of charge to all producers and provides information on all schemes administered by the Department. In addition this information is available on Aertel, page 675 and on the Department's website at www.irlgov.ie/daff. Information on all other schemes administered by my Department is available on request.</P>
      <P>Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, my Department, in conjunction with the farming social partners, will introduce a new protocol for direct payments to farmers. Negotiations on the protocol are at an advanced stage and will include payment schedules.</P>

      <P>The disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme has evolved considerably since its inception in 1968. When the scheme was <Col N="838" /> first introduced it provided only for exemption from road tax. Thereafter it was gradually extended to include repayment of excise duty on fuel, motor vehicle excise duty, VAT in 1972, and vehicle registration tax, which replaced motor vehicle excise duty, in 1993. At various times, conditions such as the need for vehicle adaptation have been modified. Prior to 1994, the various reliefs were administered by different areas within the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and I am advised that, for this reason, the information requested by the Deputy is readily available only for the years from 1994 onwards. The information is as follows:</P>

    <P>The figures shown above relate to claims for new and replacement vehicles paid in each of the years in question. In this regard, qualifying disabled persons may claim in respect of the purchase of a vehicle every two years. It is estimated that some 5,400 persons are actively participating in the scheme.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the scheme will cost approximately £20 million this year. It should be noted that the above figures do not include the cost of exemption from road tax which, according to estimates by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, would have been of the order of £2 million for 1999.</P>

    <P>It should be borne in mind that both as regards the above amounts of money and number of accounts, these are inactive but not necessarily permanently dormant and abandoned. The proposed notification process will lead to many account-holders being reminded of their accounts and therefore to a reactivation of the accounts.</P>

      <P>There is no stamp duty on the sale of new residential property where the purchaser is an owner-occupier and the house is not greater than 125 square metres. If a new house is more than 125 square metres, stamp duty is charged only on the site cost or a quarter of the value of the house, whichever is the greater.</P>
      <P>In relation to second-hand houses, I am confident the package of tax measures introduced by the Government last week will help to reduce the cost burden faced by home-buyers and widen their options. In particular, the revised regime is structured to confer advantage on those who are trying to buy their first home.</P>

      <P>In the 1998 budget, I introduced tax relief for the provision of private nursing homes. The Finance Act, 1998, provides for capital allowances in respect of expenditure on the construction, extension or refurbishment of buildings used as private, registered nursing homes and for such expenditure on the conversion of an existing building into such a nursing home. The allowances are 15% per annum for years one to six and 10% in year seven for expenditure incurred after 3 December 1997. In the 1999 Finance Act, I introduced similar capital allowances for expenditure on private convalescent facilities. These facilities are to be used as an alternative to hospital care for patients recovering from acute hospital treatment.</P>
      <P>I understand that under the normal self-assessment rules any person seeking to claim capital allowances in respect of a qualifying building would submit their claim on the appropriate tax return form. However, the form does not distinguish between capital allowances claimed in respect of nursing homes and-or private convalescent facilities from those claimed in respect of any other industrial building. Consequently, it is not possible for Revenue to indicate the level of take-up of this specific incentive. However, I would like to remind the House that in order to avail of the tax relief, a nursing home must be registered with a health board in accordance with the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990. Consequently, matters relating to the number of beds provided would be a matter for the health boards in the first instance.</P>

Under An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government is committed to reducing the standard rate of income tax to 20% and the higher rate to 42% or 40% if economic circumstances permit.</P>

      <P>The health promotion unit of my Department commissioned the centre of health promotion studies at the National University of Ireland, Galway, to carry out the first national surveys on lifestyle behaviours for school-going children, Health Behaviour of School-Aged Children, HBSC, and adults SLAN, the results of which were published in 1999. The HBSC report is part of a World Health Organisation study which looks at a wide range of health behaviours ranging from general health and well being to oral health, alcohol use, etc.</P>
      <P>The HBSC survey showed that children are experimenting with alcohol at a very young age and a substantial number of adolescents are involved in high risk drinking. That survey reported that more than 50% have had a drink prior to ages nine to 11 and up to 18% of boys in that age group were current drinkers. A total of 29% of children aged between nine and 17 years reported being really drunk. However, within the 15 - 17 age group, up to 59% of boys reported being really drunk and the corresponding figure for girls was 52%.</P>
      <P>School surveys indicate that there has been an increase in the consumption of drugs, in particular cannabis. A European school survey project on alcohol and other drugs (ESPAD) which was conducted in 1995 indicated that 37% of the 2000 16 year olds surveyed in Ireland had, at some stage, tried cannabis. This figure was high by comparison with most other EU member states. However, this figure should be qualified by noting that of this group of young people only 10% had used cannabis 20 times or more. The prevalence of the use of cannabis among the group in the 12 months prior to the study was 33% and the 30 days prevalence was 19%. Figures for use of ecstasy would be similar. The health promotion unit has commissioned a further Irish input to an ESPAD survey from which data should be available early in 2001. It is also intended to commission a further national HBSC survey in 2001.</P>

      <P>I understand the Deputy is referring to clotting factor concentrates, Factors 8 and 9, which are imported by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service (IBTS), formerly the Blood Transfusion Service Board, for use in the treatment of persons with haemophilia. As the Deputy is aware, plasma derived clotting factors manufactured in the 1980s are implicated in the infection with HIV and hepatitis C of a significant number of persons with haemophilia, many of whom have died. Matters associated with these historical infections are currently under investigation at the Lindsay tribunal.</P>
      <P>Significant improvements in the safety of clotting factor concentrates have taken place since the 1980s. In 1997 hospitals replaced plasma derived Factor 8 with a recombinant product. Recombinant products are genetically produced rather than fractionated from human plasma and accordingly are considered to be safer. Plasma derived Factor 9 was also replaced by hospitals with a recombinant product as soon as it became available in 1999. Recombinant products are considerably more expensive and my Department's allocation to health agencies increased by almost £13 million over the period 1998-9 to cover the higher costs of this product replacement programme. A further £2.25 million was made available this year. These products are licensed medicinal products and are therefore regulated by the Irish Medicines Board, an independent statutory body. The Irish Haemophilia Society welcomed the changeover to recombinant products.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Drug misuse occurs all over Ireland. It takes two forms: heroin abuse, which is confined mainly to greater Dublin, and the misuse of other drugs including cannabis, ecstasy, amphetamines, tranquillisers, LSD, inhalants/solvents and magic mushrooms.  Various estimates have been made of the number of opiate misusers in the country. Given the illicit nature of drug misuse, it is difficult to get a clear estimate of the extent of the problem. Estimates range from around 8,500 to 13,500. The ministerial task force suggested a figure of 8,000, confined mainly to Dublin city. The Health Research Board report on treated drug misuse in Ireland in 1998 gave a total of 6,043 treated cases in 1998 &ndash; 5,076 cases treated in the greater Dublin area and 67 in the rest of the country. It must be emphasised, however, that this is the number of people receiving treatment and the number of people misusing drugs would be greatly in excess of this figure.</P>
      <P>The mean age of those in treatment for drug misuse in Ireland is 24 years, which is the lowest in the EU. Of those in treatment in 1998, 13.3% were under 15 years of age when they first used drugs, while 58.9% were between 15 and 19 years.</P>
      <P>In order to implement a range of measures to reduce the demand for drugs, the Government allocated £10 million to support over 200 projects in local drugs task force areas in 1997. In August 1999, a further £15 million was allocated to enable task forces to update these plans and related activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1999, the Taoiseach allocated £34.8 million in 1999 to the young people's facilities and services fund to develop youth facilities and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. Of this sum, £25 million was allocated to 295 facility and services projects in the local drugs task force areas on the basis of the recommendations of an assessment committee in relation to plans submitted. The allocation included funding towards 86 capital projects such as youth centres, community centres and sports facilities which will provide much needed accommodation for programmes and services in these areas. In addition, the funding will provide for a wide variety of community based prevention programmes including early school leaving programmes, after-school activities, sports and recreational activities, family sup<Col N="848" /> port programmes, art, drama, and music programmes, counselling and transport services.</P>
    <P>Recognising that the problem of drug misuse is not confined to the task force areas in Dublin and Cork, funding was also allocated to areas outside these priority areas. Some £2.4 million has been provided each year for three years, 1998-2000, to set up family support projects aimed at children at risk and families at risk within particular communities and working with voluntary and community groups in a co-ordinated way. Projects have commenced in Cherry Orchard, Naas, Waterford, Mahon in Cork, Thurles, Southill, Athlone, Galway City, Letterkenny, Sligo, Navan and Dundalk.</P>
    <P>Since 1996, a total additional sum of around £24 million has been allocated by my Department to drugs and HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment services in health boards.  In the Eastern Regional Health Authority, where the majority of drug misusers reside, the total budget for drugs and AIDS services in 2000 is over £22 million. During 2000 all health boards are expanding and enhancing their drug misuse services. This includes the development of drugs information systems, enhancing education and prevention services and providing greater access to treatment and rehabilitation services.</P>

    <P>Information on the number of people who cease methadone treatment or who remain drug free is not readily available as it involves following a cohort of people for a period of time and is done by means of periodic survey. The review of the Eastern Health Board's drug services, which was carried out in 1999, referred to such a study in the National Drug Treatment Outcome Review Survey in the UK. This study looked at a one year follow-up of 478 clients on methadone. Of this number, after a one year period 22% abstained from using other illicit opioids as opposed to 5% who abstained at the initial stage of treatment. Some 64% abstained from using stimulants, compared with 47%, and 5% were sharing injecting <Col N="849" /> equipment compared with 13% at the beginning of treatment.</P>
    <P>For many opiate users the main goal is to stabilise their chaotic drug taking habit, so that they can aim at rehabilitation, with the ultimate goal of becoming drug free. The evaluator noted that the effectiveness of maintenance treatment appears strongest in reducing drug-related criminal behaviour.  On use of other drugs, once again from the Eastern Health Board's review of services in 1999, a study conducted in five addiction clinics over a four month period showed that 30% of clients tested positive for using other opiates while on methadone treatment, 65% had used benzodiazepines and a further 14% had used tricyclics. Health board clinics have a range of sanctions in place when a client tests positive for other drugs when that person is on methadone. These sanctions range from a reduction in the dose of methadone being prescribed to removal altogether from treatment. It is generally acknowledged that treatment is more likely to achieve success where methadone programmes are part of a wider treatment regime which includes counselling, after care and rehabilitation. For this reason rehabilitation has been given high priority in the Eastern Regional Health Authority's Service Plan for 2000, which recognises that further expansion of rehabilitation services must take place to assist people to break the cycle of addiction and return to a relatively normal lifestyle. Three rehabilitation co-ordinators are being appointed to link statutory, voluntary and community groups in developing rehabilitation initiatives. The Eastern Regional Health Authority is in the process of developing a drugs and AIDS information system, which will be in place by the end of the year. This database system will improve clinical management of drug misuse and AIDS, and will also allow for routine surveillance of treatment patterns and outcomes.</P>

      <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is currently undertaking an audit of compliance with the specified risk material regulations in abattoirs and meat retail premises in association with the veterinary services of the local authorities and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. Under current regulations, SRM is excluded from cattle and sheep carcases at the abattoir. With regard to sheep, all spleens and the brain and <Col N="850" /> spinal cord from sheep over one year of age are classified as SRM. The product found in the two shops in Dublin was a number of adult sheep carcases which had not been split, a process whereby the sheep carcase is cut in two using a saw and the spinal cord is removed by knife or a similar instrument designed specifically for the purpose. The spinal cord was still <i>in situ</i> in these carcases. These carcases were condemned, the spinal cords removed and sent for special treatment, and the rest of the carcases sent for rendering.</P>
      <P>Under the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act, 1998, the authority may engage in a service contract with the official agency which, prior to the FSAI's establishment, had been responsible for the enforcement of particular food legislation. In the case of veterinary controlled products, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is the responsible official agency and it now acts as an agent of the FSAI in the enforcement of legislation. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is obliged to provide the appropriate resources to fulfil its service contract obligations. This Department has negotiated with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development for an additional £2.3 million for the strengthening of food safety controls in small abattoirs and meat plants during 2000.</P>

      <P>Ireland is collaborating with its partners at European level to develop reliable testing methods for GMO-derived foodstuffs. The Joint Research Centre of the EU Commission held a second meeting in Ispra on 13-14 June of this year to discuss detection methods for GMOs in foodstuffs. Ireland was represented by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, the Environmental Protection Agency and the State Laboratory. It is generally accepted that the principal and most reliable method for detecting GMOs in foodstuffs is polymerase chain reaction with real time, PCR, providing the most reliable quantification data. The Joint Research Centre is currently conducting validation studies and ring trials throughout the European Union. It is envisaged that proficiency tests will also be conducted for the various laboratories throughout the EU. It is planned to designate the State Laboratory as the reference laboratory for the detection of GMOs in Ireland. At present the State Laboratory is reviewing the availability of equipment to conduct this analysis and I understand that machinery to conduct real time, PCR, should be purchased in the very near future. There are private laboratories with facili<Col N="851" /> ties for testing foods which may have been genetically modified.

    <P>There has been considerable development in the care and treatment of patients with cancer in recent years. Since the launch of the national cancer strategy in November 1996, and the announcement of the action plan for the implementation of the strategy in March 1997, considerable improvements have taken place in this area. The two underlying principles of the national cancer strategy are: to take all measures possible to reduce rates of illness and death from cancer, in line with the targets established in the Health Strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future; and to ensure that those who develop cancer receive the most effective care and treatment and that their quality of life is enhanced to the greatest extent possible. Underlying these objectives is the need for a high quality, patient-focused service. One of the specific objectives of the strategy is to ensure that all patients have access to an equitable, effective service with a uniformly high quality of care, wherever they live.</P>
    <P>Since the strategy was launched, regional directors of cancer services were appointed in each health board area, with two co-regional directors of cancer services appointed in the North Eastern Health Board area. The regional directors were asked to prepare plans for the development of cancer services in their area and these plans were then submitted to my Department. The National Cancer Forum and Professor James Fennelly, special adviser on cancer services to the Depart<Col N="852" /> ment, advised on appropriate developments in each area. On a national basis, some £41 million of dedicated funding has been allocated since 1997 for the development of cancer services. My Department is continuing to work with the National Cancer Forum and the regional directors of cancer services in identifying priorities for the further development of cancer services in all regions, building on the major progress made to date.  On cardiac related illness, in January 1998 the then Minister announced a major new programme to tackle cardiovascular disease built around three key initiatives as follows: the development of additional public cardiac surgery facilities to tackle the existing backlog of patients awaiting surgery and to guarantee public hospital patients access to cardiac surgery within an average waiting period of six months; the development of a national strategy for cardiovascular health; and the development of a national heart-lung transplant programme.</P>
    <P>I have provided a total of £3.6 million in 2000 to meet the costs of improvements in cardiac care infrastructure at several sites nationwide to facilitate the development of additional public cardiac surgery facilities. In addition, I have also provided £12 million in 2000 to implement the recommendations of the Cardiovascular Health Strategy Group by developing structures and mechanisms which promote cardiovascular health, reduce inequalities and ensure a high quality of service provision while reducing variations in access to and quality of service.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health and Children, my priority is to address the existing cardiac surgery waiting lists and the ultimate objective is to achieve an average six month waiting period for those on the lists. I am confident that the development of additional adult public cardiac surgery facilities at St. James's Hospital, Dublin and the proposed new cardiac surgery developments at University College Hospital, Galway will help reduce the waiting lists which exist at present. Target activity levels are in the region of 450 procedures annually at St. James's Hospital and 300 procedures at UCHG. This additional activity will increase existing adult public cardiac surgery capacity by over 50%. I am also developing additional children's cardiac surgery capacity at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin in association with the national cardiac unit, Mater Hospital to provide for up to an additional 100 cardiac procedures for children. This additional activity will increase existing paediatric cardiac surgery capacity by up to 40%. It is also proposed to increase cardiac surgery capacity at Cork University Hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The health promotion unit of my Department prepared the national alcohol policy in 1996. As explained in that policy, estimating the economic cost of alcohol related problems is fraught with difficulties due to the problems of gathering accurate data on true costs and the exclusion of other social costs which cannot be accurately quantified. Quantifiable costs for some of the measures were estimated in 1988 using criteria in relation to workplace production losses due to absenteeism, illness and accidents attributable to alcohol, losses from road accidents, expenditure on health treatment of people with alcohol related problems, expenditure on social welfare payments and expenditure on resources on police and social workers in dealing with alcohol related problems. The total cost based on the 1988 figures was £263 million, of which £138 million was borne by the State. Allowing for inflation this figure was estimated at £325.6 million in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More comprehensive data on the economic cost of alcohol related illnesses may emerge from analysis of the hospital in-patient inquiry currently being undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute. This information should be available later this year. The health promotion unit will continue, through multisectoral action, to pursue the objectives set out in the national alcohol policy which are to promote moderation in alcohol consumption for those who <Col N="854" /> wish to drink and to reduce the level of alcohol related problems.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the widespread availability of the rape drug GHB (gamma hydroxybutyrate); if his Department will conduct a study on its use here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>GHB (gamma hydroxybutyrate) was developed as an anaesthetic drug and used as a licensed drug in some member states of the European Union. In Ireland it is controlled under the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Regulations, 1993. It is a Schedule 3 controlled drug, so a person may only be in possession of it when it is prescribed by a medical practitioner. It is colourless, odourless and sometimes tasteless.</P>
      <P>There is little evidence of its misuse in any member state of the European Union, including Ireland. It is a depressant/hypnotic drug and its effects are similar to those produced by alcohol and cannabis. It has been abused by bodybuilders because of its anabolic properties. There is anecdotal evidence at a European level that GHB has the potential for being used for date rape, but there is no firm evidence to substantiate this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because there have been four deaths in the UK and two in Sweden from abuse of GHB between September 1995 and January 1999, Europol and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) are examining this drug and the scientific committee of the EMCDDA will carry out a risk assessment on it in the coming months to decide at a European level whether further controls are needed on its use. Dr Desmond Corringan, who is head of the school of pharmacy in Trinity College, is the <Col N="855" /> chairman of the scientific committee which will carry out this risk assessment. This will include an investigation in each member state of the availability and use of the drug. Based on the outcome of the risk assessment, decisions will be made at a European level whether stricter controls should be placed on GHB.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Eastern Regional Health Authority that following protracted negotiations with unions regarding nursing staff at St. Ita's Hospital, agreement was reached recently on the permanent filling of a number of clinical nurse manager posts which had been filled on a long-term acting basis. This is a preliminary step in addressing a comprehensive list of issues with staff representatives regarding the learning disability services and mental health services provided at St. Ita's Hospital. The main objective of these discussions and negotiations is to establish formal agreement on the recognition of separate and distinct services based on client need.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the agreement recently reached with the unions concerned, a current competition for the permanent filling of the clinical nurse manager posts is confined to the existing nursing staff at the hospital who have a registered psychiatric nurse qualification. This competition is unique and once-off. It is the management's intention that, in the future, the permanent filling of such posts will be by way of open competition.</P>
      <P>The Northern Area Health Board works in close co-operation and consultation with the National Association for Mentally Handicapped in Ireland in relation to the provision and development of services for persons with a learning disability. The association is aware of the arrangements outlined above and the complexities of the issues involved. The agreement reached with the unions concerned will not have any detrimental effect upon the quality and delivery of services provided at St. Ita's Hospital, including services provided to persons with a learning disability.</P>

      <P>Ennis General Hospital plays a vital role in the delivery of acute hospital services to the people of County Clare.

This is the essential first step in the planning process to improve the infrastructure at the hospital to meet the needs of the 21st century.</P>
      <P>I note that when Ennis Urban District Council raised the question of the mortality rate for County Clare it did not cast any reflection on the county's hospitals. I think that while well developed health services are important it is of even greater significance to focus on the associated social and economic factors such as poverty, nutrition and smoking, all of which contribute to poorer health status and consequently higher mortality rates generally. In the context of public health policy generally it is a matter for the Mid-Western Health Board to address in an integrated way having regard to local needs and circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin):</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in my reply to the Deputy on 20 June 2000, the requirement to reduce places following inspection under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, made pursuant to Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, is based on the need to ensure the health, safety and welfare of children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The requirement to reduce places is mainly related to the availability of adequate space per child in the premises and/or the requirement to have a sufficient number of competent adults supervising the pre-school children in the service at all times. Where deficiencies in services are identified during inspection, the health board and the providers work in a co-operative manner to make specific improvements in a planned way provided that any delay would not adversely affect the welfare of children. The plan may include a reduction in numbers achieved through natural reduction, that is, not replacing children who leave during the year, reducing numbers on a phased basis, reducing numbers at the beginning of the next school year or the provider moving to a larger premises. The time scale for mak<Col N="860" /> ing improvements varies from a requirement for immediate action to a phased implementation which may extend to six months &ndash; exceptionally, a longer period may be allowed. The Deputy will appreciate that, having regard to my responsibilities, the health, safety and welfare of children must be my primary consideration.</P>
    <P>The reduction of approximately 4,000 places which includes approximately 3,000 reduced and 1,000 reducing must also be seen in the context of approximately 47,400 places for the 0-6 age group which have been notified to the health boards under the regulations.</P>
    <P>The measures announced by my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will have a significant impact on the supply of child care facilities and places and on improving the quality of child care services available. The Deputy will be aware that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is responsible for co-ordinating child care service delivery over the course of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 and has been allocated £250 million for its equal opportunities child care programme to invest in the development of child care service provision. The objectives of the programme are to maintain and increase the number of child care facilities, increase the number of child care places and improve the quality of services available. Funding will be provided for the following initiatives: capital grants to establish, maintain, renovate, and /or upgrade and staff community based and not-for-profit child care facilities; capital grants for self-employed private child care providers to build, renovate or upgrade facilities catering for not more than 20 children at any one time; grants towards the development of local child care networks; grants to enhance the services of the national voluntary child care organisations; grants to encourage and promote local child care training models that assist in the enhancement of quality child care provision; and innovative projects identified over the course of the national development plan.</P>
    <P>Applications have been invited by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for the capital and staffing grant schemes.</P>
    <P>In addition, it was announced in budget 2000 that accelerated capital allowances, at the rate of 100% in the first year, will apply in relation to expenditure incurred on and from 1 December 1999 on child care facilities which meet the required standards as provided under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996- the allowances are subject to clearance by the European Commission.</P>
    <P>An additional £1.4 million has been made available to my Department this year to strengthen both the pre-school advisory and the inspection role of the health boards. This will facilitate health boards in responding to the anticipated increase in the number of child care places.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to state first that the Medical Council is an autonomous statutory body established by the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978. The Medical Council is the statutory body established to provide for the registration and control of persons engaged in the practice of medicine under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978.</P>
      <P>The Medical Council decided some years ago to introduce an examination for doctors outside the European Union seeking temporary registration in Ireland.  Overseas doctors, EU and non-EU, account for about a third of non-consultant hospital doctor posts. These doctors have played and, I am sure, will continue to play a very important role in providing a quality service in our hospitals. This assessment procedure was introduced by the Medical Council to ensure that all medical trainees, both EU and non-EU nationals, are of the highest standard.</P>
      <P>The matter of revising the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, is under active consideration. I hope to be in a position to bring forward proposals this year. In addition, I intend to bring forward legislation this week which will enable me to extend the period of temporary registration from the present five years to seven years in an effort to alleviate recruitment difficulties which hospitals are encountering from 1 July 2000. I will be looking for the co-operation of the House in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The delivery of acute hospital services at the Lourdes Orthopaedic Hospital, Kilcreene is a matter for the South Eastern Health Board in the first instance. As the Deputy will be aware, in September 1997 the South Eastern Health Board unanimously adopted a plan for the Kilkenny hospital system that involves the rationalisation of all hospital services in Kilkenny city onto the St. Luke's Hospital site. This plan involves the development of existing services in St Luke's, the addition of new specialities of acute psychiatry, paediatrics, geriatrics, including a long-stay unit, the further development of community services and the provision of a community hospital to support the acute hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="864" /> A central element of this plan will involve the transfer of elective orthopaedics from Kilcreene to Waterford Regional Hospital in line with the conclusions of a major review of orthopaedic services in the region which was completed in 1992 by a joint Department of Health/Comhairle na nOspideal expert review group.</P>
    <P>The full implementation of the Kilkenny hospital plan will require progress on a number of fronts, including the provision of suitable accommodation at Waterford Regional Hospital for the transfer of elective orthopaedic services there. In view of the complexities inherent in co-ordinating the implementation of the plan, a project team, involving officials, medical and nursing staff of the South Eastern Health Board and officials of my Department, has been established to draw up an implementation timetable, a priority list for the developments and to work on costings.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, elective orthopaedic procedures will continue to be performed at the hospital while this process of implementation, in consultation with all relevant interests, is under way. It is a matter for the board to address these ongoing needs in the normal way in the context of overall funding available to them for this purpose.</P>

      <P>As part of budget 1996 the then Government announced that &ldquo;persons who have been unemployed for at least one year shall retain their medical cards after entering employment.&rdquo;  Persons on the live register for at least one year who take up paid insurable employment were deemed to meet the criteria for retaining their medical cards for three years. The provision also covers participants on approved schemes applicable to the long-term unemployed, including back to work allowance, community employment, Jobstart, Job initiative, partnership and community group initiative and development courses such as <Col N="867" /> workplace and vocational training opportunities scheme. The purpose of the budget provision was to remove disincentives to labour force participation by long-term unemployed persons.</P>
      <P>The retention of medical card eligibility is approved for a period of three years when a person or the spouse of a person who has been unemployed for a minimum of one year takes up employment. In this context, time spent on the live register, approved schemes or courses for the long-term unemployed is treated as an unemployed period.</P>
      <P>CEOs approved the recommendations in the report of the working group in July 1998 and were happy that the group would then proceed to prepare revised guidelines based on the recommendations. A set of guidelines for entitlement to a medical card was agreed by the working group in April 1999. The guidelines cover entitlement to a medical card under the budget 1996 retention criteria, EU eligibility and under normal means tested criteria. It was agreed that approval for the final document would be sought within each health board, which would be responsible for printing and circulation of the document within its own functional area.</P>
      <P>My Department has been in contact with the chief executive officer of the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Mr. Donal O'Shea, and he has confirmed that the three area health boards provide medical cards in line with these guidelines.</P>

      <P>Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas. The monitoring of radiation levels in the state is carried out by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. The institute carried out and published a national survey on radon gas last year. The survey identifies areas at greatest risk from high indoor radon levels. The institute also provides a radon measurement and advisory service.</P>
      <P>Long-term exposure to very high levels of radon gas in an enclosed area can be a contributory factor in increasing the risk of lung cancer, particularly where other factors such as cigarette smoking are involved. When radon is vented into the open air it is quickly dispersed into harmless concentrations. The Department of the Environment and Local Government amended the building regulations in 1997 to provide for incorporation of radon preventive measures in new dwellings.</P>

      <P>In all new developments, hospitals are equipped with the most up to date equipment to satisfy the clinical needs of the service. Under the national development plan, £4 million has been provided to the health boards and £8 million to the Eastern Regional Health Authority to address the issue of replacement equipment and minor refurbishment works in the acute hospitals. This funding will address the upgrading issues based on the priorities of the service providers.</P>
      <P>I have also recently approved the purchase of three new MRI scanners for University College Hospital, Galway, St. James's Hospital and the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin, incorporating the National Children's Hospital. These new MRI facilities will significantly enhance the present service and will provide a dramatic improvement in the access to such facilities for public patients and should be operational later in the year. My Department is also in the process of providing new radiotherapy facilities at St. Luke's Hospital, Dublin and Cork University Hospital and a new radiotherapy service will be provided at University College Hospital, Galway.</P>
      <P>In other areas of high-technology medicine, I have also provided for additional cardiac surgery services at St. James's Hospital, Dublin. These additional cardiac surgery facilities will come on stream over the next two to three years with a view to meeting their target of 450 cardiac procedures per annum. Likewise, phase two of the major redevelopment programme at University College Hospital, Galway is now at tender stage and work will commence in 2000. Cardiac surgery facilities to cater for the target activity of 300 cardiac surgery procedures per annum are included in this project.</P>

      <P>The total number on in-patient hospital waiting lists as at 31 March 2000, the latest date for which figures are available, is 34,370. The figures requested for the last three years are as follows: 32,206 at 31 December 1997; 36,883 at 31 December 1998; and 36,855 at 31 December 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the numbers on waiting lists have fallen by 2,485 on <Col N="869" /> the end of December quarter. This welcome reduction has been achieved in a period of high levels of medical admissions due to flu-like illnesses and is a reflection of the major priority that is being attached to addressing high waiting lists.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment. In this context, following a series of discussions with the chief executive officers of the health boards, I recently announced a £10 million initiative aimed at maximising available capacity in the system to enable an additional 7,600 waiting list procedures to be performed before the end of the year. This funding will be allocated on the basis of the performance of each agency in reaching the activity targets they have agreed. The proposals to be funded are based on a series of innovative measures including use of facilities during the traditional summer closures period, cross-contracting arrangements between agencies and from the private sector, extended theatre and ward opening times, extended weekend work and the contracting of activity from hospitals in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>These short-term measures are being taken in tandem with longer term measures associated with the £2 billion investment under the national development plan, the ongoing implementation of the recommendations of the expert review group on the waiting list initiative and the national bed capacity review now under way. It is my intention to continue to take all available steps to address the short and longer term issues associated with lengthy waiting lists and waiting times.</P>

      <P>Under section 66 of the Health Act, 1970, health boards are statutorily responsible for the provision of child health services.</P>
      <P>A review of these services has been completed by the chief executive officers of the health boards. This review resulted in the recent publication of the report &ldquo;Best Health for Children&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The report's recommendations are wide ranging covering issues such as perinatal reporting, parent education, the roles and responsibilities of professionals, and the introduction of a standardised national child health surveillance programme. This core programme for child health surveillance will encompass all children between birth and the conclusion of primary schooling. Such screening will range from full physical examination at birth to measurement of growth &ndash; height and weight &ndash; testing of visual acuity and of hearing and general observation in later age groups. The report also recommends selective medical examination of children with problems. It also stresses the importance of monitoring services and ensuring that the effectiveness of the new surveillance system can be measured.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the report's recommendations is a matter for the health boards. The chief executive officers have established the national conjoint child health committee. This committee will have an important advisory role in relation to child health and will also be responsible for the development and setting of standards in terms of a quality child health service. The committee will also be examining the area of adolescent health. The chief executive officers have also appointed a national child health co-ordinator for the purpose of overseeing implementation of the recommendations of the report in the health boards. Each of the health boards has established an implementation group and they are currently assessing their needs in relation to the recommendations in the report. The health boards are also proposing to run separate demonstration projects relating to different aspects of the report's recommendations so that on completion the best practice can be extended to other boards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, <Col N="871" /> 1996, each health board is obliged to produce an annual service plan for the year on the basis of the financial determination notified to them. This requirement is also applied to voluntary hospitals on an administrative basis. These service plans are agreed with my Department at the beginning of each year. Responsibility for delivering the plans rests with management in each agency. As part of the process of delivering service plans activity in the acute hospital sector is planned by agencies over a 12 month period having regard to anticipated levels of emergency admissions and the overall resources available.</P>
      <P>In considering the delivery of service in the acute hospital sector, it is appropriate to examine the overall level of service provided in the sector rather than to simply focus on the number of beds available at any given time. This reflects major changes that have been taking place in medical practice, resulting in reduced average in-patient lengths of stay, a continuing shift in the delivery of care from an in-patient to day case basis and the increasing provision of treatment at outpatient level.</P>
      <P>The total discharges, both in-patient and day case, in the acute hospital system for the period January to December 1999 was 827,197. This huge volume of overall activity represented an increase of nearly 2.5% over 1998 levels. In particular, the level of hospital care being provided on a day case basis showed a very significant increase, up over 9.5% in 1999 over 1998 levels. This upward trend in overall activity continued in the first two months of this year. Overall discharges, in-patient and day case, were up nearly 3.5% over the same period in 1999, which includes an increase in day cases of over 11%. The increasing delivery of care at this level reflects trends in modern medical practice and is indicative of a service that is increasingly focusing resources in a manner that is best suited to the needs of the public.</P>
      <P>In achieving the activity targets set out in the annual service plans, temporary bed closures would form a part of the normal bed management function performed by local management as part of their efforts to optimise the overall activity delivered within the resources available. They also, of course, facilitate staff annual leave and refurbishment works. In recent times it has also been necessary to close beds, particularly in the greater Dublin area, due to difficulties recruiting appropriately qualified medical and nursing staff.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding this, last month I announced a major £10 million initiative on public hospital waiting lists. In drawing up proposals for this additional waiting list work, the chief executive officers were asked to examine various measures, including utilising facilities during the traditional closure periods in order to maximise overall capacity in the system. The proposals received by agencies following this examination of options by the chief executive officers are to be funded in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="872" /> As regards the recruitment of medical staff these difficulties are being addressed in the context of the Medical Manpower Forum which is due to publish its first report shortly. This issue will also be dealt with through legislation which I intend to bring forward to enable me to extend the period of temporary registration from the present five years to seven years in an effort to alleviate difficulties which hospitals are encountering in recruiting non-consultant hospital doctors from 1 July. In the event that some posts remain unfilled, hospitals will be asked to ensure that essential and critical services are not affected.</P>
    <P>In relation to the nursing area a number of initiatives have been taken or are being progressed with a view to improving the situation. These include new arrangements to give better starting pay to nurses taking up employment by giving full recognition for previous experience at home and abroad; a significantly improved regime of allowances in respect of nurses working in specialised areas has been introduced; standardised overtime working arrangements have been introduced; the promotional structure within nursing, including the introduction of a clinical career pathway, is being significantly improved on foot of the recommendations of the Commission on Nursing; agreement has been reached between the relevant Government Departments on a procedure for fast-tracking immigration clearances and work permits for non-EU nurses; the number of training places is being increased to 300 over last year and the maintenance grant for student nurses has been increased to £3,325 with effect from 1 April 2000; and swift progress is being made on the implementation of the agenda for change mapped out by the Commission on Nursing. A priority action plan was agreed with the Nursing Alliance as part of the settlement of the nurses' strike. Additional funding of £10 million has been provided this year for initiatives in the action plan.</P>
    <P>These initiatives represent a very significant effort to improve the situation. In the longer term, it is hoped that the substantial increase in the number of student places will provide enough registered nurses to fill vacancies.</P>

      <P>My Department's capital programme, which was recently incorporated in the National Development Plan 2000-2006, will allow unprecedented development of all areas of the health service infrastructure, including the acute hospital care programme. This is the first time that a national development plan, NDP, has included the health services to any significant extent. The total £2 billion provided under the NDP for the years 2000-06 represents almost a trebling of capital investment compared to the previous seven year period. This sum is expressed at 1999 prices and it is expected that it will be subject to inflation over the life of the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant progress has taken place in recent times in relation to capital developments in the acute hospital sector. These include the opening of a new hospital at Tallaght and the completion <Col N="874" /> of major developments at St. Lukes/Anne's, Limerick Regional Hospital, phases I and II, and UCHG, phase I.</P>
    <P>Major building programmes are currently under way or expected to commence in the near future at a number of sites, including Mayo General Hospital, phase II, St. Joseph's Hospital Clonmel, St. James's Hospital, phase IH, UCHG, phase II, Naas, phase II, Ennis General Hospital, and Cork University Hospital. In addition, a number of major acute hospital projects are expected to materialise under the plan including new developments at St. Vincent's, Elm Park; the Mater Hospital; James Connolly Memorial Hospital; Portlaoise, Tullamore, Cashel, etc.</P>
    <P>The investment being made in acute hospitals under the national development plan will ensure a new level of facilities for patients and hospital staff alike. This will range from new facilities to major upgradings, including where appropriate re-equipping and refurbishment programmes. All health boards will receive major investment for acute hospitals within their areas, including works for backlog of maintenance, fire precautions and health and safety.</P>
    <P>In planning for the NDP for the acute hospital sector, I have placed particular emphasis on more efficient integration of services to underpin, for example, the report of the waiting list review, the national cancer strategy, and the report of the cardiovascular strategy group.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on Private Health Insurance, published in September 1999, addressed the particular issue raised by the Deputy. It outlined proposals in relation to the introduction of lifetime community rating which will address the shortcoming in the existing system as regards the provision of first time cover by insurers to persons of or over the age of 65. The existing open enrolment provisions will be extended to such persons who could previously be refused cover if they were entering private health insurance for the first time or their previous cover had lapsed for a material period. The Government have approved legislation, the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2000, which will include provision for this measure, together with others addressed in the White Paper. Arrangements are being made for the immediate publication of the Bill.</P>

      <Quest>if a person with a medical card can call out a bureau doctor at night if his own doctor is unavailable; if a doctor pays for a bureau doctor or suffers any reduction in his payments; the reason a general practitioner should be critical of or discourage a person from calling out a bureau doctor; the procedures involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the GMS scheme, contracting doctors are required to work a certain number of hours and to be available at other times in instances where their patients have emergency needs. Clearly, particular doctors cannot be available at all times and the issue of providing appropriate cover for their patients therefore arises, especially in so-called out of hours situations, that is late at night, weekends, public holidays etc.</P>
      <P>Throughout most of the country, the provision of such cover has traditionally been provided through rota arrangements operated by doctors and encouraged by health boards. In the Dublin and surrounding areas, there are also certain localised rota arrangements in place in certain locations but in other areas of the capital region, GPs have tended to use a bureau service or doctor on-call service. The latter two arrangements involve the participating GPs concerned in paying a certain fee to the commercial service operators to provide cover facilities. In all cases, rota arrangements and bureau and on-call services are private arrangements organised and operated to allow doctors meet their obligations to their patients, both private and public, when they are themselves unavailable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A medical card holder is fully entitled to contact his or her GP at whatever time a medical need arises although it may be that at that time the doctor concerned is unavailable. In such a situation, the doctor should ensure that the patient is directed to his or her covering service. This could be done, for example, through an answer-<Col N="877" /> machine message. If patients are unhappy with the cover services provided by their GP they should raise the matter with him or her or with the primary care unit of their local health board. Equally, it is not acceptable for a GP to attempt generally to dissuade his or her patients from accessing eligible services at any time they are required. If this is happening the matter should be brought to the attention of the primary care unit of the relevant health board.</P>
    <P>The GP providing the cover, whether by rota or otherwise, for the medical card patients of the unavailable doctor is not entitled to charge the patient for eligible services provided. The patient should refer the matter immediately to his or her health board where a request for payment is made in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>The entire matter of out of hours general practice service availability is receiving considerable attention in my Department with a view to developing more structured arrangements that best serve patient interests. In the Dublin area, DUBDOC is already in operation from the campus of St James' Hospital and there are plans to develop other similar type GP out of hours arrangements in other parts of the region. Further, CAREDOC, an out of hours GP co-operative, has been launched in the South Eastern Health Board area while a region-wide version of the out of hours co-op model will be commenced in early August throughout the North Eastern Health Board area.</P>

      <Quest>the situation with regard to the right of a patient, being the holder of a medical card, to be referred to a consultant; if there is such a right; and the way in which a patient can seek or demand a higher opinion if being refused by her general practitioner.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The GMS scheme provides medical card holders with a wide-ranging treatment and curative based health care service and medical card holders enjoy full entitlement to be referred to a consultant. Patients, whether public or private, are in the normal way referred to consultants by their general practitioners exercising his or her clinical judgment as to whether such a referral is necessary or desirable having regard to the individual's medical needs. The question of a right to be referred must therefore be understood in that context. Accordingly, there is not, nor can there be, an absolute right to be referred on the basis of the patient's own wishes. The matter is one of clinical judgment.</P>
      <P>As in all cases where a patient is unhappy with the clinical decision made by his or her general practitioner, the patient may seek another opinion. A private patient would be put to the expense of obtaining such an opinion whereas a medical card holder need only exercise his or her right to choose another doctor under the terms of the scheme.</P>

      <P>The number of new cases of HIV reported to my Department by the virus reference laboratory has been increasing each year since 1994. In 1999 there were 209 new cases reported, representing the highest number of cases in any year apart from the cumulative figure of 363 for all cases up to the first year of reporting in 1985. A European AIDS surveillance system has been in place since 1984. The most recent report for 1998 shows Ireland had one of the lowest incidence rates of AIDS &ndash; 3.6 cases per million population &ndash; compared to countries like Spain which had an incidence of 93.3 cases per million population. The UK had 14 cases per million population.</P>
      <P>A European HIV surveillance system is being developed. At present the European prevalence database contains aggregated data on HIV prevalence in various populations, for example, pregnant women and blood donors, which represent populations at low risk of HIV infection. The most recent figures available &ndash; 1997 &ndash; show that prevalence was less than one per 100,000 in this group, which was similar to Norway, Sweden and Denmark, compared to a rate of one to less than four cases per 100,000 in England, France, Italy and Germany, with four or more cases per 100,000 in Spain and Portugal.</P>
      <P>Europe is moving to a standardised HIV case-based reporting system, which will include drug misuse and other risk activities and which will give a more comprehensive epidemiological profile of the incidence and prevalence of HIV in total populations.</P>

      <P>The most recent available figures for reported deaths from AIDS are for 1999. They show that 17 people died. Deaths from AIDS have been plateauing in the developed world because of the availability of highly active anti-retroviral treatment, which is administered to people who are HIV positive or who have AIDS. This treatment is delaying and even halting the onset of the acute symptoms of AIDS and is allowing people with HIV to live longer, healthier lives. The cumulative total reported deaths from AIDS since <Col N="879" /> reporting began is 349 reported cases and the <Col N="880" /> number of deaths each year are detailed as follows:</P>

      <P>The moneys held by health boards in dormant accounts are in respect of patients who have died intestate and for whom no next-of-kin can be traced. By virtue of section 73 of the Succession Act, 1965, the estates of such persons must revert to the State as ultimate successor. They are not the property of the health boards and the health boards do not have any discretion in the matter. These estates are lodged in the Escheated Estates Fund which is administered by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor. Over the past two years substantial amounts have been lodged by health boards to this fund.</P>
      <P>The Chief State Solicitor has written to each health board with a view to establishing a standard procedure whereby a list of the amount of intestate moneys held by each board be forwarded to his office each year and arrangements made for the timely transfer of funds to the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The staffing requirements of hospitals and the deployment of staff within hospitals is a matter for local management having regard to the services which hospitals are expected to provide. There are particular staffing difficulties being faced by the health services at present across a wide range of areas, particularly in the medical, paramedical and nursing areas.</P>
      <P>Action is being taken on a number of fronts to address these difficulties. However, in relation to the medical staffing of hospitals, the issues are currently being addressed by the Medical Manpower Forum. With particular regard to non-consultant hospital doctors, the forum is seeking to redress the imbalance between career posts and training posts, the need to improve postgraduate medical training to keep more Irish medical graduates in the country and the need to look at the position of women in medicine in Ireland with a view to redressing the number who leave medicine. The Medical Manpower Forum is due to publish its first report shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Difficulties in the medical staffing of anaesthetics from 1 July 2000 concern the shortage of junior hospital doctors. In that regard health service employers and the Health Service Employers Agency are continuing to monitor the take-up of employment offers made to non-consultant hospital doctors &ndash; NCHDs &ndash; for 1 July 2000. The situation is likely to remain fluid until then as an NCHD may have an offer of employment from more than one hospital. Accordingly, I am not at this time in a position to give a precise figure of the number of vacant posts on 1 July other than to say that about 27 junior hospital <Col N="881" /> doctor posts in anaesthetics remain unfilled as of Tuesday, 27 June. I expect further positions to be filled up to and after 1 July. Hospitals are exploring different options in an effort to ensure that essential posts are filled. In the event that some posts remain unfilled, hospitals will be asked to ensure that essential and critical services are not affected. With the full co-operation from all concerned, and a commitment to making the best use of available resources, the effect on services can be minimised.</P>
    <P>As I said, while the primary responsibility for the staffing of hospitals rests with hospital management, I am seeking the co-operation of the Opposition in amending the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, to extend the period of temporary registration for NCHDs from five years to seven years. This will remove an obstacle for some NCHDs and allow them to remain and work in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware I have already announced my intention to hold an inquiry into post-mortem examination policy, practice and procedure in the State since 1970. The inquiry will be conducted in two phases and I have appointed Ms Anne Dunne, senior counse,l to head up the first phase of the inquiry. On completion of the first stage of the inquiry, a report will be made available to me. On receipt of this report I will then table a motion that the report be presented to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children. The committee, on considering the report, will come to its own conclusions having regard to the terms of reference of the inquiry, holding a public hearing and calling witnesses as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The organisation Parents for Justice has expressed some concern in relation to the terms of reference for the inquiry. The group's main concern is that the terms of reference do not specifically require the inquiry to publicly name persons whom the inquiry might regard to be culpable in any way for any wrong doing which may have occurred. The legal advice available to me is that the terms of reference should not contain a specific reference in this regard and in any event such a reference would not be in accordance with the principles of natural justice. However, it should be noted that the absence of such a term of reference does not preclude the inquiry from specifying in its report whatever detail it deems necessary. Following previous <Col N="882" /> consultations with Parents for Justice the terms of reference were amended by the inclusion of the word &ldquo;findings&rdquo; in the fifth paragraph to ensure that the inquiry would provide a comprehensive report which would not merely confine itself to conclusions, opinions or recommendations. In addition, I arranged for the group's legal advisers to meet with the Attorney General to discuss this issue and I understand that these discussions are ongoing. I consider it important that these discussions ensure a full and complete understanding and appreciation of the views of all concerned.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that an inquiry of this nature takes time to establish in terms of putting in place the necessary facilities and acquiring the appropriate resources for it to function properly. Officials in my Department have identified the legal, medical and administrative support required by the inquiry and this is currently being arranged. Also my Department is working with the Office of Public Works to secure appropriate accommodation as soon as possible. The Deputy can be assured that arrangements are being made so that all necessary support is available to the inquiry to commence its important work at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>Since 1 July 1999, a common list of reimbursable medicines was introduced for the GMS scheme and community drugs schemes. In order for any medicine to be included in the common list, it must comply with a published list of criteria. These range from the uses for and licensing of medicines to the pricing of products. The criteria stipulate, <i>inter alia,</i> that the product should be the subject of a product authorisation and may be used under the supervision of a general medical practitioner and not restricted to hospital or medical specialist use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The product to which the Deputy refers does not have a product authorisation in Ireland. While my Department recognises that in certain exceptional circumstances the supply of unauthorised medicinal products will be necessary and a protocol has been drawn up for the <Col N="883" /> supply of these products, the manner of administration of wasp venom immuno-therapy is such that it requires administration in a hospital or in a specialist clinic associated with a hospital in view of the importance of patient monitoring following its administration. Since it has always been the normal practice that medicinal products administered in such a hospital or clinic are supplied by that hospital or clinic, it is considered inappropriate to include this product as a reimbursable medicinal product in any of the community-based schemes.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for the reimbursement or supply of specialised medicinal products, which are ordinarily hospital-specialist clinic-based products, are under consideration by my Department at present. The arrangements for the reimbursement or supply of this product will be considered in the light of the overall examination.</P>

      <P>The disabled person's grant scheme is administered by local authorities in accordance with the legal framework laid down in section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979, and statutory regulations made under that Act.

Grants are funded initially at local authority level from the authorities' own resources within the amounts included for that purpose in the local authorities' own estimates of expenditure. My Department then recoups two-thirds of the amount of the grant paid by the local authority. My Department sets overall expenditure limits for a number of schemes combined &ndash; disabled persons' grants, essential repairs grants and house improvement loans &ndash; in the form of capital spending allocations that are based on estimates of demand for the schemes provided by the authorities. It is, of course, open to housing authorities to seek a higher allocation in the event of increased demand under the scheme.</P>

      <P>The directive confers discretion on member states as to the waters to be designated and their designation as salmonid or as cyprinid waters. The 34 waters designated as salmonid waters by the 1988 regulations provide a good geographical spread and comprise a representative selection of such waters. They do not comprise a comprehensive inventory of salmonid and cyprinid waters given that virtually all waters in Ireland are potentially capable of supporting salmonid or cyprinid fish species.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The town renewal scheme is a tax incentive rather than a grants based scheme. Town renewal plans have been submitted by Galway County Council in relation to Portumna, Loughrea, Ballygar, Headford and Clifden. The expert advisory panel is now in the process of examining the town renewal plans submitted by the various county councils. The panel will make recommendations to me as to the areas to be designated and the incentives to be applied. Subject to the agreement of the Minister for Finance, I will then announce the designations and I expect to be in a position to do this next month.</P>
      <P>Under the guidelines for the scheme a total of 233 towns were identified as being eligible and in accordance with a selection formula based on the numbers of towns in each county a maximum limit of towns for which town renewal plans could be submitted was set. Applying this formula resulted in a total of 102 towns for which plans could be submitted; selection of these towns was a matter for each county council.</P>
      <P>This initial phase of the scheme will be of three years duration. It is envisaged extending the scheme to further eligible towns in later phases of the scheme. However, my priority now is to ensure the successful implementation of this initial phase following the announcement of designations next month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, to assist tenants purchase their homes a discount of 3% of the value of the house is allowed for each year of tenancy, up to a maximum of 30%. In addition to this, a further discount of £3,000 is made equivalent to the new house grant for first-time purchasers. Thus, a local authority house with a market value of £75,000, would be available for purchase by a tenant of ten or more years standing at £49,500, with the price fixed for up to 12 months. By any account, this is a generous discount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proceeds of the sale of local authority houses to tenants are used to part fund the local authority housing programme. I consider the terms of the current scheme strike a reasonable balance between the aspirations of existing tenants to own their own homes and the needs of those on the local authority waiting lists. I have no proposals at present to amend the terms of the <Col N="889" /> current scheme. However, my Department will continue to keep them under review and the Deputy's suggestions will be borne in mind in this context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing compulsory purchase process provides safeguards for those from whom local authorities are acquiring land compulsorily. If objections are made to the Minister by owners, lessees and occupiers, not being tenants for a month or less of the lands and the objections do not relate solely to matters affecting compensation, the Minister, unless he decides to annul the order, must arrange for the holding of a public local inquiry into the objections. Before deciding whether to confirm the order he must consider the objections made and the report of the person who held the inquiry. Where the order is confirmed it may be challenged in the courts.</P>
      <P>Compensation is payable by local authorities for land acquired by them on the authorisation of a duly confirmed compulsory order. This is a matter for negotiation between the local authority and the property owners concerned. In the event of dispute either party has recourse to the land reference committee for the appointment of an official property arbitrator to determine the case.</P>
      <P>The Planning and Development Bill, 1999, which has passed all Stages in the Houses of the Oireachtas, will transfer the Minister's functions to An Bord Pleanála and bring about other changes designed to streamline the compulsory purchase order process. These include provision for less formal oral hearings in place of the more formal public local inquiries, the confirmation of compulsory purchase orders by local authorities themselves where there are no objections, time limits on submitting compulsory purchase orders to the board for confirmation, an 18 week objective for making decisions on compulsory purchase orders and shortening the period within which local authorities must serve notice to treat to purchase the land from three years to 18 months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 205 and 206 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 2000 budget provided for the largest ever investment in the child benefit scheme, amounting to some £35 million in 2000 and £106 million in a full year. The commitment of such significant funding to the scheme will enable the rates of child benefit to be increased by £8 per month in respect of the first two qualified children and by £10 per month in respect of the third and sub<Col N="892" /> sequent qualified children, bringing the rates to £42.50 and £56.00 respectively. These increases will take effect from September of this year.</P>
    <P>In devising the parameters of the budget 2000 package, account was taken of the overall level of resources available, the range of competing priorities and the need to target resources to those in greatest need.</P>
    <P>In this regard, it should be noted some 40% of children are in families who are in receipt of weekly social welfare payments. These families face the highest risks of poverty and I was pleased, therefore, to be able to provide for the general increases in the rates of weekly social welfare payments to take effect from the first week of May 2000, four weeks earlier than last year. Indeed, since this Government has taken office, increases in weekly social welfare rates have been brought forward by six weeks from mid-June to the beginning of May. Next year, I intend to bring forward the implementation date for these social welfare increases further to coincide with the start of the tax year in early April 2001.</P>
    <P>It is also my intention that the value of the child benefit scheme as an effective mechanism for channelling child income support will continue to be exploited to the greatest possible extent. In this regard, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness includes a commitment that child benefit will be substantially increased over the period of the programme, with a priority focus towards £100 per month for the third and subsequent children.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if he has reconsidered his decision not to seek compensation for social welfare recipients in view of the likely falling value of social welfare rates in 2000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[18786/00]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 28 and 29 on 30 May 2000.</P>
      <P>Last December's budget provided for general increases of £4 for people under 66 and £7 increase for pensioners. The £7 increase for pensioners represents an increase ranging between 7.9% and 8.9%, while the £4 general increase represents an increase ranging between 5.2% and 5.6%.</P>
      <P>Social welfare rates have improved significantly in real terms since this Government took up office. Over our three budgets to date we have, for example, increased the old age contributory pension by £18 per week, a 14% real increase, as compared to £7 per week &ndash; a 4% real increase in the same payment over the three budgets introduced by the rainbow coalition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the normal way when setting the revised rates of social welfare payments at budget time each year, full account is taken of actual inflation <Col N="893" /> up to that date as well as the most up to date inflation projection for the following year. This approach ensures that any unexpected deterioration is fully compensated for and real improvements are assured. Furthermore the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides that over the period up to 2003, all rates of social welfare will be increased in real terms and substantial progress will be made towards a target of £100 a week for the lower rates of payment. For families, substantial progress will be made towards a target child benefit rate of £100 per month for the third and subsequent child.</P>
    <P>The significant social welfare improvements which we have already made amount to almost £1 billion since we came into office. These together with the further improvements to which we are committed over the coming years demonstrate our guarantee that everyone will share in the benefits of social and economic progress.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 212, 219 and 222 together.</P>
      <P>The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No 2) Act, 1978, provides the statutory scheme for the acquisition of the fee simple by the owners of dwelling houses. The scheme, at low cost, is operated by the Land Registry and the purchase price in most cases at present is about 15 times the ground rent. The Act contains provision for the determination of applications for the purchase of the fee simple in cases where the consent of all the necessary parties is not forthcoming. In such cases the Registrar of Titles will determine the application by arbitration. The Act also makes provision for the circumstance that the ground rent landlord cannot be found. There is also no obstacle to a tenant negotiating directly with the owner of the ground rent for its purchase without reference to the (No. 2) Act.</P>
      <P>Proposals which have been put forward on various occasions, that on an appointed day the ground rent tenant's interest would be enlarged into a fee simple and that he or she would be compelled to buy out the interest, have been the subject of examination in consultation with the Attorney General. However, those changes to the methods of purchasing ground rent raise constitutional, technical and practical difficulties of a kind which cannot be easily overcome. If and when those difficulties can be met in a way that would substantially improve on the already good and reasonable system that exists for the purchase of ground rent, the necessary legislative details will be announced in the normal way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, that GHB &ndash; Gamma Hydroxybutyrate &ndash; was developed as an anaesthetic drug and used as a licensed drug in some member states of the European Union. In Ireland it is controlled under the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Regulations, 1993, and, therefore, a person may only be in possession of it when it is prescribed by a medical practitioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="896" /> I am further informed by the Minister for Health and Children that there is little evidence of its misuse in any member state of the European Union, including Ireland. It is a depressant-hypnotic drug and its effects are similar to those produced by alcohol and cannabis. It has been abused by bodybuilders because of its anabolic properties. There is anecdotal evidence at a European level that GHB has the potential for being used for date rape, but there is no firm evidence to substantiate this.</P>
    <P>As there have been four deaths in the UK and two in Sweden from abuse of GHB between September 1995 and January 1999, Europol and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction &ndash; EMCDDA &ndash; are examining this drug. The scientific committee of the EMCDDA, chaired by Dr. Desmond Corringan, head of the school of pharmacy in Trinity College, will carry out a risk assessment on the drug in the coming months to decide, at a European level, whether further controls are needed on its use. This assessment will include an investigation in each member state of the availability and use of the drug. Based on the outcome of the risk assessment, decisions will be made at a European level on whether stricter controls should be placed on GHB.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there is no evidence of the widespread availability of GHB in Ireland and there is no evidence that drug rape has increased due to it use.</P>
    <P>I am further informed that no seizures have been made in Ireland to date, although several seizures have been made in the United Kingdom.</P>

      <P>The Government is aware of the need to support the development of child care service provision and identified child care as a priority area for investment in the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. The plan provides £250 million to my Department's equal opportunities child care programme to invest in the development of child care service provision. The objectives of the programme are to maintain and increase the number of child care facilities, increase the number of child care places and improve the quality of child care services in Ireland. Funding will be provided under the following initiatives: capital grants for community groups and not-for-profit organisations for the establishment, maintenance, renovation or upgrading of child care facilities; staffing grants to support staffing costs for community based child care facilities; for the first time, capital grants for self-employed child care providers catering for not more than 20 children at any one time, to build, renovate or upgrade child care facilities; grants towards the development of local child care networks; grants to enhance the services of the national voluntary child care organisations; grants to encourage and promote local child care training models that assist in the enhancement of quality child care provision; and innovative projects identified over the course of the national development plan.</P>
      <P>On 28 April I launched the capital and staffing grant measures. They were also advertised during the same week in the national and provincial newspapers. My Department has received over 3,500 requests for application forms for these measures since their launch.</P>
      <P>I intend that applications will be processed as quickly as possible so that funding can be administered to qualified projects without undue delay. To this end my Department will ensure that the appraisal committee, which will make recommendations on grant approval, will meet on a monthly basis for the rest of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the measures announced will make a real difference to the future of child care in Ireland by maintaining and increasing the number of child care places and improving the quality <Col N="898" /> of child care services. The range of these measures will ensure that the supply of quality child care will be increased, particularly in disadvantaged areas, and that these facilities will benefit from staffing supports for qualified child care workers.</P>
    <P>I am also conscious of the need to ensure that those with child care budget lines work together to ensure an integrated approach to the future development of child care using our resources most effectively. My Department is leading the co-ordination of child care service delivery over the course of the national development plan which involves the establishment of structures at national and local levels involving the key stakeholders including: an interdepartmental committee, chaired by my Department, to focus on co-operation and co-ordination between Government Departments and State agencies with a role in child care to facilitate the development of policy at an interdepartmental level and at the level of implementation; and a national co-ordinating child care committee, chaired by my Department, to oversee the development of an integrated child care infrastructure throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children has taken on the role of vice-chair in the committees at national level.</P>
    <P>The co-ordinating structures also include county child care committees whose role will be  identification of local &ldquo;black spots&rdquo; and priority objectives for the county in the provision of child care and to put forward proposals for alleviating the position; development of a local child care information strategy; development of quality statements and targets for the county; liaison with my Department and the national co-ordinating child care committee regarding local developments; development of local networks of child care providers; assessing needs; and proposing initiatives specific to that county.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that the local structures will provide a means for effective planning and targeting of resources where they are most needed. Membership of the committee will comprise local child care representatives of the statutory and non-statutory sector.</P>
    <P>The establishment of county child care committees will be facilitated by the relevant health boards. These committees will operate under guidelines which are currently being developed by the national co-ordinating child care committee.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the new structures will provide a forum for consultation and the sharing of expertise which will benefit the future development of the child care sector.</P>
    <P>My Department has availed of EU funding to develop a national census of group based child care facilities. The development of the census is a first step in developing a comprehensive database of child care facilities in Ireland which will provide assistance in monitoring the provision of child care services.</P>
    <P>I would also like to draw the Deputy's attention to yesterday's announcement by the Govern<Col N="899" /> ment in relation to an anti-inflationary package to counter inflation and protect living standards.  The package provides an additional £40 million over and above the £250 million in the national development plan to the development of child care. The additional funding will be allocated over the coming weeks following further consultation with the social partners, as provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness &ndash; PPF.</P>

      <Quest>if, further to parliamentary Question No. 85 of 6 May 1999 in which he stated that it is intended that the group will furnish its report for consideration by the Minister for Finance prior to the summer recess, he will now inform Dáil Éireann when this group will furnish its report to him; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>An interdepartmental review group, chaired by an official from my Department, is currently examining the reliefs available under the disabled drivers and disabled passengers &ndash; tax concessions &ndash; scheme. The scheme provides reliefs from vehicle registration tax and value added tax on vehicles and from excise duty on fuel to drivers and passengers who are severely and permanently physically disabled.</P>
      <P>In order that it would benefit from as full a range as possible of experience of the scheme the review group were asked to hold more extensive consultations than originally envisaged and this involved the placing of advertisements in the national newspapers seeking written submissions from members of the public concerning the scheme. To date, 240 persons have responded to the advertisements, reflecting over 60 different disabilities.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the level of response from the public to its request for submissions, the review group anticipates that the report will be completed in August 2000.</P>
      <P>The members of the group have held detailed meetings with representatives of various organisations and with a number of persons, who had indicated a desire to make oral submissions to them.</P>
      <P>The insights obtained from an analysis of the oral and written submissions, when added to the knowledge already gained from the submissions which it received from members of the public and from public representatives, will facilitate the group in bringing its work to a conclusion and in finalising its report for consideration by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the process has been somewhat delayed by the extensive consultation that has taken place, I am satisfied that due to the complex nature of the issues it was important to hold this <Col N="900" /> wide consultation phase to ensure that all people with disabilities and interested parties had an opportunity to contribute to the review.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that local gardaí have identified a particular group of young males as the cause of ongoing problems. I understand that local gardaí have targeted this group, and since 1 January 2000, 40 arrests have been made, mostly under the Public Order Act. Initially, these youths were dealt with by way of the juvenile diversion scheme, but they are now being dealt with by way of charge.</P>
      <P>I also understand that a file is currently with the DPP regarding a number of individuals in this group in relation to an assault committed in the estate.</P>
      <P>I have also been informed that extra patrols have been put in place in the estate and that a beat is also performed in St. Anne's Estate from 7 p.m. to midnight.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that this application refers to a transmission on death which was lodged in the Land Registry on 28 April 2000.</P>
      <P>Due to the current buoyancy of the property market, there has been an 85% increase in the intake of dealings into the Dublin section of the Land Registry for the period January to April 2000 as against the same period last year. As a result, there is, at present, a waiting time of approximately 19 weeks for processing such applications.</P>
      <P>I am well aware of the problems which have arisen in the Land Registry over a period of time due to the increase in applications for Land Registry transactions caused by the current economic climate and the buoyancy of the property market. I assure the Deputy that I have taken steps to address these problems by recruiting and training extra staff and by allocating added resources which I am confident will improve the service in time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Traditional definitions of illiteracy, as an absolute, are generally not found useful by researchers. Most recently, researchers have adopted various measures of functional literacy to determine the number of people with serious literacy problems. My Department does not have evidence to suggest that the number of those with serious literacy difficulties has increased over the last ten to 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1990-91 the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement conducted a reading literacy study in 32 educational systems throughout the world. Irish nine year olds and 14 year olds participated in the study. Both Irish populations scored just above their <Col N="905" /> respective international averages. Further analysis of the data from this study by the Educational Research Centre &ndash; ERC &ndash; Drumcondra, indicated that between 6.5% to 8.5% of Irish 14 year olds had serious literacy difficulties.</P>
    <P>National surveys of reading in primary schools were carried out in 1972, 1980, 1988, 1993 and 1998 by Department of Education and Science inspectors in co-operation with the ERC. Significant progress in pupils reading achievement was recorded between 1972 and 1980. The most recent survey of reading achievement of pupils in fifth class in 1998 indicated that there has been no significant change in reading standards over the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>There is an estimate from the 1993 survey that between 6.5% to 9.5% of Irish 11 year old pupils have serious literacy difficulties.</P>
    <P>In relation to adults, the 1997 Report of the OECD International Adult Literacy Survey showed that some 25% of Irish adults scored at the bottom literacy level, performing at best tasks which required the reader to locate a simple piece of information in a text, with no distracting information. The survey clearly showed lower levels of literacy among the older age groups, with, for instance, 17% of adults in the 16-25 age group scoring at the bottom literacy level on the document scale compared to 44.1% at this level among adults aged 56 to 65, suggesting that literacy levels have improved in line with general increases in educational attainment levels. While additional countries have participated in the OECD survey in more recent years, a follow up study has not been undertaken.</P>

      <P>In his national surveys of entry to higher education compiled on behalf of the Higher Education Authority, Professor Patrick Clancy assesses county participation rates. The latest figures available are set out in Professor Clancy's 1995 report, Access to College: Patterns of Continuity and Change. The 1995 report is based on a national survey of entrants to full-time higher education in autumn 1992. This report also contains comparative data from the earlier reports undertaken by Professor Clancy based on surveys in 1980 and 1986. I am arranging for a copy of the relevant extract from Professor Clancy's 1995 report to be furnished to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="906" /> Professor Clancy and Joy Wall are currently analysing the pattern of participation based on entrants to higher education in 1998.

      <P>The Higher Education Authority maintains a continuous review of the demand and need for higher education. It does this through dialogue with institutions and other State agencies; involvement in studies such as those done by the expert group on future skills needs and the implementation of decisions arising from them; and commissioning of studies in specific areas, for example, pharmacy education. It maintains detailed statistics of student enrolment and publishes a yearly survey of first destinations of graduates. Arising from the de Buitléir report, it is also formally requested to regularly review Irish participation in higher education against participation rates in other developed countries.</P>
      <P>In response to the first report of the expert group on future skills needs, that is, the Horn report, an investment programme of £75 million was put in place in order to provide additional computing and engineering places.</P>

      <Quest>the capital cost and the annual cost of putting in place extra third level places in a range of science, technology and engineering courses at university level and at institute of technology level; and the number of places in each course needed to generate an annual extra graduate in that course.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The capital cost of providing a place in the disciplines alluded to by the Deputy is based on the amount of space required per place and the unit cost of providing that place. The cost of providing the required space is made up of: construction costs, professional fees and the furnishing and equipping of buildings. Construction costs will vary depending on the complexity of the building and the level of services required for the field of study to be accommodated. Final actual cost can only be determined by reference to tender prices.</P>
      <P>In the university sector, the Higher Education Authority has advised that the average unit cost in 1997-98 was £5,140 in science and £5,564 in engineering. This unit cost represents the full cost of a place on an undergraduate degree programme in these subject areas. The average duration of a degree course in these disciplines is four years.</P>
      <P>Unit cost data for science, technology and engineering is not available in the institute of technology sector. A unit cost system of allocating funds to institutes of technology has not yet been developed. However, my Department has initiated a review with a view to preparing proposals for the allocation of current funding to the institutes of technology based on the concept of unit costs or an alternative suitable formula-based system.</P>
      <P>The number of third level places required is a multiple of the number of annual graduates required and depends on factors such as the length of the course and the student completion rates. The first report of the expert skills group identified a need for 2,800 university places to provide an additional 900 professional technology graduates and 2,600 institute of technology places to provide 1,300 technicians each year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>In-service training for the introduction of science at primary level will be provided in the context of the primary curriculum support programme. The programme, which commenced in the current school year, is due to run for four to five years during which period subject-specific training will be provided in each of the curriculum subjects and schools will also be afforded time and support in relation to planning for implementation of the revised curriculum in the classroom. Planning of the programme itself is kept under continual review and is informed by experience and by feedback from the partners in education. The estimates of costs given below are therefore based on assumptions which are liable to change.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost of the overall programme is £4.2 million per annum over four to five years. Of this it is estimated that a minimum of £1.7 million in total will be spent on training for the introduction of science. Included in this figure are travel and subsistence costs for participants estimated at a minimum of £0.7 million. There are no substitution costs for participants as the schools are closed for training. This leaves a balance of £1 million for other course provision costs in the science area.</P>
      <P>In relation to leaving certificate physics and chemistry at second level, the inservice training and support programme for these subjects commenced in 1999 and is due to continue to the end of the school year 2001-02. The total estimated cost for the three years is £5 million. Of this the estimated cost of participants travel and subsistence is £0.2 million and of participants' substitution is £1 million. This leaves a balance of £3.8 million for other course provision costs.</P>

      <P>While my Department has lists of equipment for science, school authorities, with the approval of my Department, may make substitutions. Under public procurement procedures it is necessary that all items of equipment being purchased be tendered for, thus ensuring competitiveness in the market place. It is the responsibility of each school authority to seek tenders for the supply of the equipment. Consequently, it is not possible to give an actual definitive cost per item of equipment.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that despite the increase in the number of pupils attending Scoil Ursula national school, Strandhill Road, County Sligo, his Department has refused to sanction the current complement of teachers for the coming school year in view of the fact that the school is to lose one teacher; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware the staffing of primary schools is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between this Department and the education partners.</P>
      <P>The enrolment at Scoil Ursula has decreased from 363 pupils on 30 September 1998 to 346 pupils on 30 September 1999. This latter enrolment entitles the school to a principal and 12 mainstream class teachers for the 2000-01 school year. An enrolment of 360 pupils was required in order to retain the existing staffing levels and I regret, therefore, that the retention of the 13 mainstream class post cannot be sanctioned for the 2000-01 school year.</P>

      <P>ACELS &ndash; the Advisory Council for English Language Schools &ndash; was reconstituted in 1995 to regulate the teaching of English as a foreign language &ndash; TEFL &ndash; industry in Ireland. It operates under the aegis of my Department. As <Col N="916" /> well as the Department of Education and Science, the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Foreign Affairs are represented on its board. Bord Fáilte, Dublin Tourism, MEI-RELSA &ndash; Marketing English in Ireland &ndash; the Recognised English Language Schools Association &ndash; and FELT &ndash; the Federation of English Teachers &ndash; and Enterprise Ireland are also represented on the board. ACELS runs an inspection system for schools affiliated to it. The list of recognised schools is then ratified by my Department. I will forward the current list to the Deputy in the next few days.</P>
      <P>RELSA is the association which represents the industry, that is, the owners of TEFL schools. FELT represents the teachers. There is another association, ATT &ndash; Association for Teacher Training &ndash; which exists outside the operation of ACELS.</P>
      <P>There is no obligation on schools to belong to ACELS. However, affiliation to ACELS is the only means by which schools can gain the official recognition of my Department. This recognition is of such importance for marketing reasons that most schools belong to ACELS.</P>
