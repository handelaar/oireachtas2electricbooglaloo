      <P>On that issue, Deputy Lawlor is a Fianna Fáil representative, appointed by that party to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, which is the committee of the House responsible for ethics legislation. He is also the Fianna Fáil nominee and sits as vice-chairman of that committee, drawing a significant emolument which is not open to other Members who are not fortunate enough to be vice-chairpersons of committees.</P>
      <P>I and Fine Gael do not think he is a suitable person to be vice-chairman of this committee, notwithstanding the fact that he was nominated by Fianna Fáil. He should be removed and Fine Gael has tabled a motion of no confidence in him as vice-chairman of the committee because of his evident inability or unwillingness to co-operate adequately with a tribunal established by the House. Why has the Taoiseach allowed him to continue, with Fianna Fáil support, as vice-chairman of this committee? Will the Taoiseach agree with the Fine Gael motion at this late stage to have him removed as vice-chairman? He does not represent the House in the work that committee must do in matters such as ethics but also in general.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>On a separate but related matter, sadly, why did the Taoiseach, in response to a request I made yesterday, choose not to bring forward a motion today on this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton is correct that Deputy Lawlor was appointed in the first instance as a Fianna Fáil Member. Now, of course, he acts as an Independent Member. I understand he did not resign and no effort was made to remove him. Obviously that has changed and the position must be considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the second matter, I indicated that I would check the ramifications and that I had no difficulty with the wording. All the advice yesterday was that it would not be advisable for us to take that action. We also received that communication from the Chair. This applies on a number of counts. First, Standing Order 56 applies to this and, second, the view is that this would not be helpful to the work of the Flood tribunal. Under Standing Order 56 the matter would be raised in an overt attempt so that it appears to be an attempt by the Oireachtas to encroach on the function of the courts or a judicial tribunal. The advice is that the tribunal is not having difficulty in this matter.</P>
      <P>On the political point, regarding not getting involved, as I do not want to and have been strongly advised not to &ndash; which the Ceann Comhairle has also done, though that is separate from the advice I got &ndash; I reiterate the contents of the joint statement of 11 October, which we all agreed to and signed. I would not be breaching any of the advice I got by restating that. The Flood tribunal was established by the unanimous will of the Members of this House, and every citizen, and even more so, every Member of the Oireachtas, owes a legal, moral and democratic duty to co-operate with the tribunal, not to obstruct it and to comply with its lawful orders. We would expect any citizen and any Member of the Oireachtas who disputed the validity or legality of that tribunal order to make his or her case to the tribunal and if necessary to the courts. I was advised I should not go any further than saying that because it would be deemed to be interference. Reiterating that statement does not constitute interference, but just in case it is interpreted as interference, I do not mean it to interfere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that it is all very fine to read out stuff like that, but if he cannot make a decision as to whether Deputy Lawlor is suitable to be vice-chairman of the committee, it must be considered? Surely the Taoiseach does not need to consider that? Does he not agree that before the House adjourns, arrangements should be made to take this motion in a meeting of the committee? Deputy Michael Ahern, the chairman of the committee, should be asked to convene the meeting and the Taoiseach, as leader of Fianna Fáil, should indicate his support for the motion tabled by Deputy Jimmy Deenihan on behalf of Fine Gael, to the effect that the committee cannot have confidence in Deputy Lawlor as its vice-chairman at this time given that that committee is specifically charged with ethics related matters and other important matters? I do not believe Deputy Lawlor has the confidence of the Fianna Fáil party in that <Col N="1016" /> capacity. However, it is important that the leader of Fianna Fáil should be able to make a decision here and now when it is put to him to say &ldquo;yes, he does not have confidence either&rdquo;. He should just say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton asked two questions. First, he referred to this &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;. This &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; happens to be a joint statement by the party leaders on a very important issue. It is a very fundamental issue on which we spend much time, so it is not this &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;. </P>

I am not challenging the Chair's ruling. Will the Taoiseach say what could be of any more general public importance than the travesty of a Member of this House citing as his reason for not complying with the directions of the courts and the chairman of a tribunal, that because he was a Member of this House and had facilitated the terms of reference of that tribunal, he had some right by virtue of <Col N="1018" /> his membership of this House, not to co-operate with the directions of the Chairman. </P>

I hope he will not procrastinate about Deputy Liam Lawlor who is vice-chairman of the committee dealing with taxation and banking, including banking relations between Ireland and the Czech Republic. It is also the committee responsible for ethics. He is there because he was put there by Fianna Fáil who have left him there undisturbed, drawing £5,000 a year over and above what other Members receive for his duties as vice-chairman of this committee for ethics, banking and finance. Is the Taoiseach, the leader of this House, satisfied to have Deputy Liam Lawlor representing this House as our vice-chairman dealing with ethics, taxation and banking? It is a simple question.</P>

      <P>As regards the substance of what Deputy Quinn said yesterday and today, I do not disagree with him. I wish to make a procedural point. I quoted a ruling made by the Chair on 10 October at columns 1315 and 1316 of the Official Report. Deputy Quinn is trying to make a distinction between the advice I received from everyone and that ruling. He is trying to say that I can depart from that ruling in some way. I want to clarify that. It is the advice I received everywhere yesterday. It was not the only advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1020" /> I received a letter from the Ceann Comhairle this morning which is exactly the same as the advice I received from the Attorney General and everywhere else I checked yesterday. The Chair's advice is the same as that. The Chief Whip gave the motion that Deputy Quinn gave to me because I agree with the content. I am not arguing about that but on the question of the admissibility of a possible motion that deals with the behaviour of a witness before the Flood Tribunal. The Chair's ruling, which was in line with the advice from everyone else, is that, in his view, the motion, if tabled, would not be in order. The relevant Standing Order 56 states, <i>inter alia</i>, that a matter shall not be raised in such an overt manner so that it appears to be an attempt by the Dáil to encroach on the functions of the courts or a judicial tribunal.</P>
    <P>If the Dáil was allowed to proceed with this motion, or a motion of like substance, it would, in your view, Sir, be in breach of Standing Orders and the established precedents of this House since its foundation. I find it difficult to imagine how any motion along the lines of the one referred to by me would be in order. Such matters, including penalties, are within the sole responsibility of the judicial chairman to deal with as he sees fit. You, Sir, then proceed to spell that out in four paragraphs. That is the same advice, Ceann Comhairle, as I received elsewhere so I am not resting it&mdash;</P>

In that context, is he aware of statements made by the chairman of Sinn Féin to the effect that if Fianna Fáil were on their own in Government Sinn Féin could work out a basis on which these killers would be released early, but they are being blocked because Fianna Fáil is not on its own in Government?</P>

      <P>I will not be repetitious. Can I ask the Taoiseach in light of what he said earlier, and having regard to the precedent established on 11 October and what has happened since then, whether he will be prepared, in a manner similar to 11 October, to issue by way of a joint statement from the four party leaders in this House the text of the motion I sent to him yesterday, and that we would overcome the interpretation of the rulings, because I believe everyone in this House shares a sense of concern in relation to this matter? I am not trying to be partisan; I am trying to be as embracing as possible because I believe the standing of politicians has been very badly damaged, and continues to be damaged, when people invoke their membership of this House as a reason for not complying with rulings of the court. We are citizens like everyone else, temporary officeholders, but permanent citizens, and we should not regard ourselves as different from anyone else. I ask the Taoiseach, because only he can do so, to issue by way of a joint statement the text of the motion which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that a tribunal of inquiry into certain planning matters (the Flood Tribunal) was established by the unanimous will of the members of this House and of Seanad Éireann,</P>
      <P>Being of opinion that every citizen and, even more so, every public representative owes a legal, moral and democratic duty to cooperate with the Tribunal, not to obstruct it and to comply with its lawful orders,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Being further of opinion that a policy of sustained obstruction and prevarication, calculated to frustrate the Tribunal in its legitimate <Col N="1024" /> inquiries, is incompatible with the standards of accountability legitimately expected of public representatives by those who elect them to public office,</P>
    <P>Calls on Deputy Liam Lawlor fully to cooperate with the inquiries of the Flood Tribunal and to comply with its lawful orders or, if he does not, immediately to resign his seat in this House.</P>

That is my request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to engage in repetition. I said already that I checked this out yesterday because I did not have a difficulty with what the Deputy was saying. The position is that the Houses of the Oireachtas established the Flood Tribunal to carry out important work on behalf of the public. The powers of the tribunal and the duties of all citizens in relation to this matter are well known. All of us, including myself, have complete confidence in the capacity of the tribunal to carry out its functions independently and properly. The House has repeatedly shown that it will give the tribunal whatever resources and powers it needs. Any resources required by the tribunal have always been speedily provided by the Government. The tribunal has not sought, and does not need, the interference or guidance of the House in discharging its duties. Since the tribunal was established to carry out this task, we should respect its independence and allow the chairman to carry out his mandate free from any political comment or interference. I have been strongly advised in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, I said earlier on the debate on the motion that I was quite happy to reiterate what I said previously. I think people should take that, which is not very different from it. I am advised I should not go outside that &ndash; in fact, I am advised that we should not even be saying that <Col N="1025" /> again. However, since I said it before, I do not see what is wrong with that.</P>
    <P>I repeat that the Flood Tribunal was established by the unanimous will of the Members of this House. Every citizen and, even more so, every Member of the Oireachtas owes a legal, moral and democratic duty to co-operate with the tribunal, not to obstruct it and to comply with its lawful orders. We would expect any citizen and any Member of the Oireachtas who disputed the validity or legality of any tribunal order, to make his or her case to the tribunal and, if necessary, to the courts. That position is quite clear and people should accept that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware, I endorse that statement and was co-author of it. Will the Taoiseach agree that there is a distinction between Deputy Lawlor's position as a Member of the House and a motion asking him to resign his seat in the House, which appears from the ruling we cannot deal with here, and his position as vice-Chairman of a committee of this House? Surely the Taoiseach can make a decision that he is not suitable in current circumstances to be vice-Chairman of a committee of this House dealing with ethics, banking and finance. Given that he was nominated to that position by the Taoiseach, perhaps the Taoiseach will now say he believes he is no longer suitable for the position to which he nominated him. I ask the Taoiseach to make that decision. It is not a very difficult decision to make, therefore I ask him to agree with me that he is not suitable to be vice-Chairman of a committee. That would send out a clear signal from this House before it breaks for the Christmas recess that we can make decisions about such matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I am aware we are now totally out of order, but perhaps you will allow me to reply briefly to Deputy Bruton. As I said already, given that the ethics committee and my party issued a report which led to Deputy Lawlor not just leaving our parliamentary party but leaving our party in its entirety, Deputy Bruton is aware of our views on the matter.</P>
      <P>For the information of the House, I was surprised Deputy Bruton did not pay me the courtesy of informing me that he would be raising the issue of the committee. I have since checked with the chairman and officials of the Finance Committee. No such motion has been tabled yet. Fine Gael has notified the Finance Committee that they intend to table this motion. At 10.20 a.m., just before we came to this House, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, who does not seem to be present &ndash; I am not sure if he voted &ndash; faxed in on Fine Gael headed paper the motion so that the party could raise the issue as a political football.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i> (Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>
        <b>:</b> When I last spoke on the Bill I dwelt on the role of teachers. The council will comprise 37 members. Given its proposed size there is a danger it may become unwieldy. If each group represented has two members, will they not duplicate their work in terms of policy? Would one member not be sufficient to make the council more workable? I presume the Minister is following precedent in determining the size of the council, but smaller numbers would be better if there is work to be done. Every group can be represented by having smaller numbers. The provision for two, four, seven or nine members from groups merely increases the number and the ideas put forward will be similar.</P>
      <P>One of the functions of the council is to deal with teacher training. It should spend a lot of time on this. While I welcome the changes that will allow people with degrees or honours degrees to do the H-Dip in Education with a view to taking up teaching, it is important to stress that teaching is an art. A person with the genius of Einstein may convey very little information to a class. Teaching skills should be fostered and I hope the council will deal with that. The Minister should ensure teaching skills are imparted to those studying for the teaching profession.</P>
      <P>What makes teaching difficult is conveying information. People think that teachers attend school from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. during which time they write things on a classroom board. There is an art in conveying information, including to those who may not want to absorb it. That is what makes teaching so difficult. It is very easy to teach those who are eager to learn, but many students do not want to be at school. This has become more prevalent since the raising of the school leaving age to 16 years. It makes life very difficult for others.</P>
      <P>In dealing with so many aspects of teaching I hope the council will also deal with the peripheral problems. The psychological service is very important, as is the handling of children who suffer from dyslexia. Some remedial teachers cover six or seven schools, which means they are remedial teachers in name only. A remedial teacher should be appointed to every reasonably sized school or, at the least, there would be one teacher for every two schools. A local newspaper may report the appointment of a remedial teacher for which somebody may claim credit, but the service is insufficient. Given the wide remit of the council it should have an involvement in this aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fitness to teach is another aspect of the Bill. While there are many good teachers, there is a difficulty in handling situations where classes are stuck with a bad teacher. While there are many reasons a teacher may be removed from his or her position, none deals with the competency aspect. It appears that fitness to teach in the Bill is concerned with health, unprofessional conduct and so on. While those should be sufficient grounds for removing a teacher, what happens <Col N="1034" /> when teachers are unable to control or teach a class? Parents are concerned about this and often worry during the summer holidays about their children being taught by certain teachers when they return to school. This must be addressed. Every profession has minimum standards below which action is taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady" hpid="Mr. J. Brady Mr. J. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. The Teaching Council Bill is an appropriate mechanism to bring education into a new era and the new millennium. It is further proof of the Government's commitment to education and our young people. I compliment the Government on its overall efforts in education.</P>
      <P>I am fortunate that a number of major projects in my area, some of which have been sought for years, have benefited from funding. These include a new building for St. Oliver's post primary school at Oldcastle, and major extensions to Kells community school and Dumbaragh national school outside Kells, where I was taught.</P>
      <P>This is a sizeable amount of funding concentrated in a relatively small area. I hope for further good news on other projects at Yellow Furze national school, Stackallen national school and Clonmellen national school, which, although in County Westmeath, cater for a large area in County Meath. I also hope that a new school will be provided at Eureka Convent of Mercy all girls post primary school in Kells.</P>
      <P>Education is an important agent for social transformation. The Bill is very important for teachers, pupils and parents. It provides for the establishment of a teaching council and will afford the teaching profession a significant degree of self regulation. It shows this House has the highest confidence in the teaching profession. The establishment of a teaching council has been sought by teachers and other parents in education for some time. Teachers will play a key part in the development of their profession by working through the council. They will have the opportunity to provide for the establishment of standards and policies for the education of future generations and they will have greater responsibility for the standard and quality of education available.</P>
      <P>The Bill will provide an assurance that teachers who work with children meet the highest standards of professional qualification and competence through a professional code of conduct. Registration with the council will imply that a teacher has attained a satisfactory level of professional qualification and training. A teacher must be registered to be eligible for employment in a State funded position as a teacher.</P>
      <P>Other professions have formally recognised bodies. The Irish Medical Council and An Bord Altranais have been vital in the development of the respective professions they represent. Similarly, the professional role of teachers will now be formally recognised by the State in a teaching council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1035" /> The teaching council will be an independent statutory agency. Its remit will include promoting teaching as a profession, establishing and maintaining codes of professional conduct and establishing and maintaining a register of teachers. It will also determine the qualifications and criteria for registration. It will devise arrangements for registration, induction and probation. It will advise the Minister on the work of the council and on matters relating to the educational qualification for new entrants to teaching, the number of teachers and the training needs of the profession. It will conduct inquiries into a teacher's fitness to teach and impose sanctions where necessary. It will review and accredit programmes of teacher education and training and it will carry out a number of functions in relation to the recognition of the qualifications of teachers trained outside Ireland. It will also co-operate with its equivalent body in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The council will consist of 37 members, of whom 22 will be registered teachers. Institutions involved in teacher education, recognised school management organisations, the national associations of parents and the Minister for Education and Science will nominate the other 15 members. It will conduct the majority of its business through committees. An executive committee, an investigating committee and a disciplinary committee will be established. The council may establish further committees if deemed necessary in the performance of its functions. The establishment of a teaching council in Northern Ireland will ensure that all teachers, North and South, move forward together.</P>
    <P>Our education system has played an important role in our economic success. A young and well educated population provided a sound base from which this success developed. The Bill will ensure a continuation of our highest education standards. The concerns of students and parents have often been overlooked in debates on education. This Bill will provide a platform to air all concerns.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, has broken new ground recently by embarking on a meaningful consultation process with children. Children were asked for their opinions and what they would like to see in the children's legislation. Their views were taken on board and incorporated in the Bill. Will the Minister consider making provision for students' views to be taken on board in this Bill by requiring the council to consult students regularly, meaningfully and positively? The model used by the Minister of State could be a suitable one. Representatives should be included from the soon to be created national children's office, Dáil na nÓg, and, when appointed, the ombudsman for children and youth organisations, such as the National Youth Council.</P>
    <P>While the Bill is called the Teaching Council Bill, it is not the preserve of teachers; it is about <Col N="1036" /> promoting high values and a quality education system. Students are the major stakeholders in the education system. I encourage the Minister to make provision for students' views to be taken into account. In an age of openness and consultation, it is vital that we consult in a meaningful way with all those involved in the education system. If such representation were allowed, it would bring about a situation whereby students would be able to engage with the council in a positive and meaningful way rather than being called as witnesses in competency cases. Student representation would further ensure that young people learn from an early age to engage with a democratic system. The professions and the democratic system would further learn to engage with its citizens from an early age.</P>
    <P>This Bill allows for teacher representation which is distinct from the role of teachers' unions. Maintaining and improving standards is a key requisite in ensuring the survival of all professions. The Minister is right when he states that teachers' representative organisations will complement each other in promoting teaching as a profession.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Teaching Council Bill because it will help to promote teaching as a profession, which is important. It will serve to improve the quality of teaching throughout the State. It sets standards for the education and training of teachers as well as providing methods to investigate any allegations of misconduct by teachers. The impact teachers have in our education system is immeasurable. The establishment of such a council is long overdue. The passing of this Bill will benefit students, teachers and everyone in the State. We have often heard it said in the past that a teacher cannot be sacked. Under this Bill that issue will be addressed once and for all and people will know there is recourse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 outlines the main functions of the council. These are: to promote teaching as a profession; establish, review and maintain codes of <Col N="1037" /> professional conduct for teachers; establish and maintain a register of teachers; establish and promote standards in the programmes of teacher education and training; promote the continuing education and professional development of teachers; and conduct inquiries into the fitness of teachers to teach and, where appropriate, impose sanctions. The latter function will be welcomed by teachers because for too long they have felt they were overly criticised in this regard. Teachers are proud of their profession and they want it to be regulated in the same way as other professions.</P>
    <P>The teaching council will enhance professionalism by maintaining and developing the standards that are required. At present there are many professional bodies such as the Medical Council and An Bord Altranais which have already set a precedent for the achievement of objectives similar to those set out in the Bill. It is long overdue that teachers should be represented by an officially recognised professional body, namely, the teaching council. The council will confirm the status of teachers, entitle them to regulate their own affairs and, more important, empower them with increased responsibility and accountability in respect of the quality of education on offer.</P>
    <P>Overall, the Bill will advance the professionalism and professional image of teachers nationwide. Teachers want to be recognised as professionals who care for the needs of children and their parents. It is appropriate to pay tribute to the tremendous work they have done over the years in educating the population. They have played a major role in the developments that have taken place in the economy during the past 20 to 40 years.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, teachers will play a key role in the regulation and development of their profession. One aspect of the Bill that adds a great deal of professionalism is the code of conduct provided for in section 6. This code, which will be drafted by the teaching council, will provide a sense of collective professional identity that will have far-reaching effects.</P>
    <P>To ensure the quality of education students receive, the teaching council will maintain a register which will serve as its main regulatory instrument. This register will stand as an expression of the standard of teaching and the level of knowledge that teachers aspire to procure and maintain. The Bill will allow the teaching council to decide the information which should be held on the register. Such items may include any disciplinary findings on a teacher's record as well as the length of time they should remain on the register.</P>
    <P>In order to be registered, teachers will have to meet certain standards in terms of their qualifications and training. Only those who reach such standards will be allowed to have their names entered on the register. After initial registration, teachers will have to renew their registration on an annual basis. This development will be wel<Col N="1038" /> comed by parents because it will provide them with an assurance that they children will be educated by qualified and competent professionals.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the teaching council will also benefit parents in that it will make available to them a course of action if teachers fail to meet acceptable standards of practice. Section 40 sets out the procedures for dealing with complaints, which are vitally necessary at this stage. The Minister is to be congratulated on the excellent way this section has been drafted. If difficulties arise, there will be a mechanism in place to deal with them.</P>
    <P>The members of the various disciplinary committees that will be established to deal with such matters will be appointed by the teaching council. The committees will provide for a course of action in the event of complaints being made, while also ensuring that the rights of teachers and the right of recourse to the courts are also recognised. The council will, however, have the right to strike off teachers after investigating allegations of gross misconduct. This is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>The teaching council will have a key role in reviewing, updating and establishing teachers' education and training programmes. The Bill will ensure high standards among teachers and it will allow these to be maintained and strengthened. The teaching profession needs to change and adapt to current needs in order to accommodate students. Allowing teachers, through the teaching council, to play an active part in updating their training and education programmes, will prevent our education system from becoming outdated and outmoded.</P>
    <P>The Teaching Council Bill stands to benefit teachers, students, parents and the State. Teaching is a profession that has a tremendous impact on young people: the future of our nation. It is a profession that needs to be recognised, held to standards and given the opportunity to move forward. The Teaching Council Bill will improve the quality and professionalism of teachers while giving them increased input into the advancement of their profession. In the event of unsatisfactory performance, parents and students will have a course of action to follow. This is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for expediting his contribution. By doing so he has provided me with a few additional minutes to speak on the Bill.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on this important legislation, which will be of enormous benefit to the education sector. The recent debate about teachers' pay has expanded into a discussion of their performance and the wider role they play in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The performance of teachers is difficult to judge or measure and, therefore, that the House should introduce the Bill which will help in the promotion of teaching as a profession and, more <Col N="1039" /> important, assist in the professional development of teachers is welcome. I welcome the fact that the Bill makes provision for all partners in education to be represented on the council. That is very important. I hope the days are long gone when the fear of inspectors visiting schools produced a defensive reaction not only from students but also from members of staff.</P>
    <P>Everyone concurs with the view that there must be accountability in the State's handling of teachers, their qualifications and their professional development. The Bill will be of great benefit in this regard. The importance of setting, developing and maintaining the highest standards of teaching in this country is evidenced by the role played by teaching graduates from all sectors of education in attracting overseas investment. The Celtic tiger economy exists because of the quality of our education system and the role played by the people who have delivered education over the years. We must now move forward and the Bill will put in place a fine structure to strengthen the education system further.</P>
    <P>Among the objectives of the teaching council, which are set out in section 6, will be to regulate the teaching profession and the professional conduct of teachers, to establish the maintenance and improvement of these and to encourage the ongoing education and training of teachers throughout their careers. The Minister should clarify if he envisages whether all in-career developments or ongoing education will be co-ordinated by the teaching council. As he is aware, the current position in relation to in-career development and in-service courses is that they are offered by a range of bodies including teachers' centres, the NCTE, the Department of Education and Science and various other organisations.</P>
    <P>The Minister needs to clarify the extent of the council's responsibility for the ongoing education of teachers.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 7 which provides for the maintenance of a register of teachers and the qualifications for registration. Concern has been expressed by Members at the shortage of primary school teachers, but there is also a shortage of teachers at second level in particular subjects. A recent survey highlighted that up to 35% of schools had difficulty recruiting Irish teachers. Many schools also have difficulty recruiting technical graphics, French and home economics teachers in particular. The Teaching Council must examine the issue of allowing teachers qualified at one level to teach in other levels of the education system. This issue has been raised in the House before but we need to make progress in this regard.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to the various levels of understanding of child psychology required at primary level. These levels may differ due to the behaviour and understanding of teenagers in second level. The Minister will agree that the teacher training courses must be geared to allow teachers work at primary or second level as this <Col N="1040" /> would minimise the current shortage of primary teachers.</P>
    <P>The Teaching Council must also examine the issue of allowing teachers who obtain qualifications in other countries to work in Ireland. I welcome the promotion of Irish at all levels of the education system. However, during debate on the education Estimates last week, I raised the necessity for teachers to hold the ceard teastas for oral or written Irish. This is an obvious barrier to overseas teachers gaining employment in Ireland.</P>
    <P>During debate on the Estimates I asked a Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science to update us on the review of this certificate. I have received representations on this matter from a number of constituents who pointed out that they are ineligible for posts in many schools. We must review the need for this certificate. Given the shortage of teachers we must reach out to people with suitable qualifications and the ceard teastas is no longer a genuine requirement.</P>
    <P>Schools have much to gain from broadening their experience through the employment of more overseas teachers. Irish graduates have enriched education systems in other countries and graduates from such countries could be of enormous benefit to our system. This is why we must examine the teaching of Irish and the ceard teastas.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to predict how many teaching graduates will go into teaching as many enter other areas of the private and public sectors. There has been concern for many years about the number of entrants to courses who will gain immediate employment in the private sector. I am referring in particular to woodwork, metalwork, home economics and science teachers. Graduates from these courses have gained an excellent reputation but we must examine the number who enter the teaching profession as opposed to taking employment in the private or public sectors.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 to 13, inclusive, deal with the establishment of the council and the employment of a chief executive and other staff. The Minister will be aware that the legislation will only be as effective as the resources made available. I am concerned the council may not have adequate resources to carry out its various functions. A maximum amount of resources must be made available to the council, particularly in its first few years. The fact that there has been no such council up to now will invariably mean there will be a backlog of cases and issues to be dealt with in the early years. The Minister will need to pump prime the council to ensure that, in its first two or three years, it has the resources necessary to deal with any queries or problems referred to it.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify the position as regards the Data Protection Act? The register of teachers will contain information on up to 44,000 teachers, but will that information come within the provisions of the Data Protection Act?</P>
    <P>I have more to say on the Bill but I appreciate the time constraints. I look forward to the Mini<Col N="1041" /> ster's reply and the enactment of the Bill as the council and the registration of teachers will further improve the education system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the many Deputies who contributed to the debate on this Bill. We had quite an extended Second Stage debate with a large number of Deputies on both sides of the House participating. This indicates the genuine interest of Members in promoting, sponsoring and advancing the Bill which provides for a Teaching Council for the teaching profession. I am anxious to get on with this timely legislation and I hope it will not be delayed.</P>
      <P>The Teaching Council will play a central role in ensuring that the high quality of education in Ireland will continue with the many changes and challenges taking place. The establishment of a Teaching Council is fundamental to the growth and development of the teaching profession. I will go further and suggest the council has a great deal to offer teachers.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies referred to the difficulties some principals are encountering sourcing teachers. The Government has increased the number of students on the H-Dip from 800 to 1,000 per year, and the number of students on the BEd course to 1,000 per year. It has also provided 280 places on the 18-month graduate course. The usual number would be 100 places so there has been a substantial increase due to the huge demand created by the large number of people seeking to enter the profession.</P>
      <P>Even with this progress and these successes, I am keenly aware that while we have made great strides in recent years a great deal remains to be done. I assure the House I will do my best to ensure this work is carried out as quickly as possible. To reduce the pupil-teacher ratio, and to help schools in disadvantaged areas in particular, we have provided an additional 1,225 teachers at post-primary level. This will be increased by another 400 under the PPF which is delivering extra teachers to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio.</P>
      <P>At primary level, an additional 1,200 teachers have been provided. This figure will increase by a further 900 under the PPF. We are increasing the demand for teachers because we are appointing a large number of additional teachers. In simple terms, it means we are going to the market looking for more teachers than normal, which is pushing up demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the expert group I established to examine the teacher allocation process at second level is expected to be available shortly. Further improvements in staffing at second level will have regard to the work of that group. Some Deputies argued I have not provided sufficient in-service training, particularly with reference to IT training. The number of days provided for in-career development currently stands at between 120,000 days and 130,000 per annum. Each year there has been a dramatic increase in the number seeking ins-ervice training, which is much to the credit of <Col N="1042" /> our teaching profession. Other countries expect teachers to be somewhat reluctant to participate, but that is not the case here. Large numbers are participating in these courses and many extra courses are provided to the extent that the number of days provided for in-career development is 130,000. That represents a 100% increase on the 1997 provision. In addition, 35,000 teachers have availed of IT training courses, each course being of 20 hours' duration.</P>
    <P>While many training courses target individual teachers, the concept of the school as a unit of change has gained momentum. An example is the primary curriculum support programme, which to date has targeted whole school staffs in organising programmes of professional development associated with the implementation of the revised primary school curriculum. In addition, a comprehensive programme of development for principals is planned and enhanced funding has been provided for the teacher fee refund scheme. All these measures are meeting the challenges of the present day, but there is a good deal to be done in a short time. Much of this is happening quickly as matters are changing in society and challenges have to be faced. I want to make it clear that those challenges are being faced by the teaching profession, whose members are participating in a major way.</P>
    <P>Deputies suggested that principals, in particular primary principals, have not received sufficient support from my Department, but I cannot accept that. From September 2000, all primary schools entitled to a staffing of a principal plus seven mainstream teachers have been allocated an additional teacher to enable the principal to become an administrative principal and from September 2001, that concession will be extended to schools with a staff of a principal plus six mainstream teachers. That has been widely accepted and applauded by the teacher unions, as it is a major development for principals.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, from September 2000, all teaching principals have been allowed a specified number of release days to enable them attend to administrative duties and a substitute teacher may be employed to cover such absences. The number of release days allowed will be reviewed again next year.</P>
    <P>Also from September 2000, all primary schools receive funding towards caretaking and secretarial services and further improvements in the levels of funding will be provided over the next number of years. The ability of a school to provide quality education is rooted in the commitment and expertise of the principal and teaching staff.</P>
    <P>The introduction of school development planning is designed to enhance the professional role of teachers. It empowers them to contribute to the development of the school. It enables them to exercise a greater degree of ownership over the central issues that influence their work, it provides them with the opportunities for collaborative policy-making and planning and for partici<Col N="1043" /> pation in the leadership and management of development. Planning at school level must be followed surely by the provision of a mechanism to allow teachers to plan at a professional level. This Bill will provide that mechanism.</P>
    <P>I stress that this Bill is a further step on the road to ensuring that the high standards we have always had in teaching continue and teachers are involved in delivering and developing these standards on a fully professional basis.</P>
    <P>Many comments were made by Deputies and I will take them into consideration. We will have an opportunity to discuss them in detail when considering the different facets of the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bradford asked if the Data Protection Act would apply to the registered names. It will apply to the names, as it applies to all activities in the public sector.</P>
    <P>He also talked about the school inspector and the old idea of the fears there were the day the cigire was due to visit the school and he said that was changing. That is an important point. It is changing and it will have to change considerably. In schools we are trying to assist and support managers. The manager and principals of a school play an increasingly important part in the development of the school. The point made by the Deputy is worth noting.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brady mentioned taking on board the views of students. I would go along with him on that. I will examine that for Committee Stage. Student councils are doing excellent work and I have witnessed them in operation. They are relatively new and are spreading throughout the system. The Deputy's point that students should be involved in this is a good one and I will consider it for Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne raises questions on a number of areas, including the handling of dyslexia. He was concerned that the number on the council was too great. That is one of the difficulties of having a broadly representative council. Those involved in the steering group that has led to this Bill felt strongly that the various groups must be involved. That is the reality of the situation. With regard to the handing of dyslexia, I assure the Deputy it is a matter to which I am giving priority as I said I would.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny made a wide-ranging contribution and raised a number of points. While I have replied to some of them, given the time available, I will not be able to reply to all of them. I assure him that I will consider them. He talked about the need for sabbaticals and pointed to what happens in Canada in that regard, which is an interesting concept. I will seriously consider that.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions. This is fundamental legislation that has been very widely sought by the teaching profession. It gives the profession as a whole at this critical time an opportunity to develop and promote itself, to ensure that promotion is co-ordinated and that <Col N="1044" /> the Minister is given the best possible advice on the development of the profession. It has been widely welcomed and I ask Deputies when we come to deal with Committee Stage of the Bill to help me to advance it without undue delay in the interests of the profession.</P>

It is important to keep matters in perspective. We are often loath to speak on this subject as it touches the core of what we do every day as working politicians. If one were to read some of the material in our newspapers and other media one might easily jump to the conclusion that the public and those purveying the news have formed the view that the membership of the House is corrupt to the core.

      <P>I welcome Deputy Shatter's interruption in one sense. He has tried, as is his party's wont, to turn any matter relating to ethics or standards in public life into a party political football he can kick around to his own advantage and that of his party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I warn him that if he continues with that approach it will have the effect of undermining the democracy we all hope to serve. It is typical of his party's approach. One would assume from his tone and that of other Fine Gael Members that there are no other offenders when it comes to ethics and that no members of Fine Gael were implicated in any of the tribunals or inquiries that have been set up to investigate proper standards in politics. He seems to forget that his party launched an investigation into its own county councillors and that the report identified some people wrongly, trying to hang them in public opinion. Some of them are decent people and one is the son of a former leader of Fine Gael and former Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, Senator Liam Cosgrave. He was identified in this cockeyed, half-researched and ill-prepared report. Fine Gael has no respect for the dignity or rights of the individual. What rights did Senator Cosgrave enjoy when his party investigated him? What right was he given when eminent senior <Col N="1046" /> counsel of a Fine Gael hue were brought in to do a stitch-up job on him? If I were Senator Cosgrave or a member of Fine Gael I would be very concerned with the drift of that party and its alleged commitment to ethics and good standards in public life? What justice was accorded to him? It was a rude hanging party.</P>

That is what it is at today also; it is the usual Fine Gael jackboot tendency, trying to tar Fianna Fáil and all its members with one brush. We have problems and we are the first to acknowledge that. The Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and all my parliamentary colleagues have been to the fore in ensuring that higher standards apply. We will have been four years in office next June and every time there is a hue and cry from Deputies opposite about standards and ethics and the need for greater compliance with the tax code or the standards of the House we have been first to act. We were the first to bring forward legislation. We were the first to raise the bar and we were the first to call for the tribunals; we called for those <Col N="1047" /> when in Opposition.

      <P>I would love to. I welcome Deputy Shatter's intervention regarding the vice-chairman of the Committee on Finance and the Public Services. Deputy Shatter will know that the committees are decided on a <i>pro rata</i> basis and shared among different parties. Deputy Lawlor, in turn and in time-honoured fashion, was appointed vice-chairman and that is a matter for the committee to resolve. It was strange that Deputy Deenihan was flying with the usually active Fine Gael fax machine, faxing to the committee secretariat at 10.20 a.m. this morning his anger and worry that Deputy Lawlor should be on the committee.</P>

It has become a rather late convert to the idea that he is an inappropriate person to sit on that committee. Several months ago Deputy Lawlor might be said to have been in greater controversy when under investigation by his own party&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and forced, in some man<Col N="1048" /> ner or fashion, to resign not only from the parliamentary party but the party itself. After he ceased to be a member of Fianna Fáil by his own choice I never heard from any Fine Gael representative either on that committee, in the Dáil or at the leadership level, represented by Deputy Bruton, call for his resignation as vice-chairman of the committee. This is rank hypocrisy of the kind we see played out every day here on matters of ethics in public life.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael is no rose when it comes to ethics and compliance. We know about the debt Fine Gael cleared when it came into Government in 1994 by some form of democratic coup perpetrated against the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, in which, against the public interest and mood, Fine Gael was pushed into power with no support or mandate from the people. It was foisted on the Irish people and into power. It quickly broke up the peace process, but we have never heard Fine Gael properly explain how it managed magically over two years to wipe out a debt of some £6 million because of the very successful fund-raising techniques applied by a person who is no longer apparently a member of that party but is quite prominent when it comes to christianity and forgiveness, when christianity is spoken about on the Opposition benches. I find it amusing that has never been explained.</P>
      <P>Also, when it comes to ethics and how business people interact with Government, it is important there is a proper measured response when dealing with business. Business has a right to lobby Government and to interact with Ministers and Deputies and tell them what they would like in an ideal world. However, it seems odd that when Fine Gael was fund-raising, and raising money from one Ben Dunne, it did not just look for a donation, but after dinner when the cigars were produced and the coffee was poured, it rather generously and gladheartedly asked Mr. Ben Dunne &ndash; and this is on public record &ndash; whether, now that he had coughed up the cash, there were any policies he would like to influence that Fine Gael could put forward on this behalf? That is the kind of craven approach taken by Fine Gael when it comes to raising money from big capital holders and money men. It immediately invites them to write its party policy. One would not find that in Fianna Fáil. Probably one of the greatest complaints that businessmen make about Fianna Fáil is that we take the money and donations, run the race days and the golf events and they do not receive anything in return. That is politics. We are a more robust party than Fine Gael.</P>

      <P>No robust right-wing Fine Gael Government has been elected since 1973. Even Liam Cosgrave, the elder, found it difficult to deal with the Labour incubus once it was brought into his ranks. It was a less than right-wing robust Fine Gael Government. It shouts and talks a great deal in Opposition but when it gets into Government, it is the parties of the left and the Labour Party that tend to influence policy.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House represents firm action, but action informed by a sense of proportion and perspective to deal with the problem of corruption. The Bill is welcome in itself but also for recognising that corruption is an international and not simply an Irish problem. The ratification of international conventions shows that Ireland is fully prepared to play its part in the fight against this subversive menace to democracy. International corruption has been compounded and exacerbated by the fall of the Iron Curtain and the demise of the Soviet Union. Deputy Shatter, who has travelled a lot, will know a great deal about the morals and ethics that applied in countries other than Ireland. </P>

      <P>I suppose I should be loathe to quote a former leader of my party, but what happens here is in the ha'penny place compared with what occurs in other jurisdictions. I had the pleasure of working in the newly liberated countries of the eastern bloc, particularly the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, where the levels of corruption are quite horrifying, mainly due to the low pay that public administrators and officials receive in those countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>For example, a secretary of a department circa 1992 in the Czech Republic would earn something in the order of $300 a month and, therefore, the temptations are huge, when international capital and business is invested in that country, to spread that money around to influence those public officials by giving them bribes. This is a huge phenomenon in the eastern bloc and in those countries that were formerly communist in origin. The great irony, which Deputy Shatter will appreciate, coming as he does from a robust right wing party like Fine Gael&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should take a full <Col N="1050" /> stand-up comedy routine in the Gaiety Theatre. He should join Equity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and our Leas-Cheann Comhairle might also appreciate it, is that the most insidious and corrupt officials in these eastern bloc states are always former Marxists and communists. They are the people who take to the new way of capitalism with gusto. There is a warning in this for anyone who previously served in very left wing parties of the Workers' Party variety that parties like those, Marxists and all as they might be, are the first to take to the new capitalist system and try to bend it towards their own corrupt purposes.</P>
      <P>There is also endemic corruption in other parts of the world such as the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. When one puts it in this international perspective, one sees that Ireland has a very proud record. Corruption has come to light here only in the past five to ten years and relates mainly to a period from the 1960s onwards when this country forcibly modernised in economic, social and cultural life. I give proper credit to the party opposite for its role in Government during that period too because it played a part, to some limited extent, in the development and modernisation of this country in that period.</P>
      <P>We took a great leap forward in the 1960s. Ireland was transformed from the country which Lemass haltingly tried to move forward along the industrial path. With that increased wealth came greater temptations for everybody involved in public or key decision-making to be corrupt. Corruption is not only part of politics, it is also part of the business and banking worlds.</P>
      <P>It is important that we have perspective because many Members claim that what the Committee of Public Accounts explored and discovered was dreadful. However, Irish society in the 1980s was non-compliant in a plethora of areas, such as the drink driving laws. We all know that people were brazenly non-compliant when it came to drink driving throughout the 1970s and 1980s. It was almost a feat of great machismo to get into a car while inebriated and drive it at will wherever one wanted. That was a common phenomenon in the 1980s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, people were brazenly non-compliant in terms of our tax laws in the late 1970s and early 1980s. People who cheated on their taxes &ndash; small business people of one kind or another &ndash; and set up these offshore or non-DIRT type accounts with false names or names of relations in the United States, England or elsewhere, were almost worshipped or regarded as the great cute hoors who were benefiting from the system and not paying their taxes like ordinary people. It is fashionable for the parties on the left to moralise on these controversies and suggest it is the big bankers, politicians and a cosy group looking after themselves who are cheating the system. However, to be historically correct, accurate and objective about it, in the 1980s few people in the <Col N="1051" /> welfare class were tax compliant and many cheated on the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>It is a canard for the parties of the left to depict this, in propagandistic terms, as an era when the big shots had the run of the country at the expense of the ordinary person or the PAYE worker. The PAYE worker had it hard and there was a subversive attitude to tax. Thankfully, this was realised very quickly by a number of parties It is not often I give credit to the Progressive Democrats but one of the great mainstays of its success in the early days was that it realised the huge public anger because of the overburdening weight of taxation on the individual.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a long tradition of incorruptible public service. It has been tarnished by recent revelations but we must keep a sense of proportion about these matters. Despite the shocking nature of what is emerging from the tribunals, Ireland is still one of the most corruption-free Western societies and we should not be stampeded into hasty and intemperate overreaction in the framing of legislation to deal with the problems which have come to light. Because a small minority of public representatives, officials and others in public life have been exposed as having betrayed the people's trust does not mean the entire fabric of public life is rotten to the core. Public service values and public administration have served this State well over the years. We have also to contend with the fact that corrupt and illegal business practices have been uncovered on a wide scale.</P>
    <P>Corporate interests and big business must answer questions about the failures of corporate governance in recent decades. Some of these are addressed in the Committee on Public Accounts in terms of the role of the internal audit function in publicly quoted companies. We are moving from a culture of non-compliance to a culture of compliance. That applies across a range of activities, occupations, businesses and interests. We have a welter of tribunals dealing with issues such as child sex abuse, abuse of people under the care of the religious, this House in terms of how we conduct ourselves and so on. It is important to remember that these are the necessary adjustments and corrections that must be made to a society that is much wealthier and, therefore, offers greater temptation to the tax cheat, the unethical businessman or politician.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that we finally have this Bill before us. It is interesting to compare Government action with what the Minister said about the Bill and the Government's much voiced commitment to tackling corruption in politics and public life. It is also interesting to consider the degree <Col N="1052" /> to which this Government regards the issue as a priority.</P>
    <P>The Bill was published on 4 January 2000 with great public relations excitement, press releases by the Minister's office and multiple interviews. It was regarded as a Bill urgently tackling the gaps within the criminal legal system and the problem of corruption. It took from 4 January 2000 until 21 June &ndash; six months &ndash; before the Second Stage debate took place. This urgent measure, which the Minister published just after Christmas last year at a time when he was advised it would make a good news story because there is not much news in the first few days of January sat on a bookshelf in the Minister's Department for six months. It was a measure in response to the very real problem of corruption which was continually exposed as a major difficulty in public life in particular in the context of members of Fianna Fáil, both present and former Members of this House who are members of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say there were difficulties getting the House to take this issue on Second Stage but the Government orders business and determines the priorities. The Taoiseach and the Cabinet determine what measures are taken each week and the Government Chief Whip ultimately determines business in this House. The Government chose to sit on this measure for six months. </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday the Minister signed what has been termed the United Nations anti-Mafia convention. I thought it appropriate that the Minister was in Sicily signing that convention to tackle, on a Europe-wide basis, the problems of corruption at a time when Deputy Lawlor was effectively confirming to the Flood Tribunal that he perjured himself before it and was finally admitting some of the corrupt practices in which he had engaged over two decades of public life. It is time we came to terms with the reality of what is happening. The Minister was signing the convention and making the appropriate noises that appealed to the other Ministers of the States of the European Union who were present. What about Fianna Fáil's mafia? What about the mafia that has inhabited and contaminated that party over 20 years, the tribunals that are costing the taxpayer millions of pounds in order to get to the truth of the corrupt practices of a former Taoiseach and Leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Haughey, the tribunal with which Deputy Lawlor has been playing ducks and drakes?</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil is a politically contaminated party. Deputy Lawlor and his behaviour, while he has been put out of the party, is tolerated by it. He is a Deputy on whom Fianna Fáil depends to remain in Government. Despite a public admission of what is clearly, to the mind of every right thinking person, serious misbehaviour in public life, he is allowed to remain in the Fianna Fáil corridors of this House. He is happily left to be vice chairman of a finance committee, part of whose brief is to deal with issues of ethics. Every Member knows party Leaders appoint Members to committees and, through the whipping system, determine whether people will be chairman, vice chairmen or convenors of committees. The Taoiseach has had it within his power during the life of this Dáil to determine whether it is appropriate that Deputy Lawlor retain his position as vice chairman of the committee. The truth is Fianna Fáil is a politically contaminated party that should be driven from office. A stench of corruption surrounds that party. As we are drip fed new information through hearings before the tribunals it becomes quite clear that it is in the interests of the State, the body politic, democracy, the integrity of our democratic institutions and restoring people's faith in the political system that Fianna Fáil leaves office.</P>

    <P>People are sickened by the daily revelations from tribunals. The Fianna Fáil political effluent which is seeping from its silage pit in the evidence given before the tribunals does not cast a shadow on the Labour Party, the Fine Gael Party or other Members of this House. It casts a shadow over <Col N="1054" /> Fianna Fáil for events which have occurred for which members of that party are responsible and with which it has no wish to come to terms. The party is quite happy that Deputy Lawlor, Deputy Foley and other members of that party who have engaged in questionable conduct brazen it out and remain Members of this House. It is quite happy to be dependent on those Deputies to remain in Government. If some of them had any real decency, in particular, Deputy Lawlor, if he had any remnant of decency remaining, not only would he resign as vice chairman of the Committee on Finance and the Public Service but from this House and public life. However, he will brazen it out. The Taoiseach hopes he will because he knows his term of office depends on Deputy Lawlor continuing to support the Government.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach likes to remind us every so often that Deputy Lawlor is an Independent Deputy. </P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche:</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Lowry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>I challenge the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to deny that the Fianna Fáil Whip's office continues to liaise with Deputy Lawlor to ensure his presence for votes and that the Fianna Fáil Whip's office continues to ensure he goes through the lobbies in this House to support the Government parties in whatever votes of importance take place. I challenge the Minister to deny that. I do not believe he can deny that &ndash; in which case, Deputy Lawlor is not really an Independent Deputy. Like some other Members of this House, he is really provisional Fianna Fáil. He has joined Deputy Healy-Rae and others who support the Fianna Fáil party not simply for political reasons, but for self-preservation reasons.</P>
      <P>The time has come for this issue to be fully and properly addressed politically in this House and that is something the Government has sought to avoid. That the Government is prepared to remain dependent on these Deputies, that it is prepared to remain dependent on Deputy Lawlor, in particular, and that the Fianna Fáil Whip's office continues to liaise with Deputy Lawlor on votes in this House totally undermines statements made to this House by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 21 June last when the Second Stage debate commenced. He said: &ldquo;I wish to make it clear without equivocation or ambiguity that the Government on whose behalf I am bringing forward this tough new legislation will not tolerate corrupt behaviour or practices from wherever they emanate.&rdquo;  This Government will tolerate such practices provided the person engaged in those practices makes himself available to the Government on a daily basis to support it on crucial votes no matter what damage that person is doing to people's faith in our democratic institution or in politicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said: &ldquo;Deputies do not need me to remind them of the need to have in place effec<Col N="1055" /> tive laws to tackle corruption&rdquo;. We did not need to be reminded. It will take the Minister a year to complete Committee Stage of this Bill never mind to get it enacted. He went on to say:</P>
    <P>It is timely that we are debating this measure at this time. Charges of corruption levied against the few have the capacity in the public mind to taint everyone engaged in public life. Allegations and rumours of corrupt practices have a corrosive effect on public life with the result that public confidence in the entire system is undermined. Members of this House have a right to be concerned at the possible erosion of confidence in politics.</P>
    <P>Members on this side of the House have a right to be concerned that we have in place a Government contaminated by corruption which remains happy to be dependent in the voting lobbies of this House on the likes of Deputy Lawlor for its continued political existence. There is a very real difference between what this Government says and does.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that &ldquo;we must be concerned at the reports that have emerged [that is, the reports that have emerged before the tribunals] and we must be prepared to take action to ensure that confidence in the political system and in us as politicians is not lost.&rdquo; That required not merely tackling the Lawlor problem, the Foley problem or the other problems to which Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats wish to turn a blind eye. That also required that this legislation be given real priority and that this legislation was not political icing sitting on the Fianna Fáil cake to be brought out in public on occasions when there are embarrassing revelations before one of the sitting tribunals. It is no coincidence that we are taking this Bill this week at a time when Deputy Lawlor is being forced by the tribunal to openly admit some of the behaviour in which he has engaged while still wriggling out of trying to provide the tribunal with the comprehensive information to which it is entitled.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said: &ldquo;There can be no tolerance of corrupt practices within our political system.&rdquo;  He repeated that later in his speech. I do not believe anyone outside this House regards Fianna Fáil as a party intolerant of corrupt practices. Fianna Fáil was once described as a slightly constitutional party. The Fianna Fáil party as it is now operating in Government has no real commitment to political ethics and to removing corruption from politics but it is willing to engage in the appropriate verbiage at the appropriate moment when the public relations demands require that it be seen to have some slight commitment to tackling the problem of corruption.</P>
    <P>I regret that this Bill has not completed Second Stage. It should have completed Committee Stage at the justice committee and Report Stage in this House. It should have been through both Houses of the Oireachtas and should have become law. I wonder why it has not become law. I wonder <Col N="1056" /> whether there was a concern on the Taoiseach's part that if this Bill was enacted speedily through the House, it might place Deputy Lawlor in greater jeopardy with regard to criminal prosecution than he is in at present. I wonder was a tactical decision made to delay the enactment of this Bill to preserve the life of this Government. That is a very serious allegation but it is a serious issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not ever explained why there was a need to publish this Bill with a great rush of publicity at the beginning of January 2000 and why he has failed to have Second Stage completed in this House until the last day of Dáil sittings in 2000. Will he tell us how speedily he will bring the Bill before committee to process Committee Stage? What is the time frame for completing Report Stage of this Bill, for its passage through the Seanad and for it becoming law?</P>
    <P>Does it suit the Government that this Bill is not speedily enacted? Its provisions are of relevance to allegations of corrupt practices concerning the manner in which a Member of this House may have dealt with his financial dealings in the context of moneys and alleged business dealings outside this State. Does it suit the Government that it drags on until the next election is called or that it is enacted a few days before the Government decides to go to the country? Why has the Government been so reluctant and so slow to complete the legislative process of this measure and to give it the priority promised a year ago? I do not have the answer to that question but some of the suggestions I am making are reasonable.</P>
    <P>Why does this Government which wants to make a public pretence of cleaning up the political act of members of the Fianna Fáil party, bring this Bill out and dust it off now, since it sat on departmental shelves since last June when Second Stage commenced, to complete it in a restricted debate taking place on the last day of Dáil sittings in 2000? What hold does Deputy Lawlor have over the Taoiseach, the Government or member of the Government, other than trying to preserve a life line to ensure that when votes take place in the lobbies the Government survives those votes?</P>
    <P>Is there anything more to it? I do not know and I hope there is not. There is enough to say that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, if he is truly committed to tackling corruption, should in his reply to this debate on behalf of the Government, state that the Government no longer wishes to be in any way associated with Deputy Lawlor, that the Government does not wish to see Deputy Lawlor joining the Government parties in the lobbies on any vote in this House in the future and that Deputy Lawlor is no longer welcome to hold his offices on the Fianna Fáil floor. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should, in his reply, if he is truly committed to tackling corruption, state that the Government no longer wishes to be in any way associated with Deputy Lawlor, that it does not wish to see the Deputy joining the <Col N="1057" /> Government parties in the lobby on any vote in this House in future and that he is no longer welcome to hold his offices on the Fianna Fáil floor of this House. Deputy Lawlor should be told by Members of this House on all sides to defend himself in the tribunal in whatever way he sees fit, but he should no longer brazen it out in this House. The time has come for Deputy Lawlor to resign from this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche:</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the last contribution more with sadness than in anger. Deputy Shatter is a person of very considerable intellect and it is one of the great sadnesses of this House that a man with such considerable intellect should become so blinded and bitter, an incubus, turned in on himself, incapable of recognising the truth and inventing innuendo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy looking in the mirror?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Crawford will get his chance. I await that with interest because it will be as scintillating and sophisticated as everything else that trots out of his mouth.</P>
      <P>The reality is that Deputy Shatter is a person with a very considerable intellect and it is very sad that he comes in here like some sort of human muck spreader. Every time he opens his mouth we are regaled with the stench of hypocrisy. The stench of corruption is an issue that concerns us on all sides of the House, but the stench of hypocrisy and self-destruction should concern the Deputy also.</P>
      <P>It is, indeed, ironic that Deputy Shatter should come into this House and engage in a tactic that was invented in the 1930s by Mr. Goebbels. He invented the tactic that you create an illusion, you create an innuendo, you throw it out and you challenge your opponent to engage in a debate on that false hypothesis. We heard this false hypothesis several times during Deputy Shatter's contribution. He suggests there is no concern on this side of the House about corruption. He is lying because he knows that is not the case. He knows there are Members on this side of the House who are at least as honest and concerned about corruption as he is. However, he is not prepared to recognise that fact, which is sad.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also threw up the hypothesis that somehow or other there is a conspiracy in relation to the Bill being introduced late. He knows that is an invention, yet he challenged the Minister to engage in a debate on the false and hypocritical proposition he has put forward. That is sad because the Deputy has a lot to offer. He is a man of very considerable intellect. I do not say this in a patronising way, because I admire his mind, but I certainly do not admire the filthy tactics in which he engages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shatter is conveniently forgetful that he and his party are not at all choosy about political bedfellows. If they were, would they have engaged in Government in 1994-95 with a party <Col N="1058" /> that had never cleared itself of charges of not just political crimes but crimes against the State. Printing money is a crime against the State and we never heard about who transferred a printing machine from Cork to Gardiner Street. This did not matter a whit to Deputy Shatter because in reality at that time it behoved him to be blind on the issue and the political principle. The group with which Deputy Shatter was willing to get into bed at that time had also been engaged in a whole series of other issues. There were allegations of bank robbery and murder and allegations that have never been cleared from the old democratic left Sinn Féin-Workers' Party nexus. Of course, Deputy Shatter was not particularly interested in that.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in muck-raking over the past because people from that past have made a distinguished contribution to Irish politics and have a distinguished role to play. I am at least prepared to adopt what is a reasonable principle, that is, that you judge people individually by what they do rather than by some innuendo spread like muck across the entire body politic. Deputy Shatter does politics and democracy in this country absolutely no service by his bitterness, innuendo and untruthfulness and, above all, by the corruption of his own intellect. Corruption comes in many forms. It comes in the form of a politician who is willing to accept a brown envelope. It also comes through the corruption of intellect by a politician who is so disappointed that he has become turned in on himself. I say that not in anger but full of regret for a person I respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter's willingness to engage in the type of politics which totally ignores any kind of justice, prudence or adherence to the laws of decency that apply in most democracies should come as no surprise to us. This week we celebrate one of the most ignominious acts in the State when four men were dragged without trial or charge from Mountjoy Prison and executed by Deputy Shatter's party and forebears. These people were executed without the benefit of trial or due process. The fact that the Deputy and his party continue to engage in this type of political innuendo without due process should hardly be surprising. Nor should we be surprised by his adherence to Goebel's tactic because, as Deputy Lenihan pointed out in his contribution, they had a dalliance in the 1930s with fascism, and the politics and policies of fascism are still deeply ingrained in the party.</P>
    <P>I want to address most of my concerns to the Bill. I do not wish to engage in this type of debate because it is ultimately sterile and personally destructive of the Deputy, the House and me. We must both strive for something better for the people who deserve that we leave this type of politics behind. I will not sit here as a representative of the Fianna Fáil Party, a party with tens of thousands of decent and honest men and women, and listen to the kind of political filth that tripped across the Deputy's lips for the past 20 minutes. <Col N="1059" /> Shame on Deputy Shatter &ndash; this country and the people he represents deserve a lot better.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter was very anxious to ask how we in this party feel about Deputy Lowry. May I address to Deputy Shatter, through the Chair, the same question about Deputy Lowry he addressed to us about Deputy Lawlor? After all, the acting Chair and I sat through a by-election in 1995 and we know how it was funded, we know who wrote the cheques, we know who the paymaster was, we know the results of that paymaster's dalliance with the Fine Gael Party and we know the value of the £8,000 contribution made to that party in 1985 in County Wicklow. I do not believe that Deputy Shatter shares any personal blame for that, but Deputy Lowry was his party's paymaster general at the time. I now challenge Deputy Shatter to call on his party leader to call on Deputy Lowry to leave this House. If that proposition is right for Deputy Lawlor, it is equally right for Deputy Lowry. However, the reality is that every time this man with a considerable intellect speaks in this House he displays nothing more than his personal bitterness, his extraordinarily deep animus and his extraordinary hypocrisy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan raised a question which is not a bad one to ask the Fine Gael Party. How did they clear that massive debt in such a short time after coming to office? That deserves examination because, after all, the acting Chair will recall, as I do, that when Deputy Bruton had to go to a previous tribunal &ndash; I am not saying he perjured himself at the tribunal &ndash; he was economical with the truth and he was certainly wrong with the facts. None of us on this side of the House can deny there has been impropriety. There has been impropriety which has damaged this party. I personally engaged in an investigation of allegations about my party members last summer. This was a difficult and painful exercise but we engaged in it. At least it was an honest exercise. Deputy Shatter's party put together a hanging jury and is now prepared to engage with the very people it sought to hang.</P>
    <P>I will not go on in this vein because I find it too painful. Before we start pointing fingers at any side of this House we should be determined to clean up a collective act. Through all its history, the only thing the Fine Gael Party has contributed to this country is bitterness.</P>

      <P>That is true, neither of them has a foot in his mouth. That is the sole prerogative in that party for the party Leader. The reality is that the Leader of the party opposite has indicated that after the next general election he is willing to consider a position for his very best friend in the party. I came in here to speak on the Bill.</P>
      <P>Corruption is an issue that should concern us all and we should not engage in the kind of nonsensical debate in which we are engaged. The political reality is that the people believe we are all tainted whether that is our fault, the fault of those opposite or nobody's fault. This is good legislation and it contains issues that should be addressed as well as issues that should be strengthened. I refer the Minister to the specifics of the Bill. I am concerned that we are still dependent on 1906 legislation. That legislation was drafted in a different time and its focus is on corruption and blue collar crime. There is a need to revise that legislation and to look at white collar crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Corruption and suspicion of corruption is a fatal virus that has infected the body politic not only in this country but internationally. In surfing the website this morning I clicked on the words &ldquo;corruption in government&rdquo;. I got about 100 pages of listings, none of which was about Ireland. One of them, however, might be in the near future. The main reasons for the Bill, which are set out at paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) in the explanatory memorandum, are fine as far as they go. This is a relatively slight piece of legislation. We need a modern and comprehensive approach to this issue. In this House we need to be mindful of the requirement to clear the public consciousness on this matter. I suggest, as soon as the legislation is passed, we set up an anti-corruption committee that will produce some form of inspectorate to examine this issue. It is not today or yesterday that I have suggested this, I have said it on many previous occasions. Incidentally, I suggested it in 1994 when there was a drafting between the Labour Party and the Fianna Fáil Party. I believe something serious has to be done. An inspectorate has to be set up which would be controlled by this House and which would have the means and the funding to investigate speedily any allegations made about Members. We are all damaged and destroyed by such allegations. As Ireland has become richer, it has become a much meaner place. It has become a place where people are more envious, more greedy and more willing to break the rules. The Bill deals with the remedies and the punishments for corruption. I am not happy that they go far enough. We have reached the stage where the people expect a person to go to jail for corruption and I would like that to happen sooner rather than later. There <Col N="1063" /> needs to be a cleaning of the political warehouse and we need to show people we are serious.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with offences for bodies corporate. Undoubtedly this issue needs to be strengthened. There is no doubt that the issue of corruption in bodies corporate needs attention. We saw recently where one bank was alleged, and found guilty, of effectively pilfering small amounts out of thousands of individual accounts. Several other banks and financial institutions were effectively found guilty of treason against the State in perverting the taxation system. It is a reality under this Bill and under existing law that nobody will go to jail for that.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that we were drawn down a <i>cul-de-sac</i> of arid debate. Whether this legislation was delayed or not is something we could discuss. I do not believe Deputy Shatter believes there is some massive conspiracy and now it is produced at the last minute as a cleansing exercise. If he wants to delude himself that is his privilege. It is not up to me to disabuse him. What we can do is strengthen the legislation and it can be enacted speedily. We should sit down in this House and see what further remedies we need to put in place to regain the confidence we all want from the electorate.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an unwritten tradition in the House that the preceding Minister for Justice in the Department tends not to participate in justice debates, perhaps because of his or her knowledge of what goes on in the Department and lest information that should not be is placed in the public domain is revealed. However, I am moved to speak on this Bill to address a matter that has been in the news in recent days concerning the temporary release under the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, of the four killers of Garda Jerry McCabe. The same men also seriously injured Detective Garda Ben O'Sullivan. They killed a member of the Garda Síochána and attempted to kill a second one. It was done in a cold blooded, calculated way. It was not an accident, it did not happen by chance in the middle of a robbery. It happened when two members of the force were <Col N="1064" /> sitting in a car and men shot at point blank range into it with the clear motive of killing them.</P>
      <P>Every time a member of the Garda Síochána puts on a uniform or takes up duty in plain cloths or every time a prison officer puts on a uniform and takes up duty, he represents this country, symbolised by the harp on the uniform. They carry out a job of constitutional importance, to protect the security of the State. An attack on any such officer is an attack on each law abiding citizen. These four men did as much to us as citizens as they did to members of the Garda Síochána. That is why such crimes carried a penalty of death by hanging. In more enlightened years that has been changed to a life sentence of imprisonment for 40 years.</P>
      <P>These four men received between them prison sentences ranging from 11 and 14 years for killing in cold blood a member of the Garda Síochána and almost killing another member. At the time of their conviction we were told they would not come under the early release programme under the Good Friday Agreement. We were also told this within days of the signing of the Agreement. We took the Minister's and the Taoiseach's word in good faith. The widow of Garda Jerry McCabe, Mrs. Anne McCabe, did likewise.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister explain why there is not a suspicion of a lack of truthfulness &ndash; I will not go so far as to say of corruption &ndash;<Col N="1065" /> in the answers given in this House regarding the temporary release of the killers of Garda Jerry McCabe? Yesterday in the House the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace, speaking on behalf of the Minister, tried to link the public release of a person under the peace process, a widely known scheme, with the temporary release of four men convicted of the killing of a garda. It is beneath contempt to try to do that and I am very disappointed that the officials in the Department, for whom I have the greatest respect, were forced to include this in her reply to the House. They know it is not the same thing. At the time, Pearce McAuley was not convicted of the murder of a member of the Garda Síochána. He was released under a public programme.</P>
      <P>In the case of these four men the Minister has said they will not be released under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement but have been granted temporary release under the normal procedures. However, these are not being followed. From information I have obtained I know that if any of these four men made a request for leave or a privilege it does not go through the normal procedures. Prison officers do not have the same say with these men. Having been a Minister for Justice I know this to be the case. I know there are constant discussions with Sinn Féin and connections with the IRA. The kind of lenient treatment these four men are getting must have come from the discussions to keep Sinn Féin quiet. Only this morning the <i>Irish Examiner</i> reported a comment from the Chairman of Sinn Féin saying that these men should be included in the prisoner release scheme under the Good Friday Agreement. The Taoiseach and the Minister have rightly said these men do not come under the terms of the Agreement, but sadly, they have found another way to give them special treatment. I will continually repeat this, both inside and outside the House.</P>
      <P>There must be a reason men less than three years into their sentences were given granted this favouritism.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Justice, I know the advice I would have got if I had tried to give temporary release for whatever reason to a person who had killed a member of An Garda Síochána. I recall before I left office a person who had killed a member of An Garda Síochána and who was in prison for many years looking for temporary release for some reason and I was warned and advised not to grant it. I am certain from my knowledge of the Department that the action in the case of these prisoners would not have happened without the Minister knowing about it. It was not just an official down the line who knew about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been told the welfare officers were not consulted about whether the letters about sick relatives were genuine. The prisoners were found in compromising positions. These are murderers. Why were they not escorted like many other prisoners? Prisoners who are in prison for less hein<Col N="1066" /> ous crimes are escorted in handcuffs to visit their grannies, mothers and fathers in hospital and to meet in clergymen's houses and safe places from which they will not abscond.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government are standing over these temporary releases under the guise of compassionate leave. There may have been compassionate reasons but I want the truth from the Minister. I want to know if there is a special arrangement with Sinn Féin. Is it a case of doing this quietly and preparing them for eventual release when it is not a news item and no one is paying attention? Mrs. McCabe and her family are already suffering. I read a story in yesterday's newspaper that she was hassled and harassed in Dundalk by someone who told her they did not want her kind there.</P>
    <P>The Minister owes this House an explanation. These releases did not go through the normal procedure of the half sheet. If a half sheet was done, it went to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform faster or in a different way. I hope the Minister knows I am speaking from experience. I am convinced the Minister's arrangement is keeping the Sinn Féin people happy and that is what is behind this. We are talking about a Minister who said in an article in a newspaper in November 1996 that &ldquo;the Minister has absolute responsibility to discharge in an orderly and comprehensive manner all functions which come within the remit of her Department&rdquo;. If the shoe fitted me when I was Minister for Justice, it sure as hell fits the Minister now. He is not taking responsibility.</P>
    <P>In November 1997 five men, who were detained for possession of £3 million worth of cannabis, were released because the District Court judge, who extended the period of their detention, had not been properly nominated. They then went back into court and three of them, having been rearrested, had to be released again. This happened during the reign of a Minister who stood up in this House when the Dominic Lynch saga broke, which was a serious issue, and cried from the rooftops about the danger to the security of the State of releasing these men. They were re-arrested and convicted. However, these horrendous criminals, who the Minister said when he was on this side of the House would run rampant in the State committing further crimes, were among the first people to be released after the Good Friday Agreement. He quietly signed their release from prison.</P>
    <P>Who was the Minister in the first 22 weeks of this year when there were 28 violent deaths, stabbings in our prisons, prison officers abducted and prisoners absconding when out with prison officers on hospital or other types of visits? There were armed raids twice each week for the first two years.</P>
    <P>The Minister must take responsibility for his Department. I am not blaming the officials. The Minister has misled Mrs. McCabe and this House about the way in which these four murderers are getting special treatment. It is a disgrace. We <Col N="1067" /> need honesty about the special arrangement. I know there are private meetings with Sinn Féin. </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate on this important measure to combat bribery and corruption. The Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill represents one important element in the Government's strategy to put in place a code for the behaviour of those engaged in public life. Its focus is on tackling bribery and corruption. Other measures include the Local Government Bill and the Standards in Public Office Bill and these will be further supplemented by measures recently announced by the Taoiseach to provide greater transparency in public life. I will return to this matter shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill brings anti-corruption legislation up to <Col N="1068" /> date so that it can meet current challenges. I acknowledge that our current law in this area stretches back a long way, but the changes contained in the Bill will have the desired effect of dealing appropriately with those who fall below the standards demanded of us.</P>
    <P>The Bill achieves its aims by setting out a comprehensive list of persons who are subject to its provisions, including employees, Members of the Oireachtas, judges, members of foreign Governments or foreign Parliaments, members of the European Parliament and Commission and persons employed on behalf of a foreign public administration and providing that it will be an offence to corruptly accept or obtain or agree to accept or attempt to obtain, whether for personal benefit or for someone else's benefit, any gift, consideration or advantage as an inducement or reward for acting or refraining from acting in accordance with one's duty.</P>
    <P>It will also be an offence for any person to corruptly give, agree to give or offer any gift and so on with a view to influencing the person in performing his or her duty; making indirect corruption an offence, for example, where a spouse is given a benefit with the intention of influencing the office holder; granting jurisdiction to the Irish courts in cases where any element of the offence occurs in the State or where an Irish office holder or official is involved, wherever he or she is resident; creating a new offence of corruption in office which will criminalise activity aimed at obtaining personal advantage; establishing the liability of officers of companies for offences of corruption; increasing the maximum penalties for those convicted of the offence of corruption to an unlimited fine or ten years' imprisonment or both.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as well as improving on present anti-corruption laws, will allow Ireland to fulfil its international obligations by enabling ratification of three important conventions against corruption. These are the EU convention on the fight against corruption involving officials of the European Communities or officials of member states of the European Union, the OECD convention on combating bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions and the Council of Europe Criminal Law Convention on Corruption.</P>
    <P>Before replying to a number of issues raised during the debate, I want to inform the House of a number of important changes I propose to make to the Bill. Last May the Taoiseach offered the Opposition parties a unique opportunity to take part in an all-party committee to consider and propose measures to maintain confidence in the political system. The committee's task would have been to examine various proposals, including measures to prevent corruption in public office, and to report before the end of September with a view to enacting the necessary legislation before the end of the year. Regrettably, the Taoiseach's offer was rejected and the opportunity was squandered. Attempts to portray the <Col N="1069" /> Government as insincere in its approach to the issue of corruption are nonsense and the Bill is proof positive of our determination to root out the bad apples.</P>
    <P>If further proof was needed, Deputies need only look to the Taoiseach's recent announcement of a set of proposals to increase transparency and improve standards in public life. These include, in addition to the current Bill and amendments thereto, which I will outline shortly: provision for special accounts for political donations; limits to the size of donations; protection of whistleblowers; and regulation of lobbyists.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's announcement indicated that the prevention and prosecution of corruption was an integral part of the measures which the Government is taking regarding standards in public life. In line with this, I will be proposing a number of amendments on Committee Stage to strengthen the Bill's provisions. While the Government has yet to approve the details, I can inform the House that they will provide for the following matters.</P>
    <P>First, a new section will be inserted to provide that a presumption that a public representative has acted corruptly will arise in proceedings under the Prevention of Corruption Acts where it is proved that the public representative has failed to disclose a political donation and has acted such that the donor receives a benefit. Second, an amendment to provide for a presumption of corruption where proceedings are being taken under the Prevention of Corruption Acts against an office holder in relation to the exercise of certain functions and where there is proof that he or she received money or other benefit from a person who had an interest in the way those functions are exercised.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that in each of the cases covered by these amendments there is a connection between the receipt of money etc., by the public representative or the office holder and their actions such that the person giving the money receives some benefit. This is similar to the provision in the 1916 Act, but differs significantly from the Labour and Fine Gael proposals in this regard which, as I have previously pointed out, were too wide in their scope and, therefore, likely to present problems from a constitutional and European Convention on Human Rights standpoint. A third amendment will provide for immunity from civil liability for persons who report, reasonably and in good faith, suspicions of corruption.</P>
    <P>Contrary to Deputy Jim Higgins's statement, the Bill, as it currently stands, extends to bribery and corruption outside the public sector. The Deputy said that the Bill does not deal with corruption in the private sector, such as the banks and other institutions, including those in the semi-State sector. He said that it was confined solely to the public sector. Nothing could be further from the truth. If the Deputy had taken the time, which he clearly did not, to read the Bill properly <Col N="1070" /> he would have noted that the term &ldquo;Agent&rdquo; in section 2 includes &ldquo;any person employed by or acting for another&rdquo;. This clearly covers those operating in the private sector.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin referred to the presumption in the 1916 Act and the reversal of the burden of proof in cases covered by that Act. He argued that the presumption should apply in any circumstances where payment is made to a public official by a person who has a significant material interest in the outcome of a decision to be made by that official. He suggested that such an extension and the reversal of the burden of proof would be similar to the situation under section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, and the presumption that drugs were for sale or supply in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's reasoning fails to recognise, however, that the current presumption in the 1916 Act, like section 15 of the 1977 Act, operates in limited circumstances. In the case of the 1916 Act, the presumption only arises where there is a clear connection between the making of a gift and the award of a public contract. I have already mentioned the constitutional and European Convention of Human Rights difficulties of such a wide presumption as suggested and I have outlined my proposals regarding presumptions in certain circumstances, which I believe meets the Deputy's concerns.</P>
    <P>I might also mention at this point that, during my initial contribution and in relation to the inclusion of the President as a public official covered by the terms of the Labour Party's Private Member's Prevention of Corruption Bill, I indicated that this raised a constitutional issue in relation to the position of the President and the exercise of the functions of President. The opinion of the Attorney General was sought on the matter. Article 13.8.1 of the Constitution provides as follows:</P>
    <P>The President shall not be answerable to either House of the Oireachtas or to any court for the exercise and performance of the powers and functions of his office or for any act done or purporting to be done by him in the exercise and performance of these powers and functions.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General has advised that it is clear from the aforementioned Article that the only liability which the President could have in law is for an act done by the person of the President declaring himself or herself to be doing it in a private capacity where the act itself is in no way connected with the exercise and performance of the powers and functions of the office. Whatever liability might be placed on the person of the President, therefore, cannot be connected with the President as a public official. Accordingly, it would not be possible to include the President as a public official covered by the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter referred to events taking place before the tribunals established to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by politicians and <Col N="1071" /> others. Its seems strange that the House should go to the trouble of establishing these tribunals and agreeing the terms of reference by which they operate and then, in effect, seek to resolve these matters here.</P>
    <P>Why do we establish tribunals if the parties opposite insist on ignoring their remit? One answer is that those parties do not have to take the facts into account. The tribunals will establish the facts and then reach conclusions based on those facts. It is my view that we should leave them to their task. A further point to bear in mind, which Deputy Shatter and others have clearly forgotten, is that it is not only members of one party who are being investigated by the tribunals. Members of the Deputy's party also have very serious questions to answer. No amount of bluster can disguise that reality.</P>
    <P>The standards Deputy Shatter wants applied to Deputy Lawlor are in stark contrast to his own party's handling of events when the controversy involving Deputy Lowry first erupted. When Sam Smyth's story broke in the <i>Irish Independent</i> in November 1996 about Dunnes Stores' £208,000 refurbishment and extension to the then Minister Lowry's Tipperary home, Deputy Bruton, the Leader of Fine Gael, showed little of the concern he has displayed recently for high standards in public life. On that occasion, Deputy Bruton, the then Taoiseach, told an incredulous public that the story about Minister Lowry, as he then was, merited only &ldquo;a cursory glance.&rdquo;  Deputy Bruton then sought to pardon Lowry's tax evasion and suggested it was in some way all right because it took place before he became a Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Bill and I also welcome its provisions. As the Title suggests, the Bill provides for a wide range of miscellaneous provisions. The main provision concerns nursing homes with which I will deal later.</P>
      <P>The Bill amends the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act, 1988. I welcome the provision in this Bill but I have serious reservations about it. Does the Minister of State really believe that changing the age limit from 16 to 18 and increasing the fine from £500 to £1,500 will bring about any real change in what is happening on the ground? Schoolchildren have access to tobacco at will and without restrictions. As a former teacher I was aware that one could not prevent a young person from acquiring and smoking cigarettes.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the provisions in the Bill, I do not know if they are realistic. Will the Minister of State outline how he intends to monitor it? I am on record in this House as deploring the covert use of children by health board personnel to purchase cigarettes to catch shopkeepers in the act of selling cigarettes to an under age person. This is the only method by which prosecutions have been taken in the courts. However, we must rethink this approach as it is not right to use children to carry out the kind of act we are trying to prevent. What is the sense in this? Is it the only approach possible?</P>
      <P>The fine could be raised to £1 million but the provisions of the Bill will still be ignored. Even though the Bill will be on the Statute Book this activity will continue. The one opportunity the Government had to prevent this activity was to increase the price of tobacco and put it out of the reach of under age persons. The Bill increases the fine from £500 to £1,500 even though there is no possibility of fining anyone unless structures are put in place. Do such structures exist and how are they administered at ground level? They are not provided for in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statistics show that the age at which people start to smoke is decreasing and one does not have to go far from this House to see very young people smoking in public. Nothing is being done about this. Teachers can report such incidents but nothing will happen. I do not understand how the <Col N="1074" /> provisions of this Bill will be implemented. Past measures proved a total failure. We have to address this issue.</P>
    <P>There has been a great need for nursing homes and such homes are now being provided on a commercial basis. In the past nursing homes were run by various institutions and religious orders, but that element is now gone. There is a growth in the number of nursing homes providing services to the elderly.</P>
    <P>Standards in nursing homes have improved greatly in the past ten years. New, state-of-the-art, purpose-built nursing homes have been opened throughout the country and this is very welcome. These are commercial enterprises and must be seen as nothing else. However, there is a significant difference in standards between these new, private nursing homes and existing public nursing homes. The old nursing homes which are owned by health boards were housed in old buildings which, in many cases, were totally unsuited to the provision of services to the elderly. Many of these homes, which were known as county homes, were workhouses in famine times. The Western Health Board has gradually improved standards in one such building &ndash; St. Brendan's hospital, Loughrea &ndash; to a very high standard through replacement and refurbishment. I wish the same could be done to many such buildings.</P>
    <P>We could spend hours discussing the many horror stories we heard from the past. However, there is no comparison with the current service which is much improved. Having said that, there are serious problems in new nursing homes. The most serious problem is staffing and the cost of staffing. The introduction of minimum wage legislation caused staffing problems. The imposition of that has an effect on the cost of running nursing homes, although I am not complaining about its introduction. Combined with the increased cost imposed by that measure, there is a shortage of nursing personnel in nursing homes. It must be accepted that private nursing homes find it difficult to recruit adequate professional nursing staff. The consequence being that the ratio of professional nursing staff to the number of patients in private nursing homes is very low.</P>
    <P>For that reason I hope the Department of Health and Children will introduce an audit of excellence in the nursing homes. An inspection is an encompassing term in that it could mean the inspection of the physical building to ascertain the type and number of beds and standard of carpets, lighting and safety installations in private nursing homes. I am talking about a complete audit for nursing homes and what that would mean. It would include what I outlined on the physical side as well as the staffing ratios, which are important, and the quality and standard of food and medicine within the nursing home structure and their application and use.</P>
    <P>Coming from the background of being a medical practitioner, the Minister of State is aware that if patients in nursing homes need intensive care, the necessary staff are not in place to pro<Col N="1075" /> vide such care. Those patients in nursing homes who lack discretion are medically treated to quieten them or they are put to bed and given sleeping tablets to ensure everything is quiet.</P>
    <P>An independent audit of nursing homes is required. The only body that can provide the personnel to carry out such an inspection are the health boards. It is not that I do not have confidence in them, but there is a conflict of interest in that regard. Health board staff provide a health care service for the elderly and other health board personnel inspect private nursing homes. I have a difficulty with that. I hope the Minister of State recognises the necessity to put in place an independent audit mechanism to assess and accredit nursing homes throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that all is not dark regarding the delivery of health services to the elderly. A nursing home can be a home from home for many of our elderly. In the past in many rural areas many elderly couples lived in the home as part of the extended family, but, given that one or both partners have to work to make ends meet, the elderly are increasingly having to find accommodation in nursing homes.</P>
    <P>For that reason there is a need for a subvention. While the provision of a subvention in the Bill is welcome, it is totally inadequate. The three basic rates of £90, £100 or £120, at which the subvention will be paid are inadequate and even with the private contribution by the elderly of their pensions, most of their families face the burden of having to make up the shortfall, which is a significant burden at this time.</P>
    <P>That is why a new policy on this area, the winter initiative, was introduced by the Department of Health and Children. I find it peculiar in that the health boards are seeking accommodation in private nursing homes for the elderly who have occupied acute hospital beds. Those elderly patients are being moved a step closer to the home situation by way of the winter initiative under which the health boards have secured accommodation for them in private nursing homes. That is a peculiar turn of events. While it is welcome that those elderly people are not occupying acute hospital beds for an indefinite period, thereby releasing them for other patients, public hospital beds are not available for those elderly patients.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw to the attention of the Minister of State a situation in Tuam, County Galway, where there is a wonderful facility. As a Minister of State representing a constituency in the Western Health Board area, I hope he will ask the Minister to meet with the members of the Western Health Board and a delegation that has been waiting to meet him for the past six weeks to discuss this situation. I also ask him to ensure that the necessary funding is provided to guarantee the continuation of that valuable service in the Tuam area, the surrounding hinterland, into the Minister of State's county, Roscommon and north east Galway. The Bon Secours Hospital, as it was <Col N="1076" /> known in Tuam, provided an excellent service. When I meet the Minister as part of that delegation I will ask him to ensure the continued operation of that facility and that it be expanded and developed into a step down facility. While the Western Health Board has in the region of 60 beds under contract under the winter initiative, that facility is literally locked up. I cannot understand the wisdom of that. What is required is for the Minister to communicate with the health boards and the authorities that own that facility and for them to quietly and quickly get together to ensure the continuation of that important service. That facility could be utilised to the maximum, if it was opened tomorrow morning. I hope the Minister of State will use his good offices to ensure such a meeting takes place as a matter of urgency and that the Government provides the necessary funding to upgrade and continue the operation of that facility.</P>
    <P>I cannot let this opportunity pass without asking that there be a quick response to address the problems in A&amp;E departments throughout the country. I witnessed only last week a person who was left 28 hours on a trolley while awaiting an X-ray and the bandaging of an injured leg. Such delays should not be tolerated. The delay in the treatment of that patient was due to the lack of management. As has been said at various health board meetings and by the Minister, it is a major problem to throw money at the services without ensuring proper management of them. A root and branch investigation of the management of the services is required. There should be adequate staff in A&amp;E departments to direct patients to where they will receive treatment. That would reduce the numbers waiting in line and eliminate the need for keeping patients on trolleys. Personnel should point those in need of acute medical care in the right direction. If that was done, we would get a return for the huge amounts of money being spent on health, which is acknowledged. The delivery of money is one thing but there is no response in the form of an improved service on the ground. Waiting lists increase by the day despite the increased funding. Someone must be responsible for this mess. I hope the Minister of State responds to these issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this brief but important Bill. I am aware that there are two particular provisions in the Bill, one relating to tobacco and the other to nursing homes. Both of these issues have been debated at length on many occasions and they are of continuing importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the various tobacco provisions, we all support the toughest possible regulations to ensure that smoking becomes a thing of the past for most people. I am a member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children and the Minister of State will be aware that committee has done a lot of work on tobacco. We are concerned by the ever-increasing numbers of young people, particularly young women, who <Col N="1077" /> are taking up smoking. Any provision which will dilute the sale of cigarettes either over the counter or through vending machines must be fully supported.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that so many young people are smoking. There was progress in the late 1980s and early 1990s with getting people off tobacco but more and more young people seem to be reverting to it now. It is a social drug that became acceptable in the Ireland of the 1950s to the 1970s. Despite the maximum effort by Governments in the interim period, we have not succeeded in getting the message fully across &ndash; that cigarette smoking is one of the biggest killers in Ireland and that the associated diseases are very preventable. This Bill's provisions will, I hope, help in some small way to stem the tide.</P>
    <P>Legislation is only one side of the equation. We must also look at tobacco industry advertising. I welcome the recent changes in this area and the fact that it is now more difficult for the tobacco industry to advertise its products. However, it still has opportunities to promote tobacco in other sports, such as Grand Prix racing, which is probably the major vehicle for promoting cigarettes. This needs to be tackled more thoroughly by the authorities and I know the Minister, Deputy Martin, has been making efforts in this regard and has promised a total ban. He will find that difficult but we will support him in his efforts. It is the view of the Joint Committee on Health and Children that we must try to put in place a total ban on advertising and the display of cigarettes in any retail outlet and we must make it genuinely difficult for people not just to promote but to sell or purchase tobacco products. We are speaking of a compulsive drug which kills thousands of Irish people every year. I welcome this legislation in as far as it goes but there are other areas we must try to progress.</P>
    <P>The point has been made that nicotine substitute products are effective, even if they are not the answer to everyone's addiction problem. They are also quite expensive and I hope we can agree that these products should be available on medical cards. Many people who find it difficult to give up smoking are from a relatively poor financial background. They may have medical cards and if nicotine substitute products were available under the GMS system it would help thousands of people to give up cigarettes. The cost to the State would be more than offset in the long run by savings on the broader health front. Every person who smokes adds to national health costs, so for everyone we can take off cigarettes we will save money in the long run. I hope nicotine substitute products can be made available under the GMS system.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill's provisions for nursing homes, which are now an integral part of our system for caring for the elderly. Most of us deal with problems in our constituency that stem from the lack of nursing home beds. The joint committee has dealt with this matter from time to time and presentations have been made which suggest there is an adequate number of beds but that <Col N="1078" /> from a geographical perspective we do not have an adequate bed complement throughout the country. In my area of north and east Cork there is always a deficit of private nursing home beds. There are both supply and demand problems. The first thing we must do is recognise that private nursing homes play an increasingly important role in looking after our elderly. Even when the maximum subvention of £120, except in exceptional circumstances, is paid, that is still a small subsidy that the State is handing over, as the cost of a bed in a public, district or community hospital is much greater. That subsidy is good value for the taxpayer and the Department but I hope to see a big improvement in that subvention rate in the future. I know the Minister touched on this in his budget speech.</P>
    <P>The nursing home subvention system has been with us for quite a few years and the maximum rate did not increase, though costs have obviously increased dramatically in recent years. There is no nursing home now in which the £120 subsidy plus an old age pension would cover weekly costs. I hope we see major improvements in this regard.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that in the Budget Statement there were not more measures either to assist people to care for the elderly at home or to provide more nursing home places. Obviously, an increased subvention rate will be helpful in this regard but we must also consider tax incentives on a broader front. The best solution would be to ensure the maximum number of people are cared for in their own homes. The carer's allowance is a step in the right direction regarding care in the home but, at a risk of repeating what I am sure every speaker has said, the carer's allowance is simply insufficient in many cases.</P>
    <P>There was a change in the means test announced in the budget statement last week. The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health and Children assured us that about 5,000 more people will now qualify for the carer's allowance. I welcome that but it is only a small step out of many which should be taken. More than 100,000 people, at the very minimum, are providing full-time care to elderly people in their own homes and are not getting any assistance from the State. If we reflect on how much it would cost if all of those people could be transferred into a State system of care, we will recognise that home carers are not just doing a great social service for their families and communities but are saving the Exchequer million of pounds per week. They have not received a good or fair deal from any Government. Every political party in this House is guilty but now that significant resources are available, we must try to reach out to those people and give them the sort of resources they need, financial and otherwise. It is an integral part of the issue of care for the elderly. The Minister as a general practitioner knows that where people can be cared for at home, it is by far the best solution. However, we must put incentives in place. I hope through tax allowances and an <Col N="1079" /> adequate carer's allowance we can make major progress over the next 12 months. The budget proposals are a step in the right direction but we must go much further.</P>
    <P>On the subject of the nursing home regulations and subventions, I must reflect on the recent case in County Cork. I do not know any of the people involved but that case resulted in a nursing home proprietor being sentenced to a term of imprisonment for apparently breaching some of the regulations. All the local evidence indicates that the level of care in that nursing home was outstanding and the level of commitment offered by the proprietor and her staff was second to none. However, she was in breach of some minor technical regulations. One or two nursing homes in my constituency were closed down because of similar difficulty in meeting regulations in relation to the number of full-time nursing staff.</P>
    <P>I am aware of one case where the proprietor of the nursing home tried unsuccessfully for weeks to find alternative accommodation for people who, in many cases, had been with her for years. The nursing home proprietor and her family were emotionally distressed, first, at having to close their facility which had provided outstanding service and second, at having to find alternative accommodation for people who did not wish to go elsewhere. When we put regulations in place we must try to see the human side of the problem as well as the legal side. We must try to ensure that people with nursing homes today are given the maximum time, assistance, grant aid and tax reliefs where they are required to upgrade and to maximise their facilities. There is a growing need for private nursing homes. They are part of the solution to the wider issues of care for the elderly and they need whatever support and assistance we can give.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their overall welcome for the Bill and their response which has been generally constructive. I look forward to an interesting debate on the detail of the Bill on Committee Stage. I will comment on some matters raised by Deputies relating to the contents of the Bill on a section by section basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the purposes of section 1 of the Bill is to better provide for the provision of community pharmacy services in the context of section 59 of the Health Act, 1970 as a whole. Deputy Mitchell referred to the community pharmacy contractor agreement between community pharmacy contractors and health boards and, in particular, to clause 9 of that agreement. As the Deputy indicated, clause 9 provides for a review by the pharmacist of a medicine therapy of the patient for whom the prescription is issued. This review includes screening for any potential drug therapy problems and the pharmacist shall offer to discuss with the patient or carer all matters which the pharmacist, in the exercise of his or her pro<Col N="1080" /> fessional judgment, deems significant. I agree with Deputy Mitchell that this is an important element of the kind of quality pharmaceutical care envisaged in the contractor agreement as a whole. To facilitate clause 9 coming into effect properly, the contractor agreement itself contained a requirement for the initiation of a programme of continuing education for pharmacists engaged in the delivery of community pharmaceutical services. A centre for continuing pharmaceutical education was established since the new contract came into being and much of the focus of the centre so far has been concentrated on facilitating pharmacists in meeting their obligations in regard to clause 9 and in advancing the quality of care message underpinning clause 9.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus spoke of the key role of the community pharmacist in primary care and about regulations which provide a system to regulate the granting of pharmacy contracts in accordance with public health criteria. These regulations specify the criteria and procedures under which the chief executive officer of a health board shall determine the issue of new community pharmacy contractor agreements for the provision of community pharmacy services under the Health Act, 1970. They regulate the granting of contracts with a view to bringing Ireland into line with other EU or EEA States where such controls exist in one form or another, improving standards in existing pharmacies and promoting patient access to pharmacy services in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The regulations came into force in tandem with the introduction of a new contract, as mentioned by Deputies in the debate, for the provision of community pharmacy services under the Health Act, 1970. This contract is pro-active in promoting a quality driven service to the patient. In addition, the contractor agreement is designed to improve the quality of services by encouraging greater investment in the pharmacy and facilitating the involvement of a greater number of pharmacists in a given pharmacy.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the view that the Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations, 1996 may appear at first glance to be anti-competitive. However, I argue strongly that the usual free market rules of competition cannot apply to health care and, an unregulated system, in addition to being out of step with arrangements elsewhere in Europe, would lead to a diminution of the quality of professional community pharmacy services with greater emphasis inevitably being placed on the non pharmacy aspects of the business. In this context, I also argue that the provisions of the regulations in regard to determining definite public health need for community pharmacy services are a necessary component in the advancement of a quality service for the public and that the definition of definite public health need in the regulations is designed to prevent the further clustering of community pharmacies, to the detriment of the service, in areas already provided with pharmacies <Col N="1081" /> while promoting the establishment of pharmacies in areas not currently served.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus and Deputy Ring referred to specific applications for community pharmacy contractor agreements which had been refused by the relevant chief executive officer of the relevant health boards. These are a matter in the first instance for the chief executive officer of the health board concerned. The regulations, however, provide for an appeal to the Minister where an application has been refused on the basis that a definite public health need has not been established under the regulations. In the two cases mentioned by Deputies, the decision of the chief executive officer is the subject of an appeal to the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and it would not, therefore, be appropriate for me to comment any further at this stage.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions to this debate and for their broad welcome of the anti-smoking measures outlined in the Bill. We are all agreed that the battle against smoking is one of the most important public health challenges facing us in the new millennium. This is one of the Minister's main priorities. Deputy Burke raised the issue of policing tobacco sales. Additional staff resources were provided to health boards in the recent budget to improve compliance with the law. The tactic of using children, with their parent's or guardian's consent, has been successful in improving compliance with the law. The Western Health Board has employed this tactic and the publicity generated by successful convictions has proved a deterrent to shopkeepers.</P>
    <P>As I stated in the House last month, the report Towards a Tobacco Free Society launched by the Minister on 7 March this year recommends, among other matters, raising the age limit at which tobacco products can be sold to young persons to 18 years as does the report of the Joint Committee on Health and Children on smoking and health published in November 1999. The proposed amendment to the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act, 1988, will have the effect of raising the age from 16 to 18 years and will raise the maximum fine on persons convicted for selling to underage persons from £500 to £1,500. The Government, at its meeting on 3 October 2000, approved the drafting of the heads and general scheme of a Bill to give effect to the proposals in the report Towards a Tobacco Free Society. Work is urgently under way in my Department to prepare a comprehensive tobacco Bill which will take on board many of the other proposals recommended in the report.</P>
    <P>The Minister also announced last week that, with effect from 1 April 2001 and in line with the recommendations of the advisory forum for the implementation of the cardiovascular strategy, he will be making nicotine replacement therapy available to medical card holders. This was raised by Deputy Bradford whom, I am sure, will be happy with that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1082" /> Deputy McManus referred to the contracting of private nursing home places as part of the winter initiative recently announced by the Minister, as did Deputy Burke. As previously explained, this includes the contracting of over 500 additional nursing home places which will allow for a greater throughput of patients and will alleviate the pressure on acute services over the winter period. A major factor affecting the ability of hospitals to provide beds for patients over the winter period is the high number of acute beds which are inappropriately occupied by patients who have completed the acute phase of their illness. Many of these patients are in the older age category and require a further level of care in a more appropriate environment.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 12,600 private nursing home places of which approximately 7,100 are either subvented or contracted by health boards. The initiative which the Minister recently announced will provide at least 500 additional nursing home places over and above the 7,100 places. This represents a more than doubling of the number of additional places provided under previous initiatives. These places are being made available exclusively for patients from public hospitals who have completed the acute phase of their treatment in general hospitals and who require to be cared for in less acute settings. Additional management resources have also been provided to enable health boards to manage this initiative to ensure the optimum use of the extra contracted places. Health boards are now in the process of contracting these additional nursing home places.</P>
    <P>As part of the winter initiative, approximately £1.5 million has been provided this year for the purchase of medical aids and appliances for older people. This will facilitate the discharge of older persons from hospital and also support them in remaining in their own homes. These supports will include a range of items such as walking aids, wheelchairs, special beds and other supports in the home. This initiative will run during the winter period at both the beginning and end of 2001 and, in this regard, an additional £10 million has been made available.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of responsibility for standards in private nursing homes which was raised by Deputy McManus and Deputy Burke, the Nursing Home (Care and Welfare) Regulations, 1993, were made under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990. These regulations set out the standards which nursing homes must meet to fulfil the conditions for registration by a health board. They cover a number of issues including welfare and well being of patients, contract of care, personal possessions, staffing, accommodation and facilities together with inspections by designated officers. It is a matter for each health board to ensure that the regulations are complied with.</P>
    <P>Article 11 in the care and welfare regulations relating to accommodation and facilities states that the registered proprietor and the person in <Col N="1083" /> charge of the nursing home shall ensure that the maximum number of persons to be maintained in the home and the maximum number of persons to be accommodated in shared rooms in the nursing home shall not exceed a number for which the nursing home is registered by the health board. This article further provides for adequate space, lighting, heating, equipment, bed and bedding, etc. The health boards are empowered under the regulations to enter and inspect nursing homes not less than once in every period of six months. There is no limit to the number of inspections which may be carried out. The Act provides for penalties in the event of a breach of the regulations. I note Deputy Burke's comments regarding an independent inspection. We will look at that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputies McManus and Ring raised the issue of the application of inspection procedures provided for in the Nursing Homes Act to health board extended care facilities. At present, there are no statutory provisions regarding standards in residential facilities for older people operated by health boards. As the House will be aware, a social services inspectorate was set up on an administrative basis last year. The plans for the inspectorate were that it would concentrate for the first three years on child care and, in particular, on children's residential centres run by health boards. In the longer term, it is planned that the work of the inspectorate will be extended to cover the full range of personal social services provided by the health boards, including residential care services for older people.</P>
    <P>Access to induction courses for foreign nursing staff was referred to by Deputy Batt O'Keeffe. Funding has been made available to the Health Service Employers Agency to employ a nurse manager to co-ordinate the provision of supervised clinical placement for nurses recruited from abroad. Nurses from the Philippines and certain other non-EU countries are required to undertake such placements prior to registration with An Bord Altranais.</P>
    <P>The recruitment of nurses from abroad is helping to ease staffing difficulties across a range of health care settings. However, some problems have arisen regarding the availability of supervised clinical placements. This Government is determined that nurses requiring such placements will be provided with them. The Health Service Employers Agency co-ordinator will have a nationwide remit in ensuring the availability of sufficient clinical placements.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children met representatives of An Bord Altranais last week to discuss the need for greater flexibility in relation to clinical sites where nurses from abroad may undertake their supervised placements. We are confident that the board will respond positively to the proposals made. This Government is prepared to provide funding to teaching hospitals involved in the provision of supervised clinical placements in respect of the salary of a clinical <Col N="1084" /> co-ordinator for the duration of such placements. Since this is the biggest single cost element, the availability of funding to cover it will greatly reduce the overall cost to agencies such as nursing homes which are recruiting nurses from non-EU countries.</P>
    <P>As far as tackling the abuse of older people is concerned &ndash; Deputy Ring referred to this &ndash; Deputies will be aware that a broad based working group has been established to advise on the formulation of procedures and guidelines on elder abuse. The group is chaired by Dr. Desmond O'Neill, consultant physician in medicine of old age. The working party has a broad remit in regard to making regulations as to how elder abuse can best be overcome by advising on appropriate structures, including any necessary changes in legislation and legal procedures to deal with the problem. I have made the necessary resources available to enable this group to complete the comprehensive work programme which it has set out and which includes the organisation of pilot projects, the implementation of awareness and training programmes and the preparation of an evaluation report.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the working group has reached agreement on draft practices, procedures and guidelines for the detection, assessment and management of elder abuse. Pilot projects in two community care areas are expected to start from January next. Training programmes will be provided for staff members and ongoing evaluation will take place. When the working group makes its final report and recommendations to me, I will give immediate consideration to the implementation of the group's recommendations.</P>
    <P>In regard to the issue of subvention rates, which was raised by Deputies Ring, McManus and Bradford and others, I would like to point out that in the Action Programme for the Millennium, this Government gave a commitment to increase the rates of subvention and Deputies will be aware of the recent announcement regarding the intention to increase rates by 25% with effect from 1 April 2001.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies will support the necessary changes to the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which will facilitate the management of appropriate standards and the effective operation of the schemes. That covers most of the issues raised during this debate. I thank Deputies for their assistance and their remarks during the debate. We will look at them further on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>Anything to do with youth and how they can be better educated for the future is certainly a step forward. This Bill will help the VEC and other groups to improve the education of youth in difficult areas. Youth work is defined in the Bill as a planned programme of education that is designed for the purpose of aiding and enhancing the personal and social development of young persons through their voluntary participation and which is complementary to their formal academic or vocational education and training provided primarily by the voluntary youth work organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill would be much more relevant if children in second level education were sure they would get an opportunity to study and to sit their examinations. I advise the Dáil of the extremely serious situation in which many students at inter<Col N="1086" /> mediate and leaving certificate levels find themselves with the indefinite ASTI strike. It will have major implications for children this year. The year 2001 will certainly go down in history as one of the most serious setbacks for young people in education if this dispute is not settled.</P>
    <P>I received hundreds of letters and one from anxious parents of pupils in St. Aidan's comprehensive school in Cootehill questioning what this Government is doing about the serious problem where young people are being kept away from school. I got a telephone call from a business person in Castleblayney who has built up a tremendous industry there and who is involved in community work. He is also a parent. Some 700 pupils in Castleblayney are affected by this strike. While this Bill will help to improve the lot of disadvantaged children, it is hard to see how it will deal with the serious problem the Minister for Education and Science and this Government are allowing to continue at every level. I just telephoned home and heard that a parent was sitting in my house. </P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Crawford, it is not relevant. The Chair will accept a passing reference. You cannot debate something that is in the realm of another Minister when that Minister is not here. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Leas-Cheann Comhairle goes home, he will certainly get the same representations I have got, that is, that this dispute be brought to an end. I have no intention of disobeying the Chair. As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be aware, one of my colleagues was told to leave the House today on another issue equally relevant. I am making a request on behalf of parents, families and children that this dispute be settled as quickly as possible and that as little damage as possible be done to young people.</P>
      <P>The VEC has a major role to play and it plays no less a role in Cavan-Monaghan than anywhere else. It has tried to do all it can for youth in its educational efforts. I am thinking especially of Tannin Outdoor Pursuit Centre where many young people from schools both North and South receive some training. However, that VEC sponsored outreach centre is limited because of a lack of funding and help. I hope that situation will be improved dramatically in the not too distant future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>County Monaghan has the second or third lowest number of pupils in third level education. This is partly because of the economic difficulties of sending students from low income families to Dublin or elsewhere. The maintenance grant has not been increased as it should have been and even the means test for that grant needs to be <Col N="1087" /> looked at as a matter of urgency. For that reason, this Youth Work Bill has more relevance to Monaghan and Cavan than most other counties.</P>
    <P>I would like to make sure that when we look at a VEC development plan, areas like furniture and the food industry are seriously examined. They are two of our major industries and there is not sufficient local training to make sure that young people who do not go on to third level receive proper skills and qualifications. I met two young men in the meat business. They have set up a business where boners work on contract. They said their biggest problem is that they cannot get qualified young people here. Under some of the schemes run by FÁS, young people go into meat factories but when they receive a certain amount of training, the meat factories offer them full-time employment and they do not finish their course and get proper qualifications. We must ensure young people are allowed finish their training courses and obtain proper qualifications as boners and so on. This is not a problem when times are good but people need certification at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the furniture industry. We have one of the most vibrant furniture industries in the country. Furniture is mainly manufactured in Monaghan, Meath and Louth, yet young people must go to the deep south to obtain qualifications. That issue must be dealt with within the VEC or some other structure. To maintain quality, it is important that people do not have to go elsewhere for training.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Crawford for sharing his time with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill which seeks to provide on a statutory basis for youth work programmes and services run by the Department of Education and Science and the vocational education committees. The Bill will not significantly change the current arrangements for youth work services but it will put them on a statutory basis. I have been a member of a vocational education committee for almost 21 years. As a former member of a VEC, the Minister of State will recognise the tremendous work done by vocational education committees over the years to develop this service. This service was provided at a time when resources were very scarce and accommodation was almost non-existent. The chief executive officers and members of the vocational education committees recognised the need to take on the task of providing for the disadvantaged in society when no other institutions within the educational sector were prepared to do so. Since 1974, vocational education committees in County Galway have provided youthreach programmes, adult literacy programmes and training centres for the disadvantaged and Travellers. Were it not for the vocational education committees, generations of young Travellers would not have had any training. We all recognise how difficult it is to provide <Col N="1088" /> formal education for members of the Traveller community. The efforts and cajoling of adult education officers throughout the country to encourage young Travellers into education, even in a basic way, must be welcomed and acknowledged. I welcome the fact that we are putting much of the work done in the past on a statutory basis. Given the provisions in the Bill, will the Minister of State indicate whether vocational education committees will receive a separate budget to implement these initiatives? It is important that the funding is not subsumed in the allocation for local schemes.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to young people from the age of ten to 21. Will that encroach on the formal education of ten year olds who may be involved in primary education for a few more years? From then on they may be involved in second level education. Some young people may not be involved in formal education, despite the fact that this is necessary. Is the Minister of State talking about a parallel support scheme in this instance? If so, it is very welcome, particularly for the disadvantaged in society. As a teacher, I know that young children who come from difficult backgrounds, through no fault of their own, may find it difficult to concentrate and confine themselves within the formal education structures that are in place. I welcome support for these young people but the form it will take must be clarified. It must be approached sensitively so that it will not encroach on the efforts and endeavours for formal education at primary level or the early stages of second level education.</P>
    <P>The Minister must make every effort not to antagonise the secondary teachers and bring them back on board because he totally misread the situation. As a member of the ASTI, I am aware that the voluntary work done by so many secondary teachers was never part of their contract. It was never part of my contract. If the Minister acknowledged that fact, it would go a long way towards sorting out the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>That issue does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. It is important that the Minister withdraws the threat to deduct payment for the days teachers were working to rule. If he withdraws that threat, perhaps the dispute could be resolved and teachers could get on with the important task of teaching.</P>
      <P>We must acknowledge in the legislation the work of the voluntary youth federations throughout the country. They must have a parallel support, a support of partnership, so that this valuable work can continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister of State will comment on the fact that there is no board of management in any of the institutions such as the youthreach programmes, the adult literacy programmes and so on. There is just one board of management, that is, in the training centres. A board of management may not be necessary on an ongoing <Col N="1089" /> basis but there should be some management structure for all the services. The Bill provides that where this does not exist, a committee of between 12 and 24 people will be provided for. This will be important for all the institutions.</P>
    <P>It is widely known that for all the Youthreach centres, accommodation was always a problem. Many of the training centres were accommodated within the most basic structures. However, because the committees and the teaching staff were determined to provide a service to those people, they more or less ignored the conditions of the accommodation. That was in the past in the initial stages of growth and development. It is time the Department recognised those people for what they have done by providing adequate accommodation and facilities. Does the Bill provide for funding for the improvement of facilities?</P>
    <P>Many of the training centres throughout Galway and probably elsewhere are in buildings which are totally unsuitable, often lacking basic facilities such as toilets, adequate heating and health and safety requirements may not be up to standard. If we are determined to acknowledge the important work being done in helping and training the disadvantaged, proper facilities should be put in place. In many areas groups were lucky where vocational schools were vacated, because of amalgamations, or a new structure was provided. Many other groups were not so lucky and had to be accommodated in back street yards of premises used for storage, manufacturing or whatever. That has to stop because it sends out the wrong signals about training for the disadvantaged if they are not entitled to similar standards and facilities as those in mainstream education. I ask the Minister to make a huge effort in this area.</P>
    <P>After one has gone through those centres some facilities should be provided for students of exceptional ability who have responded positively. They should be given some recognition and, perhaps, channeled into third level education if they so wish. If they have the ability and the determination to lift themselves from the past, places should be reserved for them in some of the third level institutions. That would be a worthy reward for the endeavours not only of the students but of those who have trained them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Youth Work Bill, 2000. It is an important Bill given the amount of voluntary work, structures and organisations that exist under the remit of the VEC. They play an important role in the development of local communities and youth services. Section 17 deals with the national youth work advisory committee. That committee will advise the Minister on such matters as the provision and co-ordination of youth work programmes, youth work policies, co-ordination of youth work and formal education, co-ordination of youth work and services for young people and so on. The establishment of that committee is important as is the <Col N="1090" /> appointment of an assessor of youth work. Under the provisions of section 16, the Minister is empowered to appoint the assessor. I would like this to be part and parcel of what will actually happen. Empowering the Minister is one thing but I would like the Minister to take that function on board and ensure the assessor of youth work is put in place. One of the functions of that person will be to advise, monitor work programmes and, perhaps, evaluate them. Through that work he may be able to carry out audits in various counties and link the activities of one county to another. Where there is a deficit in one county in terms of activity or financial investment that would be brought to the attention of the Minister and the national youth advisory committee. The necessary steps could then be taken to ensure an equity of spend throughout all counties, thus ensuring that no county is left behind because of inaction or lack of funding.</P>
      <P>In view of the expansion of the role of the youth work advisory committee and the various activities which will now have to be undertaken by the VEC there will be a need for a huge investment in youth services. A three-year plan instead of a one-year plan is essential. Currently, throughout the different counties, including Carlow and Kilkenny, a spend is put in place which is provided from year to year. The officers in the field, the youth clubs and organisations in the various counties realise the importance of being able to plan into the future. They realise that a three-year term is needed to focus on the investment required for those three years. There is a need for those in the Department to understand that three-year plan and to fund it. All of this will lead to extra bureaucracy and I hope in the course of implementing the Bill and investing in our young people that the money will not be taken up in new bureaucratic structures through the involvement of more personnel. The money should be used by the current structures and more money should be provided for the delivery of youth services in each county. The existing programmes which are doing well but are starved of cash should be enhanced.</P>
      <P>While the various sections of the Bill are to be commended, the cost effectiveness of the new structures must be monitored. We must ensure the money goes beyond that structure and into the field of activity which is looked after largely by volunteers. The Bill will encourage greater openness and transparency and will bring everybody on board in terms of the VEC. It has the potential to bring greater equity in funding to the various counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are benefits in revising the structures at county level. The Bill refers to the VEC and the structures required. Where a satisfactory structure for the delivery of the services is already in place and functioning properly and supported locally there would be a flexibility to keep it in place and not to create some other structure which is just another layer of bureaucracy. We should get straight down to the meat of the busi<Col N="1091" /> ness and acknowledge the work that has already been done.</P>
    <P>Such a structure exists in Carlow town, where there is a limited company supported by the various groups and organisations and which is pushing forward in the whole area of youth development. I would like to see that maintained and those structures adopted under the Bill.</P>
    <P>The funding of the Bill is mentioned in different sections. I referred last night during the budget debate to the fact that a central youth facility is needed to draw together all the activities and spending within County Carlow. The organisations in the county have put forward a proposal for such a central youth facility, which would deliver a youth information service and include a youth café, and an outreach service for unattached young people. Programmes which have been established, with workers in place, could be housed in that building. It would also include a counselling service for young people, a drug abuse prevention service, a special area based project worker, other services to be identified after consultation with the other interested parties, networking facilities and youth arts.</P>
    <P>That is the programme that they have set for themselves. That they need £1.5 million in capital to refurbish that building means they are currently at crisis point. As this Bill encourages youth organisations to go down that road, a mechanism should be put in place whereby bodies like the Carlow youth services, which want to access a £1.5 million refurbishment spend, would be in a position to avail of the 63% increase in the new capital funding that is available under the budget.</P>
    <P>If that could happen, they could, in partnership with the local agencies which have already been established and the county council, which owns the building, achieve a building and a service centre that would be at the cutting edge of youth development in that county and would be a centre of excellence for what could happen, not only in Carlow town but throughout the county. It is essential for a mechanism to be put in place to enable such a capital spend to be accessed, where the energy and the plan is available locally.</P>
    <P>Carlow is unique in that it does not have a youth information service. I have already spoken about the equity in the services that are delivered. Most other counties have such a service. It is referred to in various sections in the Bill. Carlow has applied for such a service but it has not been delivered.</P>
    <P>There is a need for disadvantaged project youth workers in Carlow town. I have looked at the system in other counties, where the programmes in place in highly populated areas refer to &ldquo;disadvantaged areas&rdquo;. Areas that require youth workers, but which are not disadvantaged according to the criteria of the scheme set down by the Department, do not qualify and cannot readily access the funds available for youth workers for disadvantaged areas. As a result, <Col N="1092" /> there is one youth worker in Carlow town who is serving a huge population, although there is a requirement for two more.</P>
    <P>I ask the Department to look at the applications from places such as Carlow town and to bring them up to speed with what is happening nationally and being achieved elsewhere, so that there will be a level playing field for youth development. There is a need for the Department to commit itself, in terms of the new developments in the Bill, to approving a youth worker for disadvantaged sections of Carlow every year for three years.</P>
    <P>We need to focus on what is being achieved in rural Ireland for young people. The Ossory youth services in my county of Kilkenny are well structured. However, they are dealing with a huge and ever increasing population and huge demands are placed on the time of the voluntary workers involved. Nine staff are involved in administration there. They receive a grant of £94,000 which should be increased, although it is only one of many grants that can be accessed. There is a £20,000 shortfall at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I am giving that example so that the Minister can look at what currently needs to be funded. I accept what is in the Bill and the requirements under it. We need to fast track many of the funding applications received by the Department from many of these counties.</P>
    <P>On the issue of rural youth workers, in my county of Kilkenny in recent days we received further funding of £30,000 for Callan and Castlecomer. There is one youth worker involved in those two population centres, which are at opposite ends of the county. Money is there for a youth worker but there is no money for the back-up services and training required to ensure that worker is able to travel to the various centres, put in place programmes, motivate the volunteers and get the job done for young people there. The salary is there but the other funding is not. We must address this.</P>
    <P>There are 12 clubs in County Kilkenny but 20 are needed. If these clubs were properly funded through the youth services and all their programmes had some way of being audited and being found to be good quality, much more would happen for young people. However, what happens is that these young people meet in fairly spread out rural areas around my county &ndash; and I know the same is true of many other counties &ndash; and have to immediately get involved in fund raising.</P>
    <P>While that is a way of generating activity, bonding people together at local level and achieving a certain amount of youth activity, it does not address the reason for having youth services and why those people volunteer, which is to make far more young people responsible within their communities. They are educated through the youth services about civics and the importance of their community. It is too easy for young people to become involved in drink, drugs and many other areas of activity which are not recommended and <Col N="1093" /> are causing serious social problems on the margins of this country. This youth activity breaks that cycle and is the way forward. That is why I welcome this Bill and am highlighting the deficiencies in the current structure.</P>
    <P>There is a need to train young people in various skills and to improve the skills of the volunteers. The training fund Bill and the education council Bill referred to the need for lifelong training and education. There is a need for the people who volunteer for these services to be skilled up, not just in youth activities but in the broad spectrum of education, so that we can give our young people a meaningful role in mainstream activities in their schools and local communities. There is under staffing in this area, but qualified people are working in the field. They must be given the finance and the wherewithal in their structures to be able to move from where they are and acquire new skills through re-education and continuing education. They can then pass on these skills to those involved on a voluntary basis who will pass them on to the young people.</P>
    <P>A youth worker in Kilkenny city covers an area where in one housing estate there is 68% unemployment. In another area a similar proportion of young people are dropping out of school at an early age. This youth worker should be given the proper resources to deal with such problems. There is no building or community centre within reach of a group of 500 houses where young people can come together and participate in youth activities. That must be addressed, as must the deficit in the skills area and the personnel on the ground.</P>
    <P>A youth worker can do many things to break cycles and can help young people who are not geared towards mainstream education but who want to work in some way, be it through the arts or through different niches within their communities where they can develop their characters, personalities and skills. At present they are unable to do this because they are being allowed to stray without anybody to look after them. This is where youth workers are needed. The youth worker in Kilkenny city, to whom I have referred, could do with the help of at least two others working together with the appropriate resources in terms of administration and so on to meet the daily challenges that arise in local communities.</P>
    <P>Much work needs to be done, including with the volunteers and involving the families. There is a need to involve as many parents as possible in the whole area of youth activity. There is also a need to open our eyes to rural areas that are suffering neglect. The Bill will go some way to establishing the necessary structures. I hope the assessor of youth work will be in a position to examine the plans from the VEC and ensure they are implemented and funded on a priority basis to the extent that they will achieve significant work on the ground and remove some of the serious difficulties we experience with young people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1094" /> I commend the Bill. The functioning structures on the ground &ndash; I have mentioned some in Counties Carlow and Kilkenny &ndash; should be funded to a far greater extent. I hope the huge allocations of funding outlined in the budget will be diverted to areas where there is a plan in place and where there is the most need. Following the fulfilment and extension of the existing plans, I hope the funding will be provided for the buildings required &ndash; I mentioned the one in Carlow &ndash; perhaps in partnership with the local authorities through the new structure with the VEC.</P>
    <P>When the Bill is finally enacted I hope its provisions will be costed. Many Bills passed by the House, which are well worth supporting &ndash; the Government and Departments are doing excellent work in this regard &ndash; need to be costed. We need to put in place the personnel to ensure the policies adopted in the legislation are enforced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide the legal framework for the provision of work programmes and services by the Minister and the vocational education committees. The principal features of the Bill are defined and the functions regarding the implementation and co-ordination of youth work programmes and services are outlined. The vocational education committees have been a very important aspect of the country's success to date. Their role in training, together with that of FÁS, has contributed a huge service. Section 3 defines youth work as a planned programme of education that is designed for the purpose of aiding and enhancing the personal and social development of young persons through their voluntary participation. It is envisaged as being complementary to the activities of the vocational education committees and FÁS.</P>
      <P>The voluntary sector is the backbone of most communities and it is very important that we encourage new entrants. Given the rush to prosperity, it is sometimes more difficult to get people to give of their time. This Bill promotes that concept. It is important for that reason and because it will complement endeavours in the education area.</P>
      <P>Section 8 sets out the functions of the Minister in terms of the development and co-ordination of youth work policy. If the Minister implements a national policy, will the vocational education committees be allowed the discretion to pursue their own policies or will they be bound by what may be termed the Minster's mission statement? The vocational education committees can be politicised to the extent that they engage in competition within the education system. For example, there could be conflict in certain towns over the amalgamation of secondary and vocational schools. This can create pressure on the system. The quality of education provided by the vocational education committees is excellent and this is often reflected in the student intake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the legislation is not merely concerned with the establishment of just another body. There is a need to provide funding for <Col N="1095" /> research in youth work and the monitoring of such programmes and services. It is important that the Minister introduces a benchmark system in this regard. Various Departments do a good job compiling reports, but the Minister should ensure there is an independent assessment of activities in this area.</P>
    <P>Last year I was elected to a local authority. I have noticed that following stipulations from Government, bodies are established within the county. In some cases they are established merely to keep the Minster happy and to look well in terms of producing programmes. The Minister should establish an inspection mechanism to ensure such bodies do more. For example, the Minister could send in an inspection team unannounced. In my experience the best display is made when an announced assessment is made, whereas an unannounced assessment provides the best benchmark for testing the effectiveness of a system. In any business, whether in the retail trade or elsewhere, an unannounced inspection by an audit team is the most effective.</P>
    <P>A national youth work advisory committee will be established. I have no doubt the Minister intends its composition to be representative. It is important to include employers as well as State bodies. I welcome this Bill because we are talking about providing services in hotels and restaurants where there are staff shortages. It is important to have people from those industries on the committee, whether they are from the Irish Hotels Federation, the Small Firms Association or a body representing the retailers. Services will be important in the future. Some 750 jobs were recently lost in Motorola. High technology companies could move their entire operation to Hungary on four articulated lorries if they so wished. It is not a case of having to move heavy equipment.</P>
    <P>The youth work programme will complement people's academic education by giving them training. The vocational education committees have been good in this regard. The leaving certificate applied is a good course which has allowed students in vocational schools to work for two or three weeks in a school year. This will give them a different viewpoint of what an employer wants and how to participate in the workplace. That is important. The Minister should also look at the role of vocational education committees and the youth work programme in recognising certain businesses as being competent to offer people skills. It is beneficial, for example, for a girl to go to work in an office having completed a course in a vocational school.</P>
    <P>Section 9 outlines the functions of the vocational education committees regarding youth work. Among the vocational education committees' functions will be the requirement to ensure the provision of youth work programmes and services in their areas and they may do so by providing financial assistance to approved national voluntary youth work organisations, designated local <Col N="1096" /> voluntary youth work organisations and authorised organisations subject to terms and conditions. The Minister, on the advice of the national youth work advisory committee, will draw up guidelines for the vocational education committees. When will the guidelines be published? It will be important to get that correct and to keep them as simple as possible so they are effective.</P>
    <P>The Minister must promote these schemes. It is important to have a good campaign on the concept of this Bill. The draftsman does an excellent job drafting Bills. However, their concept can be lost once they pass through the Houses. There is a lot of important legislation in place but it is not used effectively. Does the Minister intend to bring all the vocational education committees and chief executive officers together and to encourage them to actively promote this concept and the ethos of the vocational education committees? Members of VEC boards are probably unaware of this Bill and its far-reaching implications and benefits. The people who will use this Bill effectively will be well advised. It is important to spread the message.</P>
    <P>Section 11 deals with the provision of programmes and services where none are currently provided. This is a good point. If a VEC is of the opinion that a particular youth work service or programme is required in its area but is not being provided, it may advertise to invite the submission of proposals from appropriate organisations. The VEC will assess and prepare a report on each proposal. If none of the proposals is satisfactory, the applicants will be informed and given 21 days in which to make further submissions. Is it the Minister's intention to ask the vocational education committees to sell the principle of what must be done to make this work to communities and organisations?</P>
    <P>This Bill is important in terms of staff shortages. Almost four out of ten businesses have at least one job vacancy at present. Vacancies have been reported across all business sectors. The sector most affected is the hotel and catering sector. Some 59% of businesses have vacancies, while 43% of businesses in the manufacturing sector have vacancies. It is a great time to be in Government given the number of job opportunities available. However, many people do not have employers and that is costing the Exchequer money. This programme will cater for the youth work needs of those aged between ten to 20. It is a good definition of youth.</P>
    <P>Each VEC, in consultation with its youth work committee, will prepare a youth work development plan every three years. Will this run in tandem with the term of a council? If this plan is put in place, will it last for the three or five years before a local election is held? I understand a county development plan will fall when a new council is elected. Could it be a two year plan to the next election when there would be a change in membership? Will the plan carry forward to a new term?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1097" /> Section 14 details the procedures for an annual review and reporting by the vocational education committees, in consultation with the youth work committee. The review and reports will concern the provision of youth work programmes and services, including the areas to be covered. The criteria include the efficiency and effectiveness of the programmes and services, access to youth work by males and females, the numbers of males and females participating in youth work and the co-ordination of youth work services provided under the plan with other youth services in the VEC area. The VEC will furnish an annual report to the Minister who may direct the VEC in relation to the preparation of such a report. I presume that will be an annual report of all the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>Part 4 of the Bill deals with youth work officers and organisations. Section 18 deals with the membership of the national youth work advisory committee. The Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Social Community and Family Affairs, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children, Environment and Local Government and Tourism, Sport and Recreation will each make one nomination. I am delighted that FÁS will also nominate a member. Will CERT be included under the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation? It has done an outstanding job in providing quality workers. The chairperson will be appointed by the Minister as well as two other members who should have youth work experience. Will private partnerships be involved, although perhaps not directly on the board? It would be important to include representatives of the services.</P>
    <P>Section 22 deals with the composition of the voluntary youth councils. Each voluntary youth council will have between ten and 20 members. A minimum of 75% of the members, as far as is practicable, should be volunteers and where a professional youth worker is elected, he or she should work in the VEC area concerned. At least one fifth of the members shall be under 25 and regard is to be had to the representation of Travellers' groups on the voluntary youth council. It is important that the marginalised in society are embraced and that Travellers will be represented on the council.</P>
    <P>With regard to training, the vocational education committees have been very effective. The vocational education committees have given people who may not wish to attend third level the opportunity to avail of lifelong learning and they are playing an important role in that area. At present, mature students must be over 25 years of age before they can obtain grants. This matter should be given consideration. Certain people take a year or two out from their college studies and they should be encouraged to do so. However, that they may not be entitled to a grant can prove somewhat restrictive.</P>
    <P>The evening courses run by the vocational education committees have been extremely effective because life long learning is very important. The <Col N="1098" /> growth in the IT sector and changes in the technology base have altered the basis on which the education system operates. The vocational education committees have done a good job but vocational schools are often seen as the poor relation when it comes to competition with other schools. In towns where there are only two schools it often happens that a career guidance teacher may not be appointed because neither school has the required number of pupils to allow such an appointment to be made. The Youth Work Bill will certainly improve the position in this regard, but funding should be made available on a county by county basis and controls should be put in place to monitor how the money is spent. When administration and staff costs are deducted, grants should be given to communities to participate in this area.</P>
    <P>Part 5 of the Bill deals with financial matters. Section 32 stipulates the procedure for the preparation and approval on an annual basis of the youth work budget of the vocational education committees. It requires each VEC to prepare a youth work budget giving an annual estimate of its income and expenditure on youth work and the youth work programmes or services it intends supporting. Is it envisaged that new groups will be purposely formed in small rural towns and parishes to avail of this? Will it be promoted through the schools or will the vocational education committees encourage students to establish a scheme in their community? How much money has been allocated for this in the first year?</P>
    <P>Section 34 deals with grants. Under this section the Minister may make funds available to the vocational education committees or the various classes of youth work organisations for the purposes of the Bill. Any VEC or organisation in receipt of funds will keep proper accounts and submit them annually. Will those accounts be audited and who will sign off on them?</P>
    <P>Section 35 deals with the withdrawal or reduction of grants. Under this section the Minister may, for failure to comply with a direction or other good reason, withdraw or reduce the amount of a grant to a VEC or youth work organisation. Is it intended to pay the youth work grant directly or will it be paid by vocational education committees or local authorities?</P>
    <P>I am delighted to have had the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill. It is important that young people come to realise that there is much work to be done. Once they finish their academic careers they must come to terms with working for employers, show discipline and realise that they have certain responsibilities. We must seek to foster an atmosphere of partnership between employers and employees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill which is extremely important in the context of the proper organisation of various aspects of youth work. It provides definitions of youth work and sets out <Col N="1099" /> the functions of the Minister and the vocational education committees.</P>
      <P>The need for expenditure on the work outlined in the Bill was highlighted clearly earlier in the week on a programme shown by RTE. Some people took what they saw quite seriously while others were more frivolous in their reaction to it. One person said to me that the predecessors of the young people who appeared on the programme would have been drinking to excess in Camden Town or in US cities some years ago. That is not the point. The programme put across a clear message that a major problem exists <i>vis-à-vis </i>the consumption of alcohol by young people. The problem of drug abuse has been in the headlines in recent years but it is obvious that alcohol abuse is becoming widespread.</P>
      <P>The Bill will not provide all the answers. However, it promotes an alternative form of lifestyle and sets down mechanisms to facilitate this. The television programme to which I referred highlighted the need to support organisations such as the No Name Club and other drink-free groups. These organisations must be treated in a positive fashion and be seen to be given specific support because of the programmes they promote.</P>
      <P>There are a number of other major problems facing young people. For example, there is a huge suicide rate among young males in particular. These problems must be studied, but we can begin to tackle them by putting in place the necessary infrastructure and facilities. There are many formal organisations which do excellent work with young people such as the scouts, guides, etc. These organisations should not be taken for granted. There is a grave danger, for example, that the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association and other movements might be taken for granted.</P>
      <P>A common issue to which many Members referred is the need to monitor the operations of the system when it has been put in place. There is also a need for funding, whether this takes the form of revenue for youth workers and social workers or capital grants for premises and facilities. We must ensure that this funding is made available and we cannot afford to shirk our responsibility. I have no desire to make a political point but the amount of money provided in this year's budget is what is needed. This level of funding should have been in place for the past ten years or more, once people had come to realise that there were major problems among young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are shows on television on which adults kick each other around the place and it is called &ldquo;wrestling&rdquo;. In addition, every type of abuse is shown on TV. However, we criticise young people if they ape this type of behaviour on our streets. We need to counteract the type of example being shown to young people on television shows. We must ensure that they get the <Col N="1100" /> assistance they require to come to terms with the modern world.</P>
    <P>A number of Members referred to the need for an equality of standards throughout the country. Deputy McGuinness drew attention to the position that obtains in Carlow town and other Members also provided examples of what occurs in their localities. It is obvious that the standards which apply in some places are higher than those which obtain in others. The reason for this is not only related to the availability of funding, it also relates to the contribution of voluntary workers, professionals, the members of vocational education committees and other organisations. One example is an organisation called Ogra Corcaigh which has been working in my area for the past 25 years or more. It is well organised, well drilled and its workers, even its voluntary workers, adopt a professional approach, if that is not a contradiction in terms. These people bring a professional ethos to everything they do. This organisation has been able to establish youth organisations, clubs and different types of youth facilities throughout the city but it needs support. It was fighting for a premises for a long time and I think we have managed to give it money. There is a need to support such groups.</P>
    <P>I received a letter from the Irish Lupus Support Group Limited, Cork branch. Even though it mostly deals with adults, it also deals with children. The secretary of this organisation works from her kitchen. Facilities have been made available to voluntary groups in Dublin and they have come together. I would like to see this replicated, particularly in larger urban areas where there are greater numbers of voluntary groups and a greater struggle for whatever facilities are available.</P>
    <P>In my parish of Togher there is an application for a second resource worker for the area. It is important that this application is granted, not just because it is in my parish but because it arises from an innovative project being carried out by the Government, namely, the integrated social services project which is running in four areas &ndash; three in Dublin, including Fatima Mansions, and one in Togher. Young people have come together under this scheme and set up a youth council and examined what is needed. They have put forward their needs and demands and we must respond to them. We are only playing charades if we do not acknowledge the work being done.</P>
    <P>The idea behind the integrated social services scheme is to examine how social and State services integrate. If a good programme is devised, such as co-operation between city and county vocational education committees, youth groups, health boards and so on, it should be replicated throughout the country. It should not just depend on the population of an area. Many rural areas suffered because they did not have large numbers of people. It is probably easier to get voluntary workers in such areas as people have a greater commitment to and identity with their own areas and seem more willing to get involved in GAA <Col N="1101" /> clubs and other organisations and to do more voluntary work. We should not abuse that commitment but help such people and, wherever possible, back them up with whatever is needed. In most cases this means finance and structures.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with structures and I am happy at the composition and functions of the national youth work advisory committee. I say so because, for the first time, there is a deliberate policy of co-operation across Departments. The fact that each Department will be represented should avoid the previous problem where voluntary groups would be told they did not come under a particular programme or should go to a different Department which would tell them its money was spent. We need to give clear signals to young people. One such signal is that we can manage our work, co-ordinate our efforts and facilitate them.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism of the length of time taken to introduce this Bill. As someone involved in youth work, I would prefer if the Minister had taken the necessary time to consult with interested parties rather than rush into legislation which raised more questions than it answered. However, there is support for the provisions in the Bill. I have not heard any criticism yet, and that is fairly unique.</P>
    <P>Questions were raised at the time of the Youth Work Act, 1997. Work on that legislation was of assistance to the Minister in preparing this Bill. The Minister acknowledged this fact and thanked those who worked on the 1997 Act. There is no conflict between people trying to improve the situation and those who wish to raise some opposition. That is how things should be done once it is constructive.</P>
    <P>We must acknowledge the efforts made in the 1997 Act but we must also give credit to the Minister for the important improvements outlined in this Bill, such as improved co-operation and co-ordination. It is important that all vocational education committees, not just the good ones like Cork, bring forward youth work development plans. Standards must be high but it must be mandatory for vocational education committees to put forward a plan. Too often we hear excuses such as shortages of staff and so on, but the priority of dealing with young people can slip in such circumstances. We cannot tolerate such situations.</P>
    <P>Another important proposal in the Bill is that the budget for the year is brought forward. For the first time the Government is now dealing with multi-annual budgets and we must introduce such practices into youth work. I appreciate that the budget outlined in the Bill will be an annual budget, but we have to recognise the rollover aspects of many programmes. It is no good employing, hiring or renting facilities if one does not know what money will be available the following year. We need to examine this issue and I ask the Minister to look at the long-term funding which would take pressure off voluntary workers in particular.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1102" /> It sounds like a contradiction in terms, but the services by voluntary workers and young people are now provided in a very professional fashion. There are very committed people, particularly young people. I worked with the scouting organisation and youth clubs, and five of my sons were involved with the scouts. They carried out projects which were needed for a merit badge, to qualify for a shield, to win the national trophy or something like that. However, young people now take the initiative and take over projects working with the elderly and so on, not for a merit badge but because they want to do so. We should foster such activities and great credit is due to young people given the alternatives available to them.</P>
    <P>Youth work is becoming more difficult in terms of its scope and the statutory requirements, including the vetting of personnel, which we all support. However, this places a considerable onus on those involved. The back-up services provided by the Department, vocational education committees and local authorities must be co-ordinated. From personal experience, the funding and co-ordination of the youth at risk programme has been good because the vocational education committees linked in with local authorities and organisations to put together working teams. It is no longer the case that people say a particular problem is for the VEC or the local authority. These organisations are working together and money is being well spent. Funding should be increased as we can identify young people at risk and we should do that bit extra for them when we have the money.</P>
    <P>The most important ingredient of voluntary participation is by young people. I want to see them running their own show wherever possible. They are capable of doing so and they should do so. Not all those involved in youth work are young and I pay tribute to, and we owe a huge debt of gratitude to, the men and women who give up their time on a voluntary basis to help provide recreational and educational facilities for young people. There are thousands of such adult volunteers who provide a service we could never afford, and I pay tribute to them on their contributions. I mentioned the GAA in particular, although there are dozens of other organisations whose members give freely of their time. They are the unsung heroes. They are often criticised for the wrong reasons, but the only reward they seek is to see their charges do well. They are to be complimented for their contribution.</P>
    <P>There is also another in between section, those who participate in CE schemes, who fall between being full-time State employees and volunteers. I am concerned about the loss of posts under those schemes.</P>

Your job and that <Col N="1105" /> of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is an extremely difficult one. It was difficult even this morning. Deputies on the opposition benches find themselves in conflict with the Chair more often than those on the Government side.

I wish you a very happy Christmas and the same to all the people who occupy the Chair on a rota.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go down through the list of all the people the Taoiseach thanked. I merely endorse everything he has said. I also wish to single out the Superintendent. I was not aware he was sick. I just noticed he was not here. I am delighted to hear that he will be coming back soon. It has been a very tough time for him, but I wish him well now he is back on his feet and back to work.</P>
      <P>The past few months have been quite a difficult time for the Members. I have had to deal with a few things myself, but more particularly we have all had the disruption involved in moving to new offices in the new building. It has been a particularly difficult period for the staff, for our own staff and for the staff who have been involved in completing the new building against very tight deadlines. I thank everyone on the staff of the House, but also everyone who was employed by the various building contractors and other contractors for their good humour in dealing with the frustrations that were manifest from time to time among many of us who were anxious to get on with our jobs but who could not necessarily comprehend the physical limitations that were imposed on those who had the job of completing the building on time.</P>
      <P>I join the Taoiseach in paying tribute to the staff of the Houses, the gardaí and the media, but I say a particular word of thanks to the staff of all of the political parties who get on pretty well. They get on a lot better than the Members from time to time, to judge from the number of them who eat together and so on. Without them we would not be able to do our jobs and I wish them a happy Christmas. It has been a very eventful year. Recently we had the visit of President Clinton and I expect we are looking forward to an even more eventful and exciting year next year which will tax us physically, mentally and in every other way.

      <P>Deputy Bruton appropriately and characteristically, with his normal and wonderful sense of Christian charity, talked about the difficulties associated with physically moving office. Not everyone in the Chamber had that experience and it is my earnest desire that the Taoiseach would have it in the next year. The Office of Public Works, their architects, contractors and builders have attempted to seduce us with wonderful offices with superb views of Government Buildings. I assure the Taoiseach that I intend to swap my view of Government Buildings with his occupation of the same premises.</P>
      <P>On a slightly sadder note, I know the Chair will agree that every Christmas families count their absent members. Three families intimately associated with this House will face a Christmas without family members, two of whom were Deputies. I refer to the families of the late Deputies Michael Ferris and Theresa Ahearn, coincidentally from the same constituency. Coincidentally, also this evening, the deceased wife of former Ceann Comhairle, Seán Treacy, is being taken to her church in Clonmel and will be buried tomorrow. I formally request the Ceann Comhairle to convey on behalf of the House a formal note communicating our sympathy to Seán Treacy, a former esteemed Member.</P>

      <P>I thank all colleagues who expressed their condolences to me and my family on my recent bereavement. It is a poignant event that takes time to absorb. The Taoiseach has been through it and it visits us all in due course. Christmas has a sense of both poignancy and celebration. I am minded because of my recent experience as well as that of the families to whom I referred; we will be confronted with that realisation as we go into a hopeful and restful turning of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully endorse what the Taoiseach and the Fine Gael Leader said about the wonderful resource we as parliamentarians have in all the staff of the House, irrespective of how, what and when they do their jobs &ndash; those who open the gates in the morning, those who clean up early and late, the printers, those who process the documentation. We speak here and presume things will be done. Staff members in the Gallery or who are not listening to me are in the engine of democracy, in this great liner of freedom and liberation which is the Republic of this island. We could not function <Col N="1107" /> without them and I thank them for making it possible. Frequently this glides along effortlessly and with great style and we take it for granted. We do not take it for granted. It takes time and effort. Problems arise with the Bills Office or the Ceann Comhairle's Office which we sometimes dispute but resolution emerges.</P>
    <P>I conclude by thanking everyone and especially the Ceann Comhairle for the way he has presided over our proceedings, a celebration of republican democracy in this country.</P>
    <P>I never cease to count my blessings that of all the generations of Irish people who have lived on this island, only three have been able to stand up in an Assembly like this and speak to ourselves in our own terms in our own Parliament, irrespective of what we argue about, and resolve those problems on our own terms. There are still many countries around the world denied that privilege and many generations of dead Irish people earnestly thought they would live to see that but who <Col N="1108" /> did not do so. We have lived to see it and we owe them a debt of obligation and gratitude &ndash; gratitude for their insistence on believing in the dream and obligation to ensure that dream is properly fulfilled.</P>

      <P>I express my appreciation to the Taoiseach and the other party leaders for their kind remarks and best wishes. I extend my best wishes to them for a happy Christmas and New Year. I join with them in expressing that wish to all Members and staff. Staff have been mentioned and sometimes Members complain about late sitting, which I do myself. We must remember that if we sit here until 10 p.m. sometimes the staff may have to stay here until 1 or 2 a.m. They had to do that in the last few days and we appreciate that. I join with other speakers in extending our best wishes to them for Christmas and the New Year.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 4.55 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 30 January 2001.</P>
