      <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the following arrangements shall apply in relation to No. 16: (i) the opening speech of a Minister or Minister of State and the speeches of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party, who shall be called upon in that order, and of each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; (ii) Members may share time and (iii) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed ten minutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Government have any plans to amend the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) (Amendment) Act to accept Mr. O'Flaherty's offer to return his pension? We would not like the situation to arise that arose when two members of the Tánaiste's party made a big gesture of returning their pensions which they then had to take back in a lump sum because there was no provision under which somebody could return his or her pension. As the Act does not allow for the return of pensions, except where somebody is being paid by the Exchequer, and Mr. O'Flaherty is being given a European job, does the Act need to be amended?</P>

      <P>On the Thursday before the Easter recess the Tánaiste informed me that she would be publishing that weekend her review of the job initiative scheme. Just short of 3,000 people are about to be disemployed, 600 immediately. I have been in constant touch with the Tánaiste's office since. I would be greatly obliged if she would inform the House, having regard to the fact that all these people are at the bottom of the ladder, that they will get a second chance in the review which I hope she will publish soon.</P>

      <P>Four hundred and fifty people are due to complete their time on the job initiative scheme next month. I have indicated in public that nobody will move from the scheme to unemployment. The decision I have made is that a flexible approach will have to be adopted to each individual. It will be the job of FÁS to ensure that if they cannot move to mainstream training they remain on the job initiative scheme. I have communicated this decision to the social partners who are discussing my recommendation.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to again point out the disgraceful record of the Government and its predecessors. This is evidenced by the fact that only approximately 3% of our national territory is designated as special protection areas under the birds directive. This means that Ireland has the second lowest level of national territory covered by SPA protection in the EU. Accordingly, it may be too late for many species that are supposed to be protected under this legislation.</P>
      <P>The Bill treats wildlife as many of the cruellest orphanages in the past treated many children, claiming that all was well when in fact, following investigation, we realise that the level of criminal neglect of their responsibilities is worthy of a tribunal. This issue is not only one of neglect but it involves enormous ignorance and wilful destruction of SPAs, NHAs, SACs, Ramsar sites and other areas. For example, guidelines exist to prevent local authorities cutting hedgerows all over the country from 1 April and 1 September. However, these guidelines are being flagrantly contravened. Hedges are shaven by operators sent out to cut grass. In my area in Fingal in north County Dublin, I challenged the local authority to account for this murderous activity. I was told the operators had forgotten about the guidelines but, after my intervention, they were to be reminded of them.</P>
      <P>This points the finger at the Minister and her Department. Wildlife is depending on her  &ndash; God help it &ndash; and local authorities need to be severely reprimanded and reminded now and not when the Bill is enacted to avoid further damage. The Minister must at least state her strong dissatisfaction with local authorities for not complying with the guidelines in relation to hedgerows and ensure that they regularly remind their operators of them. This should be done now because by the time the Bill is enacted, whenever that is, the season will be over and there will be more hedgerow mutilation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While local authorities such as Fingal County Council appear to recognise that waterways are <Col N="1619" /> wildlife corridors, they have not mentioned that hedgerows are also a wildlife corridor. The potential of hedgerows as one of the last vestiges of afforestation and woodland habitat in Ireland is being wilfully destroyed by landowners and local authorities which are supposed to be State authorities and set an example to landowners. Given the Minister's role in terms of being in charge of the wildlife area, she has an acute responsibility which is being neglected. She should remind local authorities, before it is too late, that they have a responsibility to uphold the guidelines. I hope they will soon be law but, at present, they are being flagrantly disregarded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. The Bill provides statutory protection for natural heritage areas and strengthens the protective regime for special areas of conservation. I was a Member of the Dáil and the committee which considered the Wildlife Bill in 1976. At that time the Bill was dealt with by the committee but there were no division bells as such for some of the votes on amendments. It led to a situation where many of the Opposition amendments had to be accepted.</P>
      <P>This Bill increases fines and also introduces prison sentences. While the 1976 Act was good, 24 years later it needs to be updated and strengthened and the Minister has done this in the Bill. There is much emphasis on the role of the farming community and, in the majority of cases, it is trying to protect the environment. As Deputy Sargent said, there is concern about the destruction of hedgerows. It is a matter of concern that the wildlife habitats of many species could be lost. The Minister said further restrictions on hedge cutting will apply from 1 April rather than 15 April each year.</P>
      <P>Much good work has been done in the Shannon and east Galway region where farmers are prevented from harvesting crops at certain times of the year. For example, hay is cut later in the year and this has led to good benefits for the environment and wildlife. They are trying to preserve the corncrake in the area. It is important that the Minister and other Departments pay compensation because the cutting of crops has been delayed since the scheme was introduced. I welcome such schemes which encourage people to work together protecting the environment and promoting wildlife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important issue with regard to the farming sector is the rural environment protection scheme. This scheme, in conjunction with the control of farmyard pollution scheme and the dairy hygiene scheme, has led to great improvements in the environment. The schemes have also helped wildlife promotion. This matter does not come within the Minister's remit but she may be able to take it up with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to improve the scheme. There is much red tape surrounding these schemes. The rural environment protection <Col N="1620" /> scheme suits small farmers but it does not suit large intensive operators. I hope there will be an announcement to resume and improve that scheme. It is not administered with consistency throughout the country. There are problems with commonage, split holdings, land boundaries, farm maps and land title. These problems should be addressed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Renewal.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about section 50. It states that, when the Commissioners of Public Works undertake drainage, they should consult the Minister to take all practical steps in the interests of wildlife conservation to safeguard nature reserves, refuges and land subject to wildlife conservation management agreements. The section also extends provision to cover natural heritage areas. It also requires the commissioners to have regard to any drainage scheme which is likely or liable to affect or interfere with an important ecological area, even if such a scheme operates outside the area in question. This section is of concern to parts of the country which are subject to flooding. The Minister is familiar with the serious problems in south Galway for the past five years. Families have had to leave their homes, build new ones and have farm buildings relocated. It is not the first time we in south Galway have had this problem. I recall over the years talking about draining the Dunkellin river. Issues have arisen about the Turlough, the Raghasane and about the oyster beds. While nothing has been done about it, flooding has worsened in that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Carey will be glad to know that £2.5 million is available for flood relief and I hope it will provide for remedial work. We are inclined to blame Europe and European directives for every problem. The representatives of the Council of the West have said that we should discuss European directives as they affect the common good. That should be examined in the case of flooding.</P>
      <P>The situation in south Galway mirrors the question I asked about the River Shannon. I am glad we are discussing this at present at the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport. I hope the discussion on the Shannon authority will examine all issues concerning the Shannon, including the environment and wildlife. Farmers have for too long seen their crops being damaged and have seen bales of hay floating down rivers. I hope we can address the problems which affect them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that, under the Planning and Development Bill, one must have planning permission for certain activities, one of which is the cutting of turf. I understand the Minister stated that one can continue to cut turf for domestic purposes. This is an important provision. At the same time, it is important to conserve the bogs <Col N="1621" /> specified in legislation. People should not only conserve them, they should also make practical use of them, as has been done in County Offaly where there are bog trails, bog theme parks and a railway through the bogs of west Offaly. The same should apply to other bogs where conservation is taking place. Walkways, trails and even cycle lanes could be provided through some of those bog areas. This issue has been put to the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, in my town of Mountbellew where people want to initiate such a development and which would be in keeping with the principle of conservation and promotion of wildlife.</P>
    <P>Members have raised the question of wildlife dealing and this is also provided for in the Bill. We had to introduce special legislation some years ago to deal with hoteliers who advertised commercial shooting. Fishing and hunting is an important industry in the autumn which is often a quiet season in many towns and villages in rural Ireland. Nonetheless, there must be greater control on commercial shoot operators. Every year we hear of people who come into the country and shoot anything that flies. Songbirds can be game as far as they are concerned. People with camper vans come into the country, shoot willy nilly and bring quantities of fish stored in freezers back to the countries from which they came. Obviously they are not doing that without assistance from agents and middlemen. The Minister referred to this important issue. There should be regulations to control these operators, be they involved in shooting or fishing.</P>
    <P>I welcome what has been said about the statutory protection of geological sites. We have many beautiful castles. Portumna Castle is an important one in my constituency. Funding has been allocated to it under various Governments and that is something which should continue. I refer especially to the ongoing work in the Wild Geese Library. This has links with Patrick Sarsfield's family and it has been promoted by one person in particular, Mr. Seán Ryan. I commend him on the work he is doing on our history and heritage. When we speak of the preservation of heritage and geological sites, we should also speak of the preservation of history and he has been promoting that.</P>
    <P>Kilmacduagh cemetery is close to the Clare border and the Minister has visited it. A number of improvements need to be carried out to that cemetery, work on the entrance and the provision of toilets being just two. Athenry is famous for its walls and Athenry Castle is famous in song and story. My village of Castleblakeney is the home of the O'Kellys. Much of the history of that family has been preserved and I hope further work will be done in that area. The fáilte Uí Cheallaigh or the welcome of the O'Kellys is the warmest welcome one can get in any part of Ireland. That has been the feature of the history of the O'Kellys of Hymany.</P>
    <P>A great deal of funding is available to the National Roads Authority for the development of <Col N="1622" /> the road network. One of the interesting projects is the Galway to Dublin dual carriageway. Constraint studies are being conducted by the NRA. People sometimes believe it is a matter of drawing a line between two towns or cities and saying that will be the route. We all know that one of the issues in this type of development is wildlife. We also know of the delays which occurred in Kildare and other parts of the country because of certain species of wildlife which were affected by road development. The studies on these developments should begin quickly.</P>
    <P>When speaking about funding up to 2005 or 2006, one will not feel the time passing if planning does not start on time and constraint studies are not in place so that the obstacles are known immediately. This is an important issue from the point of view of wildlife and of moving people and goods quickly from one place to another. Bypasses used to be the bane of people's lives but they are now welcomed as a means of helping traffic to move more quickly. They do not take away from the business of a town or village. Bypasses along the Galway Dublin route, whether at Kinnegad, Lucan or Maynooth, mean that people and goods are brought more quickly from the west to the east and vice versa.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes a provision to enable the Minister to act independently of forestry legislation. People in rural Ireland are concerned that there does not seem to be any need for planning permission for forestry development. We all know such developments are promoted beside housing estates and along the edges of rivers and lakes. The Government must make provisions to ensure there is proper planning for forestry. Planting should not be allowed within a specified distance of private residences or waterways. It is also insidious the way planting is taking place in stages over a number of years and small areas of acreage in the initial plans are being increased. This affects the farming community and people in the local areas. Will the Minister explain the section which states that she can act independently of forestry legislation? Are there other powers she will implement in the Bill?</P>
    <P>We should also look at the effect of pollution in our waters. It is encouraging to see that the farming community and organisations such as the IFA, the ICMSA and Macra na Feirme have come together to promote our heritage and wildlife and to look after our environment. The gun clubs are also involved in conservation and preservation. They sometimes get bad publicity but they deserve our support.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have been accused in the past of breaking the law. If they are involved in pollution, the same fines and prison sentences should apply to them as apply to everyone else. There seems to be different rules in local authorities about the continuation of hedgerows and when hedge cutting should take place. Now that the Minister has stated in the Bill that she will bring forward the date on which hedge cutting should <Col N="1623" /> stop, it should lead to more consistency among local authorities.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation. It is 24 years since the last Wildlife Act was introduced. I wish the Minister well with it and I hope it will be passed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity afforded to me by this debate to suggest ways in which this long awaited Bill could and should curtail some of the appallingly cruel practices perpetrated against our wild and domesticated animals. The question is whether the political will exists to avail of this opportunity.</P>
      <P>Cruelty to animals in the State is inextricably linked to our wildlife legislation. The Wildlife Act, 1976, provides the legal framework by which many cruel practices are permitted or facilitated. The Minister's argument that her statutory remit is specifically focused on conservation and that she has no such remit in relation to animal welfare is full of anomalies and does not stand up to close scrutiny. I do not wish to misrepresent the Minister, whom I respect, but if the provisions of the Wildlife Act, 1976, come within her remit it follows, as night follows day, that she has a clear responsibility to deal with cruel activities against animals and, by the nature of the legislation, has a remit beyond conservation.</P>
      <P>We can take the example of the Ward Union Stag Hunt. In reply to Parliamentary Question No. 230 on 18 April 2000 the Minister openly admits there is no conservation concern at issue in this context. Yet she retains in the Bill the provision to issue licences to the Ward Union Stag Hunt. If she retains the provision to issue licences to hunt deer and if there is no conservation issue involved, the inescapable fact is that she has responsibility for the welfare of the animals concerned, in this case, the domesticated deer.</P>
      <P>The Minister should at least accept the recommendations of the Heritage Council which advises that the status of the deer is of critical importance and, if accepted as domesticated, the provision to licence the hunt should be deleted. The Minister has persistently refused to answer if the deer are wild or tame domesticated animals and instead offers the bizarre statement that the Wildlife Act, 1976, does not refer to the status of the deer. The logical conclusion is that the Minister knows the Ward Union Stag Hunt deer are tame and that it is clearly in breach of the Protection of Animals Act to hunt them. Yet she persists in granting a licence to allow the Ward Union Stag Hunt to break the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should follow the precedent set in the North of Ireland where in 1997 the County Down Stag Hunt was outlawed because the Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture ruled that the deer were tame and not wild and therefore the hunt was in breach of its welfare of animals Act. It seems the Minister wants to have it both ways. She accepts responsibility for issuing licences to groups of individuals to carry out prac<Col N="1624" /> tices which have nothing to do with conservation and which inflict unnecessary cruelty on animals, in this case, tame animals, but she will not accept responsibility for animal welfare.</P>
    <P>My primary argument is that animal welfare issues are inextricably linked to this wildlife legislation. In contrast to the silence in this House on the issue of cruelty against wildlife, there is widespread disgust among urban and rural people at such cruelty and widespread support for the position I am putting forward. It is touching the Minister should have such interest in the fossilised tetrapod footprints, which are within her remit, found at Valentia in County Kerry, an interest I share. However, her concern does not appear to extend to living creatures, whether stags, hares or a variety of wildlife which will be lamped or torn asunder by packs of hounds rampaging over the countryside, courtesy of this Bill. I wish to refer specifically to a number of the important issues which could have been addressed in the Bill but which were either completely ignored or, in some instances, were intended to be but were not addressed because the Minister regrettably capitulated to certain vested interests. She is now intent on amending the legislation &ndash; at the behest of the hunting lobby &ndash; on Committee Stage in order to remove some of the most progressive of her initiatives.</P>
    <P>The first matter to which I wish to refer is section 23 of the 1976 Act, as amended by section 31 of the 1999 Act. I thought that this country had made worthwhile progress following the introduction in 1993 of a Private Members' Bill in my name to amend the 1976 Act to ban live hare coursing. My Bill, which was defeated on Second Stage, was voted down on the basis that measures would be introduced to provide for the muzzling of greyhounds in order to ensure the elimination of the killing of hares, a protected and most gentle species of wild animal.</P>
    <P>Since then, the practice of muzzling has, we are informed by the Irish Coursing Club, proved to be highly successful in every respect. I strongly dispute this claim in so far as timid hares continue to be cruelly taken from their wild and protected habitats and terrorised on the enclosed coursing fields, where some still die of shock or are injured in various ways. Cruel and barbaric as this practice remains, it is certainly a vast improvement on the sick spectacle of defenceless animals being torn apart by savage dogs for the entertainment and gratification of misguided people.</P>
    <P>How has the Minister responded to this issue? Incredibly, she has left section 23(7), the original provision which deals with live hare coursing, intact. Section 23(7) states that &ldquo;nothing in this section shall make unlawful&rdquo; the taking and killing of hares by coursing at a regulated match or the hunting of hares by means of a pack of beagles or harriers. I hope the Minister will clarify her position on this issue.</P>
    <P>Why was the opportunity not taken to update the law and bring it into line with the very limited progress that has been made in relation to the <Col N="1625" /> supposed introduction of muzzling and other welfare monitoring measures at coursing meetings? The fact that the regulations for muzzling provided for in the Greyhound Industry Amendment Act, 1993, were never introduced indicates that the Irish Coursing Club, not Dáil Éireann, is dictating the pace of change. In addition, other hunting interests have ensured that good measures proposed in this Bill will be reversed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>If that is the way protected species of wildlife are provided for in the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, then what chance has the unfortunate fox which has no protection whatever? Apparently the fox is not recognised as a species of wildlife. That is very convenient for those who wish to inflict the most perverted cruelty on this much maligned and beautiful wild animal. Following another attempt to introduce a Private Members' Bill to ban fox hunting and to expose the hidden cruel activities of cub hunting, digging out and the use of terriers by terrier men, efforts were made to clean up the image of fox hunting by introducing another code of practice or some such arrangement agreed between the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Hunting Association of Ireland. This new arrangement, like the arrangement governing hare coursing, is not enshrined in legislation, despite the opportunity the Bill presents for doing so.</P>
    <P>Section 43 of the Bill amends section 34 of the 1976 Act and quite rightly extends protection to all wild animals and prohibits the use of gas, smoke, chemicals, etc., in the hunting of wild animals. The Minister's remit is shown here to be as flexible as she wants it to be and it could be easily extended to introduce a new code of practice to prohibit the use of terriers, the digging out of foxes gone to ground during the course of a fox hunt or, if she wanted to be particularly radical, to introduce the muzzling of hounds participating in an organised fox hunt.</P>
    <P>A number of further important aspects of the Bill have been highlighted by the Irish Council Against Blood Sports, of which I am national vice-president. While the council welcomes the outlawing of otter hunting, it draws attention to a loophole which needs to be addressed if the repeal of the section of the 1976 Act which had permitted otter hunting is to be effective. A statement by the Irish Council Against Blood Sports on otter hunting reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The Wildlife Amendment Bill, 1999, proposes to repeal subsection (1)(i) of section 26 which will in effect outlaw otter hunting, which is a most welcome development, albeit that this was dictated by European Directive. The otter and its habitat has been designated Category 1 status, which means that it and its habitat should be strictly protected.</P>
    <P>However, when otter hunting licences were suspended in 1990, following intensive campaigning by the Irish Council Against Blood </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1626" /> Sports and because of the above EU Directive, the four otter hunting packs operating in the Munster area promptly switched to mink hunting along the very same stretches of rivers occupied by otters. They then proceeded to hunt otters with impunity under the guise of hunting mink. The Irish Council Against Blood Sports acquired video footage [which it released recently] of a so-called mink hunt in 1993 which provides evidence of this loophole.</P>
    <P>The Irish Council Against Blood Sports submits that outlawing otter hunting could prove to be ineffective if mink hunting with hounds is allowed to continue. To fully protect otters and their habitats in any meaningful and realistic way, and to properly comply with the EU Directive protecting otters and their habitats, mink hunting with hounds should be outlawed.</P>
    <P>As an alternative to the form of mink hunting to which the statement refers, humane, modern traps are available in more progressive countries which can be used to catch mink.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Bill which is of great concern to all opposed to cruelty to animals relates to the Minister's stated intention to amend her proposal which would have outlawed the practice of lamping which involves the use of a lamp at night to dazzle or blind an animal for the purpose of shooting it or making it easy to shoot. The Minister has indicated that she intends to outlaw this practice only in the case of protected species, despite the fact that it is already outlawed in so far as protected species are concerned. The Minister advised the Dáil that a strong case had been made for the control of certain pest species. However, the Irish Council Against Blood Sports revealed the truth, namely, that this strong case was made by the National Association of Registered Gun Clubs when the Minister addressed its conference in Ennis in October 1999. The gun clubs reported, in the <i>Irish Shooters Digest</i>, that the Minister had &ldquo;pledged to change the proposals to come before the Dáil from her Department by withdrawing the specific proposal to ban the lamping of foxes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is particularly disappointing that, after years of preparation, progressive measures in the Bill can so easily be reversed or removed at the behest of vested interests and gun clubs.</P>
    <P>I presume there were very good reasons for that while the cruel practice of lamping or dazzling animals at night time, giving them no chance of escaping from so-called hunters, was being banned by the Bill. It is well known that this is the very practice used to poach protected wild deer and that the poachers, if challenged by the authorities, use the excuse that they were lamping foxes. I presume this is one of the reasons the Bill outlawed this practice altogether.</P>
    <P>This excuse can be used for any night hunting of a protected species, thus rendering the Act almost impossible to enforce. As it took such a short time for a small lobby group outside this House to change the Minister's mind on a pro<Col N="1627" /> gressive initiative in her Bill, I hope she will reflect on what I, the Irish Council Against Blood Sports and other concerned people, have said about the good intentions behind her proposal. Perhaps she would consider her commitment to reverse that proposal prior to Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that while the Bill had a lengthy gestation period of 15 years, it only took a few weeks of consultation and lobbying for some of its most significant provisions to be reversed. Section 51 is a prime example of that. The section was intended to make unlawful the bringing onto land without permission of ferrets, dogs, hounds and birds of prey for the purposes of hunting. This important provision would have given much needed protection to land owners plagued by fox hunters with packs of hounds, hindered illegal badger diggers and baiters with terriers and reduced the plague and upset caused by packs of hounds, lurchers and greyhounds. It would also have served to strengthen the hand of the National Parks and Wildlife Service personnel and the Garda in prosecuting hare hunting and badger baiting offences.</P>
    <P>If we are to accept that nobody has the right to be on another person's land without permission, that provision should be applied to all manner of hunters in addition to those with guns, as is currently stipulated in the legislation. The Minister's intention to remove this new protection will facilitate trespassers with dogs, hounds, ferrets, birds of prey, etc., a strange position for the Minister with responsibility for wildlife protection to adopt. I strongly submit that in the interests of wildlife protection the provision, as drafted, should be retained.</P>
    <P>Who dictates policy in regard to these cruel activities in this country? I suggest that the experience of this Bill, which is only on Second Stage, clearly indicates that it is not any process within this House which dictates policy, rather that it is the Hunting Association of Ireland, the National Association of Gun Clubs, the Irish Coursing Club and a motley group of other coursing clubs which have flouted the new regulations. In a reply to a parliamentary question on this subject, I learned that when some of those clubs flouted the regulations to which they had agreed and abused the animals in their care, the withdrawal of their licences was very quickly reversed. For example, members of the Kilcreevan-Ballymote club met with the Minister for a few minutes and she agreed to lift the penalties which had been imposed. That is the type of action which is dictating policy and disgracing this country on the European stage.</P>
    <P>My primary concern is that we would attempt to eradicate some of the very cruel actions being perpetrated against animals in this country. Such practices are not acceptable in the 21st century. I am very disappointed that the initiatives in that regard contained in this long awaited Bill are now to be reversed on Committee Stage by the Mini<Col N="1628" /> ster at the behest of small vested interests which do not represent public concern in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy:</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is an amendment to the 1976 Wildlife Act. I was a Member of the Seanad when the original Bill was introduced. The situation has worsened considerably in the 24 years since I last spoke on this legislation with additional wildlife species becoming extinct and endangered. Legislation is irrelevant if its provisions cannot be enforced. The stark reality is that we do not have such enforcement. Irrespective of what the Minister may say to me during Question Time in regard to the increase in the number of gamekeepers or wildlife rangers, we do not manage our wildlife population as it should be managed. That is disgraceful. The Bill is not worth the paper it is written on unless its provisions can be implemented and that is not happening.</P>
      <P>I recall the late Dr. Noel Browne, who was also a Senator in 1976, screeching that we were the last of the European barbarians because of our cruelty to hares and other hunted wildlife species. Senator Willie O'Brien from west Limerick who subsequently became a Deputy replied to Dr. Browne saying: &ldquo;I don't know what that fella is talking about. I live near Clounanna and the hares down there are fed on the best of grub. They are the best kept animals I ever saw, fattened and well cared for. Anyway, who ever expected to see a hare dying in a nursing home?&rdquo;  Incidentally, the annual Irish coursing festival is held in Clounanna. The two men had varying opinions on the matter but their hearts were in the right places. May God be good to them.</P>
      <P>We are not protecting Irish wildlife. This Bill is meaningless. I hope somebody will come along in 24 years' time when I am dead and gone and contradict me by saying that the Bill was meaningful. If the Bill's provisions cannot be implemented, the Bill is of no significance whatsoever. With respect, the Minister is completely divorced from reality. Irish wildlife is being extinguished and diminished by the day and the Minister does not seem to be doing anything about it.</P>
      <P>I have repeatedly told the Minister at Question Time that my county is a mirror image Ireland. It contains two mountain ranges and a great deal of moorland, and it has one wildlife ranger trying to supervise that. It would be funny if it was not so serious. How could one person supervise wildlife in that context?</P>
      <P>May God be good to the Minister's grandfather, our fathers and grandparents. They got rid of British rule. Does the Minister know what the British did? For their own selfish gains, they protected wildlife in Ireland. The Comeragh Mountains near where I live had ten or 12 wildlife rangers. At the time they were called game-keepers or bailiffs. They ensured that the wildlife was preserved in order that the gentry could go out and shoot it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At least they ensured that it was preserved. We allowed it to be extinguished. Where there was all <Col N="1629" /> sorts of wildlife, like woodcocks, partridges and grouse, now there is nothing. It is an ecological desert. If one walks to the top of the Comeragh Mountains one will not see any wildlife. We have overseen the demise of our heritage in that regard, and the Minister is the guardian of that. I do not believe she really cares. Perhaps she is not sufficiently informed.</P>
    <P>I am not adopting the same line as Deputy Gregory. That is probably a populist way to pursue the matter, like somebody I mentioned previously here. I am concerned about the preservation of wildlife, not that it should be hunted down and killed but that it should be enjoyed.</P>
    <P>This is the time of year when we all love to get out into the open spaces, particularly on a fine day, and look at the shrubbery growing in the month of May. Everything is in full bloom. One listens to the birds nesting and their young squabbling over a few bits and pieces of food. This is the most beautiful time of the year, and it is fitting that we should discuss this Bill today, but I do not think anybody cares. The House is empty for all practical purposes, the Press Gallery is empty and the Minister will not get one line in tomorrow's newspapers or one iota on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; on television or on the radio. Do we really care? We as a nation do not, but there is a number of very concerned individuals around the country. They might only form 10% of the population, but they are very concerned. I am one of them. I suppose it comes with age. The older we get, the more we realise how we are on the point of losing our inheritance or heritage, call it what you will.</P>
    <P>I have an English newspaper, the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 7 May 2000, in my hand. The English were the people who highlighted this. The headline is: &ldquo;Rare Birds Flying Swiftly to Extinction in Ireland&rdquo;. That is only two weeks ago and that was reproduced in <i>The Irish Times</i> the other day. It is unbelievable. Many of the birds referred to in that article are not, by my estimation, rare at all. Who would have thought that the yellowhammer or the hen harrier were rare birds in Ireland? Those are the creatures with which we grew up and loved to see in our youth, but they have become rare. If the Minister cannot do something to arrest that decline, she has failed in her ministry. The barn owl, the only common owl in Ireland, is in danger of extinction.</P>
    <P>A survey was conducted jointly by BirdWatch Ireland and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in Northern Ireland. They listed all these birds which are in danger of extinction. They listed a number of them which have become extinct, such as the cornbunting, but they go on to state that the barn owl and, would you believe, the skylark are in danger of becoming extinct. The number of yellowhammers, to which I referred earlier, has declined by 50% in recent years. This might give rise to hoots of derision and mirth, etc., but the cuckoo is on the way out also. Has the Minister heard it this year? Did she hear it last year or when did she last hear it? It <Col N="1630" /> is, to paraphrase an expression which was used by a former colleague of mine many years ago, a thundering disgrace that we stand idly by and allow these absolute gifts to humanity become extinct in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister ever saw a chough. One would say for all intents and purposes that it was a crow or, on closer examination, one might say it was a jackdaw. They live on the edge of the coast. We get them on the cliffs in County Waterford, and they are called after their peculiar cry &ndash; it is a chug. The report to which I refer states that there are only four pairs of choughs in existence in Northern Ireland. I would not be surprised if the number here were quite low also. I have not heard one for quite a long time because if you heard one, you would not forget it for a while.</P>
    <P>It is unbelievable. We over emphasise the fact that we have resurrected the corncrake population because the corncrake is such a distinctive species. One cannot help noticing the presence of the corncrake because of its distinctive noise and appearance. I remember being in Creeslough, in north Donegal for a by-election campaign about 18 or 19 years ago and hearing the corncrake. It brought me back virtually another 39 years to when I was a child because in my part of the country, where farming methods are modern, the corncrakes had become extinct. There is too much time spent congratulating ourselves that we have created a little oasis on the River Shannon, in north Donegal or in north Mayo to preserve and encourage the breeding of the corncrake. It is just one species, but I am talking about a plethora of species which are in danger of extinction or are extinct.</P>
    <P>I see where there is a proposal to bring back the golden eagle, which was last seen in Ireland in 1912. It is to be reintroduced from Scotland to Glenveagh National Park in County Donegal. The reintroduction of such a species, like the preservation of the corncrake, is something of an ego trip. Why can we not preserve the birds and animals with which we grew up? On previous occasions I have advised the Minister to hold a census of every species and to identify the location of each. This has been done in Europe and in Great Britain and is essential if the problem is to be accurately identified. Were it not for voluntary groups such as Birdwatch Ireland we would know nothing of what is happening to our wildlife. Organisations of that sort do some surveys but a more exact census is required. This census could be carried out in conjunction with national and second level schools. The help of pupils could be enlisted and the information could be transmitted to the appropriate body by the teachers. We are only guessing at the moment and we need this information.</P>
    <P>The rural environment protection scheme which is administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is a charade. People who benefit from the scheme mean well but the scheme is applied on a hit and miss <Col N="1631" /> basis. No one will convince me that it preserves wildlife. When I drive around the country I see wetlands being drained, hedgerows being demolished and the natural habitats of our wildlife being destroyed. I am told that measures are being taken to preserve wildlife. That is a contradiction and a falsehood.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister done any research into the use of pesticides and insecticides and their impact on the wildlife population? I have no doubt that the use of these substances is the basic reason for the decline in our wildlife population. Is there any co-ordination between the Minister's Department and the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Environment and Local Government? I do not believe there is. If one were to speak to the Ministers concerned I do not believe they would know what one was talking about. We are presiding over the demise of wildlife in this country.</P>
    <P>In her opening statement the Minister referred to the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna which was introduced in 1973 and is so far removed from reality that it is unbelievable. The species covered by the convention include tigers, parrots, snakes, cacti, pitcher plants &ndash; whatever they are &ndash; and ivory and coral. It provides for a strict regime on the import, export and re-export of endangered species. This convention is irrelevant to the wildlife which exists or did exist in this country. I see numerous parrots, primarily on the front benches of the House but the only tiger I ever heard of in this country is the Celtic tiger of our economy, outside of Duffy's and Fossett's circuses.</P>

        <i> (Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>It is critically important to have effective legal protection of wild plants, wild creatures and their habitats. It is particularly important to have effective legal pro<Col N="1632" /> tection in the context of developments in the modern capitalist economy. If it were allowed, many developers would think nothing of riding roughshod over the natural habitats of animals, birds, insects and plants, as some rode roughshod over considerations of proper planning and the wishes of ordinary people and their communities in the corruption scandals in Dublin County Council in the 1980s and 1990s which I had the displeasure of witnessing and fighting against, and some of the worst excesses of which I was able to stop.</P>
      <P>When people who are concerned about our natural heritage raise concerns about a proposed development which may destroy a unique species of wildlife, ignoramuses joke about progress being held up for a snail, a frog or some obscure creature. Occasionally sections of the media join in also. Those people should think again. We should remember that each living species is the product of millions of years of evolution. They are the culmination of eons of time in the struggle for survival, suffering toil and tragedy since the time millions of years ago when life most likely crawled in some form from the primeval seas. When we talk about the destruction of a species, we are talking about creatures that have a heritage of tens of millions of years, that have shared this earth with human beings for millions of years and which predated human beings in many cases. Therefore, it is only the ignoramuses and the yahoos who will take a position of lightly joking about the destruction of a species whether an animal, a plant or an insect, in order to allow some capitalist so-called entrepreneur make a killing from whatever development is in question.</P>
      <P>Profit hungry capitalism is a greedy and voracious entity and, in most cases, cares little about the natural heritage of this country or the world. This Government is now embarking on a national development plan with somewhere in the region of £45 billion proposed to be spent over the next five or seven years. We will see new so-called growth centres, vast new roads and dual carriageways and many new developments. Unquestionably, some of the people who stand to make a killing from this development plan, including contractors, developers and some landowners, will care little about the impact this may have on wildlife and the natural habitats which may be destroyed to make way for these developments. There is a serious onus on the Department to ensure strict measures are in place to protect and conserve the wildlife and habitats which would be affected by such developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The destruction of species worldwide in recent decades has been truly horrifying. We are talking about irreplaceable wildlife. In the Amazon basin, as we know, rain forests equivalent in area to Munster were cut and burned each year until recently. Here dwells one tenth of the world's plant and animal species and hundreds have been identified as being under threat. Hundreds, if not thousands, of unique species have most likely <Col N="1633" /> been destroyed in the destruction of the Amazon and other rain forests. Even the mahogany tree is listed as one of those now threatened.</P>
    <P>We are talking about an area of the world which is, because of its climate, perhaps more rich and more intensively populated in terms of wildlife and various species and where, for example, up to 40 species of ant can exist in one tree. It shows the capacity for the destruction of a whole swathe of the world's heritage of wildlife by the unthinking and greedy impetus of the multi-national companies and, in the case of the Amazon, the Brazilian companies which care not about the indigent people or the wildlife.</P>
    <P>The World Conservation Monitoring Centre lists a number of creatures, including the red squirrel and the lesser horseshoe bat, as being threatened worldwide. These creatures are found in Ireland and, therefore, there is a serious onus on this country to do its share, and stringently, to ensure these creatures survive. Anyone who grew up in rural Ireland in the 1950s and 1960s mourns the virtual extinction of the corncrake, a bird whose call was as familiar to us as most other things in life. It was a familiar harbinger of spring and summer. In most areas of the country it is no longer to be heard. That is an enormous loss to all of us but to young people in particular, who may never hear what was a unique species of wildlife.</P>
    <P>The Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, 1999, in so far as it increases protection of wildlife, is welcome. Providing statutory protection to natural heritage areas and strengthening the protection of special areas of conservation are aims and objectives with which we would all agree. In view of some recent controversies, we need to think long and hard about the attitude of various bureaucracies to these areas. The episode involving the Glen of the Downs, for example, was a particularly shameful one in the history of the protection of wildlife in this country. Some of the natural heritage was unnecessarily put at risk, including the aged oaks, and other aspects of wildlife were encroached upon for the sake of bringing traffic a few seconds more quickly to the already traffic-glutted capital.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the framers of the legislation should listen very carefully to the submissions made by groups which have for many years been campaigning to protect and preserve the wildlife of this country. The Irish Council Against Blood Sports has made some very relevant and important submissions and they should be taken on board. They have been outlined by some Deputies already. There is no reason or excuse for night hunting which should be banned out of hand. It is amazing that the Minister does not propose an outright ban on stag hunting. It defies belief that people can breed a stag in captivity and at a certain time bring it to an appointed place and set it loose set free to be harassed and harried by dogs and humans alike. That is an incredible scenario and it is a minority of retrogrades who would have anything to do with such <Col N="1634" /> a so-called sport. It is the perversion of sport; it is not a sport and it should be banned outright. There is still an opportunity to do that.</P>
    <P>I have heard that the Minister is conducting a review of whether hunting should be allowed in State-owned lands and national parks. The State-owned national parks should be areas of conservation where hunting should not be allowed, where creatures should be allowed to exist in peace and where the only communion between humans and nature would be in peaceful coexistence. That should be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I agree also with the Irish Council Against Bloodsports that the otter hunting ban must be further copperfastened by an extension of the legislation and of protection. They have pointed out how mink hunting can be used as a cover for otter hunting and even if it were not, that it can significantly disturb the habitat of the otter. This is a very strong case for further measures to be taken by the Minister in this regard; the same could apply to hare coursing. I remember as a child the awful spectacle of live hare coursing, the trauma and suffering of these creatures as they were torn asunder literally and I can still hear those awful squeals. That the dogs are now muzzled is only a slight amelioration of the terror imposed on these wild creatures. I do not see why it should be maintained.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to examine the question of licences. Perhaps on Committee Stage, it could be further outlined that what is being proposed in the legislation is licences to photograph certain kinds of wild creatures and also licences to keep certain kinds of wild creatures. Anything that protects, preserves and roots out illegal trading in protected species is to be welcomed but one has to have a balance, and not compromise it in any sense, but one should also not be unduly bureaucratic regarding the photography issue. Further guidelines should be outlined as to what exactly is meant by that. It is a representation that has been made again, I think, by the Irish Council Against Bloodsports. The Minister should discuss that issue further with them.</P>
    <P>The Irish Wildlife Trust has also made a valuable submission to the Bill which should be taken into account, particularly the question of consultation with conservation organisations regarding the areas that would be designated as natural heritage areas, which should be taken seriously and included in section 16. There are many groups who take a great interest and have a great knowledge and expertise in wildlife, the conservation of wildlife and the natural heritage. They should be more involved. There are other valuable recommendations made which the Minister should take seriously.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about a new development within our ecosystems and environment, that is the genetic engineering of plants and crops that American multinationals are attempting to foist on this country and on Europe generally. This represents a potentially very grave threat to our wildlife. We have multinational companies who <Col N="1635" /> presume to interfere with the very heart of life, the genetic code of life, to insert poisons through the genes into crops and plants, to poison, for example, insects. The consequences for our natural habitats are incalculable. It would be criminal to allow these people and these companies, after a few years of experiments in a laboratory, to bring into the wild, in effect, new species, which have been perverted for profit in the laboratory and which have a very severe follow-on effect on the chain of life where the insects that are poisoned can poison the birds and so on along the chain. This is not provided for and I still have to study the Bill fully. This is a very complex and large Bill but I do not see this provided for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity of speaking on this Bill and I would like to compliment the Minister on bringing it forward after a long period of deliberation and consultation. It is rather complex legislation and it is important that this debate takes place. The <Col N="1636" /> quicker the Bill goes to Committee Stage the better, to facilitate everyone concerned. It is just the beginning. This matter has been neglected and by introducing this Bill, the Minister must take some credit for putting it on the agenda. I listened over the monitor to an excellent speech by Deputy Deasy. He was rather over-critical of the Minister because we must all share some of the responsibility for ignoring this very critical area of our heritage, environment and our ecosystem.</P>
      <P>Some of us may have taught in the past as I did. I was a geography and environmental studies teacher and I preached this gospel to my pupils whenever I had the opportunity. I pointed out to them that the land reclamation taking place down the road, which I showed them, was destroying important habitats and that the money we were receiving from Europe at that time was destructive in the sense of the unnecessary removal of hedgerows and earthen works and so on. Unfortunately, no one cried stop. It was done in the name of progress. Trees were removed unnecessarily and some of our native species that took years to develop were removed in seconds by bulldozers. It is regrettable that that policy prevailed in the 1970s and 1980s. It is only now people have come to regret it and have seen the folly of what was done at that time. It is ironic that the REP scheme is trying to undo the damage done at that time. The attitude towards and policy on conservation in Europe has changed. Programmes that emanate from Europe contain an environmental proofing clause providing that they must take account of environmental considerations. That is only right.</P>
      <P>When I was a Minister of State in the Department of Agriculture I had responsibility for the REP scheme. I enthusiastically embraced that responsibility because I recognised its value. Deputy Deasy more or less implied it was a failure. It does not cover all of Ireland. Approximately 40,000 farmers participate in it and they are helping to protect the environment. It is unfortunate that it does not cover all farm land.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the REP scheme encouraged farmers to protect their environment. Its principal philosophy is environmental sustainability. Those who participate in it are rewarded. If we are serious about protecting the environment, we need to give people incentives to protect it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was Minister of State in the Deputy of Agriculture I set up a consultancy group, which included various interest groups, including officials from the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, the Irish Wildbird Conservancy and all bone fide non-governmental organisations with an interest in the environment and wildlife. That consultancy group enhanced the quality of the REP scheme. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, my successor did not consider it worthwhile to keep that group in place and its members were disappointed. I will discuss that matter with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and probably table a <Col N="1637" /> question on it to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. This issue is not confined only to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, it embraces several Departments.</P>
    <P>In September 1998 I introduced a landscape policy which I dealt with extensively when the Planning and Development Bill was debated here. There is a major overlap between the provisions of the Bill before us and the Planning and Development Bill and I am sure many other Bills that will be introduced. There is a need for a national landscape policy. Many of the provisions proposed in this Bill and in the Planning and Development Bill are contained in my landscape policy proposal. That proposal referred to the inadequate provision of parks and sensitively designed green spaces within our urban landscape. We seem to forget that environmental protection is as important in urban areas as it is in rural areas. Important habitats in urban areas are being destroyed. Deputy Deasy referred to the threat to the owl's habitat and I agree with him. Urban areas have a number of important habitats. The wholesale development of urban areas has undoubtedly contributed to the extinction of many of those habitats.</P>
    <P>I walk the Kerry hills on a regular basis with the local walking club and I have observed that overgrazing and poor pasture management has led to the erosion and destruction of upland regions. There has been a major decline in the number of animal and bird species on our hills and as time passes those numbers will decline further.</P>
    <P>The landscape policy proposal also referred to the impact of the change in the management of our hedgerows in the wake of more intensive agricultural practices, which is also referred to in the Bill. That proposal also referred to the general loss of biodiversity in our flora and fauna and the specific loss of wildlife habitats throughout the landscape. A stronger measure than this Bill is required to protect our landscape, which is critical.</P>
    <P>I welcome the many positive aspects of the Bill. I welcome the provision for statutory protection of natural heritage areas, the clarification of the full protection of special areas of conservation from the date of notification, the control of trading and collection of flora and fauna to enable Ireland to ratify the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and the measure to incorporate the protection of fish species. I also welcome the provisions to statutorily protect sites of geological interest, to tighten up the issuing of licences to tourist shooters and to increase penalties for breaches of the Wildlife Acts. There should not be any diminution of those provisions on Committee Stage, rather they should be strengthened if possible.</P>
    <P>Aspects of the Bill could be improved to afford more effective protection of our heritage. The Minister may have heard of some of the improvements I propose from the various interest groups. <Col N="1638" /> There is a need for a process of statutory referral and independent arbitration in this area. That has been emphasised by the Heritage Council. Concern has been expressed that the importance of nature conservation is not given due recognition in the planning legislation and in the planning process. To address this deficiency, there is a pressing need to establish a statutory system of referral between planning authorities and Dúchas in respect of applications for planning permission within NHAs and SACs. Applications for planning permission for developments proposed in a designate site should be referred to Dúchas for its recommendation. Dúchas is obliged to respond to all such referrals and planning permission must not be granted by a planning authority until a recommendation has been received. If a planning authority decides to grant planning permission where Dúchas has recommended against it, the case should be automatically referred to An Bord Pleanála due to the nature of these particular applications. That is not the case at present. An Bord Pleanála should be instructed to adjudicate expeditiously on such cases. An Bord Pleanála can decide on the case from a national perspective, given the NHAs and SACs are sites of national importance and, if necessary, recommend an alternative site for a proposed development. That Minister might discuss that proposal with her officials.</P>
    <P>It is also necessary to ensure Departments, State agencies and local authorities come within the remit of the Bill. The general thrust of the Bill is heavily weighted towards placing restrictions on farmers while other sectors are largely exempt from the provisions of the Act, as it appears to depend on self-regulation of Departments, State agencies and local authorities. Of particular concern to a number of people is the exclusion of development by local authorities, which is not an exempted development for the purpose of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 to 1993, from the definition of works in relation to natural heritage areas. I ask the Minister to comment on that point. All works or developments by Departments, State agencies and local authorities in designated sites should be subject to the statutory referral and independent arbitration process I outlined. If there is a problem they should be referred also to An Bord Pleanála. This is an important aspect of the Bill and one which the Minister should try to include in some form on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Placing natural heritage areas on a statutory basis is a welcome development. However, the designation of sites should be recognised as only a means towards an end. The production of management plans for all sites designated for natural conservation is essential if their management is to be effective. For this reason the production of management plans for natural heritage areas should be a statutory requirement. I refer in passing to a committee, of which I am member in Kerry County Council, the Barrow, Banna, Bal<Col N="1639" /> lyheigue working group. The Barrow, Banna. Ballyheigue dune system and coastal area management working group was established as an initiative of Kerry County Council in September 1999. It consists of representatives from local environmental organisations, Dúchas, elected representatives, executives of Kerry County Council and is chaired by the director of community enterprise and Kerry County Council. The primary objective of this working group is to consider the overall coastal area management and dune system represented and defined by the recently published Dúchas SAC management plan. In particular, the group will focus on initiatives which could be undertaken to heighten the awareness of this area as an important environmental resource. Specific consideration is being given to programmes to be funded by LIFE or other initiatives. This model could be replicated around the country.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to refer to Banna Strand and its sand dunes. I corresponded with the Minister's Department on a number of occasions and pointed out the seriousness of the destruction of sand dunes in Banna. I pointed out that what was done there by a developer was potentially explosive and the damage has not been undone. I will give a brief summary of what happened. During March 1998 three to four acres of sand dunes were levelled and destroyed on the coastline at Banna Strand. Part of this site may have enjoyed planning permission in the past but one acre, containing sand dunes, which was outside the bounds of planning was levelled. Most of this site has been designated for special protection and conservation status. The area destroyed outside the bounds of planning was designated a prime special amenity area by Kerry County Council. Since this demolished site could no longer sustain development, Kerry County Council revoked the licence prohibiting the use of the site as a caravan park. Unfortunately, since then other breaches of planning have taken place at this site, including the laying of sewer pipes. All of this development was unauthorised. There is also an obstruction on a right-of-way.</P>
    <P>In this case the developer gave a commitment to restore the dunes to their former formation but the site has not been restored properly. Recently slurry was spread on the grass sown there. The whole area is mismanaged. Will the Minister make inquiries about this area? From a European perspective it would reflect poorly on Kerry County Council, Dúchas and on all of us if people looked at the site and saw what has happened there.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the lack of positive incentives for wildlife protection. The rural environment protection scheme gave incentives and promoted environmental awareness and responsibility but it also compensated the farmers.</P>
    <P>The majority of the Bill is concerned with outlining the restrictions and prohibitions necessary to protect Ireland's wildlife. I have expressed my <Col N="1640" /> concerns and reservations about this approach. The protection of Ireland's wildlife can only be achieved if there is a balanced approach between restrictions and incentives, as in the case of REPS. The Bill should incorporate some positive incentives to achieve nature conservation objectives. This could most easily be achieved through making provision for the Minister to outline a series of desirable management measures for SACs and NHAs and linking them to other policy initiatives, for example, the integrated rural development policy of the recently agreed CAP reform package. If possible, perhaps the Minister would link in management plans of SACs and NHAs, whether total plans for the whole areas or individual plans for stakeholders in those areas, with the next integrated rural development programme.</P>
    <P>There is a period within which hedgerow cutting is not allowed. Given that many birds commence breeding earlier in Ireland than elsewhere, hedgerow cutting should be prohibited from 1 March rather than 1 April as proposed. In the event of a mild spring, birds nest earlier as was the case this year. They react to the weather and the temperature. I propose that such cutting be prohibited from 1 March. I suggest the Minister look at the maximum penalty for breaches of the law in this area.</P>
    <P>While the amendments I propose would enhance the area of the country formerly designated for its nature conservation value, there does not appear to have been any assessment of the resources and management structures needed to implement this legislation. Deputy Deasy referred to this matter. Dúchas, the heritage service, has great difficulty in meeting its responsibilities under the EU Natural Habitats Regulation 1997 and the failure to identify the requirements necessary to deliver on the additional responsibilities in relation to NHAs is a serious weakness. Enacting legislation in the absence of an assessment of the resources and management structures needed for the effective implementation of the legislation is unlikely to lead to a substantial benefit for Irish heritage. The case has been made for implementation and the provision of resources.</P>
    <P>The cornbunting which was in the south-east is now officially extinct. Other species are also extinct.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister has brought forward this important Bill. It is unfortunate that more Deputies are not interested in the Bill but this may be through a lack of awareness. For those of us who are interested it is important that we assist the Minister in every way possible. I hope she can take some of our suggestions on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly:</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not wish to delay the passage of the Bill I will make a few brief comments. I compliment the Minister on bringing the Bill forward. There has been a long delay in drafting the legislation. Deputy Michael Kitt spoke about being involved with the committee in 1974-<Col N="1641" /> 75 when a former Ceann Comhairle, Mr. Tom Fitzpatrick, was Minister for Lands. I too was a member of that committee. Even before that legislation was passed there were indications that substantial areas in need of attention were not dealt with in the Act. Even though the Bill has taken a long time it is welcome and will be debated more fully on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I had the opportunity in the 1980s to look at the way in which the Departments which had responsibility for fisheries and forestry were structured and to identify the policy that ought to be followed in the changed circumstances 50 years after their establishment. It was apparent that there was much duplication and overlapping and that there was a necessity to identify ways in which matters could be dealt with more efficiently.</P>
      <P>In opposition we published a policy document which provided for the establishment of a Department of the Marine &ndash; Roinn na Mara &ndash; and identified ways in which maritime industries ought to be developed. Unfortunately we did not follow through fully on it in government for political reasons. It was proposed, for example, that the Department of Tourism should have responsibility for inland fisheries but that was never done. They remained under my responsibility in the Department of the Marine. When they come to write my obituary it will be said that I was the famous Minister who introduced the fishing licence. If the policy I had devised had been followed, that would never have happened as inland fisheries would have come under the jurisdiction of the Department of Tourism.</P>
      <P>When the policy on forestry was looked at, little or no consideration was given to where the wildlife section of the old Department of Lands and Forestry should be located, following the reorganisation of the Department and the establishment of a semi-State body, Coillte, to develop and exploit the potential of the timber business &ndash; it is doing so successfully &ndash; as suggested in our policy document. It was left in a vacuum and in an effort to find a solution it was tagged on to the Office of Public Works. There have been further changes since, following the establishment of Dúchas.</P>
      <P>I expressed the view at the time that there was a necessity to establish a countryside commission similar to the one established in the United Kingdom which would have responsibility for the conservation and management of wildlife, some fisheries and related activities, but this has not been done. Part of the reason the Bill was delayed for so long was that there was no clear policy on who should be given this mandate. There are references throughout the Bill to the necessity for the Minister to consult other Ministers. She will have to consult, for example, the Minister with responsibility for the Office of Public Works in respect of arterial drainage and related matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no wish to delay the Bill unduly, which can be passed speedily through both Houses, but <Col N="1642" /> this is an opportune time to look at ways in which it might be possible to remedy some of the policy defects which have been apparent for ten to 15 years following the establishment of Roinn na Mara and Coillte. Some of the important matters with which they have to deal should be the responsibility of a separate semi-State body such as a countryside commission or similar authority.</P>
    <P>There are references throughout the Bill to the payment of compensation, the organisation of SACs and the necessity to put arbitration and appeal mechanisms in place, matters which will draw the Minister unnecessarily into areas which should be the responsibility of a local body. I have been drafting legislation for a long time but there are sections which I find difficult to understand. Deputy Donal Carey who is a mathematician will require the assistance of others in calculating the compensation to be paid in cases where permission is refused in special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas.</P>
    <P>So far as possible the Bill should be operated at local level. I fail to understand why the Department would want to be drawn into complicated and complex arbitration arrangements for resolving issues which should be the responsibility of a local organisation, of which there are many, including regional fisheries boards and regional authorities. It will be difficult to secure satisfactory decisions by way of such arrangements.</P>
    <P>I would like to see local and planning authorities having some responsibility in relation to some provisions of the Bill. While an arbitration mechanism will be put in place, some of the Acts in question are antiquated and not up to speed with what is happening in the country. There have been changes to planning law, for example. They predate the establishment of bodies such as An Bord Pleanála. There have also been developments in the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>This is an opportune time to look at policy and decide whether the time has come to establish a separate semi-State body such as a countryside commission to deal with these complex matters which would be more visible and acceptable to local communities. As the Minister is well aware, because of EU directives small farmers will no longer be able to operate in the Burren in north Clare. While there have been negotiations to resolve the matter, many farmers are very unhappy about some of the conditions attached to special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas and are of the view that their livelihoods are under threat. We must try to avoid this. While there is a need to protect the environment and support the views expressed by Deputy Deasy and others, there is also a need to keep in mind that the communities in these areas also have to live. We do not want to throw out the baby with the bathwater.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that so much emphasis is being placed on EU directives. For God's sake, they would blast one out of it in Europe. They shoot at everything. Visitors to this country from Spain <Col N="1643" /> and other countries in Europe have shot blackbirds and finches. The wildlife population here is far healthier than that in many other member states of the European Union from which we do not need strictures or directions. They have made a hash of it and have some work to do to clean up their act. We listened to environmental programmes on radio in recent weeks where people went to national parks and other areas to hear the dawn chorus which was louder and healthier this year than for many years. I have been told by people in west Clare that there are significant numbers of goldfinches to be seen which has not been the case for four or five years. There are cycles in wildlife as with salmon. The Shannon salmon disappeared but, thankfully, it is starting to reappear. There was a pretty good season last year and, I hope, we will get back to the kind of catches landed 50 or 60 years ago.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the damage to the wildlife population is as significant as has been suggested. Nevertheless, this Bill provides an opportunity to put forward suggestions as to how we should look at this area in the future. There is a need to give detailed responsibility for the management, preservation and conservation of wildlife to a semi&ndash;</P>
    <P>State or other agency, under the aegis of the Department. Such a body would be able to consult other Departments so that the Minister and other Ministers would not have to keep in regular communication regarding complaints that action is not being taken to deal with problems. I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister for expediting it through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are significant economic issues concerning wildlife. An estimated 300,000 people take part in field sports and there is a keen interest in national parks and the species to be found in them. Deputy Daly referred to the countryside commission in the UK and there is a need for a similar body in this country. Coiste na Tuaithe would probably be the Irish name for such a body, but it should be established to allow for sustainable wildlife development.</P>
      <P>The development of wildlife has been a hit and miss affair. Voluntary groups play a significant role. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and UCD produced a report in 1995 which examined the economic significance of field and country sports. This report was updated in 1998 by the Irish Field and Country Sports Society. The report does not cover all sports but updates figures to take account of inflation and deals with the major sports of fox hunting, harriers, pony clubs, coursing, shooting, beagling and deer hunting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether NGOs or the Irish Field and Country Sports Society were consulted about the Bill but there is a need for on-going consultation. Difficulties can arise. For example, I recently came across about 12 deer in the middle of the road at the bottom of Dromoland Hill. The animals were quite startled because a new road is <Col N="1644" /> being constructed across their natural run. Earth had been pilled high during the construction of this new road so the animals were standing in the middle of a national primary route and they could have been mowed down.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that anything can be done about this during road development. However, I am disappointed that the National Roads Authority does not seem to make any provision for deer crossings. The Great Southern and Great Northern Railways constructed wildlife bridges in the rail system but if one raises this issue with the NRA it replies by mentioning the cost of such measures. This is one of the few remaining herds of deer in County Clare. There are wild goats on the Burren and quite a variety of wildlife in the county. Deputy Daly rightly stated that County Clare is not badly off in terms of wildlife. However, the NRA should consider and make some contribution to sustainable heritage when national primary routes are being developed.</P>
    <P>Work on the national primary route into Ennis was held up because of a rare species of bat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">

      <P>The lesser horseshoe bat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand this because these bats were disturbed a number of times. The route was from Ballybeg to Clareabbey, which will cross the new route. People complained about this but bats will find their own safe haven. If they do not feel safe or are disturbed they will just leave. Bats are very protective of themselves. Zoologists and others probably know more about the habits of bats than I do, but local knowledge is also valuable. Deputy Daly is right to suggest that each county council should have a wildlife and heritage committee. Engineers undertaking developments have to take cognisance of these issues. They need not cause significant delays as people are busy and are anxious to get on with their tasks. However, issues such as this seem to be put on the long finger and more local input would be very valuable.</P>
      <P>The Minister received much correspondence from the masters of foxhound associations and so on regarding section 51 of the Bill. In her speech she said she was examining this issue. Is she proposing to delete the section or what is the situation? I was present in the House for Question Time when she said she was going to make changes, but I thought she was referring to the offences. People are seeking clarification on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By and large I am pleased the Bill has come before the House. We will have an opportunity to further debate it on Committee Stage, giving us a better understanding of wildlife and how it is viewed by the Department. I commend Esso, the oil company, for its wildlife challenge which is an all-Ireland scheme. I do not know if the Department has any input to it. Some of the competitions were won by schools in the North of Ireland and fourth and fifth classes in the Republic and the equivalent grades in the North <Col N="1645" /> can participate. There have been some wonderful winners, including Ballycahill national school in Thurles, County Tipperary, which won it for a postcard about forestry recently. Over 4,000 schools took up the Esso challenge that year.</P>
    <P>Has the Department considered helping the Esso challenge to expand by designating the type of species it wants to emphasise in a particular year? Rare species are disappearing and reappearing because of the major works on roads and housing that are taking pace. Perhaps work could be carried out on this aspect in relation to, for example, a particular species of bird. It is nice that a major corporation such as Esso is investing in the scheme and perhaps the Department could encourage more companies to get involved in educating young people in school about the value of our heritage and wildlife.</P>

      <P>I thank all those who took part in the debate. All the contributions were worthwhile and a number of suggestions were put forward that I look forward to dealing with in more detail on Committee Stage. This legislation is extremely important. As Members on all sides acknowledged, we have been waiting for some time for its introduction. It is a complex and lengthy Bill and I did my best to ensure that it is balanced and measured. To ensure balance was to the forefront, I took great care to ensure there was ongoing consultation with all the groups who sought it. I met some of those groups, particularly a number of the NGOs, and my officials were in constant contact with the various groups as the legislation was drawn up.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies tried to suggest that I was only prepared to listen to some lobbyists on certain issues with regard to the Bill. However, that is inaccurate. The usual process in drawing up legislation is wide consultation on all the various issues. The Minister then assesses those contributions and he or she either agrees or disagrees with them or puts forward amended versions of them. However, ultimately, the Houses of the Oireachtas make decisions regarding the legislation put before them. Members have an opportunity on Committee Stage to put forward amendments. I also intend to table amendments, which is the right of a Minister introducing legislation.</P>
      <P>I hope that during the consultation process I looked at matters in a positive way. I did my best to reach consensus on various issues where there was a logical approach to them. However, obviously, it was not possible to reach agreement or consensus on every issue. I could not concur with some of the views put forward because I did not consider that they were the best option. I will take the opportunity on Committee Stage to put forward my reasons for not accepting some of the views advanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concerns were expressed during the debate by a number of Deputies about the compensation provisions and other aspects of the natural heri<Col N="1646" /> tage area proposals. This is a most important part of the Bill. The sections relating to NHAs mirror the provisions already in place in relation to SACs. This is a logical approach because we have the benefit of the experience of the lengthy debate and negotiations on the SAC provisions regarding the finalisation of the NHA provisions.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that NGOs should have a role in proposing sites for designation. My Department will carefully consider suggestions made by NGOs and others about areas that appear appropriate for inclusion. However, given my statutory responsibility for the designation of NHAs, the implications of designation for private landowners and the risk that formal third part input could be divisive, it is appropriate that the definitive responsibility for proposals and designation remain with the Minister.</P>
    <P>Concern was also expressed regarding the need to explain the basis for designating NHAs and not proceeding with a designation. There will be no secret about the basis for such decisions and access to scientific cases will be made available to anybody who seeks it. I am most concerned that all elements of this process are transparent. However, I will consider the issue further and return to it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to developments in NHAs. As in the case of SACs, the best way to deal with matters requiring planning permission in NHAs is within the planning process. However, it should be noted that the system proposed in the Bill will not preclude developments within NHAs. An assessment will only be necessary in the case of developments that would cause significant damage to the ecological value of the site.</P>
    <P>I am committed to dealing with all aspects of the NHA process in the spirit of partnership and consultation. Deputies will be aware that I established an appeals advisory board and a local liaison committee system to assist with the consultation process in relation to SACs. I will be happy to extend that system, as necessary, to deal with NHAs.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies raised the importance of protecting hedgerows. As the House is aware, the provisions of the Wildlife Act, 1976, together with the amendments proposed in the Bill, are not intended to protect hedgerows <i>per se</i>, but relate primarily to the protection of birds nesting in hedgerows and other vegetation during the critical April to August bird nesting period. I am confident that the amendments will foster a more positive approach to the problem. Obviously, I share the concerns of Deputies regarding the loss of hedgerows, which are important not only as nesting sites for birds, but as repositories of biodiversity in their own right as wildlife corridors and field boundaries with particular significance from an archaeological perspective. We can learn much from the experience gleaned from the removal of many hedgerows in Britain and the negative effect that had on wildlife.</P>
    <P>I intend to consult my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, <Col N="1647" /> with regard to the possibility of taking measures to protect hedgerows in the context of the new planning regulations which will be made following the enactment of the Planning and Development Bill. I am also considering the possibility of advancing measures within the context of the national biodiversity strategy which I intend to publish in the coming year.</P>
    <P>I wish to confirm that this year, as in previous years, my Department has written to all local authorities requesting that maintenance works to hedgerows are undertaken outside the crucial nesting period. I wish to make this clear because some Deputies were not aware that I had taken this action.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies referred to resources. While, like many other areas, additional resources could be put to good use with regard to nature conservation, I can say with confidence that the sector is now better off and more effectively resourced than ever before. A key element of this is the level of resources in the field where real conservation action takes place. I concur with what Deputy Deasy said about it being one thing to have legislation and another to ensure it is enforced. To do that, we need further personnel, and I am happy to say that I recently obtained sanction for an additional 30 conservation rangers, which represents an increase of approximately 50% on previous levels. This will greatly enhance my Department's capacity to effectively safeguard our wildlife and important habitats. These rangers are supported by an additional 24 administrative and scientific staff, including three regionally-based ecologists who will be on the spot in the regions to deal quickly with issues which arise, for example, in the planning context, and they will be able to do so with the benefit of local knowledge of their areas.</P>
    <P>Concern was expressed about the status of our wild bird population and this was raised by a number of Deputies. I share this concern and, accordingly, I have proposed a number of provisions which will significantly strengthen the level of protection afforded to wild birds. Deputies will be aware, however, that this is a complex issue and that a host of factors can influence the conservation status of bird populations, including perdition, disease, parasites, weather patterns, climate change and changes in the agricultural environment, which can be of great significance. Amendments proposed to strengthen the protection of wild birds include the introduction of natural heritage areas, enhanced controls on hunting which are designed to serve the interests of wildlife conservation, greater protection of the eggs of wild birds, measures to allow the State to ratify the African-Eurasian Migratory Water Birds Agreement, and the substantial increase in the level of penalties for contravention of the Wildlife Acts.</P>
    <P>Issues have been raised by various Deputies about sections 46 and 51 and the potential restrictions these sections could place on legitimate <Col N="1648" /> forms of hunting. I have already signalled my intention to address these matters on Committee Stage, and discussions in this regard are being finalised between my office and the Attorney General's office.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the licensing by my Department of the snaring of badgers under the ongoing research programme of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development in the context of bovine TB in cattle and badgers. This programme is subject to review on an annual basis by officials of both Departments. In issuing the licences I am aware of and have sought to balance the clearly established need for further scientific research for the purposes of the TB eradication programme with my statutory responsibilities for the protection of the badger under the Wildlife Act, 1976. Having regard to the advice available to me, I am satisfied that the programme does not pose any threat to the conservation of the badger species.</P>
    <P>Regarding issues concerning animal welfare which were raised, I emphasise that my statutory remit is specifically focused on conservation and, as such, animal welfare does not fall within the remit of my Department. Accordingly, issues raised such as the regulation of coursing and fox hunting are not appropriate to the Bill as they fall within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
    <P>The issue of the restrictions on turf cutting has been questioned during the debate. The arrangements I announced last year apply only to special areas of conservation. Those arrangements provide for a generous system of compensation with domestic cutters being allowed to continue cutting for a ten year period in all but the most sensitive areas.</P>
    <P>Regarding other issues raised on the designation of special areas of conservation, Deputies will be aware that the legislation catering for SACs was transposed in the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997. Accordingly, the designation of SACs is not at issue, apart from the important amendment to the definition of &ldquo;European site&rdquo; contained in section 76.</P>
    <P>There were also references to the need for the consolidation of wildlife legislation. This is an important point and I agree that consolidation would be preferable. However, if we had waited for consolidation, the gestation period for this Bill, which is already excessive as I am sure all would agree, would have been much longer. The first priority was to get this long-awaited legislation on the Statute Book. I will be happy to examine the issue further of consolidation at that time.</P>
    <P>I thank all the Deputies and appreciate their positive approach to the Bill and to the number of issues they have taken the opportunity of raising with me on Second Stage. I hope I have clarified some of the principles concerned and expressed in the Bill. I look forward to Committee Stage where there will be a further oppor<Col N="1649" /> tunity to discuss all these matters in greater detail. I thank all who contributed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill marks an important milestone in the Government's approach to the reform and modernisation of our licensing laws. It is the most comprehensive package of reform measures introduced to the Oireachtas on this issue. It has benefited from sound and productive debate in the Seanad, where it was initiated, and I look forward to further debate in this House.</P>
      <P>The Bill is wide-ranging and progressive in that it introduces a system of permitted hours in line with public expectation and demand and on terms which are economically and socially acceptable. It does away with decades-old restrictive legislation governing access to the market without undermining the economic basis which obtains for the holders of licences. It introduces innovative, workable and strict penalties against those who engage in the criminally irresponsible practice of selling or supplying intoxicating liquor to under age persons. It also introduces complementary and, in certain cases, much needed reform of the law as it pertains to registered clubs. I am sure most people would agree that the package of measures provided for in the Bill is progressive and responsive to modern needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gestation period for the Bill has been long. I prefer to think it reflects a solid process of consultation, reflection and determination to deal with the issues. Anyone who knows the licensing laws knows they are labyrinthine in their complexity. It is also the case that everyone has a view on them and that these are widely differing and strongly held. I am sure this will be borne out by the debate. I expect there will be many contributions, all of them worthy and reflective of the personal and political views of Deputies on a subject which excites sometimes passionate views. It was important to me that, because of that interest, I take the time to canvass widely for views before I put forward my policy proposals <Col N="1650" /> to the Government. I can safely say that, in developing the proposals in the Bill, I have interpreted the public mood correctly as far as what is demanded by way of change is concerned and, more importantly, what changes will work and gain acceptance across many different strata and interests.</P>
    <P>I do not claim that what I propose will fully satisfy every member of the drinking and non-drinking public, every publican, restaurateur or other licence holder or every Member. There will be some who will consider that I have not gone far enough, as there will be some who will hold the view that I have gone too far. I am convinced that the proposals in the Bill represent the best possible deal for all in that they strike a fair balance among the many different interest groups, be they groups representing the licensed trade, such as publicans, hoteliers, restaurateurs, night club operators or off-licence holders, or groups in society, not least the consumer and responsible parents concerned about the negative consequences of under age drinking.</P>
    <P>The process of examination and change to the licensing laws, especially as far as the licensing system is concerned, does not end with this Bill. I recognise more remains to be done. For this reason I will shortly establish a commission on licensing. Following the publication of the Bill and its passage through the Oireachtas, there will be a clearer picture of the new law and, consequently, it will be possible to establish a clearer remit for the commission. The commission will review the scope for a system of additional licences in the context of the new law in this area. It will examine the nature of the off-licence and other forms of licence and it will seek to establish what premises might benefit from licences and how such premises might be licensed. This will be achieved in a programmed and coherent way, consistent with public expectations and the common good. The commission will be a representative one whose membership will include Departments, representatives of the trade and of consumers and other interests. The details are being progressed following on the Government's approval in principle for the establishment of the commission.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute, as I have done consistently, to the Oireachtas joint sub-committee which undertook a study of the licensing laws and whose report represented an informed basis for my detailed policy examination of this area. I have taken many of its recommendations on board in the Bill and I was grateful for the informed view it offered me of cross-party thought on reform of the law. I acknowledge the interim report of the Competition Authority and the many submissions I received from interest groups and members of the public.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies will agree it is no exaggeration that almost every provision in the Bill is of importance and of effect on persons in varying degrees, depending on whether they are licensees of one class or another or customers. There is, <Col N="1651" /> therefore, much to inform the House on the Bill, but I will be as brief as possible.</P>
    <P>Part 1 contains standard provisions dealing with the Short Title, collective citation, construction and commencement and defining some of the terms used in the Bill. As far as commencement is concerned, it is my hope, as I am sure it is the hope of the House, that the main provisions of the Bill will be brought into effect as quickly as possible on enactment so that the benefits of extended hours, for example, can be enjoyed for the coming summer. Part 2, containing sections 3 to 14, deals with the general question of hours of opening of licensed premises and registered clubs.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the abolition of the distinction between summer time and winter time so that licensed premises will be permitted to remain open from 10.30 a.m. to 11.30 p.m. on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays and from 10.30 a.m. to 12.30 a.m. of the following days, on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Sunday opening will be from 12.30 p.m. to 11 p.m. This means that Sunday closing between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. is also abolished. There is no change to Sunday night closing time and Christmas Day, except in the case of limited opening for hotels and restaurants, and Good Friday will continue to be days on which there are no permitted hours. On St. Patrick's Day, no matter on what day this falls, opening times will be between 12.30 p.m. and 12.30 a.m. on the following day. On 23 December, if it falls on a Sunday, opening will be permitted between 10.30 a.m. and 11.30 p.m. On Christmas Eve and the eve of Good Friday opening hours will be between 10.30 a.m. and 11.30 p.m. and on the eve of any public holiday premises may remain open until 12.30 a.m. on the following day. Thirty minutes drinking up time will also be permitted on all days.</P>
    <P>These changes are progressive. They introduce trading hours which reflect the changed pattern in drinking habits without applying a free for all, as would be the case if the Government had opted to provide for 24 hour opening of licensed premises. I am sure most Deputies agree there is no demand for 24 hour opening. No set of closing times will suit the needs and expectations of every individual. My view was that if I had to place a time limit on closing, it should satisfy the greatest number. That is what I have done. The package of permitted hours put forward in the Bill represents the greatest level of consensus, not just from within the trade and among customers but also from within the House.</P>
    <P>Section 4 introduces important changes to the law relating to premises engaged in a mixture of retail activity, licensed and non-licensed. Under existing legislation, the hours of trading of supermarkets, including small independent supermarkets and convenience stores, are regulated, not just in respect of alcoholic products but also in respect of other products which constitute the bulk of the trade of those outlets, for example, groceries. This means that premises which engage <Col N="1652" /> in mixed trading are restricted with regard to the hours during which their non-licensed business may be carried out. The Bill, as amended, provides that premises which engage in mixed trading will be permitted to open at any time to engage in their business of selling groceries and other non-alcoholic products.</P>
    <P>I am also providing for a certain relaxation with regard to the hours during which licensed trade can be carried out in these premises. Those premises will be permitted to open for the sale of intoxicating liquor at 8 a.m. to 10.30 a.m. on weekdays and on a Sunday which falls on 23 or 24 December. This is a consumer friendly change which greatly enhances the opportunities of supermarkets and other retail outlets. The change is a response to representations made by IBEC on the matter.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is an important section for nightclub and disco operators. It changes the law as it applies to special exemptions. These are granted by the District Court and permit the sale of intoxicating liquor on special occasions in licensed premises after normal closing time. The section abolishes the need to provide a meal as a condition of an exemption in the case of a special occasion, which is a dance, held in a ballroom licensed under the Public Dance Halls Act, 1935, as well as the requirement that a premises be a hotel or restaurant. It also removes the restriction on the granting of a special exemption for any time on a Sunday, that is, after midnight on Saturday night and after normal closing time on a Sunday evening. It retains, however, the restriction on special exemptions for Monday morning beyond 1 a.m., except on a Monday morning that is a public holiday. The special exemption orders will be granted in normal circumstances to 2.30 a.m. unless the court considers it expedient for stated reasons to grant an exemption for a shorter period.</P>
    <P>The special exemption order, together with the dance hall licence, is the means by which a nightclub operates. Many customers in a nightclub do not frequent it to partake in a meal. The main activity is dancing to music and socialising. It is widely accepted that the meal requirement under the law as it stands makes little sense in those circumstances and should be abolished. The need to provide a meal in respect of a special event organised for the entertainment of the members of a particular association, organisation or other such group or on the occasion of a private function remains on the basis that a meal forms a part of such events in the first place.</P>
    <P>It has been brought to my attention that public dance licences may in some cases permit dancing until 1 a.m. or 1.30 a.m. only. This could give rise to a situation where a licensed premises with an exemption order to 2.30 a.m. may have to end the dancing before the end of the exemption. That would not make sense. The solution in section 5 is that where a special exemption order is in force the dance licence will be deemed to be a licence which will permit dancing for a period beyond the <Col N="1653" /> period of the special exemption. This will have the effect of ensuring that the <i>status quo</i> remains in relation to dancing and extended opening hours and that future situations will not be created where there may be an anomaly between the dance licence and the special exemption, or where the dance licence might serve to limit the time to which a special exemption might be granted.</P>
    <P>This section further provides that the number of special exemption orders which may be sought in respect of a day of general or local festivity is being increased from six to 12. This change in the law will serve to benefit local areas where there are dances being held in conjunction with a local festival. Section 5 also introduces a requirement that the grant of the special exemption order will not cause undue inconvenience to persons residing in the vicinity of a premises. This is a new requirement and one which is useful and necessary. It means the court will act as the guardian of the rights of local residents and be in a position to protect local residents where the late opening of a licensed premises might not be appropriate.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for an exemption to the permitted hours where alcohol is served in a hotel or restaurant. It extends permitted hours in these circumstances by one hour over and above the time in which these premises may lawfully sell intoxicating liquor, provided it is supplied with a meal. However, the section does not overly restrict where the liquor should be consumed or when it should be paid for. This should provide restaurants and hotels and their patrons with a certain flexibility, while ensuring the premises will not be used for the purpose of obtaining after-hours drinks only. To ensure conformity in the law, I am also providing for a similar provision in relation to clubs registered under the Registration of Clubs Acts. Section 7, in effect, applies the hours contained in section 3 to clubs registered under the Registration of Clubs Acts, 1904 to 1999. Clubs will also benefit from the type of exemption allowed in respect of hotels and restaurants in section 6.</P>
    <P>Section 8 permits drinking-up time of 30 minutes after a period of a special exemption, in respect of licensed premises, or a registered club, following a club authorisation. This means that in cases where a special exemption has been granted to 2.30 a.m., for example, customers will no longer be forced to stop drinking at that time, but will be given adequate time to finish their drinks in an orderly manner.</P>
    <P>I am providing in section 9 for a small change in relation to area exemption orders. These are granted for special events such as local festivals, outside the Dublin county borough. At present, such orders cannot be granted for more than nine days in any one year in respect of a locality. The section provides for an increase, from nine to 12, in the number of days for which licensed premises may seek area exemption orders and it allows such orders to be sought for a range of periods, lasting two, three, four, five or more days.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1654" /> In section 10, I am removing the prohibition on the grant of an occasional licence on a Sunday. Occasional licences are granted to a licensee by the District Court in respect of an unlicensed premises for a particular event. Many festivals, shows or exhibitions are held over a weekend, and it has been represented to me that the relaxation of this prohibition will greatly benefit such activities. Persons who attend such an event over a weekend will now be able to enjoy a drink on Sunday as well as on Saturday.</P>
    <P>Section 11 amends the period for which a general exemption order may be granted. It is a technical amendment which follows as a consequence of the amendment of permitted hours in section 3. Section 12 extends to restaurants which hold a special restaurant licence, namely, a full drinks facility, the revised permitted hours available to all other licensed premises under section 3. It also extends permitted hours by one hour over and above the time in which these premises may lawfully sell intoxicating liquor, provided it is supplied with a meal.</P>
    <P>Part 3, by way of sections 13 and 14, contains important provisions regarding under-age persons. These will be by way of amendments or additions to provisions in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988. The main curbs provided for in that Act are that under section 33 it is an offence for any person under 18 years of age to purchase alcohol, whether in an on-licence or off-licence, or to consume it in any place other than a private residence. Under section 32, it is an offence for any person to purchase alcohol for consumption by a person under 18 years in any place other than a private residence. Under section 31, it is an offence for a licence holder to sell or deliver alcohol to a person under 18 years or to permit consumption of drink by or the supply of drink to those under 18. Under section 37, intoxicating liquor in the possession of under 18s in any place other than a private residence may be seized by the Garda. Under section 34, persons under 15 years are not allowed into the bar of a licensed premises unless accompanied by a parent or guardian. Under section 35, a person under 18 years is allowed in the part of licensed premises where an extension under a special exemption order is in force&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and, under section 36, those under 18 years are not allowed on off-licensed premises unless accompanied by a parent or guardian.</P>
      <P>Other legislative provisions of general application in liquor licensing, public order, road traffic and public health legislation aimed at controlling drinking in public places reinforce the specific underage drinking provisions. My concern in this Bill is to strengthen the law further to ensure it reflects the concerns of parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be a new penalty, by way of section 13, to strengthen the provisions against the supply <Col N="1655" /> or sale of intoxicating liquor to under-age persons. This section inserts a new section 36A in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, and provides that, where a conviction for the sale of alcohol to an under-age person is upheld, a licensed premises will be the subject of a mandatory temporary closure order. Premises which are the subject of such an order will have to display a sign indicating the reason they have been closed temporarily. Endorsement of licence provisions in current law will remain, but it will now be discretionary and not mandatory. The purpose of the new temporary closure provision is to provide a strong deterrent to abuses of the law in this area because it is designed to hit at the pockets of offenders, and publicly identify them, without necessarily having the looming prospect of forfeit of a licence &ndash; a sanction which has been rarely applied by the courts.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides for even further strengthening of the law on under-age drinking. The 1988 Act permitted a licensee to rely on the &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo; defence in any proceedings against the licensee. This section removes that defence. This will place a much greater onus on the licensee and his or her staff to demand proof of age and the national voluntary age card is proposed as the appropriate means open to a licensee to establish such proof. Provision is also made in the Bill to remove the mandatory endorsement of a licence which follows conviction for an offence relating to under-age persons, although under section 12 forfeiture of a licence remains available at the discretion of a judge.</P>
    <P>I am aware these provisions represent some of the toughest ever brought into force against the scourge of under-age drinking. However, they are being introduced for a very good reason. Under-age drinking is a serious problem. Reference has been made to the fact that it is an even greater problem than the abuse of controlled substances and that the age at which persons are now presenting themselves at alcohol treatment centres has fallen dramatically. We have a duty to our young people, our children. Under-age drinking must be tackled and if this is what it takes to tackle it, then this is what we must do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am gratified by the level of support I have received for these strong sanctions against those who engage in the criminally irresponsible act of serving alcohol to children. I have no doubt I will receive similar support from all sides of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 14 also provides for clarification in the law on the employment of young persons in certain licensed premises. Section 38 of the 1988 Act already prohibits persons under the age of 18 from being engaged in the sale of intoxicating liquor &ndash; with certain exceptions for apprentices and relatives of a licensee. The Bill makes clear <Col N="1656" /> that lounge staff may be employed to serve on tables but not from behind the bar of a licensed premises.</P>
    <P>Part 4, which contains sections 15 to 18, deals with the issue, upgrading and transfer of licences. The effect of section 15 is that there will be a requirement simply to extinguish one licence from anywhere in the State when applying for a certificate from the Circuit Court entitling a person to receive a licence from the Revenue Commissioners. Restrictions such as population increases, opening within a mile of an existing premises and the prohibition on the use of a rural licence in a town or city are abolished under this section. The need to prove rateable valuation is dispensed with in relation to the grant of a new licence.</P>
    <P>The courts will take into account the fitness of an applicant and the unfitness or inconvenience of the new premises, their unsuitability for the needs of persons residing in the neighbourhood and the adequacy of the existing number of licensed outlets. The latter requirement of adequacy is not a condition as to the effect new premises will have on the business of existing premises. Rather, it is designed to permit the courts to assess whether a locality is sufficiently served by a particular form of licensed outlet, be it on-licence or off-licence. It will require the courts to assess also whether a premises would be suitable in a particular location allowing for the needs of persons residing in the neighbourhood proposed to be served by the new premises. In this way, the adequacy provision is designed to operate to the advantage of places that are currently under-served as far as licensed premises are concerned. The Government has approved my proposal for the establishment of a commission on licensing. The commission will have ample scope to deliver quality advice to me, as Minister, my successors and the Government of the day in relation to such diverse areas as access to licences, the nature of premises that can or should be licensed, the distribution of licences, and the licensing system.</P>
    <P>The effect of this provision relating to the grant of new licences will be greater mobility of licences from over-provided for and mainly rural areas to locations where there is a demonstrable need for such licences, particularly on the fringes of our major conurbations. It could have the effect, for example, of inducing existing licensees, persons experienced in the trade, to move from areas where they may or may not be operating in a commercially viable way, to areas where there will be greater opportunities for them to provide a service to the public. It will also permit new entrants to the trade by making access to licences easier. I was not convinced, and neither was the Government, by the arguments put forward for full deregulation of access to the licensed trade, as if a licence for the sale of intoxicating liquor could be equated with a licence to sell postage stamps or sweets. Whether we like it or not alcohol is not the same as other retail products, and I <Col N="1657" /> am mindful of the very negative consequences of alcohol abuse and the effect a totally deregulated regime, introduced all at once, could have.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides a mechanism whereby the small number of persons who are the holders of restricted licences, for example six-day licences, can convert them to ordinary seven-day licences. The holder of a restricted licence can at present acquire a full seven-day licence. This involves extinguishing an existing licence or licences. Arguments have been put forward that many of the holders cannot afford to extinguish an existing seven-day licence and are finding it difficult to compete in the licensed trade. The cost of the conversion under the Bill is a one-off fee of £2,500, payable to the Revenue Commissioners and is an attempt to pitch the amount to match the ability of genuine traders. Arguments have been advanced that many holders of six-day licences are operating on the margins of economic activity and would not be in a position to afford a substantial conversion fee. Holders of restricted licences are being given one year to avail of the provisions of the conversion scheme.</P>
    <P>I am concerned to avoid speculation in restricted licences which would appreciate considerably in value if converted as a result of any conversion scheme. This will be avoided as subsection (4) of section 16 ensures that the scheme of conversion will be subject to certain conditions. These are, in addition to the payment of a fee of £2,500 to the Revenue Commissioners, that the premises and restricted licence attached to it have been held by the applicant for a period of five years, or that the licence holder inherited the premises, was given the premises by a relative or purchased the premises as a going concern. Additionally, on conversion the licence holder must, under subsection (4)(<i>c</i>), undertake not to dispose of the premises, transfer the licence or consent to its extinguishment for reward for a period of five years after the date of the first issue of the new full licence.</P>
    <P>Should circumstances arise whereby the holder of a newly converted licence experiences a difficulty, for example a financial difficulty, and would be subject to hardship if he or she had to comply with the conditions provided for in paragraph (<i>c</i>), the District Court may, by virtue of subsection (7), waive or modify compliance with those conditions.</P>
    <P>Section 17 ensures that an examination of the character of the person applying for an <i>ad interim</i> transfer of a licence under section 1 of the Licensing (Ireland) Act, 1855 is undertaken, and the court will refuse such an application unless it is established that the applicant is a fit person. At present, the <i>ad interim</i> transfer arrangement is subject to three criteria: (a) notice given of the application, (b) the reason for the transfer, and (c) that the applicant is not disqualified by law, and these, of course, will continue to apply. The addition of the requirement that the character of a person applying for an <i>ad interim</i> transfer of a licence will be examined will ensure that An <Col N="1658" /> Garda Síochána will be in a position to challenge applicants who are not of good character and who might otherwise get a foot in the business without proper scrutiny.</P>
    <P>Section 18 of the Bill simply ensures that in any proceedings under this part of the Bill, relating to licences, the premises may be described by reference to a map, for ease of reference.</P>
    <P>Section 19 extends the scope of the licences already available to race tracks, licensed under section 18 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1962 and racecourses licensed under section 65 of the Irish Horseracing Industry Act, 1994. Under the section, greyhound race tracks and racecourses will be permitted to supply intoxicating liquor at certain authorised events, such as trade fairs, exhibitions or concerts . The section provides an opportunity for these race tracks and racecourses to generate additional income on days when race meetings are not being held and, thereby, contribute to their viability. The types of function envisaged are ones which could not be held in ordinary licensed premises and the number of such events is being restricted to 15 per year.</P>
    <P>Significant increases in fines are provided for a range of offences. These are set out in the Schedule to the Bill. I draw Members' attention, in particular, to those for under-age offences and these have received the greatest increases. I am concerned to ensure that the increased opportunities available under the Bill for the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor do not lead to an increase in the incidence of under-age drinking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you. I am placing the highest onus on licence-holders to act in a responsible manner in this regard. Coupled with the tough new provisions regarding temporary closure of premises, I am confident that the law in relation to under-age persons is being suitably strengthened under this Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 22 introduces a relaxation of the law as it relates to the sale of alcohol in restaurants. It permits the holder of a restaurant certificate and wine on-licence to serve beer in conjunction with a meal. It will not be open to such a person to offer off-sales of beer or to have a bar on the premises. This section should assist restaurateurs to realise the economic potential of their establishments, provide a better service to customers and assist the attraction of such restaurants from a tourism perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 23 amends the 1988 Act in relation to special restaurant licences, namely a restaurant which is already permitted to serve a full range of alcoholic drinks. The 1988 Act requires a premises with a special restaurant licence to have a waiting area not exceeding 20% of the floor <Col N="1659" /> area of the dining area. I am removing this requirement, the purpose of which was to counter the possibility that such restaurants might become drinking emporiums in their own right. In reality, however, other restrictions such as the ban on a bar and the definition of the premises as a restaurant, where other business is ancillary, achieves this. The limitation on the size of the waiting area has given rise to design and architectural difficulties for many restaurants, particularly country houses, and these difficulties are being addressed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 23 also removes the requirement for Bord Fáilte certification as a requirement before the Circuit Court issues a certificate entitling a person to a special restaurant licence. The reality is that after some 12 years of operation, and, notwithstanding the unprecedented economic success enjoyed by the country, the number of premises having a special restaurant licence remains around the 200 mark. The representative body for restaurants, the Restaurants Association of Ireland, has pointed to unnecessary regulation and that the slow take-up of special restaurant licences is indicative of the fact that these regulations are overly restrictive. The Oireachtas joint sub-committee, in its review of the licensing laws, called for the relaxation of the standards and I am happy to oblige. It would, of course, remain open to my colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, to introduce a grading structure for restaurants, independent of the special restaurant licence, which would operate as a standards and-or marketing vehicle.</P>
    <P>I am also introducing some changes to the code governing registered clubs. Section 25 serves to clarify the position in relation to the holding of functions. It sets out what is and is not an acceptable use of a private club premises, while not disadvantaging the use of the club premises in relation to functions that are of benefit to the community, from a charitable or benevolent perspective. The section also removes any doubt as to the use of a private club premises by a member of the club for a private function, such as a member's retirement or wedding anniversary celebration.</P>
    <P>Section 26 deals with the circumstances in which intoxicating liquor can be supplied to non-club members. Under existing law, visitors may only be supplied with liquor on the invitation and in the company of a club member and the name of the visitor and address must be kept in a book, showing the date of each visit. I will not change that provision. The section, however, provides special arrangements for visiting teams, as opposed to individual visitor guests. It will be sufficient for a club official to enter the name of the visiting team and its number in the visitors book. While these visitors are on the club premises they can be supplied with liquor at the request and in the presence of an official of the club. This will <Col N="1660" /> allow a club to cater for visiting teams in a more flexible way.</P>
    <P>Present law restricts the advertising of social functions by clubs. The effect of current law is that it is unlawful for a group to advertise the holding of a meeting, for example, to form a residents' association, if the meeting is to be held on the premises of a registered club. Such an advertisement cannot even appear in a parish newsletter or community magazine. Section 27 permits such advertisements, but only in respect of functions at which intoxicating liquor will not be served.</P>
    <P>The law as it stands in section 47 of the 1988 Act is that it provides for a ban on the sale of alcohol by self-service methods. It is framed to apply only to off-licensed premises in which mixed trading is carried out, typically supermarkets, and was intended to combat under age drinking. Operation of the section is subject to the making of a commencement order but no such order has ever been made. That non-commencement has meant uncertainty for supermarket owners as to whether or not to organise their premises in anticipation of the making of such an order. Section 28 repeals section 47 of the 1988 Act. I am satisfied that the Bill, combined with the provisions of the 1988 Act, provides for strict penalties where there is a breach of the law relating to under age drinking. The most potent weapon is the removal of the &ldquo;reasonable belief&rdquo; defence and the accompanying provision that a premises or portion of a premises can be closed temporarily in the event of breach of the law on under age drinking. These new provisions offer better safeguards and more than compensate for the repeal of section 47. They will have the effect of targeting and penalising transgressors and not the entire supermarket sector, which can hardly be held collectively responsible for the actions of any rogue elements among its number.</P>
    <P>Section 29 repeals section 8 of the Intoxicating Liquor (General) Act, 1924, which requires that all sales of alcohol in an on-licence must be for &ldquo;ready cash&rdquo;. In the context of present day circumstances, including widespread use of credit cards, this prohibition is regarded as unenforceable.</P>
    <P>Section 31 relaxes the conditions under which a wine retailer's off-licence may be obtained, while section 32 removes an anachronistic provision which does not have a place in the modern code. Under section 2 of the Beer Licences Regulation (Ireland) Act, 1877, there can be a three month delay following acquisition of a property before a beer retailer's off-licence can be granted. In certain circumstances, for example, where the entire premises is licensed, this means that the outlet cannot begin to engage in even its non-licensed business for a period of three months after it is ready to open its doors to the public. The removal of this restriction will bring a beer retailer's off-licence in line with the spirit retailer's off-licence and a publican's on-licence, neither of which have a prior occupancy requirement. This will remove <Col N="1661" /> a certain amount of red tape, and facilitate people developing new outlets. Section 33 tightens the law where a company seeks a licence, renewal of a licence, or transfer of a licence.</P>
    <P>The task of reforming our licensing laws has not been an easy one. It has probably been one of the most difficult tasks in which I have been involved since taking office. However, it has also been one of the more rewarding. The Bill is ground-breaking in many respects, and I am convinced that it will provide a modern code of law for the coming decade at least. It removes those provisions which no longer represent what the market expects or demands, but it achieves a certain balance in that it reflects the thoughts and concerns of the general public on the law and how it should relate to the availability of alcohol. It is forward looking, its thrust is genuinely positive, and it is responsive to the expectations of the vast majority of our citizens. I commend the Bill to the House and thank the House for facilitating me with additional time to complete my contribution.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> I wish to share time with my colleague, Deputy McGahon.</P>
      <P>While there would seem to be a general welcome for the proposals to amend the liquor licensing laws there is considerable disappointment that the Minister did not avail of the opportunity to carry out a long overdue, wide-ranging reform of the entire liquor licensing area. While the measures in the Bill are generally welcome, it is nevertheless a Bill which merely tinkers around with closing and opening hours, dates, transfer of licences and peripheral areas relating to clubs and discos. There is also considerable disappointment that the Minister did not avail of the opportunity to consolidate and codify the mass of complicated legislation under which the sale of liquor has operated and continues to operate. While the broad thrust of what the Minister is doing is sensible in itself, by not availing of the occasion to consolidate in a consolidating Bill the huge accumulation of legislation while at the same time introducing another enactment, he is now adding yet another legislative layer on top of the 80 or so liquor related Acts which have found their way on to the Statute Book since 1833.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill represents another missed opportunity. We are legislating here for one of the most potent influences on human and social behaviour. To change the licensing laws in complete isolation without addressing the much wider agenda is not the way to proceed. One need look only at the broken homes and the wrecked marriages and partnerships destroyed by the excesses of alcohol, and the weekend casualty units in hospitals following road traffic accidents and street and domestic violence to realise that there is a huge problem in Irish society which is being totally ignored. One need look only at the increase in the number of teenage pregnancies and the huge increase in child pregnancies to see that alcohol abuse is a rampant threat, which is not being addressed in <Col N="1662" /> any coherent fashion and which is gnawing its way right into the fabric and heart of society. The mass human drunken exodus on to the streets of cities, towns and villages from disco-land in the early hours of Sunday mornings is a stark counterbalance to our image of the modern Ireland of the new millennium populated by a bright, responsible, motivated young generation. To change and liberalise the liquor licensing laws without complementing such relaxation with a thoughtful, planned and comprehensive policy to combat the use and abuse of alcohol is not a irresponsible way to proceed.</P>
    <P>Such a policy has been promised in the past. Before the rainbow Government left office the then Department of Health produced the national alcohol policy. It was an excellent document drafted after widespread consultation with lay people and professionals. The alcohol policy set down as its aim:</P>
    <P>To influence people's attitudes and habits so that for those who choose to drink, moderate drinking becomes personally and socially acceptable and favoured in the Irish culture.</P>
    <P>The policy document recommended a range of initiatives aimed at increasing knowledge of the health effects of alcohol, increasing awareness concerning sensible drinking guidelines, targeting certain groups, including youth, parents and students, and providing better treatment services for people afflicted with alcohol problems.</P>
    <P>It also dealt in some length with the glamorising and promotion of alcohol by way of advertising. Instead of the policy being used as a blueprint to address the alcohol epidemic, however, the report has been shelved and totally ignored. There has not been a public education programme worthy of the name. Nothing has been done to promote the document's sensible drinking guidelines. The national alcohol policy naively hoped that the drinks industry would confine advertising to the provision of factual information about the price, availability and mode of manufacture of alcohol. Instead of the positive and constructive targeting of youth as recommended in the policy, the very opposite has happened with the youth being systematically targeted by the alcohol industry with slick, sophisticated and stylish talk and cinema messages linking alcohol with sex, success and the good life. Alcohol treatment services are virtually non-existent except for those who are fortunate enough to have private health insurance cover. Certainly let us change our drinking hours but let us do so in conjunction with a sustained, effective and professional national campaign to promote sensible drinking habits. Let us mount a national advertising campaign to tell the truth about alcohol and the tremendous toll its abuse can have on family life. Let us spell out in clear terms the devastating effects of cirrhosis, pancreatitis, brain damage and alcohol related cancers. In this country we are in the early stages of compensation claims against tobacco companies by smoking damaged <Col N="1663" /> patients. If the American experience is anything to go by the tobacco companies can expect a long, testing and expensive run before our courts. I suspect that it is only a matter of time before we have a similar spate of claims for alcohol related medical conditions and illnesses.</P>
    <P>Apart from the health and social dimensions, imagine the savings that would accrue from reduced pressure on the health services, particularly on accident and emergency departments, the reductions in working days lost because of alcohol abuse and the reduced costs on the Justice, Equality and Law Reform Estimate because of reduced demand and pressure on the Garda Síochána, the courts and the prisons. We often delude ourselves by drawing comfort from statistics showing comparative data for alcohol consumption expressed per head of population. The real situation is masked by the fact that historically Ireland has had a high proportion of non-drinkers, thanks to the success of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association. If adjustments are made, the real situation becomes obvious and Ireland soars to the top of the European alcohol league. We have a major alcohol crisis in this country and there is no strategy at either local or national level to come to grips with it.</P>
    <P>Tribute has rightly been paid by the Minister to the sub-committee on legislation and security which, under the chairmanship of Deputy Flanagan, produced an excellent report entitled, A Review of Liquor Licensing. While the Minister quite rightly acknowledges that certain of the recommendations contained in the review document have been incorporated in the Bill, it is to be regretted that a substantial number of very worthwhile recommendations have not been accepted.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee examined the administration of liquor licensing. The administration is divided between the Circuit Court and the Revenue Commissioners with the District Court having a minor role. The sub-committee believed that it was an unnecessary complication to have two separate and distinct agencies involved in the granting of new licences and that it would simplify matters considerably, rather than a dual system of licensing and administration, to have a single licensing authority. Such a streamlining would seem to have obvious merit. The sub-committee recommended that a specialist licensing court should be established within the Circuit Court. It would have permanently assigned judges who would be conversant with the whole area of licensing and the wider range of issues which are peripheral to it. Unfortunately such an excellent and sensible proposal is not contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Certain public houses and discos conduct their business with a total indifference to and a total contempt for those residents living in their vicinity. Night after night, and particularly at weekends, residents must suffer blaring music, clients fighting on the premises, clients fighting after <Col N="1664" /> hours on the streets outside, roaring, shouting, associated vandalism and damage to property. For settled residents in areas where such badly run premises are situated, life at night is a nightmare. Young children and elderly people are unable to sleep until the crowd clears at four or five o'clock in the morning.</P>
    <P>Because liquor licenses are renewed in September each year without any court intervention provided that excise duty is produced and an audited statement and a tax clearance certificate furnished, this represents a real problem for those who wish to object to the renewal of the licence. Notice of objection must be made to the District Court and a court hearing must take place. A real dilemma arises however in that a District Court judge has only two options &ndash; to renew or refuse. There is no intermediate sanction even though the grounds for the objection are valid. There is, nonetheless, a quite understandable reluctance on the part of the court to refuse outright the licence application. The review group report sought to address this problem in a very practical way. It proposed that the licensing authority, the Circuit Court, should be empowered to order the temporary closure of premises for a proportionate number of hours, days, weeks or even months in cases in which objections are upheld.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to acknowledge the merit of this recommendation. However, he has only partly embraced this proposal in the Bill. Section 13 has provision for a temporary closure order but only in respect of the conviction for the sale of alcohol to an under-age person. I can see no valid reason such a temporary closure order should not be introduced for any premises which does not conduct its business in a responsible and orderly fashion. The expiry date for the annual renewal of licences is 30 September. This also creates a problem from the point of view of somebody wishing to lodge a valid objection against a licence renewal because of the manner in which the licensee is conducting his or her business. The sub-committee examined this problem and came up with a proposal that, &ldquo;on application at any time of the year to the Circuit Court based on an objection to the manner in which the premises is being run, the court should be free, if satisfied of the substance of the complaint, to order the temporary closure of the premises or to impose temporary restricted closing times in its operation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The proposal is quite obviously very commendable. It addresses a real problem whereby, at present, disturbances at Christmas cannot be dealt with in terms of penalising the publican or the licensee until nine months later at the September renewal. The sub-committee's proposal would have the immediate effect of curtailing the possibility of a licensee flouting his obligations by giving the plaintiff immediate access to the court to have his grievance and objection heard. Again, the Minister for some reason best known to himself, failed to have regard to the sub-committee's <Col N="1665" /> views. I will be proposing an amendment to this effect.</P>
    <P>One of the main features of the Bill is the proposed extension of hours of trading. The Minister proposes the abolition of the present winter and summer closing. I welcome this. What does not make sense, however, is the introduction of three different closing times all in the same week. On Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday the closing time is to be 11.30 p.m. and 30 minutes drinking-up time. On Thursday, Friday and Saturday the closing time is to be 12.30 a.m. with 30 minutes drinking-up time. I believe, and the vast majority of publicans believe that having three different closing times within a seven day period is ridiculous and will lead to wholesale confusion. The sub-committee report recommended a two-tier week. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday should have closing times of 11.30 p.m. plus 30 minutes with 12.30 a.m. plus 30 minutes for Thursday, Friday and Saturday.</P>
    <P>We should look at two options with regard to Sunday. We can accept the sub-committee's recommendations that Sunday, like the subsequent three days, should have an 11.30 p.m. closing plus the 30 minutes drinking-up time or we can regard Sunday as a continuation of the weekend, with the same closing times, in other words 12.30 a.m. plus 30 minutes. What does not stand up is the argument that because Monday is a working day, the extra time on Sunday night is going to lead to wholesale absenteeism from work the following day. If one is to believe such an argument then surely it would undermine the argument for 12.30 a.m. closing on Thursday night on the basis that it would interfere with Friday's work attendance. I will be introducing an amendment on Committee Stage to have Sunday's closing time conform to that of Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. This is the sub-committee's proposal of 11.30 p.m. plus 30 minutes drinking-up time.</P>
    <P>I fully support any measure, however draconian, to curb the scourge of under-age drinking. We really have to come to grips with a situation which is totally out of control. Each survey confirms a further reduction in the age threshold at which youngsters start drinking. Youngsters at 12, 13 and 14 years of age openly admit, when surveyed, that they drink. Young people are now drinking six years under the legal limit. We now have a children's drink problem. We now have teenagers graduating from post-primary schools indulge themselves to such an extent that their graduation functions have become such orgies of alcohol and misbehaviour that they have become no-go events for parents or for teachers who have taught them for the previous five years. What a sad reflection on modern young Ireland. Nothing is being done to come to terms with the alcohol crisis and to inject a more responsible culture into a bright, intelligent, but misguided, young generation.</P>
    <P>The Minister is introducing tough legislation, which I welcome, but it alone will not solve the <Col N="1666" /> problem. It is only a small part of the equation. It is difficult to understand the indifference of parents to the welfare of their children, the failure of parents to establish and to know exactly where their children are, with whom they are or what they are doing and the failure of parents to check if their 13, 14 or 15 year old has the smell of alcohol on his or her breath when they return home at night. There is a scandalous degree of parental negligence. If parents do not care, and there is a growing number who do not care, it is difficult to expect the law, the Garda or the schools to fill the vacuum.</P>
    <P>As regards this legislation, I understand the Minister's motivation in removing the defence of reasonable belief. This defence operates on the basis that the licensee can contend that he or she had reasonable grounds for believing that the young person was 18 years of age. We must be ruthless in dealing with publicans and licensees who knowingly and deliberately sell drink to under-age youngsters. If, however, the defence of reasonable belief is to be withdrawn, there must be a mandatory identity card scheme. The Minister invoked the relevant sections of the heretofore dormant 1988 Act to introduce an identity card scheme to be operated by the Garda. However, it has had little effect because it is not nationwide but is optional and voluntary. On Committee Stage I will introduce an amendment Bill so that every young person seeking to be served alcohol must produce, if requested, the official Garda issued identity card.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to get the balance right; we are talking about competing interests. We are talking about pubs, clubs, off-licences, supermarkets, discos, etc. It is, however, important to get the balance right and that is the reason the joint committee has agreed to accept submissions from the various interest groups which we will meet next week. It is not our intention to hold up the progress of the Bill. We accept the thrust of what the Minister said and want the Bill on the Statute Book before the summer. It is important, however, to listen to and canvas as wide a range of views as possible.</P>
    <P>One of the things that surprises me about legislation such as this &ndash; we are dealing with a drug which has a very potent influence on human and social behaviour &ndash; is that the Minister did not look at the kernel point of the joint committee's report. It set out to establish the principles underlying the liquor licensing system. It said it is not possible to devise or operate a rational system of governing the granting and distribution of liquor licences without having a clearly thought out strategy and a set of policy principles and objectives which the system is designed to serve. We should work back from those set of objectives and principles. In other words, it is incredible that in introducing a Bill, which the Minister says is ground breaking, far-reaching and designed to serve the industry well into this century presumably, we do not set down a clear mission state<Col N="1667" /> ment in regard to what the alcohol industry is about.</P>

        <b>:</b> One of the issues which has not been addressed is the fundamental question of why should there be so many different types of licences. Why, for example, should there not be one type of retail liquor licence and limitations on its use should be by way of attaching conditions thereto? Why should we have separate beer licences, wine licence and spirit licences? One would imagine there would be one generic licence to which one could attach a series of conditions.</P>
      <P>I support the broad thrust of the Bill but I regard it as a missed opportunity. It is terribly important when we are embarking on a new licensing regime that we take cognisance of the deeply human and social aspects of the Bill which have not been addressed. I accept one cannot include in the legislation many of the social principles but one would have thought it would have been a fairly significant part of the Minister's Second Stage speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon:</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak on this Bill against the backdrop of a definite threat of closure of two breweries in my town of Dundalk which have been there for generations and have provided gainful employment to hundreds of people. I ask the Minister to ensure every effort is made to maintain that employment in Dundalk or to minimise the reduction in the number employed. Having said that, I will not be deterred from my comments on what I regard as the greatest social ill in Irish society, that is, the tragic affinity Irish people have with alcohol. As Deputy Higgins said, we have some type of flawed gene in relation to alcohol which we do not seem to be able to handle compared to other continental countries. It accounts for at least 80% of the social ills.</P>
      <P>The refusal of this Assembly, including my party, to address this matter sticks in my craw. The tragedy drink has visited on every family, including my own, cannot be overstated. It is easier to hone in on the cigarette industry for health reasons. I am conscious I am talking in the presence of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy O'Hanlon, who knows a thing or two about the evils of cigarette smoking and drink. The sheer hypocrisy of all Governments in closing the door on cigarette smoking while at the same time promoting the indiscriminate sale of alcohol leaves me with a problem. Will this House ever recognise our national problem? I do not think so, and it illustrates the grip drink has on Irish society and the strength of the vintners lobby.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Higgins instanced cases of young girls who, in many cases, find themselves pregnant following visits to public houses and whose lives are destroyed. The rise in the number of unmarried <Col N="1668" /> mothers and the number who are in their tender years illustrates the scale of the problem, yet this House will still not address it.</P>
    <P>The number of watering holes in the country defies logic and the number has increased tenfold in recent years. There is not a football club which does not have a bar. If a camogie team wins an award, the medals are presented in the local watering hole, the pub. That is why so many young people are being seduced into drinking. I do not advocate prohibition; I would certainly not do so in the presence of a certain Senator who is watching the proceedings. However, the curtailment of the availability of drink to young people should be a priority. Surely it is more important to eliminate the glamorisation of drink in our society than extending the opening hours of public houses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins also illustrated the difficulties faced by elderly people living beside pubs and discos, which are modern hell holes. They fail to get a night's sleep and fear that perhaps their homes will be invaded or that they may be attacked by people under the influence of alcohol. Unfortunately, the promotion and sale of drink seems to be a Government objective, for which I am not blaming the Minister. It seems to have been an objective of all Governments.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how granting pubs extra opening hours will minimise the awful problem that drink creates for some people. For many people alcohol is a social relaxant and they can take it, but for those who fall by the wayside, it is a terrible scourge for them and for their families. How many families are left without food or are subjected to abuse arising from the consumption of alcohol? We are now encouraging that at a time when there is a public house at every crossroads. I feel sad that there is not a recognition of our national illness.</P>
    <P>Many of these proposals, while they are well meant by the Minister, who is a decent man, will not be implemented because we have so much legislation on the Statute Book dealing with drink, that we would need the Army as back-up to the Garda to ensure they were implemented. There are abuses countrywide and nobody would be short of a drink at any hour of the morning.</P>
    <P>The glamorisation of drink aimed and targeted at youth concerns me. Cigarette companies have to carry a health warning &ndash; why do drink companies not have to carry the same? Why is our youth subjected to what I describe as seductive and deceptive advertisements every ten minutes on television involving a good looking woman or man and spontaneous gaiety in the pub. It does not show the family perhaps cowering at home, waiting for a father or, in modern times, a mother to come home four sheets to the wind.</P>
    <P>The glamorisation of drink has to be attacked, if not by the Minister, then by a future Government. I look forward to the day when that happens. The lack of any control of advertising, particularly on television, is a definite weakness in that case. If we are sincere about looking after <Col N="1669" /> our youth, we must home in on advertising. While young people are watching television, they are asked every ten minutes whether they are going for a Harp, Carlsberg or Furstenburg or some other drink. That repetitive propaganda has an effect. They become seduced by it. They grow up believing that is the only way of life. That is an elementary matter for the Government to address if it is sincere about dealing with the problem of the number of young people being attracted to drink.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Pioneer movement, which has probably seen its best days because of the peer pressure among young people. I admire its continued defiance of the demon drink. I also commend the efforts of Dr. Loftus of Mayo, who tried to direct Government attention to a major national problem because he saw so many people mangled and mutilated by drunk drivers, another area to which we sometimes tend to turn a blind eye. He saw the damage done to people. He was in some cases described as an extremist, as I would be, but nevertheless, Dr. Loftus was on the right road. It is a great pity that more attention was not paid to his comments. He was a coroner as well as being a GP, and saw, at first hand, the problem that drink presents to society.</P>
    <P>There are areas which required more modern legislation but even if I am the only one in this House to do so, I had to describe the Minister's move to increase the hours available for drinking as an act of madness. I hope there will not be too many extra people or families who will point the finger at him and his Government for providing more stimulus to the biggest problem that faces this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate taking place at last. This Bill has been a long time in coming. The Minister has told us about the lengthy consultation process in which he engaged and the various discussions he had with many interested bodies. It is only right that should happen. In the context of that long consultation process, the Bill, while containing many admirable sections, is overall a disappointment. The Minister's approach in introducing this legislation is particularly disappointing, in that he has failed to put this legislation into any kind of social context. As the two previous speakers said, we have to closely examine the central role that alcohol now has in society and examine the reasons for that and the trends taking place regarding alcohol use and abuse. We must ensure that we formulate a policy and legislation which ensures we have a mature approach to alcohol and that we do not encourage our young people to have an over-reliance on alcohol, which many of them have currently. We should ensure that we develop mature attitudes to the use of what is, after all, a lethal, mood altering substance but which is also, as we all know, a very pleasant substance which should be a regular part of our lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The starting point should have been to examine the place of alcohol in our society. We should be <Col N="1670" /> cognisant of the serious damage in human, social and medical terms which it causes. We should especially examine the trends in alcohol use and abuse. If we took time to examine the trends in alcohol use and abuse, especially among young people, we would find them quite shocking. We have reached a point where the principal national pastime for many young people is to go out and get drunk at the weekend. This is an entirely new trend in recent years. We have always had a problem of young people abusing alcohol, where they would go out in a group and have a few cans or drink cider on the local green. We have gone beyond that in terms of shocking trends where many young people go out at the weekend and often midweek as well, with the intention of getting drunk. That poses questions for us as legislators, in terms of the urgent need for us to take a far more responsible attitude to the place of alcohol in our society. The Minister has not recognised this issue at all. I look forward to commenting further on the Bill when the debate is resumed next week.</P>

      <P>Local authorities are empowered by law to acquire land compulsorily for the purposes of carrying out any of their powers, duties and functions, including those in relation to housing. A local authority acquiring land compulsorily may be authorised to do so by means of a compulsory purchase order made by the authority and submitted to and confirmed by me, as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>The Planning and Development Bill, 1999, when enacted, will transfer my functions in relation to CPOs to An Bord Pleanála and bring about other changes designed to streamline the CPO process.</P>
      <P>My Department recently surveyed local authorities on the extent of zoned residential land currently serviced or likely to be serviced within the next six years. The survey results are being finalised and will be published shortly. An initial analysis of the results indicate that the position in regard to serviced land availability is positive. For example, Dublin local authorities estimate there is enough zoned serviced land available in the Dublin region to provide four years housing output, based on the 1999 record output levels. Based on the programme of water, sewerage, roads and other works going forward, this position is set to improve further. The position in the other major urban centres and their adjoining counties is also positive.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister of State saw the report today of a number of economists who estimate that house prices are likely to continue to rise by 60% over the next five years. Does he agree that a major factor in the continuing escalation of house prices is the availability and price of building land and the degree to which there is considerable speculation and profiteering in building land? Will he agree that the time has arrived to take building land into public ownership in the interest of house buyers, who are being priced out of the market, and in the interest of good planning? Will he put in place measures to enable local authorities to establish banks of building land not only for their house-building purposes but generally to release land at reasonable prices and to ensure houses are made available for people at affordable prices?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of questions tabled relate to various housing matters, including house prices. As I indicated, local authorities have the authority to acquire land and they have been encouraged by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and me to acquire land for the purpose of establishing a land bank to facilitate the building of houses in the private sector and the voluntary housing sector as well as the local authority sector. Those powers exist and a considerable amount of land has been acquired by local authorities during the past two years.</P>
      <P>The position on land banks in local authorities is positive and it is an ongoing issue. If local authorities use up their land banks, they must supplement them. Based on last year's output, the number of years' supply available to major local authorities does not give cause for alarm. I am anxious that the local authorities exercise their rights and if that requires their issuing a CPO, they have the authority to do so.</P>

      <P>It is envisaged that European Standard EN 1317 relating to road restraint systems will comprise of six parts, which are set out in details circulated in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>I have no responsibility in relation to the adoption of European standards, which is the responsibility of the National Standards Authority of Ireland. I understand from the NSAI that the normal procedure is for these standards to be adopted as Irish standards following their publication as European standards. Parts 1 and 2 have been published as Irish standards since November 1998. Part 3 was due to be published as a European standard on 24 May 2000, and will be adopted as an Irish standard by NSAI in accordance with the procedure outlined. Parts 4, 5 and 6 have not yet been published as European standards.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to the approval of appropriate road restraint systems for Irish roads is that road authorities are required, when installing crash barriers, to comply with the provisions outlined in a specification for road works, which has been used on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis pending publication of an updated specification for road works by the National Roads Authority.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is incumbent on the owner of an end-of-life vehicle, ELV, to dispose of it in a responsible manner, by transferring it to one of a number of facilities that have been permitted under the Waste Management (Permit) Regulations, 1998, to undertake the dismantling and recovery of such vehicles.</P>
      <P>Section 32(1) of the Waste Management Act, 1996, prohibits the holding, transport, recovery or disposal of waste in a manner that causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution. This general duty of care applies, <i>inter alia</i>, to the owner of an ELV. Section 71 of the 1996 Act specifically prohibits the abandonment of vehicles on any land and empowers local authorities to deal appropriately with abandoned cars. The enforcement and implementation of these provisions is a matter for individual local authorities.</P>
      <P>My Department has initiated discussions with the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, SIMI, with a view to the development by the industry of a producer responsibility initiative in relation to ELVs. It is intended that such an initiative would, in particular, take account of a draft EU Parliament and Council directive on end-of-life vehicles. This draft directive incorporates a number of significant proposals, including measures aimed at preventing waste from vehicles, increasing the recovery of ELVs and their components, ensuring that relevant economic operators establish collection systems for all ELVs and ensuring that vehicles are dismantled and recovered in a manner which does not cause environmental pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Initial proposals for an ELV management system for Ireland were submitted by SIMI in December 1999, and were circulated for consultation to various Departments and State agencies and a number of representative associations and other bodies. On foot of the various submissions received my Department will shortly seek further discussions with SIMI and other concerned parties to progress the development of a cohesive and practicable industry-led scheme. It would be my objective to secure agreement on an accept<Col N="1676" /> able vehicle recovery scheme not later than autumn of this year.</P>

      <P>It has come to my attention that since the national car test was introduced the number of abandoned vehicles littered around the countryside has increased, yet the Minster has said he will not finalise proposals with the Society of the Irish Motor Industry until the autumn. The Minister knew this test was about to be introduced and that it would have the effect of increasing the number of cars classified as useless. A reply to a question I tabled to the Minister informed me that since the test was introduced 4,504 cars had failed as at 18 April. Where are those cars? Are they littered around the countryside? What are people to do with them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are not the cars I worry about but rather those that do not turn up for the test which is a considerably larger number. There is an obligation on the owners of these cars to dispose of them in a responsible manner. Local authorities have an obligation under the Waste Management Act, 1996, to take action in relation to the enforcement and implementation of these provisions. As well as those obligations we are trying to put in place a producer-led scheme, similar to the REPAK scheme for repackaging waste. The obligation will not be taken away from the individual to dispose of his or her car in a responsible manner. The new producer-led scheme will be more effective than the Waste Management Act in relation to individuals and local authorities.</P>

      <P>While I accept there are obligations, they are not strong enough and are not working. As the Minister has acknowledged the number of abandoned cars has increased visibly. What will happen between now and the autumn prior to the new initiative being put in place? Driving through the countryside I see those cars rotting away. There appears to be no interest on the part of the local authorities to tackle the problem. Will the Minister intervene in some way? Given the criticisms of litter in the countryside and criticisms in many quarters of this being a dirty nation, it is unacceptable and should be dealt with.</P>

In deference to what the Deputy has said I will avail of the opportunity over the next few weeks when meeting managers to emphasise the need to take action in this area. As the Deputy has rightly said this is becoming a more visible pollution problem and one that needs to be tackled.</P>

      <P>It is expected from the announcements to date that the report will deal with issues such as security of tenure, rents and the relationship between landlords and tenants. It is reasonable to expect that it will give rise to new legislation.

      <P>As I am sure the Deputy realises, I cannot pre-empt the recommendations which might be made in the report. I have asked the commission to do a very important job. Its terms of reference are to look at the issues of improving security of tenure, maintaining a fair and reasonable balance between the rights and obligations of landlords and existing and future tenants, increasing investment in the supply of residential accommodation for renting, including the removal of any identified constraints to the development of the sector. These are difficult issues to resolve. The commission is doing a tremendous amount of good work. It has an extensive work programme in respect of which it has had 15 full meetings. A further three meetings are scheduled before it expects to be in a position to finalise its report. There have been 14 meetings of various subgroups. The commission held a seminar on a number of the issues in Sep<Col N="1678" /> tember. It is best to wait until we see what its recommendations are. As the Deputy is aware, there are officials on the commission who keep me informed as to how it is progressing. If a consensus is not achieved it will have to decide on the format of the report.</P>

      <P>My Department has not received an application from Dublin Corporation for funds for the installation of heating in the remainder of its housing stock. The Deputy will be aware that the management, maintenance and improvement of its existing dwellings, including the installation of heating, is the responsibility of Dublin Corporation to be met from its own resources. However the installation of central heating systems by Dublin Corporation forms an integral part of various remedial and refurbishment programmes which are being funded under my Department's remedial works programme. These include the <Col N="1680" /> redevelopment of a number of seriously run-down flat complexes mostly in the city centre area involving a mix of some new buildings, refurbishment and, where appropriate, demolition and replacement; the special area regeneration programme which consists of a once-off programme of upgrading of high density older flat complexes at various locations around the city &ndash; I understand that under this programme Dublin Corporation will install central heating in over 9,000 of its dwellings; the remedial works scheme which is providing capital funding to carry out major structural works to a number of flat complexes.</P>

A large number of such schemes have already been approved and are under way. Others are in the pipeline. While I have received no proposal along the lines suggested by the Deputy, I will be happy to look at any proposal submitted. Ordinary maintenance is the responsibility of local authorities to be met from their own resources. If there are major works involved they may qualify under the schemes mentioned.

        <b>:</b> Does the Minister still share my concern about the small number of isolated cottages with iron-frame windows which are occupied by old people, invariably in failing health, and in respect of which heating grants were made available? Is there any possibility that an effort will be made to provide grants for county councils to install central heating in such houses? All the new houses being built by the county council are top class and have central heating.

      <P>I have made substantial improvements to the special housing aid for the elderly scheme under which heating can be provided. I have provided substantially increased funding for the scheme. I am not entirely happy, however, with the pace of work under the scheme. Health boards and local authorities do not seem to have cranked up their ability to do the work in line with the increased funding provided. The problem is not one of funding or the right to put in heating under these schemes. The difficulty I am facing is the slowness in dealing with applications. They have to be prioritised but people were not getting high priority and they seemed to have a poor prospect of having their work done. I am conscious that this scheme is particularly aimed at helping elderly people. I am examining this issue to see if it should continue under the present system or whether we should restructure the scheme so it operates more effectively and speedily when works are examined and identified.</P>

      <P>Common standards for driving tests are already laid down by the provisions of Directive 91/439/EEC which have been transposed into Irish legislation and practice. No significant proposals exist at present to add to or amend these standards in relation to on-going assessment of drivers or otherwise.</P>
      <P>However, action is being taken nationally to improve the training and/or testing of new drivers through the following measures: registration and/or testing of driver instructors, development of a theory test to complement the practical driving test, tenders for the provision of this service have been invited, sponsorship by my Department of a programme by the Irish Motorcycle Action Group to provide initial practical training for motor cyclists and a review by consultants of the organisation and delivery of driving test services.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of the Minister of State's reply referred to driving test arrangements. Can he explain the wide difference in the levels of people who pass the test at different driving test centres? Completely different standards appear to apply in <Col N="1682" /> different centres. What is the Minister of State doing to ensure consistency in the proportion of people who pass the driving test so that passing will not depend on the centre at which one takes the test?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>No proposals have been received from the EU requiring the on-going assessment of drivers. As regards differences highlighted in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, the driving test service has been in crisis for the past year or two. This initially arose from the large increase in the number of applications but was mainly due to the inability to respond to the increase by way of appointing additional testers. I have explained to the House that industrial relations difficulties have contributed to this inability.</P>
      <P>Because of the pressure on existing staff to deal with the large number of applications, the refresher courses which should have been held were not held because that would exacerbate the waiting list problem. Departmental officials estimate the number of new test applications this year could reach 170,000.</P>

This examination will produce recommendations on how we can ensure an efficient service which operates equal standards and deals with applications within a period of at least ten weeks. I would like the period to be shorter than ten weeks but we have to reach the ten week target first. It is outrageous that some people have been waiting for 40 or 50 weeks.

      <P>Members of Kerry County Council deem it to be no more important than No. 33 on the list and I have to take that into account. However, by way of being helpful to the Deputy, Kerry County Council will receive grants for small sewerage schemes. The estimated cost <Col N="1684" /> of the Finuge scheme is about £400,000 so it is over the limit of £250,000. However, the council could submit the proposal under the small sewerage schemes programme and operate the scheme over a two or three year period. If the lack of a scheme is holding up proposals for housing or other developments, the council might consider submitting the proposal under the rural towns and villages initiative or the serviced land initiative. As it stands it will not qualify for the investment programme because of its number.</P>

Accordingly, time must be allowed for the necessary consultation to take place.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister of State put a deadline on the date for receipt of nominations? The establishment of the housing forum was one of the central issues in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness under which the social partners will have a role in housing policy. However, we have been told that the first meeting of the housing forum will not take place until six months after the programme was negotiated. The Department has direct responsibility for the establishment of the housing forum. There appears to be great delay and tardiness on this matter which is critical to social policy.</P>

It has not been possible to advance the scheme in the absence of a reliable water supply which will depend on completion of phase two of the north east Kerry water conservation project. Proposals to advance phase two are under consideration in my Department and will be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The Listowel scheme is first on the list of projects submitted by Kerry County Council in response to my Department's request for local authorities to undertake fresh assessments of the need for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of these assessments. The priority lists will be taken into account in the framing of water services investment for this and future years under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006.

Is the Minister aware that the area the scheme will supply is now the largest populated part of the country without a mains water supply? Approximately 600 families are without a mains water supply in this area and it is most unfair that they continue to be neglected given the fact that the matter has been with the Department since 1991. I realise it was with the Department during our period in Government, but these people should be taken out of their misery.

      <P>In my electoral area there is a population of about 12,000 outside the towns and villages and there is very little piped water supply for them. There is a dispute about whether phase one of the conservation project had achieved sufficient progress to allow stage four of the Listowel scheme to proceed. The technical advice available to the Department is that phase one has not been sufficient. The north-east Kerry rural water scheme is dependent on stage four of the Listowel water scheme as a source of water and stage four is dependent on phase two of the north-east Kerry water conservation project. That will reduce leakage to ensure a sufficient supply of water. It is almost there at this stage and the fact that Kerry County Council has put this as number one on the list will ensure an early decision on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the taking in charge of estates is essentially a matter for each individual local authority and my Department does not systematically collect such information. However, the Department carried out an informal survey of local authorities in 1998 on the extent of the problems with unfinished estates and the factors contributing to such problems. Replies received from 77 of the 88 planning authorities revealed that 706 housing estates were then regarded as unfinished and which, with a further 542 finished estates, had not been taken in charge. The sizes of the estates in question vary from two to 200 houses. My Department does not have available any estimate of the potential cost to local authorities of taking all these estates in charge.</P>
      <P>New requirements on planning authorities concerning the taking in charge of unfinished estates are provided in the Planning and Development Bill, 1999 which provides that where an estate has been completed to the satisfaction of a local authority, the authority must take it in charge when the developer or a majority of the residents request the authority to do so. Where an estate is unfinished, the period of seven years for taking enforcement action has expired and a majority of the residents so request, the planning authority will also be obliged to take the estate in charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised the Minister does not have an estimate of what it will cost local authorities to take estates in charge given that a new obligation is being put on local authorities to take estates in charge which have not been finished. Based on the figures he outlined that more than 1,200 housing estates are unfinished and have not been taken in charge, is it fair to conclude that approximately 12,000 families are living in houses in unfinished estates or glorified building sites which have not been taken in charge by local authorities? How long does he expect it will take the local authorities under the new legislation to take these estates in charge and ensure that the householders and residents have proper roads and public spaces and that the general environment of their neighbourhood is brought up to an acceptable standard? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no idea what number of people might be affected by this issue. The sizes of the estates vary from two to 200 houses. From a cost point of view, some estates are unfinished because of minor works while others require major work. All estates are not like construction sites. Local authorities have been aware of this provision for at least 12 to 15 months and if they do not pursue builders who have not finished estates &ndash; in some cases they cannot do so because many of them date back to the 1970s and 1980s &ndash; they will suffer financially because they must provide for taking them in charge. My advice to local authorities is to take action now, if they can, to ensure they are not left with a big bill by builders or developers. Some 706 estates are unfinished and 500 have not been taken in charge, probably because no one asked the local authorities to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister carried out a survey and wrote to all the local authorities. My experience in trying to deal with this issue in my area is that the problems are relatively minor. It is often a matter of addressing the urgency of the situation from the residents' point of view. Local authority officials are trying to come to terms with unfinished estates while dealing with new ones. This is a matter of staffing and of the local authorities focusing on the issue and getting the job done. It involves paperwork for many people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a straightforward matter in many cases. As regards the 500 plus estates I mentioned, it is a matter for the local authority to take the necessary action by way of resolution or otherwise to take over the estates. The complaints about and the reasons for the unfinished estates vary considerably. There can be minor problems, such as the paving of roads and footpaths and insufficient lighting, and major problems, such as those with sewerage and water. In some cases it is a matter of finishing the green area in an estate.</P>
      <P>The Planning and Development Bill, 1999, has provisions to take into account in future the record of builders if they do not finish an estate. Most of the estates date from the 1970s and 1980s. There are few unfinished estates from the 1990s when the local authorities got their act together and phased in building and increased bonding, which have proved effective. Some problems are persistent, however, and date back to the 1970s and 1980s.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the recent comments made by a person (details supplied) that the price of housing is now the main financial obstacle to Irish emigrants returning to the State to work; the steps he intends to take to deal with this situation, in view of the implications for the economy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I and the Government fully recognise the difficulties created due to the level of house prices for all those seeking housing. House prices have increased due to increased demand which is fuelled by many factors, including strong economic growth, increasing employment, higher disposable incomes and low interest rates and by demographic factors, such as growth in the key household population age groups. The reversal of emigration trends in the mid 1990s to significant immigration has contributed to demand for housing and to house price increases in recent years.</P>
      <P>Recent statistics show a welcome moderating trend in house price increases. My Department's house price statistics for the December quarter of 1999 show annual price increases for new and second hand houses on a national basis of 16% and 18%, respectively. This is well below the peaks of 26% and 37% recorded the year before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government introduced a range of measures in &ldquo;Action on House Prices&rdquo; in April 1998 and in &ldquo;Action on the Housing Market&rdquo; in March 1999 to accelerate the supply of housing, secure house price stabilisation, address affordability issues and bring balance to the market. A comprehensive range of initiatives has been implemented to increase supply. These measures are having a positive effect, as shown by the record housing output of more than 46,500 last year, which is up almost 10% on the year before.</P>
      <P>Principal measures to increase supply include the serviced land initiative, the fast-tracking of key infrastructural projects to increase the supply of land for housing and measures to ensure better utilisation of housing land, such as the preparation of strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin residential area and promotion of higher densities at appropriate locations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>A co-ordinating housing supply unit has also been established in my Department to drive and effectively deliver on the range of measures to maximise housing output and remove bottlenecks where demand is greatest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>Measures introduced to improve affordability for lower income and first time purchasers include withdrawal of investor incentives, <Col N="1695" /> reduced stamp duty rates, improvements in the local authority shared ownership scheme and the introduction of the affordable housing scheme. The Planning and Development Bill, 1999, which is on Committee Stage, provides for the preparation of housing strategies by all local authorities and requires them to ensure that sufficient land is zoned for residential development.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that house price increases are moderating. The measures implemented to date have been effective and will assist intending house purchasers, including returning Irish emigrants, in house purchase transactions. I have commissioned Peter Bacon and Associates, who are economic consultants, to undertake a general review of housing market developments, including developments in demand, supply and prices. I expect the report will be completed shortly and, along with an appropriate policy response it will be considered by the Government and soon as possible thereafter.</P>

Does he realise that house prices have almost doubled during his period in office, normal salary levels are no longer capable of enabling someone to buy or rent accommodation, as a representative of one of the banks stated recently, the measures he outlined have not worked and the Government's policies on housing are a failure and will have to be radically changed?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I and my colleagues in Government fully recognise the issues involved in the housing area and are deeply concerned about the escalation in house prices. We have put in place a wide range of measures to try to increase supply. The extent of these measures, which are beginning to take effect, is unprecedented in the history of social and private house building. The level of demand, which arises as a result of the tremendous growth in the economy, is enormous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1696" /> The statistics from which I quoted, and in respect of which I referred to &ldquo;a moderation&rdquo;, represent the sum of the results received from all lending agencies. House prices are continuing to increase, but not at the level which obtained previously. The unpublished figures show that there was a reduction in some areas earlier in the year. However, I do not place any great faith in that.</P>
    <P>We are anxious to stabilise house prices and we are continuing to devote our energies, resources and time to monitoring the situation and bringing forward initiatives which will further contribute to moderating the position. In that context, an increase in supply is required.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State not understand that when he uses the word &ldquo;moderating&rdquo; in connection with house prices, he runs the risk of seriously misleading people? House prices are increasing every year and are cumulatively adding to the burden imposed on anyone who wants to purchase a house. The level of house prices is making it almost impossible for people to buy their own homes.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to market developments. Is it the case that he appointed consultants last March to review market developments? Is it also the case that he appointed, without inviting competitive tenders, the same consultant who prepared the two previous reports? Does he not think it unwise to ask the proposer of the original measures to provide an assessment of their success? The Minister of State is living in cloud cuckooland if he believes that this procedure will be successful.</P>

      <P>My Department is finalising discussions with the five pilot local authorities, Galway Corporation, Galway, Leitrim and Wexford County Councils and Naas UDC, about the nature and extent of the warden service they might agree to provide on a pilot basis. I have asked the pilot local authorities to put in place local task forces to develop detailed implementation proposals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The position will vary from local authority to local authority. The pilot authorities were selected on the basis that the scheme would be spread across large and smaller urban areas. Wardens in different areas will have different responsibilities and their duties may include: patrolling public amenities, local authority estates and tourist attractions; providing directions and advice to tourists; patrolling sheltered workshops and school vicinities; assisting neighbourhood watch schemes; maintaining contact with the elderly and vulnerable; reporting criminal matters to the Garda; reporting breaches of technical regulations to local authorities; carrying out traffic congestion duties and dealing with stationary traffic offences; dog control enforcement; air pollution enforcement; litter enforcement; waste management; and enforcement of the Roads Acts.</P>
      <P>Wardens will carry out such duties which are appropriate to the local authority area in which they are employed. Task forces are currently drawing up terms of reference in each of the local authority areas.

      <P>They will be in a position to enforce any regulations and by-laws that are the responsibility of the local authorities, including those relating to litter, road traffic management, beaches, parks, amenities etc. In addition, they will be able to report breaches of regulations relating to planning matters but such breaches may require more technical evaluation by planning officers. Basically, the wardens will be the eyes and ears of local authorities in the community and they will serve as a point of contact between the authorities and citizens.</P>
      <P>I emphasise the role they will play in liaising with elderly people in isolated areas. A particular need for this was identified in County Leitrim and it will form part of the wardens' duties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the publication of the Progress Report on the Implementation of the Recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities which was published by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 13 December 1999.</P>
      <P>It is my pleasure to ask the House to note the publication of the progress report on the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, entitled Towards Equal Citizenship. The Government is committed to improving services for people with disabilities and to putting in place a framework for disability equality. The Government's record of progress on the disability equality agenda since taking office is proof of the seriousness with which we view this commitment.</P>
      <P>The report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities was published in November 1996. The recommendations of the commission are broad-ranging and comprehensive touching, as they do, on almost every aspect of social, economic and cultural life. There are 402 recommendations in all covering such areas as access to the built environment, both building and streetscape, income, transport and accessible housing. The Government is working to give concrete expression to the recommendations and has moved on a range of key fronts in achieving this objective.</P>
      <P>The progress report is a benchmarking document which establishes how far we have progressed in implementing the recommendations of the commission and points the way to what yet needs to be done. The progress report shows that many of the commission's recommendations have been implemented in full or in part. The positions stated in the report are not immutable and, since publication late last year, the work of implementing the report's recommendations has continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Substantial progress has been made in such areas as the mainstreaming of services for people with disabilities, enacting the equal status legislation, improving the accessibility of urban buses and putting the cost of disability payment on the national agenda. These and other developments are illustrative of the steady pace of change and the improvement that is taking place and has <Col N="1700" /> been taking place since the progress report was published.</P>
    <P>I would like to briefly outline a few of the areas of progress, some of which come within the aegis of my own ministerial responsibility and others whose achievement and development are attributable to the work of Government colleagues. Within my own area of responsibility the establishment of a national disability authority and the mainstreaming of services for people with disabilities are two of the key recommendations of the report. The establishment group for the national disability authority, set up in November 1997, reported to Government in June 1998. Preparations to implement the new administrative and infrastructural arrangements recommended by the group for the national disability authority and mainstreaming of services are now at an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>Mainstreaming means that mainstream service providers will now provide services to people with disabilities on the same basis and from the same premises as they provide them to the rest of the population. The policy underlines a maturing in the approach of society in relation to service provision for people who happen to have a disability. The changes being introduced will result in a shift of responsibility for disability services from the National Rehabilitation Board and the Department of Health and Children, to the Departments and agencies with general responsibility for each of the services involved. For example, vocational training and employment services for people with disabilities will be provided by FÁS, under the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. A new mainstream information and support service, Comhairle, will operate under the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, and the audiology, psychology and non-vocational services operated by the National Rehabilitation Board will be provided by the relevant Government agencies such as the health boards and the new National Educational Psychology Service.</P>
    <P>The national disability authority will be established on a statutory basis in conjunction with these mainstreaming arrangements. The authority will be responsible for research and development of standards and codes of practice for disability services and for monitoring and assisting service providers to ensure implementation of standards and codes of practice. It will also act as a coherent focus for disability-related policy and practice and will play a key role in advising and reporting to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in regard to disability issues.</P>
    <P>Legislative reform in the areas of anti-discrimination and positive action measures were key building blocks in the commission's approach. In each of the three years since the Government took office, an item of equality legislation dealing with the rights of people with disabilities has been <Col N="1701" /> passed. In 1998, the Employment Equality Act was enacted to prohibit discrimination in the workplace on nine specified grounds, one of which is disability.</P>
    <P>In 1999 the National Disability Authority Act was enacted to underpin the new mainstream framework for the provision of services to people with disabilities. This year, these Acts were complemented by the Equal Status Act, 2000, which will come into effect in the coming months and will outlaw discrimination in relation to the provision of goods, facilities and services. Legislation establishing fundamental rights in the area of education has also been enacted.</P>
    <P>I am sure Members will agree that at a time when our economy is faced with possible labour shortages, ensuring equality of opportunity for people with disabilities in firms puts a valuable resource at employers' disposal. The legislation not only outlaws discrimination against people with disabilities in employment but also in their role as consumers. Businesses have not yet fully awoken to the fact that by discriminating against or ignoring people with disabilities, they are only injuring themselves. People with disabilities are not isolated individuals but have families, friends and colleagues. Making premises accessible to people with disabilities makes economic sense and enhances their use for a range of customers. In this regard, I welcome the announcement in this morning's newspapers that Aer Rianta now requires all airlines, service providers and other agencies conducting business at Aer Rianta airports to do all that is reasonable to accommodate the needs of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>As soon as the arrangements for mainstreaming are in place, I intend to begin detailed work on a disabilities Bill. The measures to be covered in the Bill will be proactive in nature and will advance and underpin the participation of people with disabilities in society. In identifying the scope of the proposed Bill, I will be strongly influenced by the recommendations made by the commission with regard to its contents. Such recommendations include access to public bodies, use of telecommunications services, use of transport and participation in the administration of justice, to name but a few.</P>
    <P>Turning to achievements outside my direct sphere of influence, there have been significant developments with regard to transport policy. My colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, has adopted a policy to ensure that from this year onwards, all public transport purchases under the national development plan will be fully accessible. As a result, new transport stock now purchased is required to be disability-friendly. New and major refurbishment projects at all bus and rail stations will be required to take account of the needs of mobility impaired customers. The National Development Plan 2000-2006 includes significant provisions in relation to the accessi<Col N="1702" /> bility of public transport, including the establishment of a public transport accessibility committee to advise the Minister for Public Enterprise in regard to the accessibility of public transport for people with disabilities, including people with mobility impairments. I also understand that this year alone, Dublin Bus is purchasing 205 accessible buses and a further 20 accessible or &ldquo;bendy&rdquo; buses.</P>
    <P>Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the Departments of Health and Children, Social, Community and Family Affairs and Finance have committed themselves to examining the feasibility of introducing a cost of disability payment. Work is under way to establish a working group which will be chaired by an official from the Department of Health and Children at Assistant Secretary level. The cost of disability payment is of vital interest to people with disabilities and a key recommendation of the commission. I am sure the work of this working group will be closely monitored by all concerned.</P>
    <P>The role of my Department with regard to the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities is twofold, namely to provide guidance and advice and to monitor and encourage implementation. The progress report was presented on the date of its publication to a monitoring committee chaired by an official of my Department and comprising representatives of the interests involved and of key Departments. The committee has met four times over the past six months and I expect that it will be in a position to report progress to me over the summer.</P>
    <P>Members will see that much has been done in the area of disability equality. I am committed to following up this good work with new actions. More remains to be done and I will continue to work to achieve full equality for all our citizens. I commend the report to the House and look forward to hearing Deputies' views on these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that, having requested this debate some weeks ago, I now have the opportunity to comment on the progress report on the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. This original and very comprehensive report and its recommendations have been the subject of many Private Members' debates over the lifetime of this Government.</P>
      <P>It is particularly appropriate that this debate is being held on the occasion of the tenth anniversary celebrations of the Forum for People with Disabilities. On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I extend congratulations to the forum on the occasion of its anniversary in recognition of the sterling work it and the other non-statutory disability groups and organisations do on behalf of their members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I recognise that progress has been made, progress in realising equal citizenship rights for <Col N="1703" /> people with disabilities has been painfully slow. The fact that the progress report details 81 of the commission's recommendations which have been, or are in the process of being, implemented is to be welcomed but four-fifths or 324 of the recommendations remain unfulfilled.</P>
    <P>The main area of progress is in legislation. The Employment Equality Act, 1998, the Equal Status Act, 2000, the National Disability Authority Act,1999, and the Comhairle Act, 2000, are significant legislative milestones on the long road to equal rights and equal citizenship for people with disabilities. In terms of legislation, the infrastructure is almost complete.</P>
    <P>There is, however, one glaring omission from the legislative list. There is unfortunately no disabilities Bill, not even the heads of a Bill, on the horizon. The Bill is not expected to be published before 2001 &ndash; that could well mean it is another year and seven months away &ndash; yet the recommendation has been before the Government since 1996. While the equality legislation already enacted outlaws discrimination on a number of grounds, including that of disability, a comprehensive disabilities Bill &ndash; a core recommendation of the original report &ndash; setting out rights and giving a means of redress for those denied their rights, would be a major plus for people with disabilities and their families, advocates and carers. For those who have waited so long for so many improvements, a vague timetable of 2001 may seem like they will be waiting forever.</P>
    <P>Any hopes of a shorter timeframe are dashed when one reads the progress report. How could they have delayed so long? How could the Government have procrastinated when the progress report states that there may be the need for a constitutional amendment and a referendum in tandem with any such Bill? If the Department has yet to consider a constitutional amendment, consider the wording for such an amendment and put the words of a proposed amendment to the people in a referendum before a disabilities Bill is produced, then the Government's estimate of 2001 is just a fantasy. That is regrettable. It would appear that while some rights of people with a disability are underpinned by legislation, they must wait, yet again, for an exclusive Bill which sets out and guarantees their rights. That is a shame.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Government to focus on this important legislative provision and to seek in particular to speed up their deliberations in this regard. The Government has identified a disabilities Bill as one of its key priorities. The Government is already three years in office yet, according to its timetable, people with disabilities must wait at least seven months, if not almost a year and seven months, before even an outline of a Bill is available. This Bill is long overdue. The <Col N="1704" /> Government must live up to its commitments and produce this vital legislation at the earliest possible date. As I said this morning on the Order of Business, the Government has shown a willingness to produce legislation quickly to right what it perceives as wrongs done to people whom it favours. It is time those people who were wronged through no fault of their own had their rights vindicated by this Bill. One way in which rights of people with disabilities can be guaranteed is through the enactment of a disabilities Bill.</P>
    <P>Within three months of the receipt of the Franklin D. Roosevelt award, which honoured Ireland for &ldquo;reaching further and doing more&rdquo; for people with disabilities, people with disabilities were, for the third time in 18 months, protesting at the gates of Leinster House because a vital transport service had to be discontinued for lack of funds at a time of economic boom. The contrast between the international recognition of legislative achievement and the reality of the day to day struggle for even the most basic rights of people with disabilities brings into sharp focus the inherent contradiction highlighted in some areas of the report. The United Nations citation for the international award states that Ireland is &ldquo;setting the pace&rdquo; and that &ldquo;Ireland has reached farther and done more&rdquo; to advance the cause of people with disabilities. Unfortunately, according to the progress report, the Minister for Finance is not willing to reach far enough.</P>
    <P>In the ten minutes allowed to me, it is not possible to comment on every area covered by this comprehensive report. One issue which I consistently highlighted in the House as a barrier to participation by people with disabilities is the lack of accessible transport. Today on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; Ms Dina Doddrell from Poppintree stated that the lack of transport accessible to wheelchair users is the single biggest barrier to participation in employment and training and in society generally. She said her bus pass is worse than useless because there are no accessible buses for her to use. The same is true of people who live in rural areas. Mr. Dónal Tolan pointed out that only 15 of the 950 buses in the Dublin Bus fleet are actually wheelchair accessible. The theory is that we have reached farther and done more; sadly the practice is far different.</P>
    <P>Last year, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, congratulated herself on obtaining Exchequer funding for 150 new buses for Dublin, none of which is wheelchair accessible. In May 1999, the Vantastic transport service providers, on whom 300 people with disabilities depend for access to their employment, education and recreation, told the Taoiseach that they had capital and revenue funding problems. In June, the Government, which advocates a policy of empowerment through responsive services, let Vantastic close. Shamed into action by a demon<Col N="1705" /> stration at the gate of Leinster House and by the Opposition outrage, the Government had a whip around and came up with some loose change to allow the service to continue. The reality is that people with disabilities do not have a public bus transport system.</P>
    <P>A submission quoted in the &ldquo;Strategy for Equality&rdquo; report reads:</P>
    <P>People with disabilities do not want to be pitied, nor do they want their disabilities to be dismissed as of little importance. All that is required is a little respect and basic needs and rights. Surely that is not too much to ask?</P>
    <P>This is the essence of the problem facing people with disabilities, and of the slow progress in addressing the reality. They want basic needs and rights, like the right to leave home and travel on a bus without having to be carried on or crawl on, and not legislation, international disability awards or high flown rhetoric.</P>
    <P>The same problem applies to taxis. It is evident that while the specially issued taxi licences were contingent on the provision of wheelchair accessible taxis, there is no similar onus on the individual taxi owners or on taxi companies to actually use their accessible taxis to transport wheelchair users. Recent evidence would suggest that the owners and drivers of wheelchair accessible taxis would rather use their vehicles for transporting people with lots of luggage or those encumbered by sets of golf clubs than for those wheelchair bound people for whose needs their taxis were supposed to cater. This is a scandal which must not be allowed to continue. The licensing authority for taxis is a publicly accountable body. The taxi drivers' and licence owners' lobby has a powerful voice in this city. Let us hope that progress will be made and that wheelchair accessible taxis will be available for hire to those who really need them.</P>
    <P>How much more empowered or mobile are people, even in a brand new wheelchair, if they cannot get on a bus? How much more independent are they if they cannot get a taxi? How mainstreamed are they if they cannot travel down main streets or if they cannot access public buildings?</P>
    <P>A recent report on the service for people with disabling neurological conditions identified the lack of accessible public transport as the major barrier to the mobility impaired. The report states that this lack causes social isolation and reduces access to employment and education. Without this basic service is it any wonder that 70% of people with disabilities are unemployed?</P>
    <P>The same report also highlighted shortfalls in service provision regarding aids and appliances. It mentioned long waiting times for equipment and the provision of inappropriate equipment. In these days of economic boom, this is a scandal. We as a nation are now better off than ever yet <Col N="1706" /> many citizens are denied the right to a hoist to help them to get out of bed. They are denied basic rights like personal assistants to assist with dressing and feeding. Their families and carers cope alone without comprehensive, responsive and accessible support from the State.</P>
    <P>A recent conference on the rights of carers, organised by Care Alliance, heard harrowing evidence by carers who feel abandoned by the State, unrecognised, ignored, unsupported and unvalued. They spoke of the disappointment of having their precious annual two weeks respite care cancelled at the last moment because another case, deemed more urgent, had to take their place. They spoke of the inequities and anomalies of the carer's allowance system. One carer summed up her feelings by saying, &ldquo;The State puts barriers in our way and in the way of the people we care for. They should concentrate, not on what we have but on what we need&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Basic rights and needs must be addressed for people with disabilities, for their families, for those who care for them and for those who are their advocates. There is no doubt that good intentions exist. On every page of the progress report there are good intentions and fine words. Good intentions and fine words are there in plenty. Action is lacking. Transport, aids and appliances, residential care, day care, respite care and employment are lacking.</P>
    <P>The Government needs a timely reminder that the services for people with disabilities are lagging behind the legislation. For people with disabilities to achieve and exercise their economic and political rights, we need to speed up the progress. The Government must provide the resources as well as the legislation.</P>
    <P>Let us hope that any future progress report will contain more practical action as well as aspirations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that this debate has been scheduled for late on Thursday afternoon and that so little time has been allowed for it. The report is large and contains a number of recommendations. We cannot deal with them all in the time available.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the progress made. The Minister of State has outlined various aspects of this progress in legislation and funding. The most important demand of people with disabilities is that we move from the medical model to a rights based approach to the needs of people with disabilities. The representatives of people with disabilities speak of the need to establish fundamental rights so that people with disabilities can participate in work, travel and housing as the rest of us do. This rights based approach is the most important demand of people with disabilities at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier today I attended the celebration of ten years of the Forum of People with Disabilities. The chairperson of that organisation spoke of this <Col N="1707" /> issue. NAMHI, the Centre for Independent Living, which held a conference recently in Clontarf, Parents Alliance and many other organisations are calling for a disabilities Act and for a constitutional amendment to give fundamental rights to people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>While we can acknowledge progress in many areas, until we address this issue we will not have given people with disabilities the power to run their own lives.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed by parts of the report and particularly by the reaction of the Department of Finance regarding the legal right to services. It was recommended that there be an assessment of needs which would be followed through so that a person with a disability would receive what he or she needed from the various Government Departments. The Department of Finance rejected the legal right to services. The commission recommended that every disabled person get a comprehensive statement of needs which would entitle him or her to services without having to argue his or her case again and again with numerous Departments, health boards, agencies and sub-sections of such bodies. The Department of Finance said it, &ldquo;cannot accept these recommendations which imply the underpinning by law of access to and provision of services for people with disabilities as a right. This right, if given a statutory basis, would be prohibitively expensive for the Exchequer and could lead to requests from other persons seeking access to health and other services without regard to the eventual cost of providing these services&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children objected to the provision of a cost of disability payment. The Department said it would be costly and difficult to administer and that other groups, such as Travellers, the homeless, unemployed, old people and children could seek equality of treatment. These reactions were extremely disappointing because they reject much of the core of the commission's recommendations.</P>
    <P>The report is very much the response of a Government Department and is not in the same spirit as the report of the commission. The commission mainly consisted of people with disabilities, their carers and families and was chaired by Mr. Justice Flood. A number of sub-committees dealt with housing, transport, employment and so on. The approach was hugely participative and many of the people who took part have been very disappointed by the dry departmental response which concentrated on what could not be done. This is led by the thinking of the Department of Finance. I ask the Minister of State to challenge this thinking in the coming months and years. We must move to a rights based approach so that people do not have to chase from one Department to another as they grow older and their needs change but automatically receive the ser<Col N="1708" /> vices they require. Recommendation 217 is that 1% of the educational budget should be set aside for people with disabilities and should follow their needs rather than their category. There should not be a set amount for each category of disability but the need of each child should be assessed and met.</P>
    <P>I note that a monitoring committee has been established but it consists mainly of officials of Government Departments. It is chaired by someone from the Minister of State's Department and other Departments are represented. I know that others have been appointed to the committee and I hope the Minister of State can tell us the balance of its membership. Even the chapters at the end of each section which are headed &ldquo;The Way Forward&rdquo;, are written from the point of view of Government Departments rather than in the spirit of the original report.</P>
    <P>People with disabilities are frustrated by not being able to go to work because of lack of transport, for example. Nevertheless, I acknowledge the progress that has been made with regard to transport. Seven out of every ten disabled people are still unemployed while we are forced to recruit workers throughout the world. Many people with disabilities cannot work because they do not have a personal assistant, access to transport or suitable facilities in their place of work. The vast majority of people with disabilities want to work.</P>
    <P>Until a rights based and individual approach is taken, these problems will persist. We have examples in the United States and in some European countries of how the legislative way forward can work. Next year will be too far away for a disabilities Act. The commission's recommendation that Article 41.1 of the Constitution be amended is side-stepped by the report. There will be a need to amend the Constitution. We must deal with the nominal cost issue now rather than spend a great deal of time examining the issue and then find that a disabilities Bill must be rushed through in order to meet a time limit. These are the quality rather than the quantity issues in terms of what people with various disabilities have said to me, as spokesperson, and to the Minister and have debated within their groups. They want to move forward in terms of the Constitution and legislation. Until we do that, we will make slow progress which will not be as effective as it should be.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the report, the focus must not be on doing things for people with disabilities but on debating with them and giving them the power through legislation and the constitutional change proposed so that they will have rights and will be able to take part in society in the same way as everybody else. Until we reach that point, we will make slow progress which will not address the core issue of equality for people with disabilities in our society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Ahearn, has covered the main points but I would like to raise a number of points on disability with the Minister of State. There is not enough flexibility in the application of various facilities and schemes for people with disabilities. It is all very well having a scheme which allows people taking up employment to get transport tickets, but if a person cannot access transport, it is not worth the paper it is written on. The Minister might as well keep the £60 transport ticket in her pocket. More flexibility must be given to those judging people's transport needs. What is the point giving a transport ticket to a girl in a wheelchair in Skerries who has to get to Swords but who cannot get onto a bus? The bus ticket is no use. We should give people the £100 per month so that they can get a taxi to work.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise announced the privatisation of Bus Átha Cliath and various elements of CIE. Will the Minister ensure that Department, in introducing such a scheme, will not disenfranchise those who, under social welfare, have free transport tickets? People who are partially sighted, for example, and have full transport tickets on which there are no limits, unlike those placed on older people, are worried they will lose those facilities when the bus service is privatised. The Minister's Department should ensure they do not lose out.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the 3% employment quota in the public service. I do not believe there is enough flexibility in this regard. Recently I wrote about a young man who is disabled and who applied to a local authority. He received the standard letter that there would be a competition and that he could apply and go on a list. If a local authority has reached the 3% quota, there should be flexibility in terms of employing people who may not be able to match exactly what is needed because of their disability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputies for their contributions on the progress report, Towards Equal Citizenship, and for the opportunity to respond to the questions raised. As I stated previously, this report benchmarks the progress made in implementing the original commission's report, A Strategy for Equality. The original commission's report made 402 recommendations covering many areas, including access, income, transport and education, to name but a few, many of which have been implemented in whole or in part. This is to be commended and I assure the House that I and my Department will continue to seek the implementation of the commission's report. Some 20% of the commission's recommendations have been implemented in full and progress has been made in relation to a further 66% of the recommendations at the time of publication. I stress that <Col N="1710" /> work has been ongoing since December in a number of the areas to which I referred earlier.</P>
      <P>The report made a number of recommendations in regard to my Department. I assure the House that preparations are in train for the establishment of the National Disability Authority this year under the National Disability Authority Act, 1999. In addition, the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the Equal Status Act, 2000, have been enacted and the Equality Authority and the Office of Equality Investigations have been established to ensure that equality in employment and the supply of goods and services is accorded to all our people. In addition, the Human Rights Commission Bill, 1999, is currently before the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ahearn and Deputy O'Sullivan asked about the proposed disabilities Bill. The proposals for the disabilities Bill, which are contained in the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, have, in part, been enacted. Many of these proposals focused on equal opportunities legislation and a means of redress in the case of discrimination. These have become law through the Employment Equality Act and the equal status legislation. The disabilities Bill will go further and it will be a targeted measure to enhance the participation of people's disabilities.</P>
      <P>Given the strong legislative performance of my ministry in relation to people with disabilities, equality and human rights generally, I am confident in defence of that record and about my commitment to publish a disabilities Bill next year. I stress that a disabilities Bill has been published in each of the years of this Administration, commencing with the Employment Equality Act, the National Disability Authority Act and the Equal Status Act.</P>
      <P>Issues in regard to transport were raised by Deputies Owen, Ahearn and O'Sullivan. These are important issues because, as the Deputies rightly pointed out, they are the key difference for people with disabilities. Deputy Ahearn mentioned Vantastic and the financial difficulties it had last year. I assure the Deputy that my Department is providing a grant of £350,000 to Vantastic which was announced in the budget. Deputy Ahearn referred to the money that was obtained this time last year to take Vantastic out of its immediate difficulties. In addition to that, a formal grant of £350,000 was announced in the budget. An instalment of that grant has already been paid to Vantastic this year. Once its application has been finalised, payments will be made on a phased basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other transport issues raised are important. What Deputy Owen said about taxis was interesting, as was what Deputy Ahearn said. The Deputy was concerned that, although more wheelchair accessible taxis had become available, people with disabilities were still unable to get <Col N="1711" /> one. She raised some important points in regard to the licensing authority being a public body and the fact that hundreds of wheelchair accessible taxi licences had been issued. All of us share that concern. There are more wheelchair accessible taxis on the streets of Dublin and people with disabilities should be able to access them. I will ask officials in my Department to bring to the attention of the relevant authorities and the Department of the Environment and Local Government the points raised in regard to taxis because they are important. We are doing all we can to put taxis on the streets but they are not available to people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>In terms of buses, accessible transport and the difficulties faced by people with disabilities when travelling by public transport, I am aware of the difficulties in this regard. It is the policy of the Minister for Public Enterprise that all transport operators, in particular State transport companies, should provide the highest possible degree of accessibility within overall resources available to them. Procedures in relation to investment decisions and the purchase of trains and buses are to take account of that policy. From this year onwards, new and major refurbishment projects at bus and rail stations, together with any purchases of trains or buses, will take account of the needs of mobility impaired customers.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006, includes significant provisions relating to the accessibility of public transport, including the establishment of a public transport accessibility committee to advise the Minister for Public Enterprise on the accessibility of public transport for mobility impaired customers and other customers with disabilities. It includes a special provision of £10 million to part finance accessibility improvements to existing public transport infrastructure and facilities. In addition, all railway rolling stock and buses as well as new and upgraded rail and bus stations financed under the plan will be accessible to mobility impaired customers and to other customers with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahearn referred to the 150 buses that have often been talked about and that last year, only 15 accessible buses were in use. I reassure all Deputies, regarding this year's purchase by Dublin Bus, that all those technical difficulties of the past have been overcome. I understand that Dublin Bus currently has approximately 30 low floor, accessible buses but that a further 225 low floor, accessible buses are on order for delivery this year. While Bus Éireann currently has 44 low floor accessible buses, there are a further 66 on order for this year. I hope, this is a sign that, at last, we have cracked that nut.</P>
    <P>Deputy Owen raised important points regarding the 3% quota of people with disabilities in the public service and the Civil Service. It is important we keep our own house in order in <Col N="1712" /> terms of the employment of people with disabilities and that we provide all the necessary opportunities. The Civil Service figures are somewhat better than the public service ones although they have slipped behind to a degree as well. The 3% quota in the Civil Service was reached for the first time on October 1993. It was maintained in 1994 and 1995 and has not been maintained since 1996. It currently stands at 2.7%. One explanation for that, which is reasonable to a point, is that there was a tighter definition of disability back in 1996. If a person came in with a certificate detailing back trouble, he or she would not be counted in the disability sector. Genuine cases of people with disabilities are now being recorded in the figures. The figure as of 1 April 1999, which seems to be the most recent figure here, indicates that there were 743 people with disabilities employed in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The public service, to which Deputy Owen referred, which includes the local authorities, health boards and so on, is just as concerned about this matter. My Department has set up a committee which is doing considerable work chasing up those figures. We have increased the figures from 0.6% of local authority staff in 1990 to a figure of 1.7% at the end of 1998, which is the most recent figure available. I hope the 1999 figures will be better because much is happening to address this in the local authorities and we want to ensure that it does happen.</P>
    <P>I hope I have covered all the main points. The main point made by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan was that people with disabilities should be included in discussions and should be empowered to be involved in decisions affecting them. That is happening in the health boards with the co-ordinating committees. I want to be sure that people with disabilities countrywide realise the importance of those co-ordinating committees because, as more money comes down from the Department of Health and Children to the health boards, people with disabilities at the co-ordinating committees in the local health boards are determining the priorities. It is important that people with disabilities take part in all that is happening at that level.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan asked about the members of the monitoring committee on this report. I will send the names to her. The monitoring committee was set up under the former Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Mervyn Taylor, and it has not been changed. Many people with disabilities are involved in it and there will be a new monitoring role for the new National Disability Authority which is being established. Meanwhile, the existing monitoring committee has met four times in six months, is active and will report to me in the summer.</P>
    <P>We could talk all day about disability but I thank all the Deputies who contributed, whose commitment to equality for all citizens is evident <Col N="1713" /> from what they have said. It is of the utmost importance that society be made inclusive and we are all assured that we want to make a difference to the lives of people with disabilities. I give a commitment that I will continue to work to achieve a truly inclusive society for all our citizens, including those with a disability.</P>

      <P>It is mystifying to try to understand what is happening in the Tánaiste's Department and why the Tánaiste has been unable to clarify the future of the jobs initiative scheme for a number of months now. This is a good scheme which was targeted especially at the over-35s who had been out of work for five years or longer and as such was focused on a group, many of whom thought they might never re-enter the work force Despite variations in its operation, it is agreed that it has been a good scheme. These people are guaranteed three years employment at the rate for the job and it offers a way back into the work force that many of these people thought might never be open to them again.</P>
      <P>I was associated with the creation of the scheme and for that reason, I have taken a particular interest in it. There are many people in my constituency who have started work again as a result of this scheme. The first phase of those people were due to conclude their three years last December. In the interim, the Tánaiste had commissioned, as all Ministers now do, Deloitte &amp; Touche or whatever group of consultants of which one can think, to assess the scheme. I would have thought that if one met a few people in The Square in Tallaght or talked to the ushers on the way into the Department, they could tell one the merits of the scheme from sitting on the barstool in the pub. However, that is the way we do things now. She received the Deloitte &amp; Touche report and while she was contemplating what to do about it, she reasonably extended the life of the first batch of workers for six months from last December. This means that almost 600 people are due to have their employment terminated next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have raised this on several occasions, by way of an Adjournment matter, parliamentary ques<Col N="1714" /> tion and so on. I warned that this situation would arise and that there was a need to think out clearly the future of this programme and we still have not managed to achieve any clarity on it. I raised it with the Tánaiste on the Order of Business this morning. I welcomed what she said but on studying it, it does not amount to any more than an aspiration to be positive and to prevent these people becoming unemployed. That does not answer many of the questions posed by the people concerned. I hope that if the Minister of State, Deputy Ryan, is standing in for the Tánaiste, he will be in a position to clarify these matters now.</P>
    <P>During Question Time on the Thursday before Easter, the Tánaiste told me that her decision would be available and the report would be available to me that weekend, which was Easter weekend. I have tried to obtain it every second day since then. I still have not received it. I understand there was a meeting with the social partners, the real Government, on Monday and that the Minister has gone back to the drawing board to rewrite some sections of the report. There are people involved who want to know what will happen to them. Some of their employment situations are quite complex. They do not want to stay forever on the jobs initiative scheme. Ideally, they would like to progress. That is not feasible in all cases for a variety of reasons and they want to know what the future holds for them. With regard to the question of roll-over, the Department made certain promises, but we do not know who is eligible for roll-over. We do not know who, if anybody, is eligible for redundancy. Different sponsors take different positions. One sponsor said such workers are entitled to redundancy and the workers taken on by that sponsor were told that on recruitment, while another employer, who has taken legal advice on the matter, said such workers are not eligible for redundancy. We do not know what supports will be in place to facilitate the progression of those workers into mainstream employment. We do not know if the sponsors will continue to operate the programme if the current participants must be let go and new entrants recruited.</P>
    <P>We do not know what happens various social economy projects, which are complex and do meaningful work that involves the acquisition of necessary skills. Now that people have only acquired the necessary skills and these projects are up and running on a fragile enough basis, it is suggested that those participating in the programmes must make way for a new batch of entrants. A number of detailed questions need to be answered. I hope the Minister of State can indicate the future of this programme and when we will know the detailed answer to the myriad of questions that arise so that the people concerned can be reassured.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. E. Ryan):</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that this is a good scheme and it has worked well in many areas around the country. The job initiative programme is a three year work experience programme for persons who have been unemployed for five years or longer. The programme is available for persons over 35 years of age who are in receipt of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit or one parent family payment.</P>
      <P>An evaluation of the programme was carried out by Deloitte &amp; Touche consultants in 1999, who made a number of key recommendations on its future operation. These recommendations have been discussed in detail with the social partners, relevant Departments and other interest groups in recent months. The discussions have been useful and they are reflected in the guidelines I approved today for issue to FÁS on the future operation of the programme.</P>
      <P>The guidelines contain a number of elements. There will be greater emphasis in future on progression to open labour market employment in the context of its operating as an active labour market programme. That has been the case to date. Greater importance will be attached to providing work experience, training and core personal skills development and enhanced assistance from the employment services for job seeking in the open labour market. It is intended that workers on the programme will receive personal guidance from a specific employment service case officer with the task of enhancing and progressing an individual's employment prospects. Workers on the programme will be given an opportunity to build on their experience on the programme, avoiding a situation whereby they simply return to the live register.</P>
      <P>The new procedures will ensure that the 600 workers currently in phase one places, who are due to complete the programme this year, are presented with a range of further training employment options by FÁS and the local employment service. This will include, where appropriate, workers remaining on the programme for a further limited period to be decided locally by FÁS in consultation with the sponsors. The programme will continue to be targeted at those most removed from the labour market, those over 35 years of age who are unemployed for five years or more. It will be continued for the foreseeable future at its current level of 2,875 places, subject to close monitoring and review in the context of changing labour market conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Access to the programme will be extended to qualified adults and adult dependants of persons meeting the criteria for the jobs initiative, as recommended in the report of the P2000 working group on women's access to labour market opportunities. The programme will be attuned more closely to the needs of the local economy <Col N="1716" /> with greater emphasis, through more active involvement of the LES, on employment being regularly appraised of the skills and competence of JI workers.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above measures, it is intended that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will prepare proposals as soon as possible based on a report that will examine, identify and develop appropriate supports to meet the needs of those people who, because of age, literacy and barriers, are unlikely to succeed in getting and keeping a job in the open labour market. This report will be considered by the Standing Committee on the Labour Market under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>A number of the consultants' recommendations on increasing the effectiveness of the jobs initiative as an active labour market programme have been implemented. Correct entitlement to secondary benefits are extended to JI participants at the beginning of April 2000. Entitlement to the back to work allowance was implemented in December 1999.</P>
    <P>These guidelines are of immediate interest to those workers who are due to finish at the end of June. Under the terms I approved for the future operation of the jobs initiative, workers on phase one places will be presented with a further range of options which will ensure that they do not simply drift back to the live register and further social exclusion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory:</NameTxt>
      <P>By raising this matter on the Adjournment, I hope the Minister may put a stay of execution on the decision to transfer a teacher from St. Joseph's co-education national school on East Wall Road. A total of 234 children were enrolled in this school in September 1999. That figure was six short of the number needed to retain the current staff numbers for the coming school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to put forward the case on behalf of the school staff, children and parents. The school takes its pupils from the adjoining East Wall area, a traditional working class docklands community. The school is in the area covered by the docklands master plan, which puts special emphasis on <Col N="1717" /> the need to educate and train local young people to enable them to benefit from the new commercial developments coming into this rejuvenation area. They emphasise that additional educational and training resources must be made available to local children to achieve this objective. The school is also located in the north inner city drugs task force area, which prioritises additional educational resources as a way out of the drugs crisis. The Cabinet Sub-committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs chaired by the Taoiseach has that objective as a policy priority.</P>
    <P>The school is already designated as disadvantaged but unfortunately, unlike its neighbouring national schools, it does not have the Breaking the Cycle scheme or the Early Start programme. It had the same needs as the other local north inner city schools, but regrettably it does not have the equivalent resources. This results in current class sizes varying from 20 children up to 35 children. If the school loses a teacher in September, I am told it will require the amalgamation of two third classes which would result in there being 37 children in that class.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances I ask the Minister what chance would the teaching staff have to develop the abilities of the children in this disadvantaged community? At present the two infant classes have 22 children and 28 children, respectively. The neighbouring schools that have the Breaking the Cycle scheme have a maximum of 15 children per class.</P>
    <P>St. Joseph's national school, its teachers, children and parents feel strongly that they are being discriminated against. They requested that they be permitted to retain their third year infant programme and the Department replied that this is against departmental policy. The school then requested the introduction of the Breaking the Cycle scheme and the Early Start programme and were told to wait for a review date. The school asked permission to retain its current staff numbers until that review date and the Department said the school must lose a teacher in September.</P>
    <P>All the messages received by the school from the Department of Education and Science have been negative. I acknowledge that only yesterday long overdue special needs teaching hours were awarded to the school after I raised the matter in a parliamentary question this week. I hope the Minister will follow that by agreeing to put on hold the transfer of the teacher until a decision is made on the possible inclusion of the school in, what I hope will be, an expanded breaking the cycle scheme.</P>
    <P>What is the point in having local drugs task forces drawing up plans for strategies to help young people to counter the drugs threat in these areas, a national drugs strategy team and a Cabinet sub-committee chaired by the Taoiseach examining new ways to direct resources into these areas if the most critical resource available to assist the <Col N="1718" /> children is being undermined in this way? I hope the Minister will see common sense and allow the existing staff in the school to continue their work by lifting the threat on them.</P>
    <P>Next Tuesday there will be a general meeting of parents in the school to discuss this matter. I invite the Minister to attend to explain the decision to them. I see no good reason the school should lose a teacher. I see all the detrimental effects it will have on the children of this inner city docklands community if their school is undermined in this way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Ms Hanafin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gregory for raising this matter on the Adjournment and for his invitation to the Minister which I shall convey to him. The Deputy has already raised this issue in a parliamentary question.</P>
      <P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils enrolled on 30 September of the previous year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule. The staffing schedule is determined for a particular year following discussions with the managerial authorities and the INTO.</P>
      <P>The enrolment of the school on 30 September 1999 was 234 pupils which warrants a staffing for the 2000-01 school year of a principal and eight mainstream class teachers. The school also has the services of a remedial teacher, disadvantaged concessionary teacher and a shared home school liaison teacher who, I am sure, has helped to tackle some of the problems raised by Deputy Gregory.</P>
      <P>The number of pupils required to retain the ninth mainstream class teacher for the 2000-01 school year is 240. Accordingly, the school will lose the ninth mainstream class teacher at the end of the current school year. If the board of management of the school consider that the enrolment of the school for September 2000 will increase substantially it may apply for a post under the &ldquo;developing school&rdquo; criteria.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;developing school&rdquo; criteria for the 2000-01 school year are outlined in circular letter 11/2000, a copy of which will be forwarded to the board of management of the school in the near future. To satisfy the criteria as outlined in the circular letter the enrolment of East Wall primary school on 30 September 2000 would have to increase by at least 25 pupils over the number enrolled on 30 September 1999. Accordingly the school would require an enrolment of at least 259 pupils on 30 September 2000 to gain the post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position regarding the maximum class size guidelines was outlined in circular 21/99 which issued to the board of management of the school last year. The maximum class size guidelines for the 2000-01 school year are determined by reference to the enrolment on 30 September 1999. In <Col N="1719" /> determining the maximum class size guideline for disadvantaged schools account is taken of the disadvantaged concessionary post. Accordingly the school is not in breach of the maximum class size guidelines.</P>
    <P>If the board of management of the school is confident that the overall enrolment of the school on 30 September 3000 will be in excess of 259 pupils it should apply to the primary payments branch of the Department of Education and Science for the allocation of a teaching post under the &ldquo;developing school&rdquo; status.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan:</NameTxt>
      <P>For the constituencies of Dublin North-East and Dublin North-Central it is fortunate that the Minister for Education and Science is a local TD. There are 15 or 20 major educational issues which should be addressed urgently, two of which I shall focus on this evening.</P>
      <P>St. Paul's special school, Beaumont, which is under the trusteeship of the Sisters of Mercy, has about 48 severely emotionally disturbed and autistic children ranging in age from four to 18 years. The nine teachers in six classrooms depend heavily on additional care and special needs assistants. A couple of years ago the Minister's predecessor said St. Paul's special school was entitled to four extra classroom assistants but, four years later, nothing has happened. This year it was informed there would be a full school inspection by the Department to assess the need for these care assistants. With only a few weeks to go to the end of the school year the Department has failed to carry out the assessment or to give any encouragement to the school.</P>
      <P>The pupils in St. Paul's special school who have acute needs are among the most vulnerable in the primary and secondary system. Often teachers find classroom control and management of the children extremely difficult. That is the reason a care assistant is essential for each classroom.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State may be aware that the State of New Jersey has an intensive, highly staffed, programme for autistic children which seems to be successful, yet in Ireland, in St. Paul's special school, we have not even started a decent programme in terms of staff support.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise briefly also the secretarial and caretaking needs of Scoil Áine girls national school, Raheny. This is a famous, widely admired, outstanding girls national school, which has been responsible for the education of generations of Raheny women. Currently it has 345 pupils and 14 full-time staff. It has had a major struggle in its search for equipment and extra classrooms in recent years given that the pupil-teacher ratio in eight of the 11 classes is over 30 and two exceed that number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1720" /> Ten years ago the school had a full-time caretaker. When he retired he was not replaced. Often the principal says that if one wants to help it would be better to give her a new tool box. Effectively, she has to do the caretaking duties because she has not been given the necessary resources. The school shares its secretary with nearby St. Eithne's senior girls school in Edenmore. The parents in that area and my constituents are irate that neither of these issues had been tackled by the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, and so far have not been tackled by our local Minister, Deputy Woods.</P>
    <P>The Minister will say that recently he allocated £9 million for a special fund for caretaking and secretarial facilities. In the case of caretaking this will increase the grant to Scoil Áine from £5,200 to £6,800 which is well below the minimum wage. In a recent letter, the Minister, Deputy Woods, wrote, &ldquo;My Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they [that is, the caretakers and secretaries] are employed.&rdquo;  That is a cop out because it is he who can decide the overall grant. The school has also problems in relation to cleaning and the psychological service which started only recently. The principal and staff consider that this outstanding girls primary school does not have the basic resources to enable it to do its job properly.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, for attending to reply on behalf of her colleague. I urge the Minister, Deputy Woods, to ensure the vulnerable pupils of St. Paul's special school, Beaumont, and the burgeoning school and hard-pressed staff of Scoil Áine, Raheny, will be looked after in the coming months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Broughan for raising the two issues. The Department of Education and Science is committed to ensuring that all schools catering for children with special needs, including St. Paul's special school, receive the level of child care assistant support they require to enable them to cater for the children in their care. St. Paul's special school caters for children who suffer from emotional disturbance and requires the support of child care assistants to help teaching staff in catering for the special needs of the children concerned.</P>
      <P>St. Paul's special school has the services of two child care assistant posts allocated by the Department of Education and Science. However, the Department is currently reviewing the child care requirements of all schools catering for children with special needs, including St. Paul's special school. The objective of this exercise is to ensure that all such schools have access to the level of child care support recommended by the special education review committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is expected that this review, which will be completed shortly, will result in the allocation of additional child care posts to St. Paul's special <Col N="1721" /> school. The Department will be in touch with the authorities at St. Paul's in relation to this matter in the near future.</P>
    <P>In relation to Scoil Áine girls' national school, Raheny, Dublin 5, the Minister for Education and Science recently met with the principal of this school to discuss a range of issues, including its secretarial and caretaking needs. The school is involved in a secretarial sharing arrangement with another primary school under the 1978 scheme for the employment of secretaries in primary schools.</P>
    <P>In addition to the shared secretary arrangement the school had up to this year been receiving an additional <i>per capita </i>grant of £15 per pupil towards the cost of caretaking services under the PESP scheme introduced in 1992. In view of the increased allocation made available this year, effective from January, all primary schools with 100 or more pupils became eligible for a grant towards caretaking services under the scheme. In addition the Minister increased the rate of grant by 33% to £20 per pupil. This has resulted in the grant for caretaking services to the school increasing from £5,190 in 1999 to £6,880 this year. The Department has issued the increased grant to the school. With effect from September 2000 all primary schools will become eligible for grant assistance under the scheme. The Department has recently issued a circular to all schools on the matter.</P>
    <P>The allocation for grant assistance to schools in respect of caretaking and secretarial services increased from approximately £5.6 million in 1999 to £12.2 million this year. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that in framing proposals for the spending of the increased allocation it was necessary for the Department to examine means of ensuring all schools would receive assistance in respect of such services. The scheme the Department has put in place will mean that from next September all primary schools will for the first time be receiving grant assistance in respect of these services from the Department. In addition the increase of 33% in the rate of grant also means that schools which were receiving assistance have had their grant levels significantly increased.</P>
    <P>The school referred to by the Deputy has benefited from the enhanced scheme which has been put in place. The Minister is committed to seeking further improvements in the resources available to schools in respect of secretarial and caretaking services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness:</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the beginning of the year health care managers have been flagging for the Department of Health and Children and health boards the difficulties being experienced in recruiting anaesthetists and the shortage of manpower. Despite the complaints made very little has been done through the health boards to <Col N="1722" /> ensure the crisis will not bite deep into the services provided by them.</P>
      <P>The Irish Accident and Emergency Association wrote to the Medical Council in February to highlight the problems being experienced. The main problem seems to be that the Medical Council has introduced its own examination and will no longer recognise the PLAB examination in the United Kingdom which is of the same standard and which EU and Asian doctors are able to sit in their own countries, thereby reducing the cost involved. As a result there is a manpower shortage. Prior to this EU and Asian doctors travelled here<i> via </i>the United Kingdom. In view of the crisis that will confront health boards, will the Department and Medical Council recognise once more the equivalent UK qualification and consider reducing the cost involved in sitting the Irish examination to ensure the required qualified personnel are recruited? Will the Departments concerned look at the length of time a doctor can stay within the jurisdiction and extend it from five to seven years? This would be of great assistance.</P>
      <P>I understand that health boards have been notified by consultants in Mullingar, Portlaoise and my city of Kilkenny that there will be a drop of two in the number of staff at Wexford General Hospital, one in Cashel-Clonmel, two in Cork University Hospital, one in the Mercy Hospital, two in Limerick Regional Hospital, six in Tralee and three in Kilkenny. The drop of three in the number of staff in Kilkenny will result in a reduction of one-third in the number of elective general surgical procedures, in other words, the waiting lists will grow by one-third. One of the hospital's two theatres will close and there will be no epidural service after 6 p.m. Emergencies and the transfer of patients in the emergency system will be greatly affected. The casualty department in St. Luke's Hospital will close for one and a half months over a period of six months.</P>
      <P>These reductions will begin to bite into the health service at the end of June. If something is not done in the meantime the service will be rapidly confronted by a crisis, particularly in the South Eastern Health Board. Given that the problems being experienced have been flagged since the beginning of the year, will the Department review the situation and ensure that each health board will have the capacity to respond to the crisis? An audit might give a clearer indication as to the shortfall in the number of qualified personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to note the three requests I have made &ndash; that the cost of the Medical Council examination be reduced, that the PLAB examination in the United Kingdom be recognised once more and that the length of time qualified personnel can stay within the jurisdiction be extended from five to seven years. I understand that St. Luke's Hospital in Kilkenny will be the flashpoint. There is therefore no time <Col N="1723" /> to waste. We should be proactive and ask for a plan of action to allay the fears of the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. Health service employers and the Health Service Employers Agency are continuing to monitor the take-up of employment offers made to non-consultant hospital doctors for 1 July 2000. The situation is likely to remain fluid for a number of weeks as a non-consultant hospital doctor may have an offer of employment from more than one hospital. Hospitals are exploring all options in an effort to ensure essential posts are filled.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware of difficulties in recruiting junior doctors to the specialty of anaesthesia which is consultant driven and therefore less likely to be affected by a reduction in the number of junior doctors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the decision of the Medical Council to introduce an examination for non-EU nationals entering the health service the Medical Council is an autonomous statutory body established under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978. Its functions include registering all medical practitioners, fitness to practise and ensuring junior doctors working in the health service have received a very high standard of training and education. Its membership is made up largely of <Col N="1724" /> medical professionals. It works independently of the General Medical Council in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The Medical Council decided some years ago to introduce an examination for doctors outside the European Union seeking temporary registration in Ireland. Overseas doctors, EU and non-EU, account for about one-third of non-consultant hospital doctor posts. These doctors have played, and will continue to play, a very important role in providing a quality service in our hospitals. This assessment procedure was introduced by the Medical Council to ensure all medical trainees, EU and non-EU nationals, are of the highest standard, and at least as high as the standards set in our colleges. The Medical Manpower Forum is addressing the issue of medical staffing in hospitals. The forum will issue its first report shortly and its recommendations will address the issue in detail, and those raised by Deputy McGuinness.</P>
    <P>I have not seen any evidence to convince me there will be the shortage of junior doctors predicted, but in the event that some posts remain unfilled, hospitals will be asked to ensure that essential and critical services are not affected. I am confident that with full co-operation from all concerned and a degree of imagination in making the best use of available resources, the effect on services will be minimised.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.11 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 30 May 2000.</P>

      <QRef>[14555/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey): In July 1996, my Department issued guidelines for planning authorities on telecommunications antennae and support structures. The purpose of the guidelines was to assist planning authorities, An Bord Pleanála, operators of mobile telecommunications services and the general public by providing guidance on dealing with telecommunications masts and base stations within the planning system. The guidelines specifically recommend that only as a last resort and if all alternatives are unavailable or unsuitable, should free-standing masts be located in a residential area or beside schools. Because of the concern expressed during the public consultation process on the guidelines, a statement on health and safety aspects which the Departments of Health and Children and Public Enterprise agreed with my Department, was included as an appendix to the guidelines. Health aspects are dealt with by requiring operators, as part of their planning application, to furnish to the planning authority a statement of compliance with International Radiation Protection Association guidelines.</P>
    <P>The report of the Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones, the Stewart report, entitled Mobile Phones and Health to which the Deputy refers contains a series of recommendations relating, <i>inter alia,</i> to planning, health, etc. My remit relates to planning and I am having the report examined in this context. From an initial examination it would appear that its recommendations on planning issues are already governed by legislation and guidelines in Ireland. The recommendations in relation to the health effects of mobile phones are a matter for the Department of Health and Children while those in relation to the auditing of radiation emissions from masts and base stations are a matter for the office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation and I understand that those offices are examining the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the ESRI has suggested that 25% of housing output should be for social housing. The ESRI in its national investment priorities report recommended that local authority housing provision should be 6,000 per year. As the Deputy will be aware I have introduced, for the first time, a four year multi-annual programme of 22,000 local authority dwellings and I have asked the local authorities to front load their programmes as far as possible which means that my target for this year is very close to that of the ESRI.</P>
      <P>Total new house completions were 38,842 units in 1997, 42,349 units in 1998 and in 1999 reached 46,512 units. New social and affordable housing units constructed in those years, including new build local authority and voluntary housing, purchases of new houses under shared ownership and affordable housing provided by local authorities are included in these annual totals. In 1997, new social and shared ownership housing units amounted to 3,523 units, representing 9% of total house completions. In 1998, 3,362 new social and shared ownership units were completed and in 1999, 3,712 completions were recorded representing 8% of total house completions in those years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is important to note that this new housing output represents only part of our response to meeting social and affordable housing need. This need is met through a combination of the local authority programme, involving new build and acquisitions, voluntary housing output, casual vacancies in the local authority housing <Col N="1727" /> stock, shared ownership purchases of new and existing housing and the range of other social and affordable housing measures.</P>
    <P>The Government has significantly expanded investment in social and affordable housing in the national development plan. It is projected that the social and affordable housing needs of over 50,000 households will be met over the coming four years and the needs of some 90,000 households will be met over the plan period.</P>

      <P>An estimated 380,000 provisional licences were current at end 1999.</P>
      <P>The Government strategy for road safety 1998-2000 acknowledged the importance of driver training and testing to road safety, with the qualification that these could not be expected to yield road safety benefits on the scale of the measures directly targeted at speeding, alcohol and seat belt wearing which have been prioritised by the strategy. The strategy proposed, for the longer term, a significant reduction in the number of Irish drivers relying on a provisional licence.</P>
      <P>In order to attain this longer term goal, the short-term priority is to restore waiting periods for driving tests to acceptable levels. A record 154,000 applications were dealt with in 1999. Significant additional resources have been allocated to the driver testing service, which now numbers 99 testers compared to 66 in 1998. Together with productivity agreements and Saturday working, this has increased the testing capacity of the service by over 90,000 tests to about 200,000 tests annually. To deal with a 10% projected increase in applications in 2000, retired testers are now also being employed and additional testers recruited. Significantly greater numbers of tests will be conducted which should lead to a reduction in the number of drivers relying on a provisional licence.</P>
      <P>Measures have been in place for some years and will be maintained, to restrict the long-term holding of provisional licences. In addition, the Motor Insurance Advisory Board is in the process of finalising recommendations for improving access to motor insurance for young people. The possibility of affording greater credit for the holding of a full driving licence may arise in this context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>Proposals are being finalised for the creation of strengthened local authority management structures to meet the demands of the introduction of a programme based system of administration and the abolition of the dual structure. Under these proposals the posts of assistant county manager and county engineer will cease to exist. A new grade of director of services will be created at assistant county manager level and a number of these new posts will be filled by designation of the serving assistant managers and county engineers as directors of services. Each director of services will have responsibility for the management of all of the staff, both technical and administrative, dealing with the functions assigned to him or her.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to all other posts will be a matter for consideration by individual managers in consultation with their own staff during local discussions on the implementation of the new structures. However, I understand that proposals currently under discussion in the Dublin counties and Cork city involve the suppression of the county and city planning officer posts in favour of the creation of director of services posts with the wider management remit. I understand that no change is proposed in relation to architect posts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 29, 45, 54, 57, 106 and 113 together.</P>
      <P>The results of the assessment of housing needs undertaken by local authorities at the end of March last year indicated a total of 39,176 households in need of local authority housing. The results revealed that single person households, including elderly persons, account for 29% of the net need and that two or more person households account for 71% of net need. In addition, the housing needs of a further 6,400 households were considered by local authorities as being most suitably met by other measures including voluntary housing, rent supplementation and other social housing schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1730" /> Local authorities have been advised in new social housing design guidelines of the need to provide a mix of dwellings based primarily on the results of their most recent assessment of housing needs and the characteristics of households to be accommodated in their housing schemes. They were also advised that regard should be had to current best estimates regarding the size and type of households likely to be seeking housing in the future and of the need to ensure that a reasonable mix of dwelling types and sizes is maintained, both in the immediate locality and in the housing stock as a whole. Accordingly, local authorities are now providing a significantly wider range of house types including far more one and two bedroom units than in the past.</P>
    <P>In response to the increased level of housing need, I have taken a range of measures to assist local authorities expand their housing programmes which has included the introduction of a four year multi-annual programme and a significant expansion of the voluntary housing programme. Local authorities were notified of their authorised programmes for the period 2000-03 and this programme provides for a total of 22,000 local authority houses. The purpose of introducing a multi-annual local authority housing programme is to enable local authorities to produce a streamlined delivery of housing output over the four year period and to provide a better and more effective mechanism of social housing delivery. I have also encouraged local authorities to front load their programmes as much as possible to meet the increased level of need and I have ensured that adequate capital funding will be made available for their programmes.  The total capital provision for the local authority programme in 2000 is £312 million. This represents an increase of £82 million or 36% on the 1999 provision, £98 million or 46% on the 1998 provision and £137 million or 79% on the 1997 provision.</P>
    <P>The number of houses completed or acquired by local authorities during 1999 was approximately 3,700 which compares with 3,290 in 1998 and 3,217 in 1997. The amounts allocated to local authorities in the years 1997 to 1999 were fully expended on the local authority housing programme. While progress in expanding the programme in 1999 was slower than I hoped, I expect that authorities will commence the construction of, or acquire, in excess of 5,500 houses this year and that the level of house completions, including acquisitions, will be in excess of 4,000 units.</P>
    <P>Figures in relation to the number of starts-completions for the first quarter of 2000 are currently being compiled. Detailed figures regarding the number of families housed on a monthly basis are not returned to my Department. However, information relating to first time lettings by local authorities is available in the housing statistics bulletins.</P>
    <P>The Government is fully aware of the increased level of social housing need and priority is being given to tackling this need. The local authority <Col N="1731" /> housing programme is only one of a range of ways in which the needs of households on local authority waiting lists may be met and I am confident that the enhanced multi-annual local authority housing programme together with increased output from the complementary social housing measures and vacancies occurring in the existing stock, will enable the housing needs of some 11,000 households to be met this year, compared to 9,200 last year, and that the increased social housing output over the coming four years will meet the needs of over 50,000 households.</P>
    <P>While my Department will support and co-operate in every way with local authorities to help them achieve their housing programmes in terms of providing the necessary capital funding and forward commitment for house starts, it is a matter for each individual local authority to implement the programmes which they have nominated for provision this year and I expect local authorities to afford priority to meeting the social housing needs of this area and respond positively in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 92 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>Thermal treatment of waste, carried on in accordance with high environmental standards, is regarded as environmentally preferable to the disposal of waste by landfill and plays a major part in municipal waste management in many EU countries and further afield. Accordingly, the 1998 policy statement on waste management, Changing Our Ways, indicates that, where technically and economically feasible, and subject to appropriate attention to materials recycling, incineration with energy recovery or other advanced thermal processes are among the treatment options which should be considered in an integrated waste management strategy. That remains the position.</P>
      <P>There has been no recent report by the US Environmental Protection Agency &ndash; USEPA &ndash; in this matter. I am aware only of Irish media reports referring, apparently sight unseen, to a leaked draft report being prepared by the USEPA. I understand that this draft report, possibly amended, will be officially published next month following which it will be evaluated by my Department and the Environmental Protection Agency &ndash; EPA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essential point said to emerge from the leaked draft report is that the USEPA has concluded for the first time that dioxins are a human <Col N="1733" /> carcinogen. However, in 1997, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, an agency of the World Health Organisation, had already classed the most toxic dioxin compound as a known human carcinogen. The WHO also considers that there is a level of exposure to dioxins below which cancer risk would be negligible. Accordingly, in 1998, it agreed on a tolerable daily intake guideline for dioxins, based on a thorough evaluation of all available data on the toxicological effects of dioxins, and the most up-to-date methods of interpretation.</P>
    <P>Dioxins are ubiquitous in the environment, and arise from a range of combustion sources, diffuse and otherwise. Detailed information regarding the known effects of dioxins on human health is contained in a comprehensive published 1999 EU report, Compilation of EU Dioxin Exposure and Health Data. Clearly, because of the potential toxic effects of exposure to dioxins, their emission must, where possible, be strictly controlled and minimised to ensure that exposure does not exceed relevant guidelines and standards.</P>
    <P>Irish environmental legislation, in particular the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, provides for the integrated licensing and comprehensive environmental control of waste incineration facilities. The EPA must take the precautionary principle into account and is precluded from granting an integrated licence unless, among other considerations, it is satisfied that the activity concerned will not endanger human health or harm the environment.</P>
    <P>In licensing incineration facilities, the EPA already applies a flue gas emission limit value for dioxins of 0.1 nanograms, that is, one ten thousand millionth of a gram per cubic metre of gas emitted. This is an extremely stringent standard, which will shortly be adopted by the EU generally, under the proposed Council directive on the incineration of waste. The European Commission estimates that the implementation of this directive will result in a 99% reduction in emissions of dioxins from waste incineration, relative to 1993-95, and anticipates that the contribution of municipal and clinical waste incineration to overall emissions of dioxins in Europe would be reduced to 0.3%, assuming the output of other sources remains unchanged.</P>
    <P>Overall, I am advised that emissions from proposed new thermal treatment facilities, employing modern technologies and subject to compliance with strict environmental standards, should not have any appreciable environmental impact or contribute significantly to background levels of dioxins locally or nationally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Some 90,400 applicants are at present awaiting driving tests, an improvement of some 11,500 over mid-1999. Of these, approximately 25,400 have been given test appointments and a further 15,200 have indicated that they are not currently available to be tested. On average applicants have to wait 21 weeks for a test. However, applicants who require a test for urgent reasons are being given earlier appointments: about 38% of applicants are tested within 15 weeks. The average longest waiting time nationally is some 29 weeks, a reduction of 12 weeks relative to early 1999.</P>
      <P>Average waiting times are not compiled for individual centres due to limitations in the IT systems involved. However, these systems are being upgraded with a view to producing this information in future. The following tabular statement sets out the longest waiting time for each centre.</P>
      <P>Applications for driving tests are now running at record levels, driven by exceptional conditions of economic growth. Applications this year are expected to be 10% higher than in 1999 which saw a record 154,000 test applications made to my Department, compared to 118,000 applications in 1997.</P>
      <P>Significant additional resources have already been allocated to the driver testing service, which now numbers 99 testers compared to 66 in 1998. Together with recent productivity agreements and Saturday working, this has increased the testing capacity of the service by over 90,000 tests to about 200,000 tests annually. Two new test centres have been provided in Tallaght and Raheny. Retired testers are now being employed and additional testers recruited to cope with the increased demand. I am determined to bring progressive and substantial improvement to the quality of the driving test service provided to the public and, in particular, to end current excessive and unacceptable waiting times.</P>
      <P>In response to the recently published value for money examination of the driving test service by the Comptroller and Auditor General, I stated my particular concern to bring greater responsiveness and flexibility to the driver testing service in current conditions of rapidly rising demand for tests. I announced that my Department would immediately put in hand a review by consultants of the organisation and delivery of driving test services, with particular reference to the requirements of responsiveness and flexibility in an expanding market. This process is now under way. The review will include full consultation with service users, staff and other interests and I intend that it will be completed as a matter of urgency and necessary changes put in place.</P>

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that the construction industry has the capacity to meet the construction needs set out in the national development programme in view of the concerns expressed in the document, Framework for Action on Infrastructural Development including Public Private Partnership; the action being taken to expand the construction sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[14730/00]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The construction industry has shown a remarkable capacity to meet demand, having doubled output since 1994. Nonetheless, it is generally accepted that the construction industry may now be operating at or close to existing building capacity and that this capacity will need to expand further to ensure the delivery of the National Development Plan, 2000-2006.</P>
      <P>In considering this issue, it must be borne in mind that Ireland, as part of the EU Internal Market, has access to building capacity outside its borders. There is already substantial participation in building projects from construction firms and workers located in other EU member states, and especially from Northern Ireland. The size of the investment in the NDP, and the promotion of public private partnerships, should encourage greater participation by firms from other EU member states in the design and construction of projects frequently in joint ventures with local firms.</P>
      <P>The Government, in partnership with the industry, has already taken a number of steps to expand domestic building capacity. The serviced land initiative will result in the servicing of more than 1000,000 housing sites, over the period 1999 to 2001, for a total investment of around £100 million.</P>
      <P>The intake of apprentices into the building trades has more than doubled from 2,300 in 1993-94 to 5,600 in 1999-2000. The Government has given a commitment, in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness &ndash; February 2000 &ndash; to give priority to the provision of additional training places for the greatly increased intake of apprentices.</P>
      <P>The NDP provides the building product manufacturers with a firm medium term basis for undertaking investment to expand capacity. No problems are currently foreseen in ensuring that there will be adequate supplies of building plant and equipment. However, the Government is not complacent in regard to the challenges posed for building capacity by the NDP, which contains building projects with a value in excess of £22 billion. In September 1999, I asked the forum for the construction industry to expedite a study of the capacity of the industry. Last February, I published the interim report of the forum, together with a press statement setting out the positive position in relation to the implementation of each of the report's seven core recommendations. The forum's final report is due by the end of July next. Copies of the interim report and press statement have been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I published the draft guidelines for planning authorities on child care facilities on 17 May 2000. The draft guidelines are intended to ensure a consistency of approach throughout the country to the treatment of planning applications for child care facilities. They will also assist planning authorities in their efforts to make suitable provision for child care in their development plans. The draft guidelines do not, however, relate to child minding, which is generally a small scale, home-based economic activity and does not generally require planning permission.</P>
      <P>The draft guidelines have been issued for a two month public consultation period until 21 July 2000. All interested parties have been invited to submit any comments they may have to my Department. All submissions received will be taken into consideration before a final version of the guidelines issues as soon as possible thereafter. However, in view of the urgency of the need for additional child care facilities, I have asked local authorities to take the draft guidelines on board from now on both in reviewing development plans and in exercising planning control functions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The annual housing statistics bulletin 1999, to which the Deputy refers, indicates a welcome moderating trend in house price increases, indicative of the effectiveness of measures taken by Government to address the issue. My Department's house price statistics for the December quarter of 1999 show an annual price increase of 16% for new houses on a national basis, well below the peak of 26% recorded in 1998 and I believe the package of measures taken, and the further measures which will be taken, will con<Col N="1738" /> tinue to have a moderating impact in the level of house prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>On 2 May last, I launched a major Government strategy on homelessness. The strategy is based on the report of the cross department team on homelessness which was established by the Cabinet committee on social inclusion to examine comprehensively the issue of homelessness.</P>
      <P>The essence of the strategy is that action plans will be drawn up at city and county level detailing how accommodation, health, settlement and welfare services will be provided to homeless persons by all of the agencies involved in providing these services. In addition, a homeless forum will be set up in each county under the auspices of the local authority housing strategic policy committees.</P>
      <P>My Department has issued copies of the strategy to all local authorities is urging early implementation of the measures that have been identified. Local authorities have been asked to produce action plans, jointly with health boards and voluntary bodies, within three months and by the end of August at the latest. My Department will monitor progress on these actions.</P>
      <P>Substantial funding has also been made available to ensure that the measures in the strategy are implemented. Capital funding will be doubled over the next five years from £20 million to £40 million to provide suitable additional accommodation. Additional current funding of £6 million per annum will be available from my Department to increase payments for the provision of hostel accommodation by voluntary bodies and local authorities and to establish settlement and outreach programmes. Additional funding of £6 million will be available from the Department of Health and Children to fund the provision of in-house care in hostels providing accommodation for homeless persons. Copies of the strategy, which is entitled Homelessness &ndash; an Integrated Strategy, are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>The 1997 report of the strategic review committee on the construction industry included a recommendation for a registration system for building contractors and sub-contractors. The report recommended that an independent body be established by the construction industry to administer the system.</P>
      <P>In December 1999 the Forum for the Construction Industry submitted an interim report setting out preliminary proposals for the registration of contractors, the implementation of which would require legislation to protect the title of registered contractor.</P>
      <P>I accept the forum's proposals, in principle, subject to a number of modifications which are principally designed to enhance the coverage and independence of the registration system, in the interest of consumer protection. My Department conveyed my views to the forum in February 2000. I recently wrote to the chairman of the forum requesting a response by mid-June 2000.</P>

      <P>Part L of the building regulations, which applies to the design and construction of new buildings and the reconstruction of existing buildings, sets out the legal requirements to be observed in relation to the conservation of fuel and energy.</P>
      <P>Technical guidance document L, which accompanies the regulations, provides guidance on the thermal performance standards of various elements in buildings, including roofs, walls and so on. For typical construction, the technical guidance document provides guidance on determining the thickness of insulation material required to achieve the standards, taking account of the thermal properties of both the insulation and the basic construction.</P>
      <P>The building regulations do not place a restriction on the use of any method of construction or product, provided the performance requirements of the building regulations are met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has initiated a review of the insulation requirements of technical guidance document L having regard to Ireland's obli<Col N="1741" /> gations to limit greenhouse gas emissions under the Kyoto Protocol of 1997. In accordance with standard practice, my Department has consulted the Building Regulations Advisory Body (BRAB) on the proposed review. The BRAB has, in turn, commissioned a technical study by the Energy Research Group, UCD, of the impact of greater insulation levels in new houses on building systems commonly used in Ireland and on indoor air climate. The study is expected to be completed by the end of June 2000. I understand that the outcome of the study will be discussed by the BRAB in July 2000. The Deputy will appreciate that I do not wish to prejudge the outcome at this stage. I will await the results of the study and the subsequent advice of the BRAB on the revision of the relevant technical guidance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1995 my Department appointed international consultants to carry out a strategic study to, <i>inter alia</i>, assess current and future demand on the water supply network in Dublin city and the greater Dublin area, including counties Wicklow and Kildare, and to identify the most cost effective approach to meeting those demands. Among the recommendations from the consultants' report were the water conservation programme jointly undertaken by Dublin Corporation and the other local authorities in the region which has significantly reduced water leakage and improved the efficiency of the distribution system; the proposals being advanced for the expansion the Ballymore Eustace water treatment plant to increase its output by 68 Ml/d to 320 Ml/d; and the upgrading of the Leixlip water supply system, which is almost complete, to increase output to 175 Ml/d.</P>
      <P>These and other measures have ensured that Dublin's water supply has been able to accommodate the unprecedented development in the area in the meantime and to meet the additional water demand without the need for supply restrictions which had previously been a feature of the region's water supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In light of continuing economic growth forecasts, and in particular the projections of the spatial planning guidelines for the greater Dublin region, my Department earlier this year asked the authors of the 1995 report, Generale des Eaux: to update their earlier findings on demand projections and the capacity of the system to meet them, <Col N="1742" /> and to consider options for additional new sources of water for Dublin.</P>
    <P>The updated report has been received in my Department in the last few days and is under examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 36 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>The Government strategy for road safety 1998-2002 prioritises a systematic and co-ordinated set of measures for preventing and reducing road accidents. It establishes quantified targets for achieving its objectives, the principal of which is to reduce road deaths and serious injuries each by at least 20% by 2002 relative to 1997. Priority is accorded by the strategy to actions targeted at speeding, alcohol and seat belt wearing. A timetable for key actions in these and other areas is also set out.</P>
      <P>The Government strategy is monitored by the high level group on road safety whose first progress report &ndash; July 1999 &ndash;<i>inter alia</i> details progress with these key actions. Copies of that report were circulated to all Deputies and are also available in the Oireachtas Library. A second progress report, incorporating updated information on key actions, will be published by July 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is not aware of any recently published report by the Garda in relation to research or study of serious and fatal road accidents. However, in relation to engineering and road design, the Government strategy for road safety envisages the treatment by the NRA of a minimum of 400 high accident locations on <Col N="1743" /> national roads by 2002. Good progress is being made on this measure with 191 schemes completed at end 1999 and a further 100 scheduled for completion by end 2000. This programme is now also being extended to non-national roads with provision of £500,000 being made in the current year to begin similar engineering measures on this network.</P>
    <P>The recently published findings of the NRA national speed survey, 1999, demonstrate that considerable progress remains to be made to achieve road safety targets in these vital areas. Relevant measures envisaged by the Government strategy have been deployed since the survey was carried out. Fixed speed cameras are now in operation within the Dublin and eastern regions. Garda enforcement activity against speeding has also been intensifying, with over 170,000 on-the-spot fines issued in relation to speeding offences in 1999 and more than 70,000 to end April this year.</P>
    <P>On-the-spot fines for non-wearing of seat belts have also been commenced by the Garda since the NRA survey was carried out, with some 25,000 such fines issued in late 1999 and over 18,000 so far this year.</P>
    <P>The need for further action to support the achievement of stated targets for speeding and seat belt wearing will be addressed in the second progress report on the Government strategy for road safety.</P>
    <P>The scheme of a new road traffic Bill is being drafted in my Department with the principal purpose of providing for a penalty points system. However the design of the system has, as stated in the strategy, required careful consideration because of the exclusive constitutional role of the Irish courts in the administration of justice. Following protracted examination of this legal issue, I hope shortly to be in a position to submit legislative proposals to Government with a view to the earliest possible publication of a Bill.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to figures contained in the annual housing statistics bulletin 1999, which showed that the gap between the price of houses and the cost of building them has now widened by over 100 points, with the house price index now standing at 236 compared with the cost of building index which stands at 134; the steps he intends to take to stop excessive profiteering on the part of builders; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The indices for private new house prices and house building costs measure different things. The house price index measures changes in private new house prices which reflect the supply <Col N="1744" /> and demand for housing. The national house building cost index relates solely to standard wage rates set by the National Joint Industrial Council for the Construction Industry and average market prices for construction materials and does not include items such as development land prices, planning and development levies, planning fees, legal fees, marketing costs or profits which would be reflected in house prices and any house price index.</P>
      <P>Housing demand has grown phenomenally in recent years due to a number of factors, including strong economic growth, historically low interest rates, increasing employment, rising levels of real personal disposable income, and demographic changes, including high immigration and growth in the key household formation age groups.</P>
      <P>The Government strategy to moderate house price increases is based, therefore, on increasing the supply of housing to meet demand. The Government has implemented a comprehensive range of initiatives to this end, and these measures are having effect. The trend in house price increases is moderating and record housing output was again achieved in 1999 with national new house completions up 10% on 1998. Significantly, in Dublin, where the supply demand imbalance is most critical, the increase in output was 12%.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace):</NameTxt>
      <P>In December 1999 my Department advised local authorities that financial assistance at a rate of up to 85% would be available in the context of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 to support expenditure on projects to develop catchment-based water monitoring and management systems on an inter-authority basis. The establishment of such projects by local authorities is being actively promoted by my Department, with the objective of having projects established in the short to medium term to address all sources of pollution in all inland and coastal waters, including groundwaters.</P>
      <P>The proposed new projects will build on the major, catchment-based, water quality projects already under way in relation to loughs Derg, Ree and Leane and the rivers Boyne, Liffey and Suir in the context of the national strategy being pursued by my Department since 1997 to combat eutrophication in rivers and lakes due to excess inputs of phosphorus.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the views referred to in the question. I have given a great deal of consideration to how best to ensure that the community benefits from decisions of local authorities to rezone land and the response to that issue is set out in Part V of the Planning and Development Bill, 1999.</P>
      <P>It is recognised that the high value of zoned land derives in part from the actions of the local authority in zoning it and in funding infrastructure services. The Planning and Development Bill will, therefore, require that up to 20% of land zoned for housing must be made available for social and affordable housing as a condition of development. This land must be made available to the local authority at existing use value, for example, at agricultural use value, unless purchased at a higher price prior to the publication of the Bill in August 1999. The local authority will then be in a position to build or to arrange for the building of houses for sale to those who meet the criteria for purchasing affordable houses, for letting as local authority housing or to give the site to a voluntary housing body. Alternatively, the developer and the local authority may enter into an arrangement whereby the developer would provide houses in the development at an agreed price to the local authority.</P>
      <P>The measures which I have proposed in the Planning and Development Bill will ensure benefits for the wider community from zoning decisions and that the measures are well targeted, clearly defined and are proportionate and relevant to the issue being tackled. The Bill has been prepared having regard to the constitutional principles of fairness, equality and proportionality. I have no proposals, therefore, to introduce the alternative arrangement to which the Deputy referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Demand for housing generally is influenced by many factors including demographic changes, economic growth, interest rates, employment and levels of real personal disposable income and, accordingly, it is not possible to quantify precisely the numbers of people in need of housing.</P>
      <P>I have, however, appointed consultants to undertake a detailed evaluation of recent developments in the housing market, including an examination of supply and demand for housing. The study, which is being carried out by Peter Bacon and Associates in conjunction with my Department, will be completed shortly and will be considered by Government, together with a comprehensive policy response as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
      <P>Overall demand for housing to meet the needs of all members of the community will fall to be considered by local authorities in the context of housing strategies which local authorities will be required to prepare following enactment of the Planning and Development Bill, 1999.</P>
      <P>The Government considers that forecasts of continued strong economic growth, along with recent demographic predictions, coupled with high immigration, particularly in the key household formation age categories, and the fall in average household size all point towards continued higher demand for housing. For this reason, the national development plan provides the framework for an integrated investment strategy to facilitate the provision of 500,000 houses to meet this demand over the next ten years.</P>
      <P>The 1999 assessment of the need for local authority housing indicated that demand for social housing has also increased with just over 39,000 households seeking local authority housing. The provision of £6 billion investment for social and affordable housing in the national development plan will ensure that the social housing needs of over 90,000 households will be met with Government assistance over the period of the plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with its legislative mandate to prepare regular state of the environment reports, the EPA published Ireland's Environment &ndash; a Millennium Report <Col N="1749" /> on 27 April 2000; copies are in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The report concludes that, overall, Ireland's environmental quality remains relatively good in comparison with that of most other European countries. However, it also recognises that economic growth over recent years is placing increasing pressure on the environment.</P>
      <P>The report identifies five main challenges facing the environment: reducing eutrophication of inland waters, managing waste and preventing litter, protecting the urban environment, controlling greenhouse gas emissions, and protecting natural resources.</P>
      <P>Eutrophication is identified as perhaps Ireland's most serious environmental problem. The report acknowledges the importance of the phosphorous regulations made in 1998, which set quality standards to be achieved to return the waters affected to a healthy condition. Record levels of investment in water services, IR£3 billion under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, development of catchment management strategies throughout the country, use of nutrient management planning, phase-out of phosphate-based domestic laundry detergents, and implementation of REPS are among the key measures to secure and maintain good water quality.</P>
      <P>The regional waste management plans being developed within the policy framework, Changing Our Ways, which I launched in 1998, will be integrated strategies, building on the recognised hierarchy of prevention, minimisation, reuse-recycling and disposal. Some IR£650 million is earmarked for capital investment in the development of waste management infrastructure under the NDP and a programme of measures has been developed to complement local authority anti-litter action. In addition, individuals through choices in their daily lives have a major role to play in helping to reduce waste and tackle the litter problem.</P>
      <P>The report recognises that the elimination of leaded petrol and the extended bans on smoky coal, as well as other measures, have made a positive contribution to the improvement of urban air quality. However, the dramatic rise in vehicle numbers and use over recent years means that more is required to meet new EU standards for nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter. The NDP commits to substantial investment in public transport over the period 2000-06.</P>
      <P>Greenhouse gases continue to grow at an unacceptable rate. If current trends persist, emissions will be nearly three times the Kyoto commitment by 2008-2012. I will shortly be bringing to Government for approval a draft national greenhouse gas abatement strategy to set the framework for meeting Ireland's Kyoto target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its first state of the environment report, 1996, EPA underlined the room for improvement in protecting the natural heritage. The new report recognises that, while substantial difficulties remain, progress has been made in terms of <Col N="1750" /> greater public information on and better resourcing for heritage protection.</P>
    <P>Overall, the EPA report makes a major contribution to awareness of and debate on the environment and sustainable development in Ireland. It will inform and guide policy making and individual action in these areas over the years ahead.</P>

An extension from Balla to Kiltimagh has been included in the list as a requirement for the post 2006 period.

      <P>The position with regard to legal actions and complaints being investigated by the European Commission in regard to environmental matters in Ireland which fall within the remit of my Department is as follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Waste Management Plans</i>The European Commission has initiated court proceedings in respect of the failure to implement Directive 75/442/EEC, as amended, on waste, Directive 91/689/EEC on hazardous waste, and <Col N="1751" /> Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste, with regard to the making of waste plans. Ireland lodged a defence on 30 March 2000 seeking a suspension of the proceedings for three months by which time it is expected all plans will have been adopted.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Private Rural Water Supplies</i>On 11 January 2000 the European Commission announced that it had decided to take Ireland to the European Court of Justice for non-respect of certain aspects of Directive 80/778/EEC on the quality of water intended for human consumption. While my Department has not been formally advised of the terms of the court action, it is understood that the Commission is concerned at the relatively high level of microbiological contamination of private group water supplies. It is also concerned that Irish legislation does not provide sufficient legal basis for addressing quality problems in such supplies.</P>
    <P>The Commission has been informed of a package of measures being introduced to tackle the water quality problems confronting the group water sector, including a record £420 million investment to improve rural water infrastructure over the period of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 and a major revamp of the grant and subsidy schemes which support the group water sector.</P>
    <P>The Commission was also notified of new drinking water regulations made in November 1999 which strengthened the statutory basis for action to improve the quality of deficient group water supply schemes. A further amendment will <Col N="1752" /> shortly be made to the regulations to require full compliance with statutory drinking water standards within a specified period.</P>
    <P>Proceedings by way of reasoned opinion under Article 226 of the Treaty on European Union have been notified to Ireland by the Commission in relation to the following.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Council Regulation 259/93 (EEC) &ndash; Shipment of Waste</i>These proceedings arise from non-submission of annual reports under this regulation which covers the supervision and control of shipments of waste, within, into and out of the European Community. The Commission is aware that the information required for the reports is complex and must be gathered from a number of sources. It is intended that completed reports will be submitted by mid-end June 2000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Directive 76/464/EEC &ndash; Protection of Water against Pollution by Dangerous Substances</i>These proceedings refer to specific issues arising under Directive 76/464/EEC on the protection of water against pollution by dangerous substances. A reply has issued to the Commission. New regulations in request of a number of these substances are currently being finalised in my Department.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Reporting Directive (91/692 EEC)</i>This complaint refers to the submission of reports on the implementation of water directives under Directive 91/692/EEC. A reply has issued to the Commission.</P>
    <P>A further 15 preliminary complaints have been notified to my Department and the current position is as set out in the following table.</P>

      <P>Local authorities are required to zone land to meet identified needs over the lifetime of their development plans, and to ensure that the land is sufficiently serviced to address these needs. Under the Planning and Development Bill, each local authority will be required to prepare a housing strategy, addressing the housing needs of all sectors of the population for the period of the development plan, including the need for social and affordable housing. This need will have to be factored into the amount of land zoned for residential purposes for the period of the development plan.</P>
      <P>It is evident that measures taken to increase the supply response are producing results, supported by very positive progress in the provision of key infrastructure projects. An initial assessment of local authority landbanks shows that there is existing and projected serviced land in the four Dublin authorities to support about four years' output at 1999 output levels. Indications from other key authorities also shows a positive position &ndash; Kildare 4.6 years' supply, Meath 7.6 years, Waterford Corporation 6.8 years, and Galway Corporation 8.2 years.</P>
      <P>In the context of the broader range of Government policies and initiatives requiring land, for example, private and social housing, immigration, decentralisation, health, education, etc., the development of a comprehensive register of State properties and land holdings that will allow the Government determine the extent, size and use of the State property portfolio is being considered in consultation with the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>A detailed evaluation of recent developments in the housing market, including the evolution of housing demand and supply is currently being undertaken by my Department in conjunction with Peter Bacon and Associates. The study will assess short and medium-term projections of housing demand and supply and will make further recommendations for action required to bring supply more in line with demand and to improve housing affordability. It is expected that the report will be completed shortly and will be considered by Government together with a comprehensive policy response, as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Housing demand has grown phenomenally in <Col N="1755" /> recent years due to a number of factors, including strong economic growth, historically low interest rates, increasing employment, rising levels of real personal disposable income, and demographic changes, including high immigration and growth in the key household formation age groups.</P>
    <P>Maximising housing supply is the key objective of the Government in order to meet real demand, stabilise house prices and facilitate first-time purchasers. The Government has implemented a comprehensive range of initiatives to this end, and key measures to increase supply include the serviced land initiative, promotion of more efficient land use through higher residential densities in appropriate locations, capital gains tax concessions to encourage faster release of housing land, preparation of strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, expanding the local authority and voluntary housing programmes, provisions in the Planning and Development Bill to ensure an adequate supply of land for social and affordable housing, and measures to increase building industry capacity. A co-ordinating housing supply unit has also been established in my Department to drive and effectively deliver on the range of measures, to maximise housing output and remove bottlenecks where demand is greatest.</P>
    <P>There is strong evidence that these measures are having positive effect, but there is no evidence of supply of housing being artificially held back. Record housing output was achieved in 1999 with new house completions nationally up 10% on 1998, making this the fifth consecutive year of record housing output. Moreover, in Dublin, where the imbalance between supply and demand was greatest, an increase of 12% was achieved, with output exceeding 10,000 units for the first time. There is also a trend of moderating house price increases as indicated by my Department's statistics for the December quarter of 1999.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006, envisages significant private sector investment in national road development: some £1 billion of the £4.4 billion provided for national roads improvements in the NDP is to come from PPP financing. Apart from the pilot projects already identified in the plan, designation of projects or parts of projects for PPP purposes will be decided as the plan is implemented. The appropriate funding structures, including road user tolls, for projects will also be examined and identified, bearing in mind <Col N="1756" /> the level of funding available and the appropriateness of particular projects for the PPP approach.</P>
      <P>The statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll by-laws, and to enter into toll agreements with private investors is currently vested in the National Roads Authority under Part V of the Roads Act, 1993. Road authorities have similar powers in relation to the tolling of non-national roads. The exercise of these powers has been subject to the approval of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>Under the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, it is proposed to remove this requirement of ministerial approval of toll schemes, by-laws and agreements. In accordance with the revised Part V of the Roads Act, 1993, these matters will be brought fully within the discretion of the National Roads Authority or the relevant local road authority, in the case of national and non-national roads respectively.</P>
      <P>In parallel, the Roads Act, 1993, is also being amended so as to provide for the issue of policy directives to the National Roads Authority or local authorities by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government regarding the exercise of their road tolling functions, with which they will be obliged to comply. Any such policy directives would be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, at this stage, quite a considerable body of largely EU-led food labelling rules, for which responsibility is spread over a number of Departments, having regard to their respective specific remits.</P>
      <P>My Department is responsible for the European Communities (Labelling, Presentation and Advertising of Foodstuffs) Regulations 2000 (S.I. No. 92 of 2000). These regulations give effect to EU labelling rules of a general nature. The provisions apply to foodstuffs placed for sale on the Irish market, with the exception of foodstuffs pre-packaged on a retail premises for direct sale to a consumer to which many of the provisions do not apply. The rules are designed to inform and protect consumers in the EU by ensuring that they have the information necessary to make informed choices about the products which they purchase and that this information is provided in such a manner as to facilitate trade between member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations require certain specific information to be provided on the labelling of pre-packaged foodstuffs, including the name of the product, the name or business name and address of the manufacturer, packer or seller of the product established within the EU, the list of ingredients, the net quantity and the date of minimum durability. Origin marking is required only if the <Col N="1758" /> absence of such information would be likely to mislead the consumer to a material degree as to the true origin or provenance of the foodstuff, for example, through pictorial representations such as a map or a flag. It is important to note that origin in this context is taken to be the place in which the product last underwent a substantial change. It does not necessarily mean the country where the food was originally produced.</P>
    <P>While there is no explicit prohibition on the provision of additional labelling information, such as a declaration that the food is packed in Ireland, under these general regulations, it would be an offence under existing domestic legislation for any such additional information to make false representations regarding the packing of the goods in Ireland. The Director of Consumer Affairs has the power to prosecute in this regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>On the issue of safety on leisure craft, as the Deputies are aware, the action group on small powered recreational craft, including personal watercraft, recently presented me with its final report. This report made a number of recommendations including some in respect to the carriage and use of lifejackets, carriage of safety equipment and consumption of alcohol. On the basis of this, I am currently proposing the introduction of a legislative framework for the regulation of recreational craft. This is being achieved through amendments to the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992 which are included in the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Bill, 1999. The Bill passed the Dáil Report and Final Stages on 24 May 2000.</P>
      <P>The Bill foresees the implementation of regulations to take account not only of the safety of the passengers and occupants of the vessels in question but also the safety of other persons resulting from the use of the vessels and any disturbance or nuisance caused by their usage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following on the enactment of this piece of <Col N="1759" /> legislation, I hope to quickly introduce implementing regulations based on the recommendations of the action group's final report. I consider that these regulations, allied to the recently launched Year 2000 Safety on the Water campaign, will contribute to an increase in safety in the water-based leisure sector and a resultant decrease in the emergency calls received by the emergency services in future.</P>

      <P>A special reinvestment programme was initiated by my Department in 1999, to complement expenditure on the normal range of building and engineering works, for the purpose of providing modern living, operational and training accommodation for the Defence Forces. The special programme is centred on the Curragh Camp and on Collins Barracks, Cork, and is expected to result in the investment of more than £50 million in additional funding in the period to the end of 2003. It is estimated that the total expenditure on new buildings and projects for the up-grading of existing buildings throughout the Defence Forces will exceed £100 million in the period 1999 to 2003.</P>
      <P>As regards major projects at the Curragh Camp, the refurbishment of the ammunition depot is well advanced and work on a new swimming pool and gymnasium project will start shortly. About 14 further major projects at the camp are scheduled and the majority are due to be commenced later this year, including a new NCO's mess; ordnance-transport school and technical stores; and accommodation in Connolly and Clarke Barracks.</P>
      <P>All of these projects are being undertaken solely for Defence Forces purposes and will be fully funded by my Department.</P>

      <P>Current veterinary inspection procedures at meat slaughtering plants are specifically provided for under EU and domestic legislation. This service is aimed at providing the maximum level of food safety and meat hygiene standards and because of the high dependence on export markets for Irish beef we must ensure that we also meet the exacting requirements of European and third country customers.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the present system is working effectively and it has been the subject of detailed food safety inspection audits by both the EU control authorities and inspection bodies from importing countries. Nevertheless, we are constantly looking at the service with a view to identifying efficiencies and improvements in our systems.</P>
      <P>There are discussions under way at EU level at present to consider possible changes to the meat inspection system and it is my intention to participate in these discussions in such a way as to achieve the greatest efficiency in the use of our inspection resources while at the same time providing the highest assurances on food safety. In the context of these discussions, which are at a very early stage, I will of course have regard not just to ongoing developments in Australia but also in other countries, so that their experience of measures adopted to achieve best practice will be taken into account.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that the property referred to by the Deputy was offered to the Office of Public Works in January following an advertisement by that office in the national newspapers for suitable properties for the purpose of accommodating asylum seekers. I am informed that the Irish Society for Autism did not contact the Office of Public Works regarding its interest in this property.</P>
      <P>Decisions in relation to the allocation of funding for new developments in services to persons with disabilities, including those with autism, are a matter for individual health boards and are taken in line with the priorities which have been identified for each region through the established planning and consultative structures. This applies to both revenue and capital funding for new service developments. All of the capital funding available to my Department to support the development of services to persons with autism and those with an intellectual disability in 2000 has been notified to the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the property referred to by the Deputy, the relevant health board would be the South Eastern Health Board. While it is understood that the society may have been interested in this property since early this year, no approach was made by the society to the South Eastern Health Board concerning a proposed development for persons with autism. I understand from the board that it is its policy that any development such as that proposed by the society will not attract funding unless a specific business case is prepared, considered by the regional co-ordinating committee and approved by the regional director of disability services. As no representations were made by the Irish Society for Autism to the board, its proposals relating to this particular property are not included in the board's service plans for 2000. However, I have referred the request from the society for funding, which I received in early May, to the board to ascertain whether any assistance could be made available to the society in this matter and I understand that the board has written to the society, requesting <Col N="1767" /> that a meeting be arranged with the regional director of disability services to discuss the proposed development.</P>
    <P>While any decision regarding the purpose for which this property may be used is not a matter for this Department, I will inform my colleagues, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister of State at the Office of Public Works of the outcome of the South Eastern Health Board's discussions with the Irish Society for Autism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The long-term illness scheme entitles persons to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a specific schedule of illnesses. The long-term illness scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to extend the scheme, having regard to the other schemes available to help people with the cost of drugs and medicines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All persons who do not have a medical card or long-term illness card can qualify for the drug payment scheme, which was introduced on 1 July 1999 with a threshold of £42 per individual or family unit. Under the scheme, once an individual or family has spent a total of £42 on approved prescribed medicines in a month, the cost of any further approved prescribed medicines in that month is paid for by the State.  The primary aim of the scheme is to bring about improvements <Col N="1768" /> over previous schemes and it is designed to be user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
    <P>In addition, people who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the local health board has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>

      <P>The total number on in-patient hospital waiting lists as at 31 March 2000, the latest date for which figures are available, is 34,370. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the numbers on waiting lists have fallen by 2,485 on the end of December quarter. This welcome reduction has been achieved in a period of high levels of medical admissions due to flu-like illnesses and is a reflection of the major priority that is being attached to addressing high waiting lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment. In this context, following a series of discussions with the chief executive <Col N="1769" /> officers of the health boards, I announced on Tuesday last a £10 million initiative aimed at maximising available capacity in the system to enable an additional 7,600 waiting list procedures to be performed before the end of the year. This funding will be allocated on the basis of the performance of each agency in reaching the activity targets they have agreed. The proposals to be funded are based on a series of innovative measures including use of facilities during the traditional summer closures period, cross-contracting arrangements between agencies and from the private sector, extended theatre and ward opening times, extended weekend work and the contracting of activity from hospitals in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>These short-term measures are being taken in tandem with longer term measures associated with the £2 billion investment under the national development plan, the ongoing implementation of the recommendations of the expert review group on the waiting list initiative and the national bed capacity review now under way. It is my intention to continue to take all available steps to address the short and longer term issues associated with lengthy waiting lists and waiting times.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not routinely collected in my Department. However, my Department has asked the regional chief executive officer of the eastern regional health authority and the chief executive officers of the health boards to compile the information for their area and forward them directly to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The provision of an air ambulance service for emergency cases which cannot be safely conveyed by road ambulance continues to be provided by the Air Corps and the marine search and rescue helicopter service of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
      <P>Contacts regarding the provision of a dedicated air ambulance service are on-going with all interested parties involved with a view to developing a consensus on the most appropriate role for air ambulance in the overall context of pre hospital care. I am continuing to provide additional funding for pre-hospital care with funding of over £10 million in 2000. This is the largest annual amount ever provided for the development of the ambulance service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to acknowledge that an air ambulance service is only one element of an <Col N="1770" /> effective emergency medical care system. Since the publication of the report of the review group on the ambulance service in 1993 approximately £33 million has been provided for the implementation of the report's recommendations with well over half this funding being provided by this Government. This has resulted in major improvements in the service including: &ndash;  the training of ambulance personnel; the specification and age profile of the ambulance fleet; the development of command and control centres; the opening of additional ambulance stations; and the provision of training and equipment to general practitioners in remote rural areas, on a pilot basis, to enable them to deal with emergencies in advance of the arrival of an ambulance.</P>
    <P>I remain committed to the continued development of the pre-hospital care system identified both in the review group's findings and in the recent report of the cardiovascular health strategy group, Building Healthier Hearts. Proposals for the development of an air ambulance service fall to be considered in the wider context of developments in emergency medical services generally. Any initiative in this area needs to complement appropriately other pre-hospital resources such as the ambulance service, first responder schemes and other emergency response resources.</P>

    <P>Hostel accommodation is the main source of accommodation for homeless persons. The description &ldquo;hostel accommodation&rdquo; is a broad one and includes long-term, transitional or medium-term accommodation where people can stay for varying periods and over-night accommodation vacated every day although in some cases the same persons might come back nightly.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that there are approximately 900 bed places available for homeless people in hostels in the Dublin city area and they are usually all occupied. In addition to the availability of hostel accommodation, bed and breakfast accommodation is also used to accommodate homeless people, where necessary.</P>
    <P>The Government's recently published integrated strategy on homelessness has identified the need for a range of additional accommodation to be provided for homeless people. This would include emergency hostel accommodation, special high support hostel accommodation for persons with substance addictions, long-term sheltered accommodation for the long-term homeless and transitional accommodation for homeless people who are capable of moving towards independent living.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will continue to use the special £4 million capital allocation available annually from my Department to fund the purchase of suitable premises for use as move-on accommodation, whether medium-term or long-term, for homeless people who are long-term residents in hostels. An additional £20 million in capital funding will be provided over a five year <Col N="1773" /> period for the provision of additional sheltered accommodation to cater for the permanent accommodation needs of long-term homeless persons who are able to live semi-independently and local authorities will be encouraged to undertake the development of this additional accommodation as quickly as possible. In addition, the Government has also provided capital funding for the provision of two high support hostels for homeless persons in Dublin with drug or alcohol addictions. Voluntary bodies providing services for the homeless will continue to have access to capital funding under my Department's capital assistance scheme to provide suitable accommodation for homeless persons.</P>

      <Quest>the total number of staff employed in the planning departments of local authorities; the total number of vacancies, especially in regard to qualified planners; the steps being taken to fill these positions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[14687/00]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the responsibility of the management of each local authority to ensure that they have adequate staffing resources to discharge their statutory planning functions. The most recent survey of overall staffing levels in local authority planning departments, carried out by my Department, showed that the overall level of serving staff, both administrative and professional, in county councils and county borough corporations, had increased to 894.5 in September, 1999 compared with 753 in May, 1999 and 660.5 in June, 1998. The September 1999 figure comprised 391 professional staff, planners and others and 503.5 administrative staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While my Department does not compile on a systematic basis information on the number of vacancies in planning, or any other type of posts in the local authorities, a survey relating solely to professional planners carried out by my Department in March 2000 found that at that time there were 309 authorised permanent professional planner posts and 41 authorised temporary planner posts, a total of 350 posts for professional planners. Planning authorities reported that of the 350 posts referred to above, 100 permanent posts and seven temporary posts were vacant at that time. This would have arisen partly because of the large number of additional posts which have been sanctioned by my Department in response to requests from the planning authorities following my invitation to planning authorities to review the adequacy of their planning staff levels. During 1999, my Department sanctioned an additional 72 posts for professional planners, and a further 27 posts for professional planners have been approved to date in 2000. Many of the authorities surveyed reported diffi<Col N="1774" /> culties in recruiting professional planners. A significant limiting factor was the fact that there is a limited pool of professional planners available in the country and the local authorities must compete with the private sector consultancies. Several planning authorities have sought to address this problem by advertising vacancies in professional journals abroad and on the Internet.</P>
    <P>Ireland's only planning school is in University College Dublin and I have written to the President of UCD indicating that the expansion of the economy has made for a greatly increased workload on the planning system and there is evidence of a shortfall in the number of professional planners to meet present requirements. I outlined in that letter that the Planning and Development Bill and future EU requirements will confer further functions and place new obligations on planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála. I indicated that these developments will call for increased professional planning resources in this country and any increase in the number of planners qualifying would be welcomed.</P>
    <P>My Department has also been in contact with the School of Environmental Planning and Management at the Dublin Institute of Technology, Bolton Street, in relation to its plans to establish a part-time Masters programme in spatial planning and the up grading of the existing diploma in environmental resources management to a four-year honours degree with specialisms in spatial planning and environmental management. It is understood that the Dublin Institute of Technology plans to commence these courses in the next academic year. My Department has expressed its strong support for these initiatives. I have also been in contact with the Minister for Education and Science seeking his support in increasing the output of professional planners by the higher education sector.</P>

      <P>My Department does not lay down specific standards for construction of local authority housing other than a general requirement that the form of construction used should comply with the building regulations. These regulations set out the <Col N="1776" /> minimum legal requirements for building construction and apply equally to both private and local authority housing. The regulations do not place a restriction on the use of any particular method of construction or product, provided the performance requirements of the regulations are met, for example, in relation to thermal performance, structural stability, etc. It is a matter for building owners, designers and builders to ensure that their buildings comply with the regulations and to select the form of construction and product which best meets their needs in achieving this.</P>
      <P>In order to assist local authorities in relation to the provision of rented local authority housing, my Department issued new social housing design guidelines last year which highlight the specific design features, requirements and standards, that have from experience, been found to be particularly relevant in the provision of social housing.

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 101D of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as inserted by the Dublin Transport Authority (Dissolution) Act, 1987, empowers prescribed road authorities to issue directions to statutory undertakers, including telecommunications operators and others for the purposes of co-ordinating road openings and minimising traffic disruption. Under the Road Traffic (Co-ordination of Roadworks) Regulations, 1992, the Dublin local authorities are among those authorised to exercise these powers. I understand that Dublin Corporation is making extensive use of these powers through its directions for the control and management of roadworks in Dublin city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Development operations carried out by telecommunications companies on public spaces are subject to the requirements of the Telegraph Acts, 1863 to 1916. This provides that permission must be obtained from the person under whose control and management the land resides, normally the local authority. The erection of telecommunications masts is also covered by the <Col N="1777" /> same legislation, which clearly did not envisage the scale of development and range of technologies being utilised in today's liberalised market. In 1996, my Department issued guidelines for planning authorities on telecommunications antennae and support structures, the purpose of which was to assist planning authorities, An Bord Pleanála, operators of mobile telecommunications services and the general public by providing guidance on dealing with telecommunications masts and base stations within the planning system. I also understand that the Office of the Director of Telecommunications encourages the sharing of masts between communications operators, although agreement on sharing is a matter for commercial negotiation between companies.</P>
    <P>The Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill, 1999, which is currently before the Seanad, proposes to modernise legislation in this area and enhance local authority powers by obliging telecommunications operators to obtain the consent of the local authority before opening a road to lay underground telecommunications infrastructure. Under section 15 of the Bill, a local authority would be empowered to make its consent subject to conditions including reduction in the number of telecommunications related road openings by ensuring that road openings are co-ordinated, trenches are shared and spare ducts are laid for future use by other operators.</P>
    <P>The Bill simplifies the legislative and arbitration systems to enable the operators of fixed telecommunications networks to obtain rights of use over land for the purpose of constructing telecommunications infrastructure, where such infrastructure is essential for supply of telecommunications services  &ndash; mobile phone operators are not included in these provisions &ndash;  while maintaining an environment for development that is attractive to investment in telecommunications infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Beyond the above provisions, I have already recently indicated, in response to the Committee Stage debate on the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, that I would consider the need for a strengthening of legislation to control road openings.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I have asked the Dublin Transportation Office to assess, in consultation with local authorities in the DTO area, to what extent the approaches taken to the opening and reinstatement of roads and paths for the installation of telecommunications infrastructure could be better managed.</P>

      <P>Demand for housing generally is influenced by many factors, including demographic changes, economic growth, employment, levels of real personal disposable income and mortgage interest rates and, accordingly, it is not possible to quantify precisely the relative demand for housing for particular areas at a particular point in time.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 103 and 104 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A robust framework for the delivery of additional housing supply was put in place by the Government in 1998 with the publication of Action on House Prices in April of that year. The focus of Action on House Prices was on providing additional housing supply through a range of measures such as doubling the funding for the serviced land initiative from £15 million to £30 <Col N="1779" /> million. This was subsequently increased to £39 million later in 1998.</P>
    <P>A sum of £5 million was provided for specific non-national roads schemes in 1998 opening land for housing development. A capital gains tax rate of 20% was introduced as an incentive to developers to bring land quickly into residential development. These measures helped sustain the increases in housing output that have been achieved with a record 42,329 units built in 1998 and a further record level of output of 46,512 achieved in 1999.</P>
    <P>Output under the serviced land initiative is now expected to exceed the 100,000 units originally envisaged. The national development plan published in November last provides for massively increased investment in economic infrastructure such as roads, water, sewerage and public transport which is essential to support housing development in the period to 2006 and beyond.</P>
    <P>The Planning and Development Bill, 1999, which has now completed Committee Stage will require local authorities to prepare housing strategies dealing with the housing needs of all sectors of the population in their area, including those in need of social and affordable housing. Under the Bill, local authorities will be required by law to ensure that sufficient land is zoned to meet housing needs for the period of their development plan.</P>
    <P>The Department recently carried out a survey of local authorities on the extent of zoned residential land currently serviced or likely to be serviced within the next six years. The survey results are being finalised and the information requested will be compiled and forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110 and 111 together.</P>
      <P>The national development plan sets out a strategic framework for the development of physical infrastructure, including roads, public transport, water services, housing and health, over the period 2000 to 2006. This framework will be further elaborated in the economic and social infrastructure operational programme that is at present being drawn up under the plan.</P>
      <P>The programming of work under the plan along with the planning, design and implementation of individual infrastructural projects is the responsibility of various implementing agencies. These include Departments, local authorities, the National Roads Authority, in relation to national roads, and other public bodies. This detailed work is now well under way and every effort is being made to ensure the efficient and effective delivery of improved infrastructure throughout the country, including the implementation of the roads development programme provided for in the NDP. High level support for this process is being provided by the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructural Development.</P>

      <P>I introduced upgraded building regulations and related technical guidance in 1997 requiring that all new houses commencing on or after 1 July 1998 incorporate radon protection measures.</P>
      <P>Technical Guidance Document C - Site Preparation and Resistance to Moisture (1997 edition) gives guidance on protecting against radon in new dwellings and other long stay residential buildings and draws attention to the results of a national survey of radon in houses carried out by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. The institute has published a map incorporating the survey results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Technical guidance document C provides that all new houses in high radon areas should incorporate a radon proof membrane and a sump at <Col N="1782" /> foundation level. All other houses should incorporate a passive sump that can be activated post construction, if a radon survey warrants activation.</P>
    <P>Where works are carried out in accordance with the guidance in Technical guidance document C, this will, <i>prime facie</i>, indicate compliance with the building regulations. I am advised that the guidance on radon protection measures is adequate and has been welcomed by the RPII.</P>
    <P>Compliance with the building regulations is primarily the responsibility of designers, builders and owners of the new houses involved. The monitoring and enforcement of the regulations is a function of the local building control authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The cornerstone of the Government's housing strategy is to increase the supply of housing across all tenures including, in particular, social and affordable housing. I introduced a range of measures in Action on House Prices &ndash; April 1998 &ndash; and Action on the Housing Market &ndash; March 1999 &ndash; to accelerate the provision of additional housing supply and bring balance to the housing market. I have recently commissioned Peter Bacon and Associates, economic consultants, to undertake a general review of housing market developments since the introduction by the Government of these measures and to carry out an evaluation of recent developments in housing demand, housing supply and house prices. The review has been commenced and it is envisaged that it will be concluded by the end of May. I anticipate that the results of the review will be considered urgently by Government and then published together with an appropriate response.</P>
      <P>I have also established a housing supply unit in my Department to ensure urgent and effective delivery of the housing supply measures and to identify any additional measures that might be put in place to further increase housing supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to increased need, I have significantly expanded the local authority housing programme to provide 22,000 additional local authority house starts over a four year multi-annual programme, from 2000-03. The multi-annual nature of the programme will enable the more effective planning and implementation of local authority housing delivery. I am also committed to assisting the voluntary housing sector to increase output over the period of the national development plan to reach a level of 4,000 units of accommodation per year. Improvements to the terms <Col N="1783" /> and conditions of the voluntary housing schemes have been introduced on a number of occasions &ndash; most recently last October.</P>
    <P>The Government has allocated £6 billion to social and affordable housing in the national development plan, which will ensure that the social housing needs of over 90,000 households will be met with Government assistance over the plan period.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over and to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and to carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance. It is also available to certain people with disabilities and people who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
      <P>Time restrictions have been a feature of the free travel scheme since its inception. They do not, however, apply in the case of mentally handicapped people, people attending long-term rehabilitation courses or certain work experience programmes and certain other disabled or blind people. These people are issued with an unrestricted free travel pass, which enables them to travel during the normally restricted travel times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The central issue in regard to time restrictions relates to capacity constraints. Where restrictions apply it is at the request of the transport companies because the transport system is under severe pressure from commuters travelling to and from work and school in the morning and evening. <Col N="1784" /> There are no peak time travel restrictions on DART, suburban rail services, and on services provided by private transport operators in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>A review of the free schemes was recently published by the Policy Institute, Trinity College Dublin. The review notes that the demands for the easing of time restrictions are, without exception, based on the fact that people have difficulty attending hospitals for appointments that fall within the restricted peak times. The review recommends that the Department of Health and Children and the health boards should examine this problem with a view to introducing more convenient and flexible appointments for free travel pass holders. My Department will write to the organisations concerned bringing this recommendation to their attention.</P>

Following an examination of her case by a deciding officer it was established that she had sufficient contributions to qualify for unemployment benefit. In accordance with social welfare regulations, unemployment benefit claims are examined to establish if there has been a substantial loss of employment. The deciding officer determined that she had not suffered a substantial loss of employment and accordingly her claim was disallowed.</P>
      <P>The deciding officer disallowed her claim for unemployment assistance on the grounds that she was not available for or genuinely seeking employment.</P>

The code is intended to form the basis of a framework within which the NRA will be able to proceed with its programme of work while carrying out appropriate archaeological mitigation having regard to a set of principles and actions agreed by both parties. It is my intention that the code will make provision for appropriate levels of archaeological monitoring on all major road construction projects and that where sites are discovered as a result of such monitoring that they will be investigated having regard to the provisions of the National Monuments Acts, 1930-1994 and my published policy and guidelines on archaeological excavations. The code should also have the effect of streamlining the archaeological mitigation process so as to legitimately keep costs and delays to the NRA to a minimum. Good progress is being made on agreeing a code and it is hoped that the discussions can be concluded without delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department operates a grant scheme towards the cost of providing school textbooks for needy pupils in primary schools.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of these grants, a needy pupil is defined as a pupil from a family where there is genuine hardship because of unemployment, prolonged illness of a parent, large family size with inadequate means, single parenthood, or other family circumstances, such as substance abuse, which would indicate a similar degree of financial hardship.</P>
      <P>Principal teachers administer the book grant schemes in a flexible way, based on their knowledge of particular circumstances in individual cases.</P>
      <P>A consultancy report, which was submitted to my Department in 1993, dealt with the factors that contribute to the cost of school textbooks. The main conclusion of the report was that book rental schemes are the most practical way of limiting the cost of school textbooks to parents. In the circumstances, at primary level, schools that opt for book rental schemes are allocated enhanced grants in order to encourage schools to participate in such schemes.</P>
      <P>In 1999 £2.59 million was disbursed, at primary level, towards the cost of providing school textbooks for needy pupils. The allocation for this year has increased to £2.64 million and a circular has recently issued from my Department to all schools, inviting applications for assistance under the terms of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The rates of grant payable are reviewed on an annual basis. This review takes account of factors such as the increasing cost of school textbooks and the need for families to purchase more schoolbooks, should such arise. If the advent of the revised primary curriculum in schools results in additional demands being made on families for the purchase of school textbooks, this factor will be taken into account in the review of the levels of grant to be paid in future years.</P>
