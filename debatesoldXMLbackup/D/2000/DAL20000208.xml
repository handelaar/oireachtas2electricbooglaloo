      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report on the courts and the Judiciary is part of a wider series of recommendations for constitutional change made by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution. The Government has already implemented the recommendations made by the committee on recog<Col N="1382" /> nition of local government in the Constitution. Other recommendations, including those in these reports, will be addressed over time.</P>
    <P>Preparations for ratification by Ireland of the Statute of the International Criminal Court are in hands in the Department of Foreign Affairs. It is possible that a constitutional amendment will be required to enable ratification to proceed. A decision on this will be made on completion by that Department, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Office of the Attorney General of their consideration of this Article 128 statute, which is complex.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On 22 January <i>The Examiner</i> quoted the Taoiseach as pledging himself to hold a referendum on the issue of abortion. In respect of that pledge, which has not been refuted by his office, has a formula of words been discussed by the Cabinet or a sub-group of the Cabinet and, if so, when will the referendum be held?</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, has made repeated references to proposals for electoral reform. Has a formal memorandum for Government come before the Cabinet? Has such a memorandum been listed? If it has, does it contain a set of options as distinct from proposals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that the Government's Green Paper was referred to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution in September 1999 for consideration. Following that, advertisements were placed in the newspapers asking for submissions, and 105,000 communications have been received by the committee which is currently cataloguing the views. The committee is preparing a report which I understand it hopes to publish with recommendations. The committee has not given an expected completion date, but the Government looks forward to the committee's recommendations. As I have stated previously in the House, we do not intend to move ahead of the committee as this has been a divisive issue over the past 20 years and we must try to move away from a partisan atmosphere. The Government is going to wait to see what the committee will say on the matter.</P>
      <P>Regarding the newspaper article, I was asked if I believed a change could be made without reference to the people and I expressed the opinion that I did not believe this could be done. The people are asked to vote on Cabinet confidentiality, local government and various other issues. This is a major ethical, moral and religious issue and people will have to have their say. However, we are not yet at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the report which appeared on 22 January in <i>The Examiner</i> accurate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave the interview but never read the report. I understand the question I was asked was whether, if this matter was being referred to legislation, the people should have a <Col N="1383" /> say. The answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and that is reflected in the reply.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's second question, the Minister has had several discussions at Cabinet level on his proposals and views, but his memorandum to Cabinet will await the conclusions of the all-party committee on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure the Taoiseach has answered my questions &ndash; perhaps he did not hear them clearly. The report in <i>The Examiner</i> states that the Taoiseach pledged himself to a referendum on abortion. The options set out in the Green Paper did not universally indicate that a referendum would be desirable or necessary &ndash; other alternatives were raised. Is the report in <i>The Examiner</i> of 22 January accurate? Did the Taoiseach pledge himself to holding a referendum on abortion in advance of any decision made by the all-party committee? Has the Minister for the Environment and Local Government brought a formal memorandum to Government proposing&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's answer was clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not. I do not think the Taoiseach needs the help of the Minister for Defence who should concentrate on the White Paper. The Taoiseach's use of words is very precise. He said &ldquo;proposals&rdquo; and I wonder whether informal discussions and documentation are the same as a formal memorandum for Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will attempt to be very precise. The reply to the first question is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. The reply to the second question is that the Minister will not bring forward a memorandum until the all-party committee reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree there are two scenarios in which a referendum might be required, namely, for an amendment to the Constitution and for the referral of non-constitutional legislation to the people for their view prior to its final enactment? In so far as the Taoiseach is considering a referendum on abortion, is he only considering the constitutional amendment route or is he considering other possibilities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been on the record on this matter for a long time. I reiterate that I am promising no referendum until we deal with the all-party committee report. I take it the House understands that. The entire question of abortion, whatever way it is dealt with, is extremely sensitive and complicated. It is a complex issue affecting ethical, moral, social, medical and legal considerations and whatever, following the all-party committee's work, the Government's consideration of it and whether there are constitutional or legislative issues, the people should have some <Col N="1384" /> reference to it. I do not envisage a situation whereby it is not referred to the people. If legislation is the way to deal with the issue, it should still be referred to the people and that has been my view for a long time.</P>
      <P>The fact that the all-party committee, which sought views on the issue, received 105,000 submissions, some lengthy and others in the form of letters, demonstrates the level of interest and indicates that people were prepared to engage with such a committee. There are different views, but in the first instance we must follow the process in which we are engaged. The Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution must complete its work and I hope it can remove some of the divisive arguments relating to this issue. Then we must proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that one of the seven options put forward in the Government's Green Paper is the retention of the <i>status quo</i>, which would not require legislation or a constitutional amendment? Do I take it the Taoiseach is ruling out that option?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am ruling out no option. That is why I answered &ldquo;no&rdquo; to Deputy Quinn's original question. The all-party committee must complete its work first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree, with regard to the establishment of the international criminal court, it is one of the most important global developments in recent years? There will be a court to try war crimes regardless of where they may have been committed or by whom. How soon does he expect the work on this matter in the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General's office to be completed? Is it the case that a good portion of that legal work, which is currently under way, should have been done during the negotiation of this treaty given that it was obvious that any international criminal court would raise the issues which are being considered? Will the Taoiseach accelerate the matter given the importance of this in demonstrating Ireland's commitment to opposition to crimes against humanity and war crimes by whomever they may be committed, including those who win and lose wars?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>An amount of the legal work is already complete and I am advised that the Department of Foreign Affairs will shortly be in a position to submit a memorandum to Government for a formal decision on ratification. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General are trying to complete that work and other appropriate bodies are examining the statute also because it is complex. At this stage a referendum looks likely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá dhá cheist agam. An chéad ceann baineann sé leis an méid a duirt an Teachta Quinn agus an Teachta Bruton. Is the Taoiseach aware that in the 1992-93 parliamentary session, the New Zealand government held a non-binding multi-option preferendum on the issue of electoral reform? In the light of the many opinions circulating in the debate on abortion, would the Taoiseach consider it appropriate to examine the possibility of a non-binding multi-option vote prior to any binding two option referendum, which I am sure he will agree tends to be divisive? Has the Taoiseach considered the Supreme Court ruling that private property rights are superior to the Constitution's equality guarantees? Will he indicate whether that might arise as a constitutional matter in the future to be decided by the people, given the serious drawbacks it causes in determining employers' responsibility in relation to those with a disability? Is that matter being considered by the Taoiseach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any information on the second issue. I am not sure if it formed any of the consideration of the all-party committee or if it has been considered within the Departments. <Col N="1386" /> If the Deputy puts down a separate question, I will check that matter for him.</P>
      <P>On the abortion issue, my intention would be to try to avoid some of the mistakes or difficulties of the past and to do our utmost, within the all-party committee, to find a way forward. Any consideration that would help that should be discussed within the all-party committee. We will serve ourselves and the people far better if we try to find a way of dealing with this issue that has the support of the public in terms of the important issues involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two principal issues in the all-party report on the Judiciary and the courts. The first involves the proposal to establish a judicial council to review the conduct of judges as opposed to their decisions, and the second involves changing the impeachment procedures so that the procedures applying to judges should parallel those applying to the President. Is the Taoiseach in favour, in principle, of both of those proposals and will he accept there is a degree of urgency in getting these proposals in place in the light of events last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can honestly answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to both of those questions. I have asked the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, since the excellent report was published on 25 November, to examine this matter. The only aspect delaying its consideration is that it also wants to take into account the judicial committee's consideration of the sixth report on the courts commission and to bring those together, which the Deputy will agree would be a sensible way to go forward. In principle, however, I agree with the reasoned and logical argument that has been made.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>In regard to Questions Nos. 2, 4 and 6, when the abolition of ground rents was raised in the Dáil on many occasions, the Taoiseach referred to problems with the Constitution. Equally, when the control of outrageous profiteering in building land was raised, the Constitution was raised as an obstacle. In the interest of relinquishing the last vestiges of old landlordism in the case of ground rent, and in the interest of those who are priced out of a home by greed, will the Taoiseach introduce an amendment in the year 2000 to write into the Constitution the welfare of the vast majority of people before the right of the profiteer and the speculator, even though, admittedly, that section has lavishly financed Fianna Fáil in the past?</P>

      <P>The Secretary General of my Department, Paddy Teahon, is due to retire on 30 April 2000. The Government, at its meeting on 25 January 2000, appointed Mr. Dermot Gallagher, Second Secretary General, Department of Foreign Affairs, to succeed Mr. Teahon as Secretary General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the post of Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach does not come within the remit of the top level appointments committee, the Government asked that senior officers across the Civil Service should be offered <Col N="1388" /> the opportunity to express an interest in being considered for the post and the posts of Secretary General to the Government and of the Department of Finance. This was done by letter from the Secretary General, public service management and development, in November.</P>
    <P>A group consisting of the outgoing Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach, the then Secretary General to the Government and the Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the latter two of whom are members of TLAC, considered the officers who expressed an interest in being considered together with, at the Government's request, the officers across the Civil Service with the requisite experience and track record. Their recommendation to me, which on my proposal the Government approved on 25 January, is that Mr. Dermot Gallagher be appointed Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach from 1 May 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 8 to 10, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A working group on the implementation of the recommendations of the Nally group report commenced work in November 1999. The group comprises representatives from the Office of the DPP, the Department of Finance, the Office of the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor's office. It is considering the staffing levels and structures necessary in an enhanced prosecution service. Considerable progress has been made but I am not yet in a position to set out any new arrangements. The staffing and grading issues in <Col N="1389" /> the Chief State Solicitor's office are being considered in parallel with proposals for the staffing and grading of the new office of solicitor to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>Regular discussions with staff side representatives have taken place and are continuing both in relation to internal CSSO matters and on the implications of the Nally group recommendations. I understand steps have been taken by the CSSO to address the workload problems in some sections. The numbers at recruitment level in professional and technical grades have been increased by five over the past six months. Furthermore, additional promotional posts have been created to provide a more attractive career structure for new staff. Counsel are being engaged on some larger cases to prepare books of evidence.</P>
    <P>The industrial action is creating general inconvenience and is slowing down the preparation of cases for court. Negotiations between the law offices, the Department of Finance and IMPACT are taking place in order to achieve a settlement of the dispute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the Taoiseach's attention to a report which was carried in the newspapers on 4 February, subsequent to my tabling this question and the preparation of the official reply. Bearing in mind the announcement today in the new social partnership programme, is it not necessary to benchmark certain types of Civil Service activities?</P>
      <P>There is, as Deputy Rabbitte suggested at the Committee of Public Accounts, a need to take the CSSO out of the mainstream Civil Service and to establish it with greater autonomy, analogous to that of the National Treasury Management Agency. Mr. Michael Buckley, the retiring Chief State Solicitor, has indicated that the office simply cannot get the staff it requires. Does the Taoiseach agree that failure to do so endangers the liberties of citizens, as in the case of Nora Wall, and makes the State liable to subsequent litigation for compensation, the costs of which are far in excess of anything related to the funding of the CSSO? Has consideration been given to the idea of giving a greater degree of operational autonomy to the CSSO analogous to that of the National Treasury Management Agency? If so, would the Taoiseach be disposed to such a course of action and when does he expect a response from the Departments of Finance and Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his Department which are the three Departments directly involved? There is a crisis and the Taoiseach is in a position to solve it. Does he agree he has the model which would enable him to solve it quickly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of questions posed. The Nally committee was established to examine all aspects of how the legal arms of the State work. It built on the Deloitte &amp; Touche report in 1997 commissioned during the term of <Col N="1390" /> the then Attorney General, Mr. Dermot Gleeson, which examined similar issues. A number of changes were made at the time, 29 additional staff were recruited and 14 additional senior posts were conceded across the professional and technical grades.</P>
      <P>The Nally commission made recommendations similar to the Deputy's suggestion. One of its recommendations was that responsibility for the Chief State Solicitor should be transferred in its entirety from the Attorney General to the Director of Public Prosecutions with legislative provision to enable the DPP to delegate powers. The Government has accepted that recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>By delegate, does the Taoiseach mean to contract out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It also means that the office is responsible to the DPP and that he has legislative authority&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. It is one of the recommendations of the Nally committee.</P>
      <P>The industrial dispute is causing problems and the issue of staffing levels and the negotiations on staffing issues are to be dealt with simultaneously. I am familiar with the problem of recruiting staff because I examined the figures for this matter last week. At present, no assistant solicitor in a recruitment grade in the office has more than two and a half years' experience. Everyone in the office for two years is effectively promoted and the first promotional grade for young solicitors has a salary from £31,000 to almost £39,000, which we in the House would say is not too bad for such young people. That is not the whole picture. Having been in that position for two years, which means they would be less than five years in the service, they are headhunted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Having been trained by us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, precisely, and it is happening to a greater degree. It is not a question of the rates of pay, something I thought might be the case. I thought they were too low at the introductory level, but that is not the case. In addition to what happened in 1997 and 1998, more promotional posts were created and there were more appointments to the technical grades but it has not resolved the position as there is still an outflow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the work rate is very tough and that issues such as Army deafness claims have placed enormous strains and pressures on the office in recent years. That, on top of all the <Col N="1391" /> other work, creates pressure and the Attorney General, the Department of Finance and my officials are working on this with IMPACT in the context of the implementation of the Nally report. A great deal of work went into the review, it is believed to be the way forward and the Attorney General has been supportive of it, as was the previous Attorney General. More reform will be necessary, particularly in the criminal section of the office where there is quite a large staff. There are approximately 230 staff in the CSSO and the majority of these are in the criminal section. That will also have to change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the same newspaper, <i>The Irish Times, </i>of 4 February, carries the story that due to a lack of co-ordination the taxpayer has had to pay £500,000 &ndash; £800,000 more than was anticipated &ndash; will the Taoiseach consider using the NTMA model for the CSSO? This might provide flexibility in hiring staff with the requisite experience and skill while the effect of tricking about with grades and so on will filter into the rest of the Civil Service system. Just as we had a problem at the end of the last decade with the management of the national debt we now have a serious problem with the management of the State's legal obligations. Conventional Civil Service structures and staffing norms will not suffice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In a period of little more than two years there have been two major studies of this problem, neither of which made that recommendation. The studies made a series of recommendations which need to be implemented. I do not wish to go off on another tangent. We should implement the recommendations of the eminent people who have studied the problem. The outgoing Chief State Solicitor, the Director of Public Prosecutions, and the previous Director of Public Prosecutions and Attorney General all believe these recommendations would make a substantial difference although they may not solve the staffing problems. The salaries staff can command in the private sector after a relatively short time working in a busy State office are quite high. They would not consider them high for the work they are doing and that is what is under negotiation. All the recommendations of the Deloitte &amp; Touche report have been implemented. We must now implement the recommendations of the Nally report which have been accepted and see where we go from there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Government accept the subordination of the Chief State Solicitor's office to the DPP's office, given that the Chief State Solicitor is a servant of the State while the DPP holds an office independent of the State? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The belief was that this was a far better way of co-ordinating the caseload. The lack of co-ordination referred to by Deputy <Col N="1392" /> Quinn was being created by the Director of Public Prosecutions not having total control over the staff. At a previous Question Time we discussed the proposal that the CSSO should form a unit of the office of the DPP and be headed by a solicitor who would be answerable to the DPP. That case was put forward in the report and it was the unanimous finding of the committee. Because the criminal section of the CSSO works, by and large, for the DPP it was felt that it would be more effective if it were answerable to the DPP through a solicitor. That is why we accepted that recommendation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that a real problem is created by secretarial staff leaving the CSSO because they are being offered salaries higher that those being paid to solicitors within the CSSO?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that. I can tell the Deputy the salary of a law clerk, which is a recruitment grade. Is the Deputy referring to law clerks or to clerical grades?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The salaries for clerical grades go from £17,700 to £22,000. The salaries for solicitors go from just under £31,000 to £38,500. The problem seems to be on the solicitor grade side rather than on the side of the clerical or technical grades, even though there has been a high turnover of staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree there is a problem in retaining quality staff in the public sector, not just in individual offices such as this where one could adopt the NTMA approach but in all Departments when they see the salaries that can be made outside, and that there is a need for a systemic rather than an <i>ad hoc </i>solution to deal with borrowing or legal services? A person appointed Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach, for example, might be able, if he or she is worth his or her salt, to command twice that salary working outside. It is also extremely difficult to get people to go into politics in view of the comparison &ndash; to give a concrete example &ndash; between what a solicitor and the Minister for Foreign Affairs can make. Talent can be applied in different ways. This is a real problem in the public service generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no one left in the recruitment grades after two years; they are all in the higher grades. The Deputy is correct. Through some magnificent ways people on the outside know who the good ones are in the important clerical grades and they are increasingly being head-hunted and offered much higher salaries. It has become common practice for them to be offered between £5,000 and £10,000 more than can be offered under existing structures. The same applies to those who operate the technology. Deputy Bruton cited one example in the higher grades, but there are many others. This presents a difficulty. Staff are also being head-hunted at an enormous rate in the private sector. Some of the deals done in the financial sector in the past year or so have been highlighted in the media and the figures involved are mind-boggling. Individuals can command such salaries in a good marketplace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that one of the reasons there are problems with the probity of public administration in many eastern European countries is that the civil servants who make important decisions are paid half nothing while there are large amounts of money to be made outside with the result that there is either rapid turnover or corruption? We need to be very careful to ensure salaries are adequate for the responsibilities undertaken, otherwise there will be problems given that original sin has not been abolished.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet Sub-committee on Infrastructural Development and Public Private Partnership, which I chair, includes the Tánaiste, the Ministers for Finance, Public Enterprise, Environment and Local Government, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General. The general purpose of the sub-committee is to oversee the delivery of key infrastructure in the context of the national development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cabinet sub-committee is assisted by a cross-departmental team drawn from the Departments involved. The terms of reference of the team are to develop and oversee the implementation of a framework for action and, in particular, to bring forward proposals to deal with planning approval issues to reduce delays in infrastructure delivery. These could include proposals for legislative and constitutional change; support for the development and implementation <Col N="1395" /> of public private partnerships; and support for the ongoing work of the Cabinet committee.</P>
    <P>The Cabinet sub-committee has held meetings with CIE and the National Roads Authority to discuss the two agencies' plans to ensure the timely delivery of the priority objectives in the national development plan. The committee will consider the recommendations of the cross-departmental team on statutory approval and legal issues at its next meeting. To date, the Cabinet sub-committee has met five times including its last meeting on 1 February.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. I understand that since this question was previously answered on 30 November, the sub-committee has met on two additional occasions. In that initial reply and in today's reply, the Taoiseach stated that the Cabinet sub-committee, which comprises seven people, including the Attorney General and almost half the Cabinet, is supported by a cross-departmental team. Does the Taoiseach have details of the composition of that team? Has he taken steps to ensure the over-runs which characterised the previous national development plan will not occur during the course of the current plan? If so, what are they?</P>

Some of the issues are administrative, <Col N="1396" /> many are legislative and none of them is constitutional. I stated previously that we might need to consider how particular matters would be dealt with in the courts and how compulsory purchase orders and planning development issues would be tackled. A memorandum will be forthcoming to Government on these matters next week or the following one. We can learn from what happened in the past five or six years in regard to the issues which resulted in planning delays.</P>

      <P>The private sector is closely involved. About two years ago IBEC produced a report on public private partnerships. The Cabinet committee is dealing directly with IBEC which has a public partnership committee. A number of people are interested in the projects. The Department of Finance has also set up a public private partnership section. A conference on public private partnership was held in Dublin Castle. There is great interaction between the public and private sectors. Areas of interest to the private sector have also been identified. I am hopeful the private sector will take up a number of the projects because there is considerable scope in them.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise a matter previously referred to by Deputy Quinn. The National Roads Authority is not really an authority. As far as roads are concerned, local authorities have the real authority. There is a multiplicity of local authorities on any given route which leads to constant procedural and planning delays. As a result, it is difficult to have the predictability and speed of delivery which attracts private money. Legislation is required to change this so the full potential of PPPs is achieved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That issue has been discussed at some length. Subject to correction, we have been advised that legislation can be changed to give the NRA the power to deal across local authority areas. It will be possible to deal with a project in one piece. Breaking roads into small sections will not attract funds. A legislative change would allow the NRA power across local authority boundaries to deal with a project as one contract and that would cut down on administration and legal objections.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach referred to a report recently obtained by the committee and two specific issues have been discussed by a number of people, including the Attorney General. The first is to give effect to the commitment to have a motorway or dual carriage between Dublin, Limerick and Cork &ndash; the N8 and the N7, if my references are correct. At present this would require six or seven separate hearings as each section of that new motorway would go through different local authority or administrative areas.

The second issue was highlighted by a number of people and taken up subsequently by the Attorney General in a reported speech attributed to him &ndash; the desirability for a dedicated section of the High Court to deal with citizens' legitimate objections to proposed developments, as in the case of the two year delay in the completion of the C-ring around Dublin city. Are there administrative or legislative provisions for a specially designated court to fast track legitimate objections to any infrastructural proposals such as eminent domains, CPOs etc.?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The implementation of performance management systems is one of the wide range of objectives of the strategic management initiative. In July 1999 the Taoiseach announced the extension of the strategic management initiative on the modernisation of the Civil Service to the wider public service, including the wider education sector. A core objective of the SMI is the provision of improved service delivery through ongoing improvements in performance management systems.</P>
      <P>Management performance systems are concerned with the totality of performance. The distinguishing features of such systems are greater role clarity, the setting of objectives and related performance targets, development of individual competencies and the monitoring of progress. A considerable amount of progress has been made by my Department in developing the basis for school performance management systems for primary and second level schools. Systems are being developed in partnership with school management, teachers and parents which will facilitate the setting of objectives, attainment of targets and the provision of a better service to parents and pupils.</P>
      <P>The systems are contained in the school development planning initiative. This initiative provides that every school will partake in a school development planning process involving a school plan dealing with total curriculum and the organisation of all the school's resources, including staff, space, facilities, equipment, time and finance. It will also include the school's policies on a diverse range of administrative and organisational issues. In accordance with the Education Act, 1998, it will set down the objectives of the school relating to equality of access to and participation in the school and the measures which the school proposes to take to achieve those objectives.   </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school plan is a collaborative process and its preparation must, therefore, involve consul<Col N="1399" /> tation with all the partners, including parents. Over the period of the plan, it will be subject to ongoing review internally and at the end of the period it will be evaluated in relation to the extent to which the objectives it set out have been achieved. External evaluation of school plans will be undertaken by the Department in a number of schools each year. This model of school planning, which has the support of all the stakeholders, will provide a practical and realistic system of performance management in schools and will deliver an informative and meaningful evaluation of the school's performance.</P>

      <P>There have been a number of developments in relation to music education since the preparation of the PIANO report. The revision of the primary curriculum under the aegis of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment &ndash; NCCA &ndash; was completed last summer. The revised curriculum and guidelines were issued to all teachers last autumn. The revised curriculum incorporates a subject-block entitled Arts Education. This comprises visual arts, drama and music. It is recommended that this area of education should be allotted at least three hours per week in the curriculum of all primary schools.</P>
      <P>In common with the other subject areas, the documents on music education consist of two booklets, a curriculum statement, incorporating the aims and content objectives for each class level and guidelines for teachers on the teaching of the subject. All primary teachers have been given an overview of the revised curriculum through attending a total of over 500 two-day seminars with specially trained tutors throughout the country during the first half of this school year. In-career professional development in music education will form part of the ongoing primary curriculum support programme at a later date. Schools may introduce the revised programmes in the various subject areas as they see fit, taking account of the particular interests and expertise of their staff. In general, the expectation is that schools will implement the revised programme in a particular subject in the school year following its inclusion in the in-career development programme.  </P>
      <P>The PIANO report proposed the splitting of leaving certificate music into two subjects. The NCCA , in devising the new leaving certificate music syllabus, considered a range of options and concluded that the appropriate approach to adopt was the integration of the three aspects of music, listening, composing and performing. The history and criticism of music are taught as integral aspects of the subject. This new syllabus was introduced in September 1997 and examined for the first time last year. The number of candidates taking music at leaving certificate has increased from 1,322 in 1996 to 2,995 in 1999.</P>

      <P>I join Deputy Bruton in wishing the Minister success in his new appointment. My question was much simpler than the one the Minister answered. It is the classic strategy of answering another question entirely. I did not ask about changes in the curriculum. I asked where the Government stands in relation to the implementation of the Piano report. This simple question requires a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer.</P>
      <P>The report produced a map which showed that if one drew a line from Drogheda to Limerick there was no provision for music education to the left of that line. Since Dr. O'Connor produced the report, that map was published and the line was drawn, the absence of provision for music education on the left of that line remains the same. However, £35 million has been allocated for a performing arts academy. I am not against the academy, but where does the Government stand on the Piano report? Does the decision of 27 January have implications for the implementation of the report?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, last December the Government decided to establish an academy for the performing arts based on the report from Dr. Renshaw. The establishment of the planning and steering group was announced on 27 January to develop, advise on, facilitate and monitor the process of establishing the proposed academy. The group will be chaired by Dr. O'Hare. From that point of view, the Government has taken decisive action. I also mentioned the steps which are being taken.</P>

The answer to that is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;. A decision has either been taken by the Cabinet to implement it or the Government has announced a project of £35 million without stating whether it is in the context of providing music education. This cannot be done, unless it is regarded as a type of &ldquo;super stroke&rdquo;. Will the Piano report on music education be implemented? Does the large capital investment have anything to do with a decision of either of the Ministers, both of them or the whole Cabinet? The facts as Dr. O'Connor reported them are of scandalous underprovision, particularly in the area I mentioned. Has the Government decided to implement the report?</P>

      <P>I have already expressed my deep interest in the issue of literacy and I am determined to take steps to raise the standard of literacy in primary schools. The first ever national initiative to improve reading standards generally was launched recently and I will make every effort to ensure it is a complete success.</P>
      <P>I am arranging that all primary classes from first to sixth will be supplied with standardised norm-referenced tests of literacy. In addition, teachers will be provided with profiles of pupil achievements in English to complement the standardised tests. It is intended that teachers from first to sixth classes will administer these tests each year. However, prior to any implementation of this proposal, it is my intention to hold discussions with the teaching profession.</P>
      <P>Through the use of these norm-referenced, standardised tests each school will be able to compare its own results to national norms. Schools will plan and set improvement targets to be achieved within a stated timeframe. This should increase the number of pupils who function in the higher achievement bands and reduce the number of pupils who function at a low level or who exhibit reading difficulties. The use of profiling will be of particular benefit in this latter area.</P>
      <P>National assessments of reading have been carried out in Ireland for 25 years. Plans are being drawn up by my Department and the Educational Research Centre for a programme of regular surveys of different curricular areas, including surveys of English reading. These will be carried out at two levels in primary school, third and fifth classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is ample evidence from the national reading surveys in English and from our partici<Col N="1403" /> pation in international literacy surveys that about 10% of Irish pupils have serious literacy problems. We also know that students at the nine year old and 14 year old levels function just above the international average. The results obtained by pupils in national and international reading surveys can be used as a benchmark against which future progress can be measured.</P>
    <P>My target is to reduce significantly the number with serious literacy problems and to improve our international position relative to other countries. The national reading initiative will help to give momentum to this effort. It has already been launched and activities to meet its objectives are being planned.</P>

The national reading initiative, which was launched on 21 January, is directed at that objective. I will pursue the different aspects of the matter with vigour because I regard it as a priority.</P>

      <P>At present, my Department collects statistics on the number of pupils with special needs attending special schools and special classes attached to mainstream primary schools. However, information on special needs pupils attending mainstream schools on a fully integrated basis is not specifically collected.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently planning to extend the range of data gathered on special needs pupils as part of the development of a comprehensive database on individual pupils. The objective is to develop a database which will provide critical information on all pupils, including those with special needs, to support the development and implementation of policy.</P>
      <P>A total of £4.5 million is being provided to develop this database over the next three years. This includes £500,000 which is being provided in the current year. The IT unit of my Department is currently preparing a development plan for the database project and it is intended to implement the first phase in a pilot group of schools during the coming school year. It is anticipated that the project will use the latest Internet-based technologies to facilitate the convenient transfer of data to my Department from schools.</P>
      <P>Also, arising from a Government decision of October 1998, all children assessed as having special educational needs within the primary system now have an automatic entitlement to special support services. Already, as a result of this development, my Department has allocated an additional 225 resource teachers and 642 child care assistants to support children with special needs in the primary system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All primary schools have been advised of this development and of the procedures to be fol<Col N="1405" /> lowed in seeking support for special needs pupils. My Department is responding to requests for support on an ongoing basis and will continue to make relevant resources available to support such pupils. This process is already providing significant and valuable data on the prevalence of special needs within the primary system. The database which is now being planned will facilitate the development of a more detailed and comprehensive picture of the level of special needs within the system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that given how critical early intervention is in identifying special needs and in ensuring the best outcome for the pupils, something beyond a pilot scheme is appropriate? A complete survey based on, for example, a statistically based sampling plan should be introduced as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the development is to have a continuing information system and that does not exist, so it is being installed at present. It will provide the kind of multi-faceted information that is necessary to fully understand the needs involved, particularly where children are integrated into mainstream schools; there is very little information on this available centrally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is wide recognition that problems such as ADD in particular, even on anecdotal evidence, is clearly on the increase. Surely a pilot scheme is not adequate in the circumstances and the situation should be reviewed on a school by school basis, or, if necessary, on a pupil by pupil basis. Professionals and a professional backup service should be put in place to identify the pupils in every school where these needs arise.</P>

There have been difficulties in getting people available. As I said, 642 child care assistants and 225 resource teachers were provided, but statistical information is a separate issue. Care is being provided, but statistical information will be gathered on an ongoing basis as quickly as possible. Obviously it is important to extend that as fast as we can.</P>

      <P>The report by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science on school transport in Ireland was received in my Department last November. The report deals with a broad range of transport issues and contains many recommendations for changes to the school transport system. The report was referred to the school transport section in my Department for a full assessment, including costing, of the various recommendations. This assessment is being carried out at present in consultation with Bus Éireann, who operate the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department. As soon as the assessment is completed I will give serious consideration to the recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister of State is to give serious consideration to the recommendations. In light of a recent court case in Mayo where a bus driver was transporting schoolchildren without a licence or insurance, will the Minister of State implement the report recommendation which calls for private operators to come under the safety standards in place for current operators in the school transport scheme?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is under consideration. Some of the recommendations require extra finance to implement, while some are cost-neutral. I have given the Department a directive to go ahead and implement whatever recommendations are cost-neutral in as far as it can. Some of them cannot be implemented in the precise format suggested in the report, but we are considering the matter.

Does he find it acceptable that there is a double standard for the transportation of schoolchildren &ndash; one for private operators outside the scheme and one for private operators within the scheme? Does he believe it is acceptable that children are being transported without insurance or proper standards being in place?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not condone any operator who would seek to transport schoolchildren without insurance. The Deputy must understand that a minuscule percentage of schoolchildren are being transported by private operators outside the school transport system. It is a tiny minority. The school transport system involves Bus Éireann and private contractors employed by Bus Éireann, but there is also a third category. Is that the one to which the Deputy is referring?</P>

      <P>I am told there are very few of them. I do not have the exact figure, but I can send it to the Deputy. I am told that a tiny percentage of children are being transported outside the system. As far as I understand, we only have responsibility for children transported by Bus Éireann and by private contractors employed by Bus Éireann. Those are the children in the school transport system for whom I have responsibility. We took legal advice on this matter recently in a different context and that advice was that our inspectors can be prevented from boarding buses outside the system, so obviously there is a difficulty there. We only have a responsibility for the system operated by Bus Éireann and by private contractors employed by Bus Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I would concur fully with the Minister of State's points, except for the fact that there is a growing number of private operators. For example, pupils are coming to the Athlone post-primary sector from areas ranging from Roscommon to Ballinasloe. This is a growing issue. Does the Minister of State accept that he, as the Minister with responsibility for school transport, has a role to play in relation to children being transported outside the current school transport scheme? Does he accept that there is a need for urgent change in the legislation so that we do not have a repeat of the incident in Mayo?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy Naughten. I think the number is quite small and I have no evidence that it has grown in recent times. Also, people who employ bus operators outside the normal school transport system do so of their own volition. It is a private arrangement between them and the contractor. For one reason or other they have decided not to avail of the school transport system and enter into a private contract. It is difficult for any Minister to interfere in private contracts between parents and transport operators. I take the Deputy's point about responsibility. Legally I do not think we have any responsibility. On legal or constitutional grounds I do not think I can give myself any responsibility; if I can, I will. Deputy Naughten made a number of references to a particular court case, which was widely reported, where the defendant was dealt with by the judge. It is appalling that the opportunity to ask questions about the school transport system should be used to make a petty political point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In November 1998 my predecessor announced a major initiative for integrated education for children with special needs. This initiative provided the first ever automatic supports for many children with disabilities. The measures involved are aimed at ensuring that all children with a special educational need, irrespective of their location or disability, will receive the support they require to participate fully in the education system.</P>
      <P>The measures extend right across the entire spectrum of special needs and deliver extra teaching and child care services to special needs children, whether in groups or in individual isolated settings. The key measures in the initiative include: the introduction of a formalised system of special teaching support for all children attending school on a fully integrated basis who have been assessed as having special educational needs; the introduction of a formalised system of child care support for all children with special needs, including those in special schools, special classes and ordinary schools, who have been assessed as requiring such support.</P>
      <P>The level of response in each case has regard to the number of children and the severity of the disabilities involved. Where a group of special needs children attend an ordinary school or adjacent schools, the support may take the form of full-time resource or child care posts, or both. Where individual or small groups of children are involved, the support may take the form of part-time teaching hours or part-time child care support, or both. The level of support has regard to the number of children and their particular assessed needs.</P>
      <P>My Department provides grant-aid to schools for the purchase of educational aids, such as computers, for children with special needs. Since 1998 a special fund of £250,000 has been allocated annually to provide assistance to schools in catering for the information and communication technology needs of individual special needs pupils, including those who are fully integrated into ordinary classes.</P>

The purpose of the scheme is to provide such pupils with equipment of direct educational benefit to them. Computer equipment and software are items that may be provided. Under the terms of the scheme the school authorities make an application in respect of an individual pupil. The equipment remains the property of the school.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept there is a difference between the theory, the aspirational nature, and what happens in practice? Certainly, there is not an automatic entitlement to supports in practice. Is the Minister aware that many schools have an intolerable burden placed on them due to the lack of supports available from his Department? For example, a school which has two or three children with Down's syndrome has had to fight a battle over the past four or five months to get support. Has the Department a clear position in relation to entitlement to child care assistants for each child in a separate class with special needs?</P>

      <P>&mdash;and what it is doing and it is being developed fairly rapidly. The Government decided in October 1998 that all special needs children in the primary system should have an automatic entitlement to support services to meet their needs. Since this decision there has been a major growth in the demand for resource teachers and child care assistant support. We are responding to this demand on an ongoing basis. The impact of the Government's decision can be seen from the fact that the number of resource teachers in the primary system has grown from 104 to 309 in that period and the number of child care assistants has grown from 295 to 937. It is clear a great deal of progress is being made in this area and will continue to be made.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to a recent study which indicated that an average of 3,000 school pupils are on suspension on any one day; if this is an accurate figure; and the steps, if any, he is taking to tackle this serious problem.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much aware of the issue of suspension from school which is related to that of early school leaving. This is a complex and difficult area and in order to make progress we must tackle the problem on a number of fronts.</P>
      <P>My Department has in place a range of guidelines on school discipline which stress the need to regard both suspension and expulsion as sanctions of last resort. More recently the Education Act made provision for new appeal procedures in order to address grievances in this area and my Department is working on the implementation of these at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department gives assistance in securing school placements for pupils out of school. This generally arises where a pupil has been suspended as a result of disruptive behaviour and <Col N="1411" /> where alternative arrangements need to be made. My Department liaises with school authorities with a view to having the pupils back in full-time education as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>As matters stand there are no formalised reporting arrangements covering suspensions and this makes it difficult to estimate the full extent of the problem with any precision. This deficiency will be addressed in the Education (Welfare) Bill, 1999, which is currently before the House. This Bill provides for a comprehensive range of measures to address the problem of non-school attendance. Among the key objectives is the establishment of a single national authority with responsibility to co-ordinate action in relation to school attendance on a countrywide basis. The focus of the national authority will be the provision of assistance and support, through locally based educational welfare officers, to schools and families rather than on penalties for non-attendance at school. The Bill also includes specific measures for the early identification and support of children at risk of dropping out of the school system.</P>
    <P>However legislative solutions are not in themselves enough and it is vitally important that we also have in place strategies to encourage and support schools in retaining pupils to completion of senior cycle. That is the reason the Government's recent &ldquo;stay in school&rdquo; initiative was introduced.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>It is designed to focus resources on schools where the problem of drop out is most acute. At the core of this new strategy is the empowerment of schools to participate in framing plans for addressing this problem.</P>
    <P>This issue is not a simple one and in order to have a real chance of success the solution must be wide-ranging and include strategies for identification, balancing of rights, statutory safeguards and school empowerment. That is why the stay in school initiative was introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The programme for Government identified as a key priority the establishment of a Dublin centre for the performing arts, incorporating a conservatoire. The establishment of a planning and steering group to plan for the development of the Academy of the Performing Arts was announced by my predecessor on 27 January. The planning group will develop, advise on, facilitate and monitor the process of establishing the proposed academy. The group will be chaired by Dr. Danny O'Hare, former President of Dublin City University.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The planning and steering group includes representation from my Department, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, the Department of Finance, the Higher Education Authority, third level institutions, the <Col N="1414" /> Arts Council and bodies providing professional education and training in music, dance and drama. As part of its work the group will consult widely with interested parties. The proposals on the academy are derived from the recommendations in a report prepared by Dr. Peter Renshaw, Head of Research and Development, Guildhall School of Music and Drama, London. Dr. Renshaw consulted widely with a range of interests involved in broadcasting, drama, music, dance, education and the arts in general.</P>
    <P>In section 6 of his report, Dr. Renshaw indicates that the nodal model approach proposed for the academy ameliorates the need to rationalise existing courses or to amalgamate particular organisations. The planning and steering group is to make proposals about the longer term possibility of transferring elements of other educational bodies in the fields of music and drama to the academy and the facilities required and of incorporating other disciplines to make it a fully multi-disciplinary institution. Dr. Renshaw also indicated in his report that one of the strongest features of the academy would be the opportunity to act as a catalyst for the continuing professional development of artists, teachers and arts managers throughout the whole of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The capital estimate of £35 million for the academy was prepared by my Department on the basis of a feasibility study prepared by consultants and its experience of capital building costs. One of the tasks of the planning and steering group, with the assistance of sub-groups or individuals as appropriate, will be to make proposals regarding the legal base for the establishment of the academy and the appointment of a governing authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What consultations took place with the Dublin Institute of Technology, and in so far as it has responsibility for the municipal school of music and the conservatoire of music and drama, will it be represented on any steering group? The Minister referred to the multi-nodal nature of the proposal. Does this mean the academy will be located only in the venues mentioned by his predecessor, Deputy Martin, and his colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands? If it is located in only Dublin and Limerick, how will it be multi-nodal? Is the Minister happy to neglect an area north of the line from Drogheda to Limerick? I would like a written reply from him on this. What about places where chairs of music exist, such as at UCG, which have not been funded? Is it the intention that these will migrate to the new academy? What about the areas that have nothing?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a national body based in Dublin. That was what was put to the people prior to the last general election. The idea at this stage is to incorporate a headquarters and significant facilities on a site to be provided on the DCU campus, to have a Limerick campus developing the existing Irish World Music Centre at the University of Limerick and to have an undergraduate professional dance facility based at the Firkin Crane Dance Development Agency in Cork. If the Deputy can propose a venue in Galway I will ask the steering committee to consider it. I will also bear in mind his remarks on Galway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Minister's offer to consider a location in Galway. In a proposal to establish a national performing arts centre, one would assume there would be one centre. However, given the reference to nodal points and to Dublin, Limerick and Cork, some people may feel excluded. Usually the imaginary area, referred to by Deputy Higgins, is located north of the line from Dublin to Galway, but this proposal does not even incorporate Galway. If there is to be a regional spread it should incorporate all parts of the island.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister accept arts activities in Northern Ireland are very strong? Will he accept that the arts Bill in Northern Ireland is very strong and that places like Donegal have made submissions to the Department on cross-Border development and co-operation in music, performance and other arts between Donegal and Derry, for example?</P>

The Dublin Institute of Technology is on the list of those which were consulted.</P>
      <P>I have noted what has been said about Donegal in terms of spread and involvement. I am very familiar with Donegal and while I was talking about Galway I was thinking about Donegal as well. I will examine the issue as it is important that development is as inclusive as possible.</P>

I therefore join the leader of Fine Gael in wishing both Governments every success in their efforts to ensure the IRA and Sinn Féin can make the sort of movements which seem necessary to avoid a suspension of the institutions. Will the Taoiseach make arrangements for a comprehensive debate at the appropriate time next week if the IRA does not make the sort of response which now seems absolutely necessary?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the leaders of the Opposition for their support in this matter. I had hoped it would have been possible to have a debate in the House this week, but unfortunately we are not at that stage. There has been an intensity of debate all weekend, but a conclusion has not been reached which would allow me to make substantive comment. My officials have kept the Leaders of the Opposition informed.</P>
      <P>I will restate two or three things in relation to what Deputies have raised. The House has consistently said that the Good Friday Agreement must be implemented in all aspects and that includes the issue of decommissioning. All of us have said that with one voice. I assure the House that intensive discussions are ongoing. If movement is possible, and I believe it should be, we can still resolve the issue without suspending the institutions, but that is not my call. It is the call of others and progress is required to achieve that. We will continue to do all we can.</P>
      <P>The British and Irish Governments and everybody in the House is at one on this matter We have stated our positions. There are formulae through which it would be possible to achieve movement. We will keep trying but the time limits are tight. We have a few days effectively to make progress. I cannot change my position. I can be as helpful as possible but I can operate only on the basis of the will of the people and that is very clear.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept he is absolutely correct in saying he cannot change his position on the removal of bombs and guns from the equation because his position on that matter is that of the people, which was adopted in the most solemn fashion in a referendum in all 32 counties, and that it is time for all who are loyal to Ireland to act in accordance with the expressed wish of the people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree the only timetable of substance was set out in the Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent referenda that took place on this island, which was the formal act of self-determination shared by every person in all 32 counties, and that it was explicitly stated that decommissioning was an integral part of the most elaborate and comprehensive political agreement aimed at resolving as complex a set of conflicts that Ireland or any country has witnessed? Does he further agree that those people, wherever they may be, who are preventing the implementation of the Agreement on the basis that they are not prepared to dance to somebody else's imposed timetable are missing the point? The people, in an exercise of sovereignty, declared a timetable on 22 May 1998 and any true republican should surely recognise, support and endorse such sovereignty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputies' comments in support of my position. The Good Friday Agreement was negotiated over a long period. The multi-party talks took place between September 1997 and Good Friday, 10 April 1998. Many of those involved like to say the resulting document was the most clearly understood and debated in any plebiscite in Northern Ireland. Everyone understands what the Agreement states. I have worked with the support of the House and my Government colleagues to implement all aspects of the Agreement without fear or favour. That means we must continue to do so as there must be consistency in approach. This position is understood by all the parties in the North, the British Government and the President of the United States, who has been kept fully informed in the past few days. I hope to have an opportunity later to talk to him to brief him on where we are at. Last night I discussed the position with Prime Minister Blair for some time. It is our wish that the institutions should not be suspended and that the Good Friday Agreement should be implemented in all its aspects. If people follow what all of us have agreed, we can do that. If not, there will be difficulties but, as was requested by the leaders of the Opposition, we would then discuss the matter in the House and I would readily agree to that.</P>

      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, we discussed matters to do with Northern Ireland earlier and, lest Deputy Power's question go unanswered, perhaps you will allow me to do so now. I think I know the reason he raised it. This morning <i>The Times</i> in London ran a very detailed headline and an account that my officials had spent the past few days driving around Northern Ireland to the farmhouses and homes of the Provisional IRA Army Council on my behalf, that of the Irish Government and this House, convincing them to go against the leadership of Sinn Féin. It received major prominence throughout the morning in the United Kingdom. There is absolutely no truth in the story and rather than stay silent on the issue, I want to say it is unfair. This matter was raised last week by British media sources. I said then it was untrue. I went to considerable trouble over the weekend to make sure that was the case. It has never been the policy of successive Governments to meet the Provisional IRA, and it is still not the policy. It is not fair to identify officials, to show pictures of them or to refer to their names when the story is untrue.</P>

I applaud the voluntary sector for the gains it has made but, on cursory examination, there appear to be many elements with which I am unhappy and which need to be developed further. When will the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs be able to give the House a detailed briefing on these issues which deeply affect the people we represent?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) to consider the development of a personalised one-to-one information, advice and advocacy service for people with disabilities,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both amendments refer to section 7, which deals with the functions of the board. Having studied the section and consulted many of the interests involved, I believed the functions should be clarified in relation to some of the concerns expressed <Col N="1429" /> by people in the sector, such as the NRB. There was a feeling that the most important aspect of the support necessary for people with disability who wanted to go into the labour force is a personalised, one-to-one approach.</P>
    <P>This type of approach began in recent years in the local employment service. A person seeking to enter the workforce would have a mentor who would evaluate the person's educational abilities and needs, look at their training and then decide the steps by which the person could re-enter the workforce. A number of steps might be involved, including going to one of the training companies which a number of partnerships have established. That approach is particularly important for people with disability who, because of the inaccessibility of the educational system, might have an educational deficiency or might not have been able to finish first or second level education or had an interrupted education. Some might have some type of third level education or vocational training but they still need a deep support mechanism. A few months ago when the Minister first published the Bill, trainers and people in the sector who work with people with disabilities were concerned that this matter was not stated sufficiently clearly in the section in the Bill dealing with functions. The guidance that people will receive has been couched in general terms such as &ldquo;support&rdquo; and &ldquo;promote&rdquo;. There is a general feeling that it needs to be stressed that people can expect a personalised, one-to-one information, advice and advocacy service.</P>
    <P>Cognate with amendment No. 4 is amendment No. 5 which refers to the idea of a one-stop-shop for access and that would accord with the recommendations of the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities of a few years ago, subsequent reports and an interdepartmental committee on this matter. A key aspect of support for people with disabilities wishing to re-enter the workforce is the necessity of a location where everything could be accessed at once.</P>
    <P>We discussed at length with the Minister's officials at a meeting last week of the Joint Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs the extent of the liaison between the Department and FÁS and the local employment service. There is concern that people would have to go to three, four or five different places to access the necessary information to enable them enter or re-enter the workforce and to obtain other information they need to lead a useful life as a citizen. It is in that context I asked the Minister on Committee Stage to consider strengthening the functions and the direction to the board for its first mission statement by including an amendment such as this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the spirit of the amendments and the views expressed by Deputy Broughan. We discussed physical accessibility under the previous amendment but the spirit of these amendments is concerned with another form of accessibility, the form and basis on which <Col N="1430" /> information is given. They are concerned with a one-to-one approach and a one-stop-shop, which means all information is available in one place.</P>
      <P>We should not assume that people wishing to access information are always literate and that has consequences in terms of the benefit of the personalised, one-to-one service which Deputy Broughan outlined. It also has consequences in terms of forms and documentation used in offices. Studies show, unfortunately, that a sizeable proportion of the population is functionally illiterate. We must take that into account, especially when we deal with the disadvantaged section of the population.</P>
      <P>On that basis, the spirit of the amendments deserves to be supported. It is a matter for the Minister whether he agrees to include them in the Bill or in the strategy approach of the board. I am sure he will accept the spirit in which the amendments are tabled and supported but I await his views on how they should be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Broughan for tabling the two amendments and thank the Deputies for their comments. I agree with the spirit of the amendments. Given that the recommendations on the establishment of Comhairle are that people with disabilities would be mainstreamed into the existing service, thus creating a better service for all, and given the increase in funding for the National Social Services Board in past years and in the coming year, I would like to think that, no matter whether people have a disability, they would be dealt with on a one-to-one basis.</P>
      <P>Having travelled throughout the country visiting and opening offices &ndash; I opened a Citizen's Information Centre in Ballyshannon yesterday &ndash; I am aware that there has been a greater move towards making the offices one-stop-shops. With the improved technology available and the computerisation programme undertaken at the NSSB, now Comhairle, the service provided will in effect be, and has been for a number of years, a one-stop-shop for accessing information. The board of Comhairle is conscious that people accessing its service require one-to-one contact and need all the information to be in one location. I would say that is happening in this area. Such a requirement is not included in the functions in the Bill because they are explicit and the strategic plan would be the way forward whereby the board can decide, given its resources, where best to deploy its resources. I ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendments but assure him that what he said will be taken on board in the strategic plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's good intentions but I hope the board of Comhairle would have an absolute commitment from the outset to implementing the strategy of equality as it relates to information and advice. It was not always the case, even in larger agencies, that one received a one-to-one service. It is through developments in the past decade, especially through <Col N="1431" /> partnership and leader companies, that such an approach has been developed and has been successful. We must bear in mind that many people still need intensive guidance in terms of training and work, especially for those trying to enter or re-enter the workforce &ndash; recent unemployment statistics bear this out for many areas, including my area of Dublin where 45,000 are still on the live register. I hope that will be borne in mind by the new agency. I accept the Minister's good intentions in this regard.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) to consider the development of appropriate training for its own staff and service providers in connection with the provision of independent information, advice and advocacy services to people with disabilities,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment arose from the same basis as the previous four amendments, which is that the staff of the new agency would be given the necessary training to deal with people with disabilities who approach the agency seeking information and services. Doubts and concerns were expressed in this regard when the Bill was published. Given the work done by the National Rehabilitation Board in the area of information provision and that Comhairle would comprise staff from both agencies, it was considered necessary to ensure training would be provided for all staff giving independent advice and advocacy for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The area of functions should be included in the Bill, which is the charter of the new agency, so that people with disability can expect to meet staff who are fully trained in this regard. Many of the staff of the new agency might be primarily information providers for other agencies and not all will be familiar with the deep needs of people with disability. We should have regard for this in the establishment of the new agency.</P>

      <P>This amendment is largely aspirational but the aspiration is one with which I fully agree. Deputy Broughan argues very well for the need for proper training and development and I am sure the board of Comhairle will agree with him. Will the board have sufficient funding and resources to provide the necessary training? If we are assured that resources will be made available to the board, are given an outline of the board's training plans and an assurance of the Minister's support for them, our case will have been met. We have highlighted the need for train<Col N="1432" /> ing. If the Minister can confirm that resources will be provided for training, we will have achieved our objective.</P>

      <P>I thank the two Deputies for their comments. I agree with the sentiment of the amendment. Funding has been increased in the recent budget by £750,000 to £5.2 million. The chairperson of the NSSB, which is soon to be Comhairle, and the board are very conscious of the need for extra training for the staff, given the new responsibilities they are taking on. There is reference to training in section 7(1)<i>(e), </i>which states that it shall be a function of the board to &ldquo;promote and support the development of voluntary bodies providing social services, including, where the board considers it appropriate, the provision of financial or other resources such as integrated information, training and development services&rdquo;. Over the years the NSSB has provided a range of these services to the voluntary social services sector. It operates a training and development service which delivers a general training programme to the whole range of organisations in the social services sector, including community information centres and organisations dealing with people with disabilities. These include courses on basic information and interpersonal skills required for the delivery of a quality information service. In 1998 alone over 1,500 people working in the area of social services received training from the NSSB and I have no doubt that service will be further developed by the board. In my dealings with the chairman of the board I will keep a very close eye on staff training in this respect.</P>

I hope the high standards shown by the NRB and NSSB will continue.</P>

      <P>8.&ndash;Within 3 months from the establishment day, the Board shall prepare and publish a mission statement which shall set out the overall long-term vision of the Board as distinct from any short-term objectives.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes that a strategic plan be published as soon as shall be practicable. This plan would encompass many of the issues we have raised today and in our previous brief debate on Report Stage regarding the policies and functions of the new agency. It is important that a clear mission statement on the long-term objectives and vision of the board is made as soon as possible. The amendment proposes that this be done within three months of the setting up of the board.</P>
      <P>In framing this amendment I was considering the concerns of people who work in the area of disability regarding the structures of the agency and its ability to deliver information, support services, supportive technology and advice. The questions which we were asked three or four months ago have not been answered in the Bill. They should be answered clearly soon after the agency begins its work. There must be a clear statement of the agency's objectives and policy as soon as possible. The amendment proposes that this will happen within three months of the establishment of the agency.</P>

      <P>Under the Bill the strategic plan will be submitted to the Minister for approval with or without amendment. He will, therefore, play a significant and extremely powerful role. It is important, however, that the board of Comhairle is fully independent in framing objectives and policies on the provision of information and support services for people with disabilities. While I accept that there is a precedent for strong ministerial input in other State agencies and semi-State bodies, it is critical given its purpose that the new agency is fully independent.</P>

      <P>This amendment goes to the core of the Bill under which the Minister has the power to issue directions as he considers appropriate from time to time. He will effectively be able to amend it by making orders, under section 7 in particular. It is important that the board of Comhairle has a degree of functional independence. In this context the question of the strategic plan is relevant. There is a tendency in establishing allegedly independent boards, if not on the part of Ministers, on the part of civil servants, to retain strong control, over financial resources in particular. I accept the need for this from the point of view of public accountability. There is no bottomless purse. The question of control is, however, taken a step further in the Bill under <Col N="1435" /> which the strategic plan prepared by the board of Comhairle must be submitted to the Minister and the Department for approval with or without amendment. This is a source of concern as I can envisage a situation where the Minister will not be directly involved given that discussions on issues such as these are conducted at Civil Service level. To a degree this diminishes the quasi-independence of the board. While the Department should have a view which should be discussed with the board, the provision under which the Minister has the power to amend the strategic plan tips the balance too far.</P>

      <P>As I said on Committee Stage, this is a relatively common provision in cases where a State board produces strategic plans. Recent examples include the Irish Sports Council, Act, 1999, and the National Disability Authority Act, 1999. Lest my silence is taken as acquiescence, my officials would not wish in any way to spancel the strategic plans of the board of Comhairle. Deputy O'Keeffe said on Committee Stage that he had no problem with the Minister approving or, by extension, not approving them. A decision not to approve them could result in a Mexican stand-off. This could happen where there is a glaring omission. Deputies Broughan and O'Keeffe highlighted a number of issues which ought to be dealt with to provide for greater access. It is, therefore, best to leave the provision in the Bill as it stands as it is tried and trusted. The Department has had a good relationship with the NSSB, particularly in recent years when there has been a dramatic increase in funding.</P>

      <P>As Deputy O'Keeffe said, under the Bill the Minister has significant powers. The Bill states that a strategic plan shall be prepared in a form and manner in accordance with directions issued from time to time by the Minister. That was the rationale for hoping that we did not need to insert a further check by the Minister on the operation of the organisation. Having said that, I accept the Minister's good intentions and hope that the agency, as established, will be as independent as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope our concerns will never be realised. The Minister is quite right to uphold the position of the civil servants currently in his Department. However, when we make law, we make it for the future as well as the present. I know the last thing the departmental officials would want to do would be to spancel this new organisation and, to be fair, there is no evidence of any such attempt in regard to the NSSB. I am not overly concerned that any practical problem exists at present although we must look to the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1436" /> It seems somewhat odd that the board would prepare a plan which the Minister must essentially approve. If the Minister were not to approve of a plan, the plan should go back to the board for further consideration and it should make necessary amendments. As currently drafted, the section not only gives the Minister the right to approve of the plan but it is also the Minister and, by extension, his departmental officials who make the amendments. The proper course is that any such amendments should be agreed or made by the board following discussion with the Minister and his officials.</P>
    <P>I accept that this provision is relatively common in legislation although the fact that it is does not mean it is right. The Minister is not prepared to change the provision at this stage and as I do not anticipate a practical problem arising, at least in the short-term, from the manner in which the legislation is framed, I am prepared to accept the Minister's assurances. If difficulties arise, we must return to the House at a future date and address them.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 11, to delete &ldquo;one member&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;4 members&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party and the entire labour movement believe it is critically important that workers would be strongly represented in the administration of bodies for which they work both in the public and private sectors. In recent years the labour movement was instrumental in developing the concept of ESOPs, employee share ownership programmes, both in regard to recently privatised companies and throughout the economy. It is a fundamental belief of the labour movement that workers should have key representation in regard to the administration of any company, a belief which truly distinguishes the Labour Party from other political parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9(4)(<i>c</i>) proposes that one member of the staff of the board shall be elected by secret ballot of the staff of the board in such manner as the board, with the agreement of the Minister, may determine. There has been a growing perception within the State sector and throughout the economy that workers' rights and abilities to be part of management structures are being increasingly eroded. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions discussed this issue at length when IMPACT proposed that Comhairle should have worker-director representation in full accordance with worker participation legislation. We should <Col N="1437" /> not allow any further rowing back in this area. IMPACT and the trade union movement generally are gravely concerned that a new national body is to be established of which only one member at board level will be a worker-director.</P>
    <P>I note that the issue of Comhairle's structure was discussed extensively at the AGM of the worker-directors of all State and semi-State bodies held last year in Tralee. The general feeling was that it was critical that staff would be adequately represented from the outset of any organisation. Such representation informs people's ideological viewpoints of the economy. Given that Comhairle is an agency with such a specialist and sensitive remit, it is very important that there would be perhaps as many as four worker-directors on the board. That would ensure that some of the areas we have discussed, such as adequacy of training and capital provision for Comhairle's network of sites and personalised one to one service could be addressed. There is a strong feeling among many members of the workforce that these objectives could be best realised by ensuring significant workforce representation on the board.</P>
    <P>When the Enterprise Ireland legislation was being debated, at which time I was the Labour Party spokesperson on enterprise, trade and employment, it was found that there was an attempt to row back on workers' rights. It is all very well for the Government to engage in elaborate signing ceremonies for national partnerships and so on, but the really important issue is what happens at the level of the shop floor. A deeper commitment to worker representation at the highest level is required. Worker representation, where it exists, operates very successfully within the semi-State sector. Indeed, it has also operated successfully within the private sector in the past and has allowed companies and agencies to perform to their optimum capacity. I urge the Minister to re-examine this provision and to allocate four places on the board for the workers.</P>

      <P>I am generally in favour of worker representation on State boards and I am in favour of procedures being put in place whereby staff of commercial companies are provided with the opportunity to purchase shares in the companies. From that point of view, I support the views expressed by Deputy Broughan. However, I would not go to the wall on the numbers involved. I appreciate we are dealing with a board where there is a strong case for general equality and I am glad the Minister has agreed with the amendments in that regard. People with disabilities must also be represented on the board, of which I am in favour. Gender and disability must be taken into account and we cannot restrict the board too much. I am glad the Bill provides for staff representation on the board but I can see the practical difficulties with a statutory <Col N="1438" /> provision that this number must be four. I am supportive of staff representation but I would not press the matter of the number, particularly because there must be gender equality and disabled representation on the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no statutory provision for staff participation on the board of NSSB, although that is normally the practice. This practice is being followed by including the provision for one worker-director. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment recommend that each case be looked at on its merits. This is a non-commercial body which specialises in delivering information to the wider public. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe put his finger on it by referring to the importance of gender and geographical issues as well as representation of the various groups, such as those with a disability. I appointed someone to represent the elderly to the board. I cannot recall the particular groups but there was good representation in each case.</P>
      <P>In certain instances there may be a requirement for more than one worker-director. My party, like that of Deputy O'Keeffe, is in favour of that. There are examples of how we legislated for greater worker participation when we were in office previously, mainly in commercial State sponsored bodies. However, as regards non-commercial bodies, if I accepted these amendments the board would be top heavy. We increased the representation on this board from 15 to 20. I was advised that 20 was unwieldy. Looking at the spectrum of issues in this huge area, if another three representatives were added some people representing certain specialities and in contact with CICs around the country would have to be removed from the board. If worker-directors were to be represented, the number would have to be increased to 23 which would be totally unwieldy, or existing representatives would have to be removed.</P>
      <P>The staff of the NSSB have always been at one with the board regarding the development of the NSSB and the preparation of its strategic plan. I have no doubt that will continue. There is worker-director representation on the board which is sufficient to look after the needs of staff.</P>

      <P>Practically every Member of this House has been a board member of community and local organisations or commercial and national enterprises. Individually representing a key interest can be extremely difficult and being able to share the burden with one or two other people tends to make this easier. In this case when matters relating to training etc. arise the worker-director will have the specialist knowledge, with the chief executives, of how programmes will operate. It could be valuable to have more than one person representing that interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1439" /> There are other precedents &ndash; for example there is generally more than one staff representative on school boards, health boards and bodies under the aegis of health boards. They usually perform a valuable role. I ask the Minister to think about this again and to adopt a more generous attitude to workers by enabling them to have more than one worker director representing them. I ask him to accept our amendments. There are concerns in the trade union and labour movement that there is an attempt to erode previously clear policy measures laid down by my predecessors, Michael O'Leary and others, including the Ceann Comhairle, when in Government in the 1970s. The rights of workers established then are being diminished in this Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On the operation of the agency, it is extraordinary that the information agency is not included <Col N="1440" /> in the organisations to which the Freedom of Information Act, 1997 applies. It seems almost comical that the Minister has chosen not to include it given that section 18(1) lays down stern ground rules on how employees of the board should behave. While the Minister would make the point that much of the information serviced by the new organisation would be of a confidential and personal nature, it is fitting that the general performance of the board should be covered by the Freedom of Information Act and that an agency which specialises in dispersing information might be accessed through the Act. There have been complaints recently that the Act does not apply to some bodies in the public sector. However, it seems the performance of the agency, given that its speciality is information, could be best monitored and evaluated if it is covered under the Freedom of Information Act.</P>

      <P>Generally the Freedom of Information Act has been a success. It has brought many benefits from the point of view of transparency. Having had reservations about the Act initially, I am now a great supporter of it and this is why I support the amendment. It seems extraordinary, when dealing with a body whose primary function is the provision of independent information, to exclude that body from the operation of the Freedom of Information Act. The Minister has some explaining to do in this regard. He touched on this on Committee Stage but I was not convinced. Deputy Broughan has made a very compelling case and I await the Minister's explanation to the contrary.</P>

      <P>In page 12, to delete lines 31 and 43.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment to get a discussion going on this provision at this stage. When I first read the section, I was absolutely amazed. I find it outrageous that someone would be precluded from disclosing any information obtained by him or her while performing duties as a member of the board, a member of staff, a member of a committee or a consultant or adviser to the board. This seems a draconian section, therefore I oppose its inclusion.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage we argued against this section. I moved an amendment to limit the provision to information that could reasonably be regarded as confidential or of a commercially sensitive nature. Given that the Minister has tabled an amendment which effectively confines the provision to the disclosure of confidential information, my view on the section has changed. I would like the Minister to outline fully the thinking behind his amendment. It deals largely with the point I raised on Committee Stage and, in effect, confines the provision to the disclosure of confidential information. On that basis, we may have found a solution to the problem highlighted on Committee Stage and, if so, we can dispose of the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo Deputy O'Keeffe's comments. Section 18 covers an enormous remit and introduces an almost draconian approach to the governance of the new agency, Comhairle. It seems to be out of line with precedents in other areas, given that the basic work of the board will be dealing in information, often of a sensitive nature. I understand the necessity for the protection of information but that this draconian measure should apply to the general performance of the board or to aspects of its work is out of line with the assurances needed in relation to confidential information. This is why I tabled amendment No. 25 categorising information as confidential, personal information relating to an individual. I wel<Col N="1442" /> come the fact that the Minister has taken on board our concerns and tabled amendment No. 24.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision in section 18 is a standard provision in a number of Acts. The Acts relating to the National Disability Authority and the Food Safety Authority and the Pensions Act all have similar provisions. One of the principal functions of Comhairle, as set down in section 7, is to ensure that individuals have accurate and clear information and that its confidentiality is maintained. The provision was included to ensure that people accessing the service may be assured that their circumstances will not be divulged. The provision must be included in the Bill to ensure that would not happen.</P>
      <P>The terms &ldquo;save as otherwise provided by law&rdquo; and &ldquo;with the consent of the Board&rdquo; allows the staff of Comhairle to provide this information service to the public. This provision prevents the disclosure by staff of, for example, confidential information with regard to a client or other information relating to the board's activities which is regarded by the board as sensitive. It would not apply generally with regard to issues relating to the board, which probably would not be sensitive. However, sensitive matters may arise occasionally if difficulties arose. The provision is targeted at the disclosure of personal information.</P>
      <P>I have taken on board the concerns expressed by the Deputies on Committee Stage in the amendment which restricts the non-disclosure of confidential information as determined by the board. I hope the provision satisfies the concerns expressed by the Deputies.</P>

    <Title>National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill, 1999  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. We all recognise the importance of the Bill because the issue of quality assurance and food safety became extremely important as a result of the BSE crisis. While it had a downside with regard to the European markets for Irish beef and the troublesome phase it endured at that stage, it probably had a positive side because there is greater appreciation of quality assurance and food safety aspects. Given the importance of the beef industry to Ireland, involving more than £1 billion worth of exports, we must pursue quality assurance and traceability aspects.</P>
      <P>However, given that the Bill stops at the farm gate and does not deal with the consumer aspects of beef, it will be necessary to involve the Food Safety Authority, which is answerable to the Department of Health and Children, and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. The Minister must create confidence with regard to the entire chain and ensure it is enhanced by the Bill. It was stated in the Seanad that it might be better overall if all stages of the beef assurance scheme were administered by the Department of Health and Children. However, given the logistics involved, it is questionable whether that would succeed. In addition, as the Minister set up the inspectorate, which will inspect the various beef units around the country, it is obvious that will be handled by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. Perhaps it is unsustainable to have only one agency involved, but I am sure there will be a close link.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I greatly appreciate the work that has been done so far by Dr. Patrick Wall and the Food Safety Authority. The integrity of food has been considerably enhanced as a result of the establishment of the authority. Consumers are extremely important in the context of the overall process and the quality assurance aspects of the Bill will add extra credibility. Would it be possible to extend the Minister's actions with regard to the beef industry to other food components, such as the pig and poultry industries? I am not raising any questions about the current status of those products. The poultry industry is strong in my area and I have spoken on this issue on many occasions. However, the large supermarkets, such as Tesco and Dunnes Stores, dictate the quality required in the poultry industry. They carry out inspections <Col N="1445" /> of poultry units. The Minister has different departmental veterinary officials in different poultry processing units and one would be happy with the inspection process regarding Irish poultry products. However, over time there has been massive importation of poultry products from EU countries and beyond. I would like to think controls similar to those we have in Ireland exist in these countries also. We have seen the dioxin scare in Belgium and the use of sewage in France and people are concerned by the products we might be importing. Commissioner David Byrne will have a considerable role to play in this regard. If we are to be in the vanguard with our beef assurance and traceability and with our other products, such as pigs and poultry, Bord Bia's marketing will be made much easier, as we will be ahead of the posse when the White Paper on food safety is produced. I look forward to more positive action in this regard.</P>
    <P>The day of consumers being taken for granted is gone. Consumers have proved in recent times that they will dictate the quality they expect in future and that is why the traceability being developed by the Minister is laudable. There is much work still to be done in this area, as the Minister will agree.</P>
    <P>I am concerned by certain aspects of the Bill. When the inspection takes place and the situation is found to be unsatisfactory, the farmer has a right of appeal, but after that he must use the Circuit Court. Many of our farmers are elderly and I am concerned that they have had difficulty adjusting to the level of bureaucracy required by Europe and that many of them would be intimidated by the Circuit Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is being introduced at a very appropriate time. Irish beef is working its way back on to EU shop shelves after the BSE crisis, which began in March 1996. We paid a heavy price for that crisis and I acknowledge the efforts of the Minister in visiting Italy, France and the Netherlands to try to solidify our existing markets and to open new ones. The demand from Egypt, our biggest third country market, remains strong and there are indications that Russia will be back in the commercial market this year after its economic problems. The Iranian market may also be reopened this year. EU intervention beef stocks have been effectively cleared since December and intervention products will no longer compete with Irish beef for third country markets. We have not lost major markets as a result of the recent dispute between the meat factories and farmers, and Bord Bia predicts that the 15% increase in beef exports we experienced last year will be enhanced this year. Things are finally beginning to look up for the beef industry after three difficult years, while live cattle exports are running at record levels. That is why it is important we have a comprehensive set of measures in place to safeguard the markets we are regaining, as we cannot take them for granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1446" /> The measures proposed in this Bill will go a long way towards reassuring customers and consumers of Irish beef. They include proposals to give a statutory basis for the development of common standards for the production, processing and trade in Irish cattle and beef for human consumption and for the manufacture and trade of animal feedstuffs. These are to be applied to a system of registration, inspection and approval for all beef farmers. The Bill also provides for the enhancement of an animal identification and traceability system for Irish cattle. Under the Bill, all farmers keeping cattle must have a certificate of approval and be registered if they are mixing feeds and farms. Farmers and feed merchants deemed not to be complying with the new legislation face fines of up to £1,500 and or a year in jail for a summary conviction, and fines of up to £100,000 for an indictable conviction. The Garda are getting new powers of inspection and seizure on premises. They will be able to demand records and get a search warrant for the farmer's home. The Bill also includes enabling legislation for the cattle movement monitoring scheme and for the national cattle census. I have heard criticism of some measures in the Bill on the grounds that farmers will face additional bureaucracy and regulations, but the dioxin and BSE scares are clear proof, if it was really needed, that safeguarding consumer confidence is crucial for the future of any sector and the food industry in particular. This is now the number one priority and we cannot allow that to change.</P>
    <P>Think of the devastation that would be wrought on the food sector if we had a scare similar to the Belgian dioxin scare? The beef sector alone accounts for almost 40% of our entire agricultural output and is worth in excess of £1 billion. It contributes to the livelihoods of up to 250,000 people between producers, their families and workers in the processing industry. The value and importance of the industry were brought home very forcefully during the recent blockades of factories. A food scare like the dioxin scare would wipe us out.</P>
    <P>Consumers are demanding, and are entitled to safe and wholesome food. This is as it should be. We should not have to make do with anything less than the highest standards in the food we eat. Farmers should not allow anything in the food chain they would not eat themselves, but they should be treated properly by the big export plants with which they do business. I am delighted the Government has set up a committee to investigate complaints of anti-competitive practices in the meat industry and the huge gap between what the farmer gets for his cattle and what the consumer pays for beef. I have raised the problem of the meat factories all singing from the same hymn sheet several times here and I hope we are on the threshold of a new era of price transparency and reporting of cattle prices <Col N="1447" /> by the meat factories. Several Members have expressed concern about this matter over the years and I am delighted it is to be dealt with in an open and transparent fashion.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be congratulated for getting the farmers and the factories to agree to set up a market price transparency mechanism based on independent verification. This is to be done through the beef task force monitoring committee, where the factories will contribute to a market reporting model that will be independently audited by a firm of reputable auditors. In addition, the Department intends to publish a weekly list of the actual prices paid for cattle by named factories, as opposed to quota prices, which is another major step forward. I commend the Minister on this.</P>
    <P>Part of the factories' problem as a processing industry was that they were unwilling to yield ground on anything in the past, which led to the unprecedented frustration among farmers which was manifested in the recent blockades. The consistent refusal of the factories to come forward with any constructive proposals for the development of the beef sector or even to contribute to the new cattle breeding federation like all other sectors of the agricultural industry has left a sour taste. The meat factories will have to accept that a totally new approach is needed; the old tradition of nods and winks over a penny a pound here and there or transport deals for the favoured few will not suffice any longer. The only way forward is for the beef industry to pay for quality and to have a fully traceable product from the farm to the fork. The implementation of this scheme, which we are discussing, will make Ireland the first country in Europe to establish a national assurance scheme on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>The Bill applies to all people involved in the primary production and processing of Irish cattle and beef &ndash; farmers, cattle dealers, live cattle exporters, livestock marts, slaughtering premises, etc. It is a pity it does not bring food businesses in the retail sector under its wing also. If farmers are effectively to be licensed and regulated and expected to produce beef from the time they first feed their animals to the time they sell them, with traceability from birth to slaughter, should the same provisions not apply to the retail sector, which will sell their produce?</P>
    <P>It will take some time to complete the inspection and licensing of all beef farms and I welcome the provisions for transitional arrangements under which all participants will be deemed to be provisionally approved until they have been either granted or refused approval under the scheme. This is a sensible approach by the Minister and should take much of the heat out of the initial registration process. The Minister is also to be congratulated for allowing those farmers found not to be in compliance with the scheme a <Col N="1448" /> specific period of time to bring themselves into compliance. This reinforces his claim that the provisions are being introduced not alone to safeguard and protect producers but to provide assurances to consumers and buyers.</P>
    <P>The Bill will give credible assurances to customers and consumers about the quality of Irish beef and when operational, will enable us to say that beef and beef products produced in Ireland are safe and wholesome to eat. I hope it will be used as a platform for a concerted marketing drive for Irish beef at home and overseas. We have Kerrygold, Newbridge cutlery, Baileys and Waterford Glass. The challenge now is to develop a similar reputation for beef in the new millennium. The product itself has a great taste and flavour. One will find none better. I hope this Bill will help us to realise the full potential of our single biggest industry and that the customer is king.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the IFA President, Tom Parlon, who has been reinstated. One has to be careful in this House when paying tributes to people who on other occasions are very critical of Members. I congratulate him on the leadership he has shown in dealing with a difficult and ongoing problem which farmers have had to endure for a long time. All his contributions, as a leader of Irish farmers, have been fair and balanced. That is not easy when one is leading a group as big as that led by Tom Parlon. He has shown exceptional leadership. I am pleased to see him back at the helm again. As Deputy Finucane said, this is a positive development arising from what would be considered difficult problems. There is now a greater understanding among urban dwellers of the difficulties which farmers have to endure. The common perception, even among Members, that farmers were rolling in money, could not be further from the truth. For the majority of farmers, farming is a livelihood and a way of life for which they are not well paid but they do not want to change. If they can make a living from it, they are quite happy and content to remain on the land. It is vital that this House gives them every encouragement and assistance to do that.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for bringing the Bill before the House. It is a welcome development and it is in all our interests that it proceeds.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill in that its intention is to reassure consumers with respect to the safety and quality of beef, and in so doing, to enhance and strength of the beef industry as a whole. For many years the beef industry was in a strong position, obtaining prices close to 90% of the EU price on the European market and moving away from an over reliance on the lower end <Col N="1449" /> of the economic scale in third world markets. However, the arrival of BSE in early 1996 was to dramatically change this. A certain fear of beef was propagated across the markets and Ireland, despite the fact that it had a very low level of BSE cases, witnessed a rapid decrease in demand for its beef product and some countries banned Irish beef.</P>
      <P>Consumer confidence was undermined, prices hit rock bottom and the agricultural community took a severe battering, the effects of which are still visible today. Certain measures were taken at local and European level. The EU sought to expand its control and inspection services in the food, veterinary and plant health sectors and a system was put in place to provide early warning of food safety alerts. However this system needs to be modified.</P>
      <P> The Government established the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. This body was tasked with protecting consumer health by ensuring that our home produced food products meet the highest standards in hygiene and safety. With regard to the beef sector, the regulations on animal identification and movements were strengthened. In addition, there was a commitment in Partnership 2000 to develop a national beef assurance scheme which would promote the quality and safety of Irish beef, the main element of which would be the provision of a comprehensive animal identification and tracing system. This is the basis of the Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>The concept of traceability is the most important aspect of this industry. It is accepted by virtually all elements in the trade that traceability is central to the success of any assurance scheme. Most butchers have penned their own information on the counter front, to ensure customers can be satisfied as to the origin of the beef they are about to buy.</P>
      <P>One of the main complaints from the agricultural community is the increased bureaucracy and red tape with which they must become involved. While I agree there is a proliferation of paperwork, certain measures must be implemented and adhered to, in order to guarantee the quality of beef. In May 1999, Deputy Connaughton produced Fine Gael's proposals for profitability in beef production entitled &ldquo;Beefing up the Future&rdquo;. I shall refer briefly to some of the excellent proposals in that document. If these measures were to be implemented, I have every confidence the beef industry would not only return to the pre-1996 position but would improve from the pre-BSE position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conformation of our cattle is crucial and this can only come from a proper breeding policy. Some 80% of Irish suckler farmers have less than 20 cows and as they generally cannot afford to buy a bull, they use AI stations, which favour bulls which can facilitate calving. In an industry that is very definitely driven by quality, this can <Col N="1450" /> no longer be the principal factor. A quality animal is crucial for the future of the sector &ndash; as you sow so shall you reap. It is estimated that an improved cattle quality would bring a breeding dividend of £30 million for the beef and dairying industries.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation which has taken over responsibility for cattle breeding affairs from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. However, funding for this body needs to be brought into line and the charges, certainly in the initiation period, should not be imposed on the producers. This new body, in conjunction with Teagasc, should develop and implement a breeding education programme, designed to give producers a more scientific approach to breeding. A greater role will have to be found for the bull testing facility at Tully, County Kildare. We should look at the concept of producing beef for a definite market and if a variation is desirable we should ensure its creation.</P>
    <P>When we get the product right we have to be able to market it. We have to be open to the opportunity of new markets as the globe becomes one's local shopping store, and loyalty to brand and country of origin can no longer compete with quality and price. For too long, certain meat processors have been allowed to control and dominate the marketing of the vital sector.</P>
    <P>Export credit has often been a more important factor than a quality market. We have to face up to the fact that a great disservice has been done to the industry and shaking off some irresponsible works is part of the task. An Bord Bia has to take on this role and lead the way. The Board has identified four target markets which will provide the best returns for the industry, namely, Britain, France, the Netherlands and Italy. Each market will have different product requirements, <i>vis-à-vis</i> consumer attitudes, retailing and the pricing policies.</P>
    <P>However, An Bord Bia should not set a line to the markets that may be penetrated. Irish culture has infiltrated the most unique and unusual corridors and it is not unreasonable to assume beef can do likewise. If An Bord Bia can encourage Bono to eat a burger in Botswana or Roy Keane to lower a fillet steak before facing Florentina the sky may become the limit and many small producers could aim for a very specific market. The market vehicle is almost as important as the product.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister recognised it is now fully accepted that the maintenance and improvement of market position is dependent on meeting consumers' requirements, particularly in relation to food safety. I note that a new so called &ldquo;designer steak&rdquo; with guaranteed tenderness and colour characteristics has been produced by manipulating the diet of animals and by using newly <Col N="1451" /> developed procedures at meat processing level. Researchers at the National Food Centre and at the Beef Production Research Centre at Grange, have found that cattle finished on a diet of concentrates, produce a more tender beef than that from animals finished on grass alone. Also, it would appear that animals fed on maize silage produce whiter fat than animals fed on grass silage. Consumers in some European markets show a distinct preference for beef with white, rather than cream fat. This is the type of detail that needs to be addressed to ensure we can compete. I realise we are taking some steps but the message and supports have to be put in place for each farmer and the information has to be relayed to that farmer.</P>
    <P>Teagasc, as part of the campaign to increase the quantity of beef suitable for European markets, has produced a new suckler cow breeding handbook. The handbook contains comprehensive advice for suckler farmers on the breeding strategies necessary, which, in a nutshell, should exclude dairy genes from the suckler herd. I do not know how comprehensive is this campaign, but it is imperative that the information filters down the line.</P>
    <P>One of the main reasons for the drop in beef consumption on the home market has been the advent of fast frozen foods allied to the use of the microwave oven and the decline of the traditional butcher's shop in the face of the superstores, which provide a choice of products that can easily substitute for the traditional meat cut. The temptation to purchase Donegal catch or a pizza as a time saver by those in the many households where all adults work, often wins out. Even if the frozen steak and kidney pie is selected the meat content is far less than the home produced equivalent.</P>
    <P>This makes for a glum picture. It is predicted that by 2007, real national farm incomes will be approximately 15% less than they were in 1998. This will represent a drop of almost 10% in the value of agricultural output, although it should be compensated for by an increase in the direct payments. The combined effect of reduced output and lower prices will lead to a drop of approximately 25% in the value of beef output by 2007. While direct payments are welcome in that they relieve hardship, they have eaten at the heart of the agricultural community. Farmers want a fair price for their product and their depth of feeling on this was demonstrated earlier this year. The most unusual aspect of their recent protest was the almost unanimous backing by the urban sector, which has shown a lack of understanding of the agricultural sector over recent decades.</P>
    <P>The beef industry needs to be market rather than premium led. In addition to the identification of markets to which I have referred, the live export trade must be promoted. The report <Col N="1452" /> of the beef task force failed to adequately address this aspect and the Minister has been silent on the subject. The Department of Foreign Affairs must play a greater role in re-establishing old markets and opening up new ones. The problem of inadequate shipping facilities is also a handicap in this area.</P>
    <P>It is no secret that beef producers are losing millions of pounds because of the lower grading results on the national kill. This deterioration in quality is a direct result of a forced change of emphasis by producers to premia farming because of the low return on quality cattle. However, it will be different in the future, with much greater emphasis on quality, and on payment for it. It will be related to the return which producers receive. There has not been any encouragement to produce quality animals, and farmers, like all other groups, will respond to where they can get the best return. This concentration on premia farming did not put any emphasis on what the market required or on the production of quality animals.</P>
    <P>The Bill is weak in that it does not include any measures to deal with a proper labelling initiative. While it is good that retailers will be obliged to display a history of the product, the process would be helped by a suitable labelling system. I am not satisfied the Government has given the Bill the high priority it requires. Second Stage commenced last November and in the interim it has been put on the shelf for long periods. However, in so far as it seeks to meet consumer requirements it is welcome.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the Bill was discussed extensively with the representatives of the main participants in the scheme, namely the farmers, abattoirs, meat plants, marts and the animal feeding stuffs trade. While concern has been expressed about the scope of the provisions on the cost of compliance with the scheme, the Minister believes these problems <i>vis-à-vis</i> the non-application of the scheme to the retail sector can be addressed by legislation covering food hygiene in that sector. That is a matter for the health boards, but there should be a clearer link between them in the Bill. Following recent events I am sure the Minister will carefully monitor the cost of compliance and where it falls.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision whereby the origin and history of all cattle and beef entering the food chain is to be verified. I hope the Bill will deliver what it sets out to do and that our long held belief in beef, which has taken a hit recently, can be restored and improved. Beef is but one of the many sectors in the agricultural community that is suffering, but the light at the end of the tunnel is the re-examination process that is now taking place. Other sectors to suffer include the sheep industry, and I am aware the Minister has received several submissions on the various measures that need to be implemented to assist <Col N="1453" /> sheep farmers. It is imperative he puts as much energy into solving these difficulties as he has into other sectors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this timely debate. The beef industry is the most difficult sector in processing and manufacturing. It has been rocked to the core by the actions of unscrupulous people whose main motive has been profit at all costs, at the expense of consumers, producers and the Government. The scandals of the past 20 years will not be easily erased and legislation will not, of itself, correct or undo the irreparable damage done by the beef barons, as they have been called.</P>
      <P>While the Bill is well intentioned, it will not be possible to teach an old dog new tricks. Too many people have been involved in past activities which made profit the goal. Legislation will not prevent them from continuing such activities. That can happen only at the greatest cost. No matter how well intentioned the Minister's efforts, including on the legislative front, he has an enormous and unenviable task in derailing these people and in taking hold once more of a very important sector of industry.</P>
      <P>Despite many people having been dependent on beef for their income, these ruthless people have taken over the industry. Section 23, which provides for powers for authorised officers and the Garda Síochána, is well intentioned, but how effective will it be given that even the highest court was unable to bring these people to task, people who only in the recent past hounded the industry?</P>
      <P>While legislation will be a help, it will not hinder the activities of these people unless there is a sea change regarding the way our beef is marketed. The Minister has an opportunity to reassess the whole process of marketing beef, in the interests of producers, consumers and the Government. It should be done along the lines adopted by the milk marketing board.</P>
      <P>We cannot expect processors, who are engaged in a form of manufacturing, to be concerned with the income obtained by farmers and producers while they have the opportunity to sell. The Minister knows they have always taken the soft option. They have sold vast quantities of quality beef in some cases, into intervention, where it did not belong. Then other people removed it from intervention and sold it at enormous profit. It is now time for a root and branch reappraisal of the beef marketing process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Successive Governments have spent enormous sums of money marketing beef in select European markets. For all the money that has been spent marketing Irish beef, something that was necessary given that the beef industry was on its knees, can the Minister identify one new market which we have penetrated? If there is such a market, what quantity of beef has been sold in it as a <Col N="1454" /> result of the marketing initiatives? It is important that we reassess what is happening. We must restructure the approach to marketing and take it out of the hands of processors who have failed producers, the Government and consumers.</P>
    <P>I am not being political when I say that the Minister gave an undertaking prior to the last general election that he would provide grant assistance to abattoirs &ndash; private, family run businesses &ndash; to upgrade in order that their premises could satisfy EU regulations. There were 1,500 such abattoirs a couple of years ago, while today there are only 400 privately run family abattoirs. We have no indication that the Minister will give grant aid and assistance to these people to allow them sufficiently upgrade their premises. Let us compare what has happened to these people with what has happened in terms of major processors and the millions of pounds of taxpayers' money which they have received. They have pushed the abattoirs in private ownership out of business. Many of the remaining 400 privately owned abattoirs will go out of business if we do not do something. I plead with the Minister to say these people will be immediately looked after through grant aid to allow them reach a sufficient standard to allow them operate efficiently and effectively in the interests of consumers and the safety and quality of food they produce.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not blame the quality of our beef for the current difficulties. Quality beef is being produced at a basic level but, unfortunately, it is being siphoned from the country by lucrative overseas markets. We want to add value to the quality beef being produced at a basic level, and incentives must be put in place at that level to allow producers hold on to animals by guaranteeing them that their endeavours will be rewarded in terms of a realistic price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Daly.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said from the outset that he is anxious that beef being produced in Ireland and exported to other countries is of the highest quality. He has been to the forefront in ensuring that farmers, producers and consumers are at one with him in this regard. The national beef assurance scheme is obviously a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Numerous criticisms have been made of the Bill, the bulk of which have been concerned with the effect on small and elderly farmers who may not be able to withstand the stricter regulations for beef production. If we look to the past we will find that while those criticisms were previously directed towards other schemes, small farmers responded to ensure that the quality of their production always met the demands of regulations. While we take into account the concerns of these people, we must look at the benefit which will result from the Bill, namely, the safety of Ireland's food supply which is of paramount <Col N="1455" /> importance. Everybody recognises that if small farmers and producers are to compete on an international market, their product must have the assurance of the strictest safety and highest quality, which is what the national beef assurance scheme will ensure. By developing standards for production, processing and trade, and by applying these standards and enhancing the animal tracibility system the Bill will increase confidence in Irish beef and ensure its safety, thereby protecting consumers and producers.</P>
    <P>Ireland exports food to more than 57 countries, with beef accounting for 40% of the country's agricultural output. Therefore, it is necessary that we strive to ensure the safety of our beef at home and abroad. The reputation of our cattle industry is contingent on its ability to protect consumers against BSE and dioxin diseases. In March 1996 the explosion of the BSE crisis in the UK opened the world's eyes to its severity and the threat to health. Aside from the economic damage, the credibility of the beef and cattle sector was seriously damaged. The consequences of the recent dioxin scare in Belgium has served as a reminder of the dire results of failing to swiftly and firmly respond to such a threat.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development stated in his speech introducing this Bill to the Seanad that the safeguarding of consumer confidence and the prevention of BSE and dioxin food scares is to be our number one priority. Of course, it logically follows that in attainment of this priority lies the chance to save small farms. Inevitable as confidence in Irish beef is boosted, there will be an increase in demand. Therefore, the industry can be saved, not harmed, by Government regulation.</P>
    <P>Innovation is necessary if the beef and the cattle industry is to survive. Farmers will have to find new methods of creating desirability for Irish beef. The Bill provides such a scheme which will boost confidence in the product. The environment in which food is produced has changed dramatically in the past ten years, with consumer expectations and standards rising substantially. Producers must respond to consumer demand for demonstrably safe and wholesome food. Consumers have a right to demand and expect food which is safe, wholesome, of high quality and produced in ultra-hygenic conditions. Farmers understand that the market environment for beef has changed radically. Provisions for independently backed and credible guarantees for the safety of Irish beef are necessary to satisfy consumers' reasonable and legitimate demands and increase our market share. Farmers also understand that this will, of necessity, impose some extra obligations on all elements of the beef sector. However, we have striven to keep these obligations to levels consistent with delivering a credible scheme which will address the concerns of <Col N="1456" /> consumers of Irish beef. Any additional assurances regarding the safety and quality of Irish beef will work to the benefit of farmers through an increase in demand for beef.</P>
    <P>The Bill has also been criticised because of its lack of regulations for supermarkets, restaurants and catering services in the retail sector. However, these accusations are simply unfounded given the existing legislation covering the retail sector. The FSAI has the authority and responsibility to enforce regulations on the sale of beef. The Bill is criticised for placing an undue burden on farmers and for not regulating the retail sector. This is considered to be a severe contradiction. There is no need to provide further restrictions on the retail sector because it is already obliged not to purchase beef that does not meet the requirements of the scheme. Given that the Bill applies to all persons engaged in the primary production and processing of cattle and beef, the retail sector will receive beef which has been assured to be safe. It is already regulated by the Minister for Health and Children through the food hygiene regulations and they will continue to be applied. It is, therefore, not necessary to introduce a second tier of regulations, inspections or other approvals.</P>
    <P>Non-compliance with this provision will constitute an offence under the Bill and it is intended to empower health boards to conduct inspections to ensure it is complied with. The threat of disease will be eradicated from beef that is sold to the retail sector at the primary level because only persons meeting the prescribed standards will be approved to participate in the industry. The action taken at the primary level of cattle production will provide for the safety of beef sold by retailers and the safety of beef on consumer's plates is contingent on the precautions which are provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill has the support of farmers, whom it affects most. Tom Parlon, the IFA president, stated that farmers supported the scheme as it was contingent on a fully computerised traceability system for which the IFA had been calling since March 1996. It contains provisions for this request and includes a traceability system for cattle movements and other events in their life cycles. While farmers question the exclusion of regulations for the retail sector they must note the redundancy of such regulations. The retail sector is included in the existing regulations which come under the FSAI's jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>A closer examination of the legislation also verifies that it provides the statutory basis for the scheme, the purpose of which is the development of common standards for the production, processing and trade of beef. At the end of the day, the Minister and his Department are trying to reintroduce confidence in the beef sector. He is ensuring that there should be a total commitment to traceability and quality approval. He wishes to <Col N="1457" /> restore pride in beef production and encompasses that with vigorous marketing that depends almost completely on rigorous regulation, which is desirable from the point of view of consumers and the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome the legislation and compliment the Minister on introducing it. Everybody recognises that beef is fundamental to Ireland's export industry and quality assurance in the beef industry is critical in order to ensure that it continues to play an important part in the overall development of the agriculture industry and that people involved in production and processing earn a decent living. When the Leas Cheann-Comhairle and I served in Cabinet together, a major effort was made to adopt a national plan for the development and exploitation of the beef industry. It came unstuck because it was not accelerated to the required dimensions. A big effort was made by the Minister for Agriculture at the time but, nevertheless, such a plan did not materialise and that still needs to be remedied. It is as fundamental to progress today as it was ten years ago. The industry is fragmented and disjointed at all levels and that was evidenced during the recent dispute at meat plants. It is essential that there should be close co-operation and liaison between primary producers and those involved in processing and marketing. Until that happens difficulties will continue in the industry and the marketplace.</P>
      <P>The beef tribunal was mentioned in a critical fashion earlier and many of those who studied the tribunal's report searched for references to scandals and wrongdoing in the industry and these were identified and highlighted. However, the tribunal acknowledged the outstanding contribution of beef exports to the economy. Currently, approximately £1 billion worth of beef is exported and it makes a substantial contribution to the economy. A few key areas in the beef industry must be examined not just to ensure that it continues to make such a contribution but to expand it in order to create further employment opportunities, especially in the highly skilled technical area of beef processing and to generate greater income for producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also necessary to examine the overall structure of the meat processing industry. There are 42 plants, of which only two have attained the ISO 9000 standard, which has become the standard for industry generally. The beef industry is no different to any other industry. We have an opportunity to use a natural raw material to develop an industry which would result in further employment opportunities and the production of top quality beef for home and foreign markets. The BSE crisis sent shock waves through the beef industry in Europe especially and it had an impact in Ireland. However, it has regained its market share in France, Italy and the Netherlands <Col N="1458" /> since 1996 and the prospects for beef and cattle prices in the longterm must be stable. If we can get our house in order, we can continue to have a viable industry which will continue to give sustainable employment to many people, especially small farmers in my constituency.</P>
    <P>A proper structure for beef production is fundamental to the development of the beef industry. The Minister of State, Deputy Davern, has been very much involved in the breeding sector and tracking suckler cow herds through the system. In my county, since changes have taken place and since many people have left the dairy industry, we have a very sound suckler herd industry in my constituency. They have been looking at breeds such as Belgian Blue and Charolais and so on, to improve the quality of breeding and that is fundamental. A large amount of money has been invested in disease eradication and other aspects of the agriculture industry which had needed to be remedied for a long time. However, there was not sufficient investment in breeding. There is a need to have a detailed look at that, and I ask the Minister to do so, and to provide some additional finances to ensure that those involved in suckler cow breeding &ndash; there are many in my constituency &ndash; get some support to enable them to improve the quality of the breeding stock. That is vital to the long-term development of the industry.</P>
    <P>It has been necessary to carry out a radical overhaul of the standards of quality food. I compliment our new Commissioner, David Byrne, on the impact he has had in the European Union in improving and regulating the standard and quality of food generally, particularly in relation to beef. I compliment Commissioner Byrne on the work he is doing on food quality and in urging the national agencies here involved in food quality to work with the overall EU policy he has put forward. I congratulate him also on the establishment of an EU quality food standards agency. I hope representations will be sufficiently strong to get such an agency established in Ireland. We must ensure that the Irish agencies with responsibility in this area would be part of the overall EU policy put forward by Commissioner Byrne. We must have effective food quality standards and a highly regulated system in place so that the consumer will have the confidence to buy the product from the supermarket. We must be able to stand over the product we are putting on the national market.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to some problems being experienced by many of the small butchers in my constituency as a result of efforts to bring them up to standard. Some of these butchers are being forced out of business. I appeal to the Minister to provide grant aid for the small butchers throughout the country who are providing an excellent service. Many of them have been in the business for generations. A grant aid scheme should be put <Col N="1459" /> in place to enable those butchers to provide the chilling, refrigeration and other facilities they need.</P>
    <P>This is a very successful business, but difficulties have arisen and there is a need for an overall national plan for the industry. We need to be vigilant with regard to imports. I am aware that Brazilian imports are coming onto the market, particularly in the catering business. We need to ensure that beef is subject to the same regulatory standards applied to beef here. I compliment the Minister on what is the first step in putting a decent beef industry in place which will make a major contribution to the economy and in terms of employment.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill. It will reassure customers about the quality and safety of Irish beef and, in doing so, will help the marketing of beef products outside the State. We must ensure, however, that there is adequate education, assistance and understanding of the impact of the new system on Irish farmers. It must not be used as a policing approach, rather it should be used as an advisory and helpful approach.</P>
      <P>The beef industry has gone through a terrible time over the past 12 months. There has been little profit in farming. The beef industry is very important to the economy. The industry is not just about the beef processor. There must be a partnership with the primary producers, the meat factories and other service agencies. The meat processors will have to recognise that a totally new approach is needed, and the Minister must ensure that happens. He must recognise that the question of inspection levies and VAT has to be addressed and that the full quota of market returns will have to become a reality.</P>
      <P>Cohesion in selling into third countries will have to come into effect. That was the central recommendation of the McKenzie report but it has been ignored, with farmers picking up the bill for the weak selling. So far, factories as have refused <i>en bloc</i> to countenance such proposals. Instead, they have succeeded in turning the political and democratic system against themselves. How long can they sustain public and political odium? They will now inevitably find themselves recipients of a new legislative system and outlook.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an exporting nation, it is important that this State stands over its products and, in doing so, enhances the marketing of our beef internationally. One of the important aspects of the national beef assurance scheme, if it is successful, will be determined by improvement in the prices the farmers will get for their produce. I am concerned about the level of bureaucracy which will <Col N="1460" /> result from the proposals. This will add further pressure to the farming community and it should be rewarded financially if the scheme is to be successful. It would mean that a producer of Irish meat will be in a position to check with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development that an animal was reared under certain environmental conditions and to identify the farm at which it was kept during its lifetime. This traceability is very important. It will be possible to confirm the conditions in which the animal was kept, to confirm that such conditions were environmentally friendly and that the animal was well looked after.</P>
    <P>I commend the National Food Safety Authority on the excellent work it has done. The population is beginning to acknowledge and accept that it is a truly independent body taking an up to date, scientific and professional approach to its responsibilities, and is obtaining credibility for its views. It brings together many elements of the beef industry. It is important yet difficult to have a foolproof system of traceability based on the ear tagging of animals with almost eight million cattle in the country and a higher rate of movement of cattle than any other EU country. Theoretically it should be possible to know the location of every animal at any one time, and this is the aim of the Department. In November the Minister stated that 2.2 million cattle were registered on the system. In building up the register we must ensure the system operates sufficiently and that the computer database has been examined and proven to be beyond fault.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a number of problems with the Bill. On-farm inspections will be carried out and if farmers do not pass inspections, their herd numbers will be taken from them. This will restrict severely their ability to farm. The Minister must ensure his approach is sympathetic and understanding, advisory and educational, rather than being a policing system. Enormous costs will be involved if care is not taken with the inspection process. Inspections should be carried out on the day the veterinary surgeon visits the farm to carry out the TB and brucellosis tests. In his contribution, the Minister said that this would be the case, but some veterinary surgeons say the system merits more attention and that they must receive more information before visiting the farm, otherwise they will have to visit the farm a second time. There is an obvious cost implication for this. We must ensure that the inspections do not add extra cost to the farming community. In most cases veterinary surgeons are aware of the farming practices of their clients and the health status of their herds.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress that the scheme should not create extra costs for veterinary services to the farmer. It should form part of an integrated approach under a cost compliance scheme being introduced by Brussels. There will be more farm <Col N="1461" /> inspections and if an inspection is failed the farmer will lose his or her headage and REPS payment. We must ensure that we do not create a policing approach with employees of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development being obliged to seek out farmers whom they can fail for inspection. Strict criteria must be put in place for inspections. Farmers deserve to be treated fairly and to have their integrity and dignity respected.</P>
    <P>The Bill will create special difficulties for elderly farmers who will find it more problematic to respond to the changed needs. The Minister should introduce a comprehensive educational programme to prepare the farming community for the changes. This could be done through Teagasc and the farming organisations. It will take time to outline the changes to farmers. There will be difficulty in understanding the changes given the speed at which they are taking place. Due to the complexity of the changes farmers will not readily understand them. The Minister referred last November to the running in time and this should be used to allow farmers to understand and experience new changes. No income should be lost by any farmer during this period.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister the reason the same traceability procedures will not apply to imported meat or meat products. Will he agree that this places an enormous anti-competitive burden on producers in the State? Why does the safety net now being applied to Irish producers not cover outside producers?</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the issue of non-compliance with the scheme. Under the proposals, farmers will be warned first and then given a reasonable time to improve their farms.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Eireann calls on the Taoiseach to come before Dáil Éireann to make a statement and answer questions on:</P>
      <P>&ndash;who told him that Deputy Foley was under investigation by the Moriarty Tribunal and had an Ansbacher account;</P>
      <P>&ndash;when he first became aware that Deputy Foley might have held offshore accounts or been compromised in his activities on the Committee of Public Accounts;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1462" />&ndash;when he first discussed this matter with the Tánaiste;</P>
    <P>&ndash;whether the Government has got an early warning mechanism about material or witnesses under investigation by tribunals;</P>
    <P>&ndash;whether he or the Tánaiste have received, or are aware, of the contents of the additional list of Ansbacher account holders' names that Deputy Foley's name is on;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the circumstances of his meeting with Deputy Foley in December 1999 and who first sought that meeting, the people present at it and whether notes were taken;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the specific questions he asked Deputy Foley;</P>
    <P>&ndash;whether he asked Deputy Foley to resign from the Committee of Public Accounts or its sub-committee investigating DIRT; and</P>
    <P>&ndash;whether, in view of his statement to Dáil Éireann on 3 June 1998 that &ldquo;as a general principle that those who have enjoyed the trust and support of ordinary party members, of the electorate and of this House, and who have achieved high office and positions of great trust over a number of years, owe a full and frank explanation to the country that should not have to be extracted from them by tribunals of inquiry&rdquo;, he will ask Deputy Foley to make a full and frank explanation to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>The motion poses nine questions for the Taoiseach and each can be answered with almost a single sentence. On this occasion we want facts, not froth or verbal gymnastics. I ask these nine questions because I believe elected politicians in their private and public dealings should and do set a tone for society. Politicians should be leaders, not followers. They should set a standard. A party leader who does not set exacting standards for those who follow him is simply not doing his job.</P>
    <P>The first question asks who told the Taoiseach that Deputy Foley was under investigation by the Moriarty tribunal and had an Ansbacher account. It is an important question. A number of journalists claim that they knew for some time that Deputy Foley might have an Ansbacher account. The then editor of <i>Magill</i> posed this question two years ago to Deputy Foley. Did the Taoiseach ever hear the rumours which had reached <i>Magill</i> two years ago? Did the Taoiseach's fabled media monitoring machine ever pick this rumour up? It is quite adept at spreading rumours. Who told the Taoiseach about Deputy Foley's Ansbacher account and when? Was it two years ago, two months ago or just the day before the meeting with Deputy Foley?</P>
    <P>The second question asks when the Taoiseach first became aware that Deputy Foley might have held offshore accounts or have been compromised in his activities on the Committee of Public <Col N="1463" /> Accounts. Did the Taoiseach know of the possibility that Deputy Foley might have had such accounts, as <i>Magill</i> suspected, when he chose Deputy Foley as his party's nominee to chair the Committee of Public Accounts between 1995 and 1997? Did the Taoiseach have any such suspicions about Deputy Foley and his accounts before the Committee of Public Accounts DIRT inquiry began? Did he know about them before Deputy Foley participated in the publication of the report on tax evasion last December? A tax evader investigating tax evasion. If the Taoiseach knew Deputy Foley might have had offshore accounts before the DIRT report was published, even at that late stage, he should have asked him about it and told him forthwith to resign.</P>
    <P>The third question asks when the Taoiseach first discussed this matter with the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney. This is related to the first question. Some reports suggest that the Tánaiste knew about Deputy Foley's position before the Taoiseach knew. Such a report was carried in the <i>Sunday Tribune.</i> If so, how did she know about it? Did she get it from a list that was given to her in her ministerial capacity and chose to pass it on to the Taoiseach in a party capacity and, if so, was that the appropriate thing to do? A detailed chronology of this business from the Taoiseach would be most helpful and might link the disparate facts and statements of belief that have been issued by the usual sources and by some Ministers on this matter.</P>
    <P>The fourth question concerns whether the Government has got an early warning mechanism about material or witnesses under investigation by tribunals and should be easy to answer. It seems to Members on this side of the House that on occasions the Government and its mouthpieces are remarkably well informed about matters that we are led to believe are strictly confidential to the tribunals.</P>
    <P>Question five is about whether the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have received or are aware of the contents of the additional list of Ansbacher account holders' names, which includes Deputy Foley's. At least one journalist claims to have the full list, suggesting that this list exists in a complete format. Do the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have this full supplementary list of names, including Deputy Foley's? Will this new list be selectively leaked in due course, in the same way the original list was leaked last September?</P>
    <P>On that occasion I asked the Garda Commissioner to investigate these apparent leaks. He told me that he had not received any papers on the subject from the relevant Departments and, therefore, could not act. It would be helpful if the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste gave the Garda Commissioner some of the papers in their possession about the Ansbacher lists so the commissioner can make at least an informal assessment as to whether criminality was involved on the part of anybody high or low in the leaking of the names.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1464" /> Question six asks about the circumstances of the Taoiseach's meeting with Deputy Foley in December and who first sought that meeting, the people who were present at it and the notes that were taken. By any stretch of the imagination, this must have been a memorable and dramatic meeting for the Taoiseach and Deputy Foley.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>They were probably both in denial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the serious nature of the matter for discussion, was anybody else present at the meeting? What did the Taoiseach do after the meeting? Did he make a note of the meeting and did he talk to any officials or party staff afterwards? Does he have a record and, if not, why not?</P>
      <P>I recall having such meetings with members of my party when I was Taoiseach. While I was always unaccompanied, I was careful to ensure that a record was taken immediately after such meetings as to what had happened, in case there was any dispute thereafter. I assume the Taoiseach has a record available, if not contemporaneous then one taken immediately afterwards, of what transpired at the meeting. Vagueness will not suffice on this occasion from the Taoiseach, who is absent from the debate this evening.</P>
      <P>The seventh and eighth questions seek to find out the specific questions the Taoiseach asked Deputy Foley at the meeting. Did he ask questions or did he just nod sagely as Deputy Foley gave his version of how he came to emerge phoenix-like from his state of denial about his offshore accounts? Did the Taoiseach ask Deputy Foley if he had paid tax on the interest on those accounts? the Taoiseach, as a former Minister for Finance and accountant, knew there was a potential tax liability on these offshore accounts. If he did not ask the question, &ldquo;Did you pay tax, Denis?&rdquo;, he clearly did not want to know that he had not paid tax, and if that was the case, the Taoiseach was not doing his job. If he asked the question and was told by Deputy Foley that he had not paid tax, the Taoiseach knew there and then in December in his office in Government Buildings that a member of his party was an admitted tax evader and he should have asked him there and then not just to leave the office but also the party. He did not do it, if that is the case.</P>
      <P>Question No. 9 refers to the Taoiseach's statement in Dáil Éireann on 3 June 1998 that:</P>
      <P>as a general principle...those who have enjoyed the trust and support of ordinary party members, of the electorate and of this House, and who have achieved high office and positions of great trust over a number of years, owe a full and frank explanation to the country that should not have to be extracted from them by tribunals of inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In light of this, has the Taoiseach asked, or will he ask, Deputy Foley to make a full and frank explanation to Dáil Éireann about this matter, or is it the case that Deputy Foley will conveniently <Col N="1465" /> resign the Fianna Fáil whip tomorrow so that the Taoiseach will no longer be in a position to ask him questions because he will no longer be within his jurisdiction? It would be a convenient way for Deputy Foley to avoid answering the questions by leaving the Fianna Fáil Party and for the Taoiseach not to have to ask the questions. Although he could have asked them last December or any day up to today, he will not be in a position to ask them tomorrow because Deputy Foley will have left. It is very convenient for both the Taoiseach and Deputy Foley but typical of how the Fianna Fáil Party does its business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am tempted to say to the Deputy who has just interrupted me that he should be ashamed to have made that intervention. His party has, over the past two and a half years under its current leader, been unable to face the truth about its associations with and support for the former Deputy, Charles Haughey, and all he stood for, the former Deputy, Raphael Burke, Deputy Ellis, Deputy Matt Brennan's constituency colleague, and Deputy Foley, even though it has been plain as a pikestaff since last December.</P>
      <P>The problem with Fianna Fáil is that it does not do its job well, including under its current leader because he has no wish to ask questions to which the answer might require a decision from him which would involve pain on his part. It is that unwillingness to face any painful decision or any friend with a hard question which characterises the fundamental weakness of Fianna Fáil at present. Fianna Fáil is a weak party. It is weak because it is unable to face the truth. Facing the truth and asking hard questions require strength and, by that measure, Fianna Fáil is a weak party.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is weak because of its continued tolerance of the style of leadership it receives at present. Deputies who support the Taoiseach in his passive and evasive attitude to this issue should be ashamed of themselves. Éamon de Valera would never have led Fianna Fáil in this way. The Minister of State, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, spoke the truth when he said there is an unwillingness in the Fianna Fáil Party to stand by its own proud traditions, to confront public opinion, even where it believes that opinion to be wrong, or to confront a version of history which may have been presented in a manner unfair to a former leader, even if it believes that version to be wrong, because it never wants to be unpopular with anyone at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is impossible to be a genuine public leader in politics if one is unwilling to be unpopular. The problem with the Taoiseach is that he never wants to be unpopular with anyone, and that is not leadership, that is useless. The people will <Col N="1466" /> soon enough come to appreciate that, in Government Buildings at present, they do not have a leader, they have a follower of fashion and public opinion, a person who always wishes to be nice. Sometimes niceness is not enough. When Deputy Foley was summoned to the Taoiseach's office to explain himself, niceness was not enough, but I have no doubt it was the only characteristic displayed at the meeting. It is not good enough and the people are not, nor will they be, satisfied with it. Leaders must ask hard questions, but this leader does not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a debate about political accountability, standards in office and the vast gulf which exists between the words and deeds of the Taoiseach. By tabling this motion, Opposition Deputies seek to restore the integrity and standing of the House which has been damaged by the continuing fall-out from the Foley affair. The Dáil has repeatedly acknowledged the huge challenges facing politics. The sleaze and double dealing of a few prominent political figures has cast a dark shadow on how democratic politics is perceived in this State. The public perception of politics has been shattered by the revelations of the past decade, particularly the past three years.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party believes that we in the House have a duty to ensure the whole truth, however unpalatable, is laid bare. We have a responsibility to deal with the difficult questions the truth sometimes turns up. Given the central involvement of members of his party in the issues being investigated by the Moriarty and Flood tribunals, the Taoiseach must prove by his words and actions that there is no place in modern politics for the cronyism and cowardice of the past.</P>
      <P>Speaking in the House on 10 September 1997, the Taoiseach seemed to acknowledge the serious task confronting politics. Referring to the establishment of the Moriarty tribunal, he stated:</P>
      <P>The whole procedure envisaged is a painful necessity for our democracy. It is essential that we dissipate the atmosphere of cynicism and suspicion and that we show we are capable of acting resolutely without fear or favour to defend it.</P>
      <P>However, as we have found out time and again in the Dáil, the Taoiseach's actions do not match the fine words carefully crafted by his spindoctor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Foley affair raises serious questions for both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste. It is right and proper for those on this side of the House to ask those questions now and to expect honest and straightforward answers. No one has sought or wants to establish a parallel inquiry to that taking place in Dublin Castle. However, issues pertinent to the House and which should rightly be addressed in the House have emerged as the tribunals continue their public hearings. The Moriarty tribunal is not investigating the manner in which the Taoiseach found out about Deputy Foley's deceit. It is not with that the House charged the tribunal. The serious questions about <Col N="1467" /> the Taoiseach's and the Tánaiste's role as this scandal unravelled cannot be brushed under the carpet. Debate on these important and pertinent political issues cannot be suspended indefinitely because a tribunal of inquiry is sitting. They are legitimate questions and they must be answered in this House. This is called parliamentary accountability and it does not grind to a halt with the establishment of a tribunal.</P>
    <P>This debate has been precipitated by the reprehensible actions of Deputy Foley. By holding an offshore account illegally and for the purposes of tax evasion, Deputy Foley has engaged in corrupt and duplicitous practices since he became a TD. The extent of this duplicity is mind-blowing. In 1979 Deputy Foley colluded with Mr. Des Traynor to defraud the taxpayer. By his own admission, he has known since 1983 that an offshore account was used to execute this fraud. In 1995, after the death of Des Traynor, he made a withdrawal from his account. Mr. Foley contacted and met Mr. Traynor's right-hand man, Pádraig Collery, in a discreet corner of Jury's Hotel and received £50,000 in cash. In May of last year Deputy Foley received a statement of his account. The names Ansbacher and Hamilton Ross appeared on the statement. All this information was concealed from the tribunal until November of last year.</P>
    <P>At the same time, Deputy Foley sought and obtained senior positions of responsibility and trust in this House. He has been chairperson of the Committee of Public Accounts. Last autumn he sat on the sub-committee that inquired into DIRT evasion. In September 1997, the day after the Taoiseach waxed lyrical about the need &ldquo;to dissipate the atmosphere of cynicism and suspicion&rdquo;, Deputy Foley himself voted to exclude the Ansbacher accounts from the remit of the Moriarty tribunal.</P>
    <P>I put it to the House and to the two members of Fianna Fáil who are present, that the nature and extent of Deputy Foley's deception is truly shocking. Members will know that I have made a complaint against Deputy Foley under the Ethics in Public Office Act. I did so because I believe in that legislation. My party campaigned for and introduced this significant reform. Unlike others, we believe in adhering to that legislation and not simply paying lip-service to it.</P>
    <P>However, it is the role of both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste in the Foley affair which is at the kernel of this evening's debate. The events surrounding the Taoiseach's meeting in December with Denis Foley and the inaction which followed, demand an explanation, as Deputy Bruton has already said. Newspaper reports, which have not been denied, insist that it was the Tánaiste who first informed the Taoiseach that Deputy Foley was under investigation by the Moriarty tribunal. Shortly after receiving this critical information, the fateful meeting between Deputy Foley and the Taoiseach took place. We do not know the date. It seems that the <Col N="1468" /> Taoiseach's diary of appointments with Fianna Fáil backbenchers has been elevated to the status of a State secret. We know few details about the meeting. What we do know is that in January of this year Deputy Foley was still a serving member of the Committee of Public Accounts and action was not taken by either the Tánaiste or the Taoiseach until this sordid affair became public. The murky cloak of secrecy which has been cast over the Taoiseach's meeting with Deputy Foley cannot be maintained.</P>
    <P>The motion details the questions that need to be answered and they have been well articulated by Deputy Bruton. Whether either the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste will adhere to the standards of openness and accountability required by this House and answer those questions remains to be seen. That Deputy Foley remained a member of the Public Accounts Committee after his meeting with the Taoiseach simply beggars belief and it is my understanding that a formal letter of resignation has not yet been received by that committee. Outside this House, the Taoiseach has stated that he requested the meeting with Deputy Foley because he had been informed that he was under investigation by the Moriarty tribunal. Deputy Foley confirmed that this was true. This is a critical point. The Taoiseach was centrally involved in drawing up the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal. He knows what those terms of reference are. The Moriarty tribunal is charged with examining public office holders who benefited from the Ansbacher deposits. It does not have a role in examining murky investments made 26 or 28 years ago or in examining under-the-counter payments in a hotel in Tralee during the showband era. The only reason the tribunal would be inquiring into these matters was that they were linked to the Ansbacher deposits.</P>
    <P>The inescapable logic is that as soon as Deputy Foley confirmed to the Taoiseach that he was being investigated by the Moriarty tribunal it was clear that Ansbacher deposits were centrally involved. However, despite this evidence and the fact that Deputy Foley informed him at the meeting that he was salting money away in an investment account with Des Traynor, the Taoiseach asks us to believe that he did not know that Deputy Foley was an Ansbacher depositor until it was publicly revealed by the tribunal on 27 January last. This House is asked to believe that. Despite the overwhelming evidence of culpability the Taoiseach expects us to believe that he was as shocked as the next person to find out that Denis Foley was up to his neck in the most scandalous tax fraud perpetrated in this State.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's threadbare defence for this contention is that he had seen a list of Ansbacher depositors who were unearthed by the Tánaiste's authorised officer, Gerard Ryan, and that Denis Foley's name was not on that list. However, if it is true that the Tánaiste provided the information which led the Taoiseach to call in Deputy Foley, is it not apparent that both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste knew before the meeting with Deputy <Col N="1469" /> Foley that Gerard Ryan's list was not exhaustive and that he had uncovered some but not all of the Ansbacher depositors? Is this not one of the main reasons the Tánaiste sought the appointment of High Court inspectors to continue inquiries into the Ansbacher quagmire? The Taoiseach's defence that an initial investigation carried out with the limited powers available to an authorised officer had identified all the Ansbacher depositors and that anyone not on that list must be innocent of any connection to Ansbacher accounts is, therefore, quite unsustainable.</P>
    <P>Where does the Tánaiste stand on this issue? Will she either confirm or deny that she informed the Taoiseach about the tribunal's investigations of Deputy Foley? If this is the case, will she confirm that she was aware that people not identified in the authorised officer's report had Ansbacher deposits? Will she accept that the Taoiseach's defence is threadbare? Will the Tánaiste explain why she has stood silently by while an Ansbacher account holder continued as vice-chairperson of the PAC?</P>
    <P>Since the formation of the Government the Tánaiste has been denied information, told a blatant untruth and been openly defied by the Taoiseach. The Taoiseach has now presented the Progressive Democrats with another display of Fianna Fáil's regard for standards in public office but no doubt, as with so many other issues, the Progressive Democrats will be satisfied to turn a blind eye to their supposed principled politics.</P>
    <P>In a comment made about this affair outside the House, the Taoiseach stated that at the meeting Deputy Foley informed him that, in line with Fianna Fáil policy, he was co-operating fully with the tribunal. Now it is official. Fianna Fáil Deputies will comply with the law of the land. The Taoiseach apparently accepted this outrageous claim.</P>
    <P>Deputy Foley has concealed crucial information of relevance to the tribunal of inquiry established by this House. When the tribunal was established he knew that Des Traynor operated an offshore account for his benefit and that when Mr. Traynor died, Pádraig Collery continued to manage his offshore affairs. Yet he did not think this of relevance to the Moriarty tribunal. Again, in May of last year Deputy Foley received a statement of his account which mentioned Ansbacher. The extent of his involvement with the Ansbacher deposits was there in black and white yet he still concealed his involvement from the tribunal. When the Tánaiste received a report into Ansbacher, Deputy Foley kept his head down, thankful that he had not been discovered at that stage. Again, he concealed his involvement from the tribunal. Only when the tribunal, through other avenues, had tracked down Deputy Foley did he co-operate with the inquiries. Is this Fianna Fáil policy on tribunals of inquiry? Is there anybody else in a similar position to that of Deputy Foley in the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1470" /> The Taoiseach seemed quite prepared to accept Deputy Foley's behaviour at a meeting in December. Does the Tánaiste also accept this duplicity and evasion? It seems the Progressive Democrats are willing to put up with anything which delays their next meeting with the electorate. Despite the occasional and publicly necessary bout of sulking it is abundantly clear that the Progressive Democrats will put up with any behaviour so long as they cling to office.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's refusal to robustly confront wrongdoing within the Fianna Fáil Party is feeding the public cynicism surrounding Irish politics. The vast gulf between his words and actions serves to undermine his credibility and that of the Government. Speaking on his proposed ethics commission on 28 May he stated that &ldquo;events had made it all the more urgent to have this legislation processed as quickly as possible. The Minister for Finance intends urgently proceeding with this.&rdquo;  We still have not caught sight of it 21 months later. The Taoiseach promised to introduce a new code of conduct for Fianna Fáil members at its Ard Fheis in November 1998. Thirteen months later we find that the proposal has been shelved and that a draft document which requires candidates to produce satisfactory evidence that their tax affairs are in order has been rejected. The Taoiseach told the House on 10 September 1997 that it is &ldquo;unacceptable that the people who decide upon the laws should engage in placing their money outside the jurisdiction in offshore accounts not merely for the purpose of concealment from the public but in a way which lends itself to wholesale tax evasion.&rdquo; When faced however with a member of his parliamentary party who was engaged in such evasion for more than 20 years he refused to take action and that member remained a member of the Committee of Public Accounts. He told us on 28 May 1998 that &ldquo;Fianna Fáil is giving co-operation to the tribunal&rdquo;. Yet it seems he does not bat an eyelid when the extent of Deputy Foley's concealment of that vital information relevant to the work of the tribunal is laid bare.</P>
    <P>Restoring trust and public confidence in parliamentary politics is one of the most important challenges facing this House. The Taoiseach has proved himself utterly incapable of contributing to this task. Each time he has been required to take strong action against wrongdoing and make a break with the culture of secrecy and cronyism which has crippled Fianna Fáil and subsequently damaged the rest of politics he has failed abysmally. The Burke affair, the Rennicks payment, the Sheedy scandal and the Foley revelations, in all these crucial tests the Taoiseach has hid from the truth and misled his partners in Government. He has misled us as well.</P>

      <P>It appears that Deputy Foley and the Taoiseach expect a fool's pardon. We have a choice to make in this House. Either Deputy Foley is an extremely stupid individual and a complete amadán or he is a very cute fellow with <Col N="1471" /> one hell of a brass neck. Deputy Foley and the Taoiseach are not stupid individuals. It is clear that in terms of public perception Deputy Foley has damaged the work of the Committee of Public Accounts &ndash; the six men who were going to redeem Irish politics and who did a very fine job. As a result of Deputy Foley's revelations the public has become even more cynical about Irish politics and the task of changing public attitudes towards tax evasion has become far more difficult.</P>
      <P>The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General showed that tax evasion was widespread and endemic. There were 22,000 bogus nonresident accounts in Tralee alone. This is a terrible problem. It is almost perverse that those who evade tax are seen as victims who are simply taking precautionary measures to prevent the avaricious State from stealing their hard earned money. That is how it is often seen. There will be enormous sympathy for Deputy Foley and little understanding for the craw-thumping do-gooders who want to do him down. In the case of Raphael Burke, the Taoiseach said that we were hounding an innocent man out of office. That is the perception unfortunately.</P>

The chattering classes in Dublin will say, &ldquo;Isn't that awful? It must be some sort of rural aberation. It could not happen in Dublin.&rdquo; It could. If Charles J. Haughey were to run for election he would enjoy electoral success. If Raphael Burke were to run for election he could possibly top the poll. Despite all our pretensions and so-called sophistication in this Celtic tiger economy the gombeen culture still flourishes in this pathetic little country of ours.</P>

We have not received answers to these questions. It is being put out by Fianna Fáil that somehow the Taoiseach was misled by Deputy Foley, as Deputy Roche said last night <Col N="1472" /> on radio. The Taoiseach simply does not want to know. He is like Manuel in &ldquo;Fawlty Towers&rdquo;&ndash;&ldquo;I know nothing&rdquo;. The Taoiseach knows nothing. This is a Fawlty Towers Government stumbling from one scandal to the next. It knows nothing and wants to know nothing.</P>

A Deputy can be asked to leave this Chamber if he does something outrageous like take off his jacket. We have our priorities slightly wrong when a Deputy can sit here if he is evading tax. We have to put our house in order. That is what the motion is about.</P>
      <P>While there has to be a clear division in terms of what is happening at the tribunal which has a quasi-judicial function, Article 15.10 of the Constitution states that each House shall make its own rules and Standing Orders with power to attach penalties for their infringement and shall have powers to ensure freedom of debate. We are enjoying that freedom tonight and have certain privileges to which we must live up. We must give leadership. We cannot condone corruption and be seen to be complicit in any way. The problem is that the Government has been seen again and again to be complicit in corrupt practices. This is intolerable in a democracy. I hope there is a new Government because if this continues there will be no trust in politics.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the years and decades which lie ahead historians and observers of political science may have good reason to look back on the political happenings of the second week of February of the year 2000. There is no doubt but that this week will be seen as one of the most important in the social, political and economic development of the nation. The ongoing efforts to maintain and build upon the fledgling peace in Northern Ireland and the notable achievement of a new social consensus regarding our immediate economic future will be seen as milestones in the Ireland of the third millennium. The same observers may well ponder with perplexity the curious preoccupation of the Opposition which <Col N="1473" /> chooses this week to debate during Private Members' Business not the burning issues of the day which will fashion our future but what will be seen as an obscure and long forgotten motion relating to the peripheral actions of the Taoiseach. Time and history will adjudicate on whether Opposition Members will be seen to have captured the hearts and minds of the people with this motion or whether they will be seen to have focused on peripheral performances at a time of historic happenings.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt but that the Taoiseach, in his efforts relating to Northern Ireland and to build an equitable and fair society, is carrying out the wishes of the people. I have no difficulty with Members of the Opposition using Private Members' Business in this fashion &ndash; it is their democratic right &ndash; but it is about time they changed their tune. Since I entered this House in June 1997, the same tune has been sung from the Opposition benches. That tune seeks to demonise Fianna Fáil, its Leader, its Ministers, its Deputies and its membership throughout the country.</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party has dominated the political life of this country since its inception in 1926. It is a party with an honourable history of service to the people. It would be fanciful to assume that in three quarters of a century any political party of the size and scale of Fianna Fáil could escape blemishes caused by individual human failings.</P>

      <P>Experience in the United Kingdom, Europe, North America and Australia shows that political life is not immune to human frailty and fault. What is of importance is the capacity of society and of any political grouping to deal with matters when they arise and to put in place systems which ensure, in so far as it is politically possible, that such matters cannot arise again.</P>
      <P>We have sought to discover what occurred by establishing tribunals of inquiry under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, as amended. Two tribunals are continuing their work. The pace at which the work is proceeding and the costs which attend the work is a topic to which this House might usefully return, but it must be borne in mind that the 1921 Act has long been regarded as being deeply flawed. In England, Lord Salmon, who examined the workings and legislative framework of tribunals of inquiry noted in relation to the 1921 Act that &ldquo;. of necessity the passage of the Bill through Parliament was somewhat hurried. As a result, there are certain omissions and shortcomings in the Act .&rdquo;. Whatever shortcomings exist, it is clear that tribunals, once established, should be allowed to get on with their work without unnecessary interference from the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Tribunals of inquiry have two functions. First, they exist to restore public confidence arising out of some matter of definite public importance. Second, they exist to report to the Oireachtas and to make recommendations to assist the Oireachtas in its legislative task. It would be a wholly unsatisfactory situation if the ongoing work of the tribunals were to be punctuated by ill-informed comment or criticism from this House by persons who, of necessity, had a less than perfect grasp of the facts.</P>

That decision is consistent with his style of open government and the manner in which he has conducted himself since being elected Taoiseach. The Taoiseach recognises that those who participate in the public life of this State must be above reproach and must demonstrate a high level of ethical behaviour. His efforts as leader of this country and Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party have consistently been directed to this end.</P>

      <P>We in Fianna Fáil, the largest political party in the State, believe it is incumbent on us to be at the forefront in underpinning the confidence of the public in politics and public representatives. We can never condone the betrayal of public trust or behaviour which would bring democratic politics into disrepute. We accept that we have duties and responsibilities to this House and to the people. I resent the implication which attends tonight's motion and which was conveyed in the preceding speeches that all members of the Fianna Fáil Party are in some way implicated by the actions of an individual.</P>
      <P>Having served at all levels of the Fianna Fáil organisation, I know the party stands for the principles on which it was founded. We stand for the policies which have brought Ireland as far as it has come in the past 78 years. We accept that our duties and responsibilities are imposed on us by the people and that we owe it to them to maintain their trust. That is what Fianna Fáil, led by the Taoiseach, will continue to do.</P>
      <P>This House can and should deal with established facts but as far as the Taoiseach is concerned, it is time for this House to leave behind the shadows of persistent and unsubstantiated innuendo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this motion. Politics is a noble profession which involves service to the <Col N="1476" /> community which is informed by a sense of civic duty and a love of one's country. The late US President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, used to say there was no greater calling than public service, and I agree with that sentiment.</P>
      <P>At the last general election, one out of every three people did not vote, resulting in the lowest election turnout since the early 1920s. Two thirds of young Irish men and women did not vote in the recent local and European elections. The impression that politicians are all the same and that politics is about power, prestige and low standards in high places is apparently winning. Politicians have a duty to challenge this view and renew faith among our young people that politics makes a positive difference.</P>
      <P>Since 1987 this country has been turned around from an almost bankrupt banana republic to a modern, wealthy economy. This did not happen by accident. I remember the difficult decisions taken by politicians, Ministers and the Government in 1987 which were the foundation for the resurgence of the economy. The politicians made the difficult decisions and the political leadership of all parties in the past 13 years have been responsible for the numerous national plans which have been so important for our development. Without political leadership, the successful development of our economy would not have taken place. However, we cannot sit on our laurels and expect plaudits for past actions &ndash; we are as good as our next act.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the revelations at tribunals have had a considerable negative impact on the public perception of politicians. The reaction of the public is interesting because very few of the number of people involved are politicians. However, they attract the greatest opprobrium. This highlights the fact that the public, expects, demands and deserves the highest standards from their public representatives. Fianna Fáil stands for public service and needs to be seen as a party which puts public interest first. This has been the tradition of my party since 1926. Of course, there have been some transgressions of the high standards required by the party. However, let he who is without sin cast the first stone.</P>
      <P>Ireland is fortunate in having a healthy democratic system which in the main has enjoyed the confidence of the general public. As the largest political party in the State, it is incumbent upon Fianna Fáil to be at the forefront in underpinning the confidence of the public in politics and public representatives. We can never condone a betrayal of public trust or behaviour which brings democratic politics into disrepute. I repudiate such conduct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On entering the new millennium, Fianna Fáil, as part of the ongoing modernisation of the party, prioritised the reinforcement of the emphasis on highest standards in public life, in accordance with the ethos of its founders. In Government we have initiated and implemented legislation covering a wide range of electoral and ethical issues including the Electoral Act, 1997, the Electoral <Col N="1477" /> (Amendment) Act, 1998, the Local Government (Declaration of Donations and Expenditure) Act, 1999, and the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill, 2000, which amends existing legislation, some of which is over a century old. It is also intended to address serious loopholes in the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995. A standards in public office Bill is in the process of preparation.</P>
    <P>In 1999, Fianna Fáil published proposals for a mandatory code for office holders and candidates for discussion within the organisation. This code will be put forward for sanction by our Ard Fheis in March. This document has three objectives. First, to set out guiding principles and a general code of conduct to which members, active in public life, should adhere. Second, to specify the requirements imposed on candidates and office holders by the electoral and ethics legislation and practices so that each person understands clearly his or her legal obligations. Third, to provide for the establishment of a standards in public life committee to foster the development and enforcement of ethical behaviour in the party.</P>
    <P>This document does not anticipate and provide for all instances in the conduct of public life where issues requiring the exercise of an individual's judgment will occur. On such occasions, a candidate or office holder must always recognise their highest duty is to the public they serve and act accordingly. The party requires that candidates and office holders comply with all legal requirements, both in their spirit and letter.</P>
    <P>However, promulgating the highest ethical standards goes beyond legislation. This document seeks to promote the highest standard of conduct and is intended to compliment the requirements of law. As with the relevant legislation, it should be seen as a definitive guide. It is intended to reflect the high standards which Fianna Fáil seeks to promote in public life and which the majority of members, elected or otherwise, have upheld in the history of the party.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that of all the parties, Fianna Fáil has come forward to lead the way once again.</P>

      <P>Has it no interest in finding a solution to what is surely the most important issue of this parliamentary session? I think the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. It is more convenient to be opportunistic and have a go, yet again, at the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern. On the day when the programme for fairness in work was published following detailed and painstaking dialogue between the social partners, when pay increases of 20% and further tax reductions, programmes of accelerated housing development and targets to counter social exclusion were all agreed, the Opposition is on its moral high horse yet again, second guessing tribunals which have been set up by the Houses of the Oireachtas as the most appropriate mechanism to investigate the matters which are the subject of its motion.</P>
      <P>Tax dodging is wrong, although for years it seems to have been an accepted culture. Paying tax seems to have been an option, not an obligation, for many. Thankfully, we now seem to have a more compliant culture and this House, through its laws and actions, can take a great deal of the credit for this. We have started on a road which will lead us towards even more rigorous standards and that is as it should be. I am and always have been a PAYE taxpayer, with many other Members and thousands outside the House. We always expected that the same rigorous demands would be made of others outside that category but they were not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where does the blame lie? We all had a sneaking regard for the &ldquo;cute hoor&rdquo; culture which seemed to be endemic and all pervasive in certain sections of society. It was condoned, rarely condemned and never properly investigated &ndash; not even by the media. Why? Some would say this was because of the overly restrictive libel laws. Surely the hard-nosed newshounds should have been able to do better. The tax collecting agencies have not crowned themselves in glory. They are performing now as we expected they always should have. Is it a case of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted? The manner in which we perform our duties, discharge our responsibilities and meet our obligations is a legitimate topic for public scrutiny. Our conduct as Members of the House and in matters which relate to our membership must always be open to public scrutiny. Of necessity, that means as public representatives our affairs must be open to a greater public <Col N="1479" /> interest than the affairs of other citizens. Each candidate for public office knowingly accepts this because public confidence in the workings of the House is the cornerstone of democracy.</P>
    <P>The report of the McCracken tribunal raised for proper public debate the issues of the integrity of our democratic process and the public perception of it. If there is a widespread public perception that Members of this House may be open to improper external influence then, collectively, we forfeit the respect of the people. If we as the people's representatives forfeit their respect, then the integrity of the Oireachtas is damaged and the cornerstone of democracy is loosened. Each of us has a duty to ensure this does not occur. Our primary duty is to the democratic institutions of this State and to ensure they are protected and strengthened. If and when questions arise which cast a shadow on the workings of this democracy, we have a duty to take every reasonable step to answer them and to lift the shadow.</P>
    <P>In May 1995, Lord Nolan presented to the British Parliament his first report on standards in public life. He and his committee stated in their report, &ldquo;We cannot say conclusively that standards of behaviour in public life have declined. We can say that conduct in public life is more rigorously scrutinised than it was in the past, that the standards which the public demands remain high, and that the great majority of people in public life meet those high standards.&rdquo;  Those conclusions apply equally to elected representatives here. The same principles of conduct which underpin public life in Britain apply here. The seven principles stated by Lord Nolan are selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership.</P>
    <P>The decision by this House to establish the McCracken tribunal signalled to the public and to those in public life that the standards expected of public representatives, both by their fellow public representatives and the public, go substantially beyond mere compliance with the criminal and civil laws. There is an implied trust placed on persons in public life by those who put them there. The extent of that trust can be difficult to define but it can be summarised in the word &ldquo;honourable&rdquo;. Those who send us here expect us to act in an honourable manner. The Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, spoke for the entire Fianna Fáil organisation when he said, &ldquo;Participation in the democratic life of this country is about public service not self-service or the sustaining of a certain lifestyle. It is the Oireachtas and ultimately the people who decide what our political leaders and representatives are paid and who provide them with the appropriate facilities. Even if in the particular case there were no favours sought or given we could not condone the practice of senior politicians seeking or receiving from a single donor large sums of money or services in kind.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>By comparison with many of our European partners, we are a relatively young democracy. In a sense, we are still on a learning curve in the <Col N="1480" /> development of standards of best practice to allow that democracy flourish in the real sense. We were extraordinarily lucky in our emerging years as a new State to have so many visionary statesmen and women who had a very clear idea of how they saw democracy flourishing through a vigorous parliamentary system. Most were idealists; many were pragmatists as well. By and large, they were all inspired and driven by a sense of public duty and by the value of the process of politics and of unselfish public service. It strikes me that many of these founding members of our State had an independence of means which gave them a freedom of thought and action which perhaps those of us who may now be termed professional politicians may not have to the same extent. To the extent that they did not always have to look over their shoulders to examine the implications of decisions in electoral terms, they had room for more courageous decision-making.</P>
    <P>We have good examples in the early years of this State of Members from all parties and from none, from the professions and from the trades unions who made a considerable contribution to the State. They did not look to the safety net of a Dáil seat when making their decisions. If anything needs to be adjusted in our mind set as parliamentarians, it is that we must be ordinary people, always listening and interacting with the people. The day we think that as soon as we step inside the Kildare Street gate and on to the plinth, we have undergone a mysterious metamorphosis is the day we lose touch with reality. Trust, integrity, courage, good judgment and openness are but some of the qualities we would expect in any well rounded personality. These are traits and qualities the public expect in their public representatives. It is not, however, good enough to express these values, it is expected that we display them in the way we frame policies and make decisions, even in the way we live. That does not mean we should set ourselves up as plaster saints. It does mean we must expect that our public behaviour is constantly under the microscope and open to scrutiny. It is important, therefore, that we put discredited ways of doing things behind us. All our dealings must not only be open but be seen to be open.</P>
    <P>The proposed public ethics commission is desirable and I compliment the Taoiseach and the Government for their initiative. Public life will be served well by it and it will do much to restore public confidence and trust in the operation of Government.</P>
    <P>I was elected to the Dáil in my third attempt, so it is fair to say that I wanted to become a full time politician. It is a humbling experience to come to this House as one of the representatives of Dublin North West to join colleagues whose honesty and integrity I admire. The contributions of some of the founding members of the State have inspired me. I am in awe of much of the work they have done. I am dismayed and greatly disappointed at the earlier attitude of a small number of people who, though totally devoted to <Col N="1481" /> public life, abused their very special position and dragged the whole profession of politics into disrepute. If we expect the consent of the governed to be forthcoming, the people who govern must be the essence of probity and integrity. The past must be rigorously investigated and the faulty punished. The lessons learned from these investigations must be incorporated into legislation which is being proposed by the Government. We must search elsewhere for models of best practice into the operation of the parliamentary process and procedure and into monitoring standards in public life. Many of our current practices need little adjustment but where improvements can be made, they should be implemented without prevarication.  </P>
    <P>In recent years, we have seen the fragile flower of democracy emerge in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. We saw the spectacle of the first time voters in South Africa travel for days, over deserts, to exercise their hard won right to vote. Perhaps we have become too complacent and take too much for granted. Complacency is a malaise which must be avoided at all costs. It breeds cynicism and cynicism breeds alienation. Once people are alienated and to all intents and purposes outside the loop, it is difficult for them to feel a sense of ownership of what is happening.</P>
    <P>When it comes to honesty and integrity, there is no pecking order in this House, no matter what office is held or on what committee the Member sits. When it comes to membership of a committee where the financial affairs of others are under examination, it seems to me that it should be a given that anybody who has the slightest doubt about their own affairs should not compromise themselves, their committee, its investigation or findings by presenting themselves for membership of such a committee. Therefore, it is best that a Deputy in that position does not present himself for membership of the Committee of Public Accounts and, by extension, the sub-committee charged with investigating the DIRT controversy. However, when it comes to condemnation, I believe in due process. I am not prepared to condemn someone, a Member of this House, who is widely acknowledged to be hardworking, kind and helpful, without hearing him out or without hearing all the facts. When those facts are known and analysed, then I will reprimand, censure or do whatever is required to preserve the good name of all politicians.</P>

    <P>Tonight is the first time the House has an opportunity to see parliamentary accountability at work in respect of what has become known as the &ldquo;Foley affair&rdquo;. It could scarcely be a more serious issue since the connection to Ansbacher has become widely accepted as a synonym for tax evasion. What do we get instead of parliamentary accountability? In respect of a motion directed at the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, we get calculatedly and deliberately the most junior of the Jun<Col N="1482" /> ior Ministers sent in to the House to read a script that frankly I wished I had not been present to hear. Fianna Fáil could have taken a different course tonight. It could have said some of the things its members are saying in private but it did not. This most junior Minister and some of her backbench colleagues have instead taken up the position of &ldquo;hit me now with the peace process in my arms&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>They have dragged into a particular and specific debate the shelter of what is ongoing in the wider political arena on this island. The Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin's contribution was almost unbelievable. For example, she urged us to leave behind the shadow of unsubstantiated innuendo. We should reflect on that statement from a Minister of State who knows better. There may be a price to be paid for promotion, but it should not be that high. I have much regard for the Minister of State, many Fianna Fáil colleagues in the House and the people who have traditionally voted for the Fianna Fáil Party. However, the House is dealing with a serious issue put on the agenda of the House by the conduct of half a dozen people in Fianna Fáil in succession. It is an insult to the House to send in the most junior Minister of State and for her to make a speech to the effect that we are deflecting the Taoiseach from his important work in respect of Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>We should consider what would happen if any other party leader in the House dealt with the Deputy Foley situation in the same way as the Taoiseach. There would be internal unrest in the party. However, six senior members of Fianna Fáil, two former Ministers, a former Taoiseach and several Deputies, are helping various tribunals with their inquiries. If that happened in any other party the leader would be replaced. That does not happen in the Fianna Fáil Party, despite all the grand homages to the fine tradition of the party and the honour of public service.</P>
      <P>It has not happened in any of the issues to which the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, said she is tired listening since June 1997. Why is she listening to it since June 1997? The answer is that these issues continue to recur. The sewage keeps seeping out from under the door. She said that experience in the United Kingdom, Europe, North America and Australia showed that political life is not immune from human frailty and fault. That is a nice way of putting it and nobody on this side is trying to pretend that human frailty does not apply on both sides of the House. However, the issue is how the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party dealt with it. The Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin's comment about experience in Australia, America and elsewhere is a euphemism for corruption. That is the issue being inquired into and the Taoiseach has now developed expertise in contriving not to answer questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1483" /> We are told the Taoiseach has appointed an interlocutor to make contact with Deputy Foley. This is very convenient because he cannot then ask him any questions. There is now an interlocutor to defuse the Deputy Foley time bomb and the Taoiseach does not have to ask any questions. It is entirely beyond belief that in the one contact between the Taoiseach and Deputy Foley he did not ask him why he was being investigated by the Moriarty tribunal. It is entirely incredible. That is what the Moriarty tribunal is investigating and for the Taoiseach to say that he did not know that he was an Ansbacher holder until the day it was revealed at the tribunal is entirely beyond belief. It is reminiscent of the trail of deception on which he led the House in respect of the former Deputy Ray Burke.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach led us to believe that he sent a senior colleague to London and that he was up and down every tree in north Dublin, but he did not ask the man himself the hard question. There was only one question but he did not ask it. Instead he said, &ldquo;Ray, is there anything that you want to tell me?&rdquo;. That is the standard and quality of leadership and we now know that there were several other questions that he might have asked former Deputy Burke. He might have asked him why he wanted to continue dragging the communications portfolio behind everywhere he went. When he was in the Department of Energy, he had the communications portfolio between 1987 and 1988. He transferred to the Department of Industry between 1988 and 1989 and he brought the communications portfolio with him. From 1989 to 1991, when he was in the Department of Justice, he also brought the Department of Communications. What is the answer to the question? From what we have been hearing in recent days, it appears that £35,000 may provide part of the answer. Most Members remember the ferocity of former Minister Burke's attack on RTE at that time.</P>

      <P>My colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, was the Opposition spokesperson at the time. Former Minister Burke sought to relegate 2FM at that time to clear the pitch for Century Radio and he sought to divert some of the licence fee. He reduced the transmission fees by £200,000 and he capped the revenue from advertising. However, the spokesman for Fianna Fáil assured <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> on 3 June 1990 that everything was fine and he denied that Mr. Oliver Barry was &ldquo;a significant contributor&rdquo;. He said: &ldquo;Mr. Barry participates in party functions such as auctions and raffles and donates relatively small four figure amounts.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members may recall that the first head of news at Capital Radio at that time, Mr. Patsy McGarry, wrote in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 20 July 1999 about the &ldquo;tantrum&rdquo; thrown by the then Minister, for<Col N="1484" /> mer Deputy Burke, when the new radio station broadcast comments by Deputy Éamon Gilmore on a planning story. Out of earshot he told Mr. McGarry: &ldquo;&lsquo;Did you not know that one of the reasons we set up these new stations was to get people like that off the air?' Burke then proceeded to cancel Capital's derogation from the 20% news requirement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We must ask how many Oliver Barrys are out there? How many more Ansbacher holders are out there? One of the most horrifying aspects from the point of view of the public watching what has gone on in recent days is that essential documents and records have been deliberately destroyed. If it is the case that they have been deliberately destroyed, then others who are also Ansbacher depositors can sleep easy in their beds.</P>
    <P>We should remember the row in the House when the Government opposed a motion from the Labour Party to have the Ansbacher deposits included in the remit of the tribunal in the first place. Instead of the disgraceful contempt we have seen so far for the House and the mantra of &ldquo;hit me now with the peace process in my arms&rdquo;, the Fianna Fáil Party could have lectured us, if they chose, on the importance of public service. They could have pointed to the patriotic performance of former Fianna Fáil Leaders, but they should have admitted that serious damage is being done to politics arising from the activities of half a dozen senior Fianna Fáil personnel who are helping the various tribunals with their inquiries at present. Yet, there was not one word of criticism tonight.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, in an arrogant speech that certainly was not written by any of her civil servants, said we should leave behind the shadow of unsubstantiated innuendo. Deputy Carey said that as soon as he finds out what is going on, he will condemn them but he will not condemn now.</P>

      <P>If we do not know enough about the damage that is being done in the eyes of ordinary citizens to the State and practice of politics, we have learned nothing from the last decade. No senior Minister has been present in the House tonight for this debate or purported to answer for the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. We do not know why the Tánaiste has taken a vow of silence on this one. It is markedly different from the stance she has taken so far on this issue and perhaps she should take to heart the words of her Attorney General when he remarked that a party that stands for nothing will stand for anything. It is time the Progressive Democrats looked at the implications of what is happening and forced Fianna Fáil, in the interests of all of us who <Col N="1485" /> believe in public service, to face up to the damage being done to politics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first occasion I have heard Deputy Hanafin speak since her appointment as Minister of State and I wish her well with her new responsibilities.</P>
      <P>However, listening to her speech was extraordinary in relation to what is supposed to be responsible for the pass in which politics finds itself. I thought, when history breaks out in Fianna Fáil, we all have to run. She blamed just about everything except original sin for the actions of her party. I love the phrase: &ldquo;They cannot best the charisma and success of Deputy Bertie Ahern as Taoiseach&rdquo;. This concept of charisma is one for which we have paid a high price. Now nobody wants to know former Taoiseach Charles Haughey and some question whether he was ever a member of Fianna Fáil. I have heard a Minister ask if he ever paid his subscription for membership. Does he carry a card? Maybe he does not exist at all.</P>
      <P>I remember charisma in action. I remember a certain class of person practically breaking each other's ribs to get near him when he was at the height of his powers and his abuse of public office. Let us be clear: when Deputy Hanafin uses a phrase like &ldquo;Fianna Fáil is leading the way&rdquo;&ndash; an unfortunate phrase &ndash; they are leading the way into the tribunals to give evidence, one after the other. One of the phrases people like myself &ndash; who came in to serve in public life &ndash; are unhappy with is the &ldquo;politicians' tribunal.&rdquo;  It is time we spoke directly. There is at least an over-representation of politicians from one party being investigated by the tribunal.</P>
      <P>None of this happened by accident. If one goes back to the 1960s when much of this began, a culture was created within a party of many fine achievements and which has many fine members today. I am making no accusations against all members of Fianna Fáil, but the cult and culture that surrounded Mr. Haughey in his day &ndash; and all the others &ndash; were sustained by something outside membership of this House. It was sustained by the kind of people one saw in attendance, the kind of people anxious to be acolytes. They were people from the shady end of the building industry who were not interested in making fast money from building or rentals. They were people who had perhaps not built at all for some time but who had bought land where building might take place and then sold it again. They were always around. The motion is about this: how could a couple of innocents be sustained in this field of people behaving in a particular way? We are asked to believe that the person who is now Taoiseach knew nothing. It was going on all around him and he knew nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One moves on to different matters. When I was a Minister with responsibility for broadcasting I <Col N="1486" /> was pilloried for different things I did in relation to RTE, such as abolishing the cap. Some of those making prime appearances before the tribunal are those who said they would put manners on RTE. Their chief priests in attendance said: &ldquo;We will soon have our own station to tell our own story&rdquo;. I loved the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin's comment: &ldquo;They will get their answer from the opinion polls&rdquo;. If the people want to say yes to that, let it be known that there are some of us who will say no. I would not want that. It is a great reflection if that behaviour is acceptable.</P>
    <P>Again, let us be frank. There are people who have worked all their lives, paying their tax week in, week out and who have taken lectures. In the 1980s they took lectures from someone who was living like the last days of the Borgias. In the Hanafin analysis this is some kind of frailty that is human and that breaks out in the best of parties in even the greatest countries. Dear, dear. We are going to have a suggested general confession from all elected representatives as a substitute for those appearing before the tribunal and those who, miraculously, were never touched by any of it. It is something that stretches credulity nearly as far as the immaculate conception.</P>
    <P>In relation to the matters coming before us, there is another sinister undercurrent &ndash; the suggestion that maybe all these tribunals are taking place under flawed legislation, that they are lasting a long time, that they are costly and what will come out of them in the end? The answer to that is to look at how long they got away with it. Is it in the public interest, no matter how long it takes or how much it costs, to have buried the truth? People ask why all this was not discovered earlier. I remember nearly 20 years ago when people were digging for the truth in relation to the background of some of the matters now being investigated. The answer is that they were well buried and well hidden with the collusion of alleged professionals who had sold their professional skills to a task of deceit, fraud and criminality. What would a person in an unemployed centre, who elects a Member to the House, say if they were told they were just the same as a person elected by those who represent the banks? </P>
    <P>The secret in the opinion polls is that the public paid a heavy price for the suggestion that perhaps because this was going on for some people it might, at the end of the day, be for the good of the country also. That was the feeling at the time and there is still a lot of it left. It would suit everyone if it could be said that all politicians are the same. Not all politicians are the same and not everyone in Fianna Fáil is the same. However, Fianna Fáil would have been better off coming into the House and saying that the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste would answer the questions that have been asked and that they wish to detail the meetings and questions that took place and the information and answers that resulted. This is not <Col N="1487" /> what we are getting; instead we are getting rhetorical flourishes and, as Deputy Rabbitte said, the disgraceful notion of &ldquo;hit us now with the North under one oxter and the new agreement under the other&rdquo;. There was always a moment of terror in Northern Ireland when Fianna Fáil used to bang the green drum as the reverberations all over the island were singularly less than helpful.</P>
    <P>What we must do in relation to the motion is to restore the practice of public service. I have been very careful to acknowledge the contribution made by all political parties, but I find it a bit much to listen to all this wind, which is a mixture of corners, tackling the man and not the ball, charisma, success and the Taoiseach. It is a lot more than that. The time has come for us to know clearly and unequivocally what the Taoiseach asked the Deputy in question, the answers he got and the circumstances in which he got them and what the Tánaiste knew. There is a kind of smokescreen that it will pass, that people will get tired of it and that suddenly people will awake and it will have been a bad dream and people will be back to the good old party. We are not talking about &ldquo;shadows of persistent and unsubstantiated innuendo&rdquo;. We are talking about malpractice, destruction of public trust, damage to the civil society and enormous evasion. There is also the suggestion that there is such innocence prevailing at the top of the party responsible for all of this that they are somehow or other separated so well from reality that even if it were true they would not know it.</P>

      <P>On 8 November 1998 the Bausch and Lomb company in Waterford, a considerable company employing 1,400 people, decided to sell off its subsidiary plant known as Ray Ban, which manufactures sunglasses &ndash; it was described in a Minister's reply to me at that time as a premium fashion eye wear business &ndash;  to an Italian company, Luxottica. Since November 1998 the number of jobs at the Ray Ban enterprise has decreased from 350 to 95 &ndash; last week the company announced it was divesting itself of a further 165 jobs, which will reduce the number of staff to 95. There had been an erosion of the employment level in the interim although, I understand, an assurance was given at the time of the purchase that the operation would be kept going. The company pledged its allegiance and commitment to Waterford in November 1998 and again as late as November 1999 when the 165 members of staff were put on short time. Short time did not come <Col N="1488" /> about but the redundancies did and that was much more critical.</P>
      <P>The employment position in Waterford city is dire. I wish to draw to the Minister's attention that there are 3,372 on the live register in Waterford, which represents 14% of the workforce, virtually three times the national average. People ask what the Government and the IDA are doing about it. An IDA office which was located in Waterford up to three years ago moved to Cork. We were told it was for the betterment of Waterford that it would be a more efficient office and would have much stronger personnel. Our experience has been quite the contrary. We have not had any new industries in Waterford city in recent years. Any increase in employment has been due to expansion of existing industries, such as Bausch and Lomb. The people of Waterford would like to know when Waterford will get new industries. Can any of the jobs in the Ray Ban division be preserved? Can the IDA persuade the Italian company, Luxottica, to remain in Waterford in considerable force? What remains is an operation called lens edging, which I do not fully understand. There is a view that this may be the end of the road for the factory in its entirety.</P>
      <P>Promises have not been kept over the past 15 months. People have become sceptical about the future because the plant involved was highly cost effective and was brand new. It is difficult to believe it was not good enough to compete with a similar plant in Italy, America or elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to take an interest in west Waterford and, in particular, to look at what has happened in the town of Tallow where there was an industry called Flair Plastics Limited which is virtually on the point of closure. Some 80 people were employed there until 18 months ago, now a mere five people are looking after the stock and the premises. Will the Minister, Deputy McDaid, make a note for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who is not present, about the situation in Tallow which is an underprivileged area where unemployment is rife. Perhaps the IDA would put its resources at the disposal of the people of Tallow where there are a number of small enterprises which would like to use the factory that was at the disposal of Flair Plastics Limited. If Flair Plastics Limited cannot continue, perhaps others in the locality could be given the opportunity to use the premises in a manner which is conducive to employment.</P>

      <P>I apologise for the unavoidable absence of the Tánaiste and on her behalf I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. The Tánaiste shares fully the Deputy's disappointment at the announcement of the loss of a further 165 jobs at the Luxottica plant in Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1489" /> Luxottica is engaged in the manufacture of Ray Ban sunglasses in Waterford. The plant, which was formerly owned by Bausch and Lomb, was established in Ireland in 1982. As part of a corporate restructuring Bausch and Lomb, primarily a medical-pharma company making eye care products, sold its Ray Ban division to Luxottica in June 1999.</P>
    <P>Luxottica Group is a public Italian company based in northern Italy and quoted on the New York Stock Exchange. It is the world leader in the design, manufacture and marketing of high quality eyeglass frames and sunglasses in both the mid and premium price range. Luxottica's fully-owned North American subsidiary, LensCrafters, is the largest optical retail chain in the world. As at 31 December, LensCrafters operated 861 stores throughout the United States and Canada.</P>
    <P>Following the acquisition of the sunglass plant, a restructuring of the Luxottica Group has resulted in the closure of plants in Mexico and the USA. Today the company has six manufacturing plants, five in Italy plus the Waterford facility. Discussions between IDA and senior management with Luxottica at the time of the acquisition indicated positive plans for the future of the Waterford plant with particular focus on maximising Ireland's corporate tax rates. Prior to the end of 1999, 75 redundancies were announced for the Waterford plant which also had an extended close down over the Christmas-new year period.</P>
    <P>Since then a further review of the Irish operation has shown that the Waterford plant cannot compete with the economies of scale available to Luxottica through its centralised Italian sunglasses-frame manufacturing plants. The company now plans to restructure the Irish production plant to fully align it with the group's mainstream manufacturing methods and efficiency standards. This will involve the transfer of frame production from Waterford to Italy with the Irish plant specialising in lens edging and finishing. This restructuring will reduce the Irish workforce to 95 employees, which the company hopes will be achieved mainly through voluntary redundancy.</P>
    <P>The restructuring of the Irish operation will mean that the Waterford plant will specialise in lens edging and finishing for the Luxottica range of products, which include the top international designer sunglasses. The company is planning to invest in extra equipment to enable the Waterford facility to develop this specialisation. The company has said that the Irish facility remains a vital part of the group's manufacturing operations and the skills and expertise which the Waterford workforce brought to Luxottica are highly appreciated.</P>
    <P>On a more positive note for Waterford, expansions of both Allied Signal and AOL Europe were announced in 1999. These expansions are to create over 500 jobs and are a significant develop<Col N="1490" /> ment for Waterford and an endorsement of the success of the companies' existing facilities there.</P>
    <P>The key objective is to ensure that alternative employment is found for those workers who are to lose their jobs at Luxottica. FÁS has already been in touch with Luxottica's general manager and has offered to put a comprehensive range of FÁS options at the disposal of the company and its employees. These include individual guidance, counselling and registration, access to the full range of FÁS vacancies, access to the current range of FÁS courses and special training course which will be provided in consultation.</P>
    <P>The prospects for attracting new industry into the Waterford region are excellent. In this regard, NTL, the company which bought Cablelink last year, announced yesterday that it is to set up a customer management centre in Waterford City. This project will employ 250 customer service telesales and technical support staff and recruitment is to start immediately. I will bring the matter raised by the Deputy to the attention of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, will appreciate the reasons for my bringing this to the attention of the House. The matter refers to the case of a constituent who has been in receipt of the old disabled person's maintenance allowance, introduced in the 1960s, arising from an unfortunate illness. He has received the payment up now.</P>
      <P>In recent years the name of the disabled person's maintenance allowance has been changed to disability allowance. The then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa &ndash; who was my colleague in Government &ndash; and I gave an undertaking when the appropriate legislation was introduced to the House that there would not be any change in the manner in which people would be assessed and treated under the new system, that is, that people would not be disadvantaged as a result of the introduction of the disability allowance.</P>
      <P>However, during the summer it emerged that a review was taking place with regard to this case on the basis of an assessment of the applicant's means and it was determined that his payment would be reduced. I challenged this decision by way of a parliamentary question and the matter rested until the applicant reached old age pension age, which he did recently. Given the new situation, it now transpires that the means of assessment in respect of old age pension differs from the means of assessing disability allowance. The result is a considerable reduction in this constituent's entitlements. His pension will be reduced from approximately £114 per week to approximately £92 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1491" /> This is a peculiar outcome at a time when the country is enjoying prosperity, when everybody expects more and when everybody with a justifiable case is making it with vigour. It is ironic that in this case a person who has suffered from severe disability for the past 30 year should, at the start of the new millennium, have to face a reduction in his income for a reason that escapes me. A clause has always been applied in determining social welfare entitlements of those in receipt of a means tested payment and who would qualify for one or two payments at a given time, to the effect that the qualifying person would receive the higher of the two incomes and would not, in consequence, suffer a reduction in income.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister convey to his colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, the serious trauma caused by the reduction in benefit in this case? The man in question lost both legs through an illness in 1967-68. He has lived when others would have given up, has learnt to walk again with artificial limbs and has continued to try and live a normal life, in so far as he can. Given the state of the economy it would be a huge travesty of justice and a sad reflection on us all if he were to receive a reduction in benefit given his pain and effort during that period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. Unfortunately he is unable to be here due to another engagement. On his behalf I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. As it entails a complex reply I assure him I will raise it with the Minister when I next meet him.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the determination of entitlement under the statutory old age non-contributory pension scheme, or entitlement under any other statutory social welfare scheme, is not a ministerial function. Under the relevant legislation, these are matters for deciding officers and, in the event of appeal, for appeals officers, appointed in accordance with the provisions of the Social Welfare Acts. Nonetheless, the Department can clarify for the Deputy the basis on which the pension rate applicable to the person concerned has been determined and the reasons for the change on his previous payment position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned, who had been in receipt of disability allowance at the maximum rate of £114.70 per week, reached pension age of 66 years on 6 January 2000. Disability allowance had been in payment to him at the maximum rate because his previous entitlement under the former disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme was preserved under special transitional arrangements. These arrangements were put in place on the transfer of existing disabled person's maintenance allowance recipients to the new dis<Col N="1492" /> ability allowance scheme administered by the Department.</P>
    <P>These transitional provisions are limited to the duration of the claimant's entitlement under the disability allowance scheme. They do not extend to subsequent entitlements arising under other social welfare schemes, such as old age non-contributory pension, which are effectively treated under the legislation as a new claim to be assessed in accordance with standard means rules. The person concerned has now been awarded an old age non-contributory pension of £92.70 per week with effect from 7 January 2000, by reference to the social welfare legislation pertaining to this scheme. This amount comprises a personal rate of £58.50 and an increase of £34.20 in respect of his wife. The Deputy will be aware that the person concerned has recourse to the appeal process if he is not satisfied with this decision.</P>
    <P>The decision is based on a means assessment of £25.96 a week, deriving from the capital value of a second property owned by him. Under the former health board assessment for disabled person's maintenance allowance purposes, and preserved when the person concerned transferred to disability allowance, his means had been assessed at £4 a week on the basis, it is understood, of the rental income from the second property. The legislative basis for the assessment of means from capital or property for pensions purposes is set out in rule 1(1) of Part II of the Third Schedule to the 1993 Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act. The rule states that in assessing means, account is taken of property owned but not personally used. This is a long-standing provision affecting the assessment of means for old age pension purposes. There is, therefore, no change in practice in the assessment of means from this source for old age pension. Persons receiving disabled person's maintenance allowance in the past would not have been treated any differently when their time came to claim old age pension.</P>
    <P>The legislation is based on the principle that non-contributory pensions, which are financed by the Exchequer out of general taxation, should be related to the person's need. These payments are, therefore, means-tested and the rules for the calculation of means take account of the person's ability to meet his own needs in determining if and to what extent the taxpayer should be called upon to subsidise his income. Under the legislation, the property must be assessed whether or not it is producing an income. If an income is not being derived from a property, the owner has options which it is in his interests to exercise. In the current economic climate it should not be difficult to realise a return from the house property which is at least equal to the assessment in this case. The Deputy will also be aware of substantial improvements in the capital assessment rules which were announced in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>Under the new arrangements which will come <Col N="1493" /> into effect in October this year, the first £20,000 of capital in the case of a married couple will be completely disregarded. In the case of single people, the first £10,000 will be disregarded. This marks a substantial increase on the current capital disregards of £2,000 and £4,000 for a single and married couple respectively. The revised capital assessment method will be extended to unemployment assistance as well as pensions. This will provide a significant increase in capital disregard levels at a cost of £5 million. The Deputy can be assured that the means of the person concerned will be reviewed again later this year in the context of these improved capital assessment rules.</P>
    <P>It should also be pointed out that it is open to the spouse in the circumstances of this case to apply for a carer's allowance. The Department has already arranged to issue an application form to her. In the event that the spouse would be entitled to that allowance, the overall income position of the couple would be improved.</P>

        <i> (Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> In the first five weeks of the new millennium there has been an upsurge in murder and violence unprecedented in the history of the modern Irish State. On the first day of the century a 21 year old was shot dead in Ashbourne, County Meath, and a man has been charged with murder. Only eight days later, on 9 January, the naked body of a teenager was pulled from a Dublin canal. He had been shot in the back of the head and concrete blocks had been tied to his body as an anchor. Two days later the canal yielded up a second body, that of his friend who had been brutally murdered in a similar fashion. News bulletins on Sunday morning, 23 January, told the nation that two people had been murdered in two separate incidents in Limerick and one in Drogheda. On Monday, 31 January, the body of a young man was taken from the River Barrow in Carlow. Two men have been arrested in connection with the find and are helping the Garda with their inquiries. On Saturday last, 5 February, the body of a teenage girl was found badly beaten at Mahon, Cork, and a 17 year old has been charged with murder. In the early hours of yesterday morning the Garda were called to a house in Ardee, County Louth, where a Donegal man had been stabbed to death with the jagged handle of a brush. Last night a patient in St. James's Hospital was brutally stabbed to death and a man connected to the incident was taken into Garda custody and has been charged today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings to ten the number of people who have died in the most violent circumstances &ndash; shot dead, stabbed to death and beaten to death. The statistics for 1999 &ndash; 40 murders, including 11 gangland killings in Dublin &ndash; were alarming and stark enough. However, ten deaths in just over five weeks clearly points to the fact that there is a major crisis in Irish society. We must tackle the <Col N="1494" /> problem on several fronts. We need a public debate about the reasons why so many people are putting such a small premium on human life. We must establish the underlying and real reason why society is increasingly turning to violence to resolve disputes and disagreements.</P>
    <P>We need a political response from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Never has somebody so vocal in Opposition on issues surrounding violence been so silent in Government. I demand that the Minister makes a full statement outlining the measures the Government proposes to confront this new wave of violent crime and murder in society. What has happened to zero tolerance?</P>
    <P>Last week, in reply to a question in the House, a further frightening statistic was unveiled. In the first four weeks of 2000 there have been 34 armed robberies, compared to a total of 48 for the last three months of 1999. In each case the individuals in question made a decision to bring a gun or guns in order to assist in the robbery and to make good their escape in the event they were confronted or resisted. It is quite clear that matters are quickly getting out of control, that we have a crisis on our hands and that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform cannot stand idly by. He must provide whatever resources are necessary in terms of money, ideas, manpower and expertise in order to come to grips with the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the House's concern at the number of deaths in violent circumstances we have had so far this year. We must also remember that behind every one of these tragedies there is a grieving family and our thoughts must be with them.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the number of deaths of persons in violent circumstances to date in 2000 is nine, with detections having been made already in seven of these cases. While obviously the detection rate is commendable it is of little consolation to the victims' families. I have also been informed that a number of persons have been charged in respect of these offences and are awaiting trial. Furthermore, a number of files have been submitted to the law officers whose directions are awaited.</P>
      <P>Some of these crimes are very recent and the House will appreciate that it would neither be appropriate nor helpful for me to go into specific detail or speculate as to the motive behind such crimes. Obviously, it is of paramount importance that nothing is said or done which could interfere with or prejudice the outcome of a Garda investigation into any of these heinous crimes or any likely future prosecutions which may result arising from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally, while I am concerned with the number of these incidents I think it would be wrong at this early stage to be drawing firm conclusions or making assumptions about the overall murder rate for 2000. In relation to the three most recent <Col N="1495" /> deaths I have been informed by the Garda that there is no evidence to suggest there is any connection between them. I am assured that the Garda is actively pursuing those responsible for causing these violent deaths and that all necessary Garda resources are fully deployed in detecting these crimes.</P>
    <P>In relation to claims that there is an escalation in the use of firearms in violent crime, I have been informed by the Garda authorities that they are satisfied there is no evidence of any major increase in firearms on the street, so to speak. While it would not be safe to speculate as to the motives behind any of these particular crimes I can assure the House that lest there be any doubt about it I continue to afford the highest priority to the targeting of drug trafficking and related criminal activity.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware of the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, a flagship measure in my extensive programme of criminal law reform. The House is also familiar with the continued aggressive policy which is being pursued by the Garda Síochána to bring drug traffickers before the courts. As the House is aware, this has led to significant seizures of illegal drugs, the disruption of organised networks and the charging of major criminals. I wish to assure the House that I will continue to ensure that adequate legislation is introduced to respond to whatever criminal threats may emerge in the future.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda that in 1998 and 1997, the last years for which Garda statistics have been published, 38 murders were recorded and 34 were detected in each year. The number of murders recorded in 1998 and 1997 is in fact lower than the numbers recorded in 1996 and 1995, which were 43 and 42 respectively. I note that the detection rate has also improved gradually over time. In 1995, for example, of the 43 murders recorded, 32 were detected. In 1998, however, of the 38 murders recorded, 34 were detected.</P>
    <P>While it is of no consolation to the families of those who have died in violent circumstances, the House will be interested to know that the national murder rate for 1998 is approximately 1.05 per 100,000 of population, the most widely and internationally accepted comparator which is among the lowest in Europe.</P>
    <P>I can inform the House that I have also spoken to the Garda Commissioner to express my concern at the recent number of violent deaths. I assured him that whatever resources he requires will be made available to him to bring the perpetrators of such crimes to justice. The Garda Commissioner informed me that for his part no effort would be spared in solving these crimes.</P>
    <P>Never in the history of the State have more resources been allocated to combating crime, purchasing modern technology and equipment for the Garda Síochána and ensuring Garda personnel is increased. Never in the history of the State <Col N="1496" /> have we had such a major prison building programme to ensure that those guilty of serious offences serve their sentences. The message has clearly gone out via the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda Commissioner and the House that if one commits a serious offence for illicit gain, one is not only in danger of losing one's liberty but also one's illicit assets. While I would prefer if crime figures fell further, it is encouraging that they have fallen by approximately 20% since the Government took office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the Minister's best efforts the amount of funding allocated to youth services and sports clubs over the past three years has been a pittance in comparison to the capital needs of many areas. Most clubs received little or no national lottery capital grants while the Minister was redesigning the sports capital programme. Last year my constituency, which has a population of 80,000, was allocated approximately £300,000. At the same time ongoing research has highlighted high levels of disadvantage and various problems associated with young people in many deprived areas, especially in Dublin.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Dublin Regional Authority and Dublin Employment Pact, there is a deep feeling that deprived areas in Dublin and other urban centres are increasingly sidelined and marginalised. There is growing anger among regional authority members in Dublin and the south-east region at the failure of the Government to recognise the grave needs of deprived areas in their regions, which were recently demoted in EU funding terms.</P>
      <P>Eleven of the 12 most deprived areas in Ireland, with populations of up to 40,000, are located in Dublin. A house to house survey carried out six weeks ago in one parish in my constituency showed, for example, that almost 45% of household heads are unemployed. The 45,000 Dubliners who are on the live register are concentrated disproportionately in deprived areas. The almost inevitable result of the Government's failure to provide community, youth and sports facilities in areas of disadvantage is the growth in juvenile alienation and youth crimes, despite the pleasant words of the Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I highlighted the ongoing plague of joyriding on more than a dozen occasions in the House and it is no accident that this dangerous and vicious deviancy is so prevalent in localities which have been starved of Government support and attention. In addition, the battle against drug addiction is ongoing and it is also felt most severely in such localities as young people drop out of primary school or leave secondary school early. There is only rudimentary support for youth services and none for sports and community clubs and centres. Joyriding is prevalent in two parishes in my constituency. There has been a 20 year campaign for <Col N="1497" /> a dedicated youth building in one parish, which has gone unrecognised, while recently the other parish was left without a youth service for more than five months.</P>
    <P>The deadline for receipt of applications under the new sports capital programme is next Friday and I hope the Minster will strongly assist local youth, sports and community groups with capital funding. Funding of between £2.5 and £3 million has been applied for by groups in my constituency. The Minister must fight in the new Programme for Prosperity and Fairness or the Finance Bill for a budget of at least £50 million to provide support for youth and sports clubs. There is no point in the Minister allocating £10 million because that will not be enough. In addition, endless drudgery is experienced by local sports, youth and community groups in the form of ongoing fundraising and the Minister should address that, possibly in the context of the social economy. Jobs could be provided to support sports and youth clubs.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposals for the national stadium and sports campus and the centre of excellence, which will be a showpiece for our international athletes. The funding for it, which totals £300 million, will be totally misplaced if we do not provide for local community and sports facilities. Would it not be ludicrous if in a few years this impressive national complex was to open a few miles from my home while at the same time the young athletes of Coolock, Kilbarrack, Donaghmede and other districts in my constituency still had to change beside a ditch or in the dark, filthy shell of an old parks pavilion, with a similar scenario applying around the country?</P>
    <P>Approximately £200 million will be provided for disadvantaged areas through PPF but it is critical that a large portion is spent in the youth and sports field. The Department should urgently prepare an audit of the funding needed, especially in the deprived areas of Dublin, so that the Government can honestly say that it has made provision for the youth and sports needs of our disadvantaged children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Broughan for raising this matter as I fully share his concerns that the needs of those who live in areas of social and economic disadvantage are kept to the forefront of our planning and delivery of services throughout the range of initiatives and funding programmes that are in place. A key role of the Department in working with other Departments and agencies is the development of a comprehensive strategy for local development in partnership with local authorities and the voluntary and community sector, with particular focus on the integrated development of the most disadvantaged areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sport is at the heart of the Government's agenda for social inclusion. I wholeheartedly agree with the Deputy that sport and recreational opportunities play a special and key role in combating the problems that spring from social and <Col N="1498" /> economic deprivation. Good quality, well managed and attractive facilities are fundamental elements in effective delivery of sporting opportunities, particularly in areas such as those mentioned by the Deputy. The Government has signalled its commitment to the provision of sport and recreational facilities throughout Ireland by increasing the provision for sports expenditure from £13.5 million in 1997 to more than £49 million this year. The increased provision for 2000 is the largest since such provision was made and includes a trebling in funding for the sports capital programme by the national lottery from £5 million in 1997 to £15.2 million and a fourfold increase in the allocation for swimming pools from £3.5 million in 1997 to more than £15 million. Such funding has increased by more than £45 million in that period.</P>
    <P>Under the sports capital programme in 1999 grants were allocated to 416 projects nationwide. Almost 400 were local projects and sports clubs, youth and community groups and recreational centres received support from the Government to provide much needed facilities. More than £5 million was allocated to sport, youth and community facilities in Dublin. Special priority under the programme is given to projects located in designated disadvantaged areas in line with Government policy and aimed at improving quality of life and increasing participation in sport and recreation in these areas.</P>
    <P>The 2000 sports capital programme was advertised in early December 1999 and the closing date for the receipt of application forms is 5 p.m. on 11 February. It is open to local community-based projects to apply for funding and I look forward to a substantial number of applications, particularly from clubs and organisations operating in areas of disadvantage. The Deputy will also be aware of a wide range of programmes and interventions aimed at tackling social inclusion, drug abuse and crime. Another of these is the young people's facilities and services fund which will provide more than £35 million to aid in the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities and services in disadvantaged areas. To date, a total of 329 individual projects have been approved for funding. These include 96 capital projects entailing the building, renovation or fitting out of 49 youth facilities, 21 sports clubs and 19 community centres to provide suitable accommodation for programmes and services geared towards the most at risk young people in the area.</P>
    <P>Funding has also been approved for the development of a number of purpose built youth centres which will provide a focal point for youth activities in areas such as Tallaght, Ballymun, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown. Also approved is the appointment of 79 youth and Outreach workers as well as five sports workers to encourage greater involvement of target groups in sport and recreational activities.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Broughan for raising this <Col N="1499" /> important issue and assure him that the needs of young people in areas of social and economic disadvantage will remain at the core of the Government's planning and implementation pro<Col N="1500" /> grammes. Last year I allocated more to these type of facilities than was allocated in 1995, 1996 and 1997.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.12 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 9 February 2000.</P>

    </Qst>
    <P>(Dr. Woods): Certain Montessori teachers are granted restricted recognition to teach in certain special schools and classes. In addition, my Department has recently decided that such teachers are also eligible to apply for and take up positions as resource teachers for pupils with special needs.</P>
    <P>The Montessori teachers who are entitled to restricted recognition are teachers with the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full time course in the Association Montessori Internationale, AMI, College, Mount St. Mary's, Milltown, Dublin 14, and teachers trained in St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, Montessori, who have successfully completed the diploma or degree in humanities in Montessori education recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards.</P>
    <P>Montessori teachers are not currently recognised as fully qualified primary teachers or as remedial teachers who also may be required to teach the full primary curriculum to the pupils to whom they are assigned.</P>
    <P>Issues related to the training and qualifications of primary school teachers are kept under review. At present the existing pre-service training of primary teachers is being reviewed. A working group undertaking that review is expected to complete its work before the summer. Following completion of that review it is proposed to put in place a review of the recognition of Montessori teachers as primary teachers and for remedial teaching.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Early Childhood Education, which was published on 17 December 1999, sets out a range of proposals concerning educational provision for children aged from birth to six years. The White Paper provides for the establishment of an early childhood education agency, ECEA. The ECEA will be charged with the detailed implementation of the proposals outlined in the White Paper, including advising the Department as to how other teaching professionals, including Montessori teachers, could be assisted to obtain qualifications which would entitle them to hold mainstream teaching posts in national schools.</P>

      <P>Teacher estimates derived from the national reading surveys indicate that nearly 10% of pupils in fifth class at primary level have serious literacy difficulties. Tackling this serious problem for our young children is one of the top priorities for me, as Minister.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of primary schools already engage in annual assessments of their pupils' reading. There is a deep understanding among teachers already of the importance of regular assessment of their pupils' achievements. To date, schools have mainly used test results for reporting to parents and for the identification of pupils with reading difficulties.</P>
      <P>I am arranging that all primary classes from first to sixth will be supplied with standardised, norm-referenced tests of literacy which teachers will administer to their pupils each year. In addition, teachers will be provided with profiles of pupil achievement in English to complement the standardised tests. Both the tests and the profiles will be distributed to schools during the present school year.</P>
      <P>While the proposal for the assessment of reading using specific instruments on a class by class basis will not be a new departure for teachers, I intend, however, prior to any implementation of this proposal, to hold discussions with representatives of the teaching profession.</P>
      <P>I also intend to conduct a programme of national surveys of English reading at primary level on a regular basis, in conjunction with the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra. I will continue the series of surveys at fifth class level and extend the programme to include pupils at second-third class level.</P>
      <P>The use of particular standardised tests by schools and the system of profiling pupil achievements in English combined will be the basis for the benchmarking and comparative analysis of performance nationally and locally to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>The provision of test materials to schools is just one of a series of initiatives which I am taking to address these serious problems.</P>

The group commenced hearings in May 1998 and I understand that the group is expected to report shortly.</P>
      <P>The question of providing additional facilities for the education and training of physiotherapists will be considered in the light of the report of the expert group.</P>

      <P>At present, my Department collects statistics in relation to the number of pupils with special needs attending special schools and special classes attached to mainstream primary schools. In addition, statistics are also gathered in relation to the number of Traveller children attending primary schools where a resource teacher for Travellers is sanctioned.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently in the process of planning to extend the range of data gathered on special needs pupils as part of the development of a comprehensive database on individual primary school pupils. The new database will provide critical information to support the implementation of policies in the special needs area targeting specific and appropriate supports to those children most in need. It will also provide data for research and policy development purposes.</P>
      <P>The development of a database on all primary school pupils is a very significant undertaking involving the collection and processing of information on 450,000 pupils from more than 3,300 primary schools. It will take at least three years to put the full database in place and an allocation of £4.5 million has been provided for this purpose over the next three years, including £500,000 in the current year.</P>
      <P>The IT unit of my Department is currently preparing a development plan for the project and it is intended to implement a first phase in a pilot group of schools during the coming school year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 142 together.</P>
      <P>In October 1996 my Department published a manual Safety in School Science: A Code of Practice and issued it to all schools. It contains general guidelines for best practice in school science, including a section on laboratory organisation and management which deals with matters such as storage, stock control and waste disposal.</P>
      <P>At the same time, my Department published a manual which it commissioned from Forbairt entitled Safety in the School Laboratory: Disposal of Chemicals. This manual gives clear guidelines on the disposal of individual chemicals which are commonly found in school science laboratories. The manual explains how most of these chemicals may be safely disposed of in schools in accordance with the instructions given. My Department also contracted Forbairt to operate a help-line to further assist schools at that time.</P>
      <P>To assess the range and volume of chemicals, a questionnaire was issued to all second level schools. They were asked to identify and report on the amount of certain chemicals which are no longer required for school purposes and which could not be disposed of by the school in accordance with the guidelines given. The completed returns were collated and analysed by the curriculum development unit, CDU, of City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee. A report by CDU of this analysis was issued to all schools in February 1998.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the results of the survey, my Department, in conjunction with CDU and the Health and Safety Authority, arranged for a training programme to provide further assistance and advice for all second level schools on disposal and storage issues. The programme was conducted in April and June 1998 for science teachers from all second level schools. It was intended that this training programme would enable schools to review further their chemical stocks, to arrange for the safe storage of chemicals which will be required for future use and to arrange for the disposal of unwanted chemicals which can be disposed of safely by schools in accordance with the guidelines already given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although it remains the direct responsibility of school authorities to manage their stocks of <Col N="1505" /> chemicals and ensure the safety of students, staff and property, my Department has recognised that a co-ordinated strategy is required to deal with the problem of unwanted chemicals which cannot be disposed of within schools. It has carried out a pilot exercise with 19 community and comprehensive schools in the Dublin area to engage disposal contractors to identify and remove hazardous chemicals.</P>
    <P>I understand that the operation for the disposal of chemicals went smoothly and that the participating schools expressed general satisfaction with the outcome. All aspects of the pilot study are being evaluated in detail at present with a view to putting a comprehensive strategy in place in this area.</P>

      <P>The dissemination of the substance misuse prevention education programme for primary schools, Walk Tall, commenced in January 1999. The target was to disseminate the programme to primary schools generally over a period of two years. At the end of 1999 the programme had been introduced to approximately 1,150 primary schools, about one third of the total number of primary schools. The dissemination process continues during the current year.</P>
      <P>The process will be reviewed in May next, and if it appears then that the target needs to be revised it is my intention that provision be made to continue the dissemination in 2001 until all primary schools have had the opportunity to introduce the programme.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the primary school programme, Walk Tall, was evaluated independently during its two year development phase in a small group of 26 primary schools. The evaluation outcomes were positive and it was decided to introduce the programme to primary schools generally.</P>
      <P>At post-primary level the substance misuse prevention education programme, On My Own Two Feet, had been introduced in approximately 570 post-primary schools, representing 75% of the total of schools at second level, at the end of 1999. The dissemination of this programme commenced in early 1995 and has continued each year since. No particular target timescale was set for the dissemination of this programme to post-primary schools generally. Following on a report from the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, it is intended that social, personal and health education, SPHE, including substance misuse prevention education, will be phased in as part of the core curriculum at junior cycle over a three year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1506" /> The implementation of the On My Own Two Feet programme was evaluated independently during its development phase in a small group of post-primary schools. The outcome of this evaluation was positive and, therefore, it was decided to introduce the programme to post-primary schools generally.</P>
    <P>The feedback from schools availing of both Walk Tall and On My Own Two Feet is very favourable in terms of meeting student needs and in terms of the value of the in-service training support provided.</P>
    <P>I agree that programmes such as these need to be reviewed at regular intervals. However, on the basis of experience to date, I am satisfied that the programmes referred to are succeeding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the practice in recent years to increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. The reckonable income limits for the 1999-2000 academic year were increased by 4.6%, based on the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March 1997 to March 1998. The increase in the reckonable income limits was also applied to the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study. In such cases, for the 1999-2000 academic year, the reckonable income limits may be increased by £2,160 where there are two such children, £4,320 where there are three, and so on by increments of £2,160.</P>
      <P>Similarly in relation to the value of the grant the practice in recent years has been to increase third level maintenance grants in line with inflation as measured by the change in the consumer price index for the period mid-February to mid-February each year.</P>
      <P>This approach will ensure that the real value of maintenance grants is maintained. The question of providing further additional increases to the value of maintenance grants can only be considered having regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector. I would point out to the Deputy that over 40% of third level students qualify for maintenance grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, this Government's priority in relation to student support has been to fulfil the commitment given in the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium to introduce equitable support for students attending PLC courses. This commitment has been honoured through the introduction of a <Col N="1507" /> maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate courses with effect from the 1998-99 academic year.</P>
    <P>The position of mature students in general and independent mature students in particular has also been addressed under the student support schemes. The rate of maintenance grant payable is determined by reference to the distance from the student's normal residence to the college which s/he is attending. In the case of independent mature students, their normal residence is taken as their address while in attendance at college. Accordingly, a large proportion of independent mature students only qualified for the lower adjacent rate of grant. With effect from the current academic year, all eligible mature students will qualify for the higher non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant.</P>
    <P>The need to target resources at those most in need is well recognised and underpins this Government's approach to tackling disadvantage. There is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan. This fund will provide for additional financial support for disadvantaged students on top of the existing maintenance grants schemes. I am developing proposals in relation to these financial supports and I will be announcing the details of the new arrangements in due course.</P>

      <P>Since 1997 the funding allocated to primary and second level schools has been increased substantially in accordance with the Government's commitment to giving education a clear priority in the allocation of resources as set out in the policy document An Action Programme for the Millennium. However, the available data does not facilitate valid comparisons to be made between the levels of grants payable by my Department and the actual costs of running schools.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the standard capitation grant at primary level was increased by £5 in 1998 and £10 in 1999 which brought the standard grant to £60 per pupil. This constitutes a 33% increase over the period. Schools with enrolments of 60 pupils or less receive a minimum grant of £3,600. In addition, the grant is being increased by a further £11 this year. In relation to voluntary secondary schools, the standard per capita grant was increased to £184 from £177 last year with a further increase of £8 planned for this year. Budgetary allocations to the other second-level sectors are increased on a <i>pro rata </i>basis.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that these increases represent a meaningful response to the need for increased funding from schools generally. I am committed to improving further the funding position of primary and second level schools in the context of forthcoming budgets and in light of available resources.</P>

These figures in relation to activity levels of children are encouraging.</P>
      <P>The revised primary school curriculum issued to schools in 1999 recommends that a minimum of one hour per week be devoted to physical education.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the quality of the transition year programme can vary from one school to another. This is to be expected since the transition year is now offered in over 500 schools, and since the school itself is responsible for the choice of curriculum. The programme guidelines issued by my Department set the broad parameters within which transition year programmes operate. These guidelines allow schools considerable freedom. This freedom offers schools a necessary opportunity to devise creative curricula and learning experiences for their pupils.</P>
      <P>A major evaluation of the transition year programme was carried out by the inspectorate of my Department in 146 schools offering the programme in 1996. This showed that most schools offering the programme used this freedom responsibly and creatively. Under the heading Quality of Teaching and Learning, 55% of schools evaluated scored &ldquo;creditable&rdquo; or &ldquo;distinctive&rdquo;. Weaknesses emerged, however, in the areas of assessment of pupils' work, where 19% of schools evaluated were considered to be &ldquo;weak&rdquo;, and evaluation of the programme by the school, where 25% of schools &ldquo;needed to do more work&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has followed through on the recommendations issued to schools as part of the report on the 1996 evaluation in a variety of ways: support work in schools by the transition year curriculum support service has been intensified in the areas diagnosed as weak; the transition year programme has been evaluated on an ongoing basis by the inspectorate. Since September 1998, 30 transition year programmes have been inspected; circular M1/00, recently issued to schools, seeks to firm up schools' practice in the implementation of the transition year programme under the following headings &ndash; the need for each school to produce an annual, written transition year programme; the need for each school to ensure that all transition year students complete a full school year; the need for schools to devise curricula specific to the programme and not to treat the year as year one of a three year leaving certificate programme; the advisability for schools of making full use of the transition year <Col N="1510" /> curriculum support service and of reading the service's publications for schools.</P>
    <P>A document called Writing the Transition Year Programme has recently issued to schools offering the programme. This was produced jointly by the inspectorate of my Department and the transition year curriculum support service.</P>

      <P>In order to be fully recognised to teach at primary level, teachers must have undertaken a recognised primary teaching training course and possess a recognised primary teaching qualification. Such a qualification can usually be achieved by a person graduating from one of the recognised teacher training courses in the colleges of education, including the post-graduate conversion courses, or by a primary teacher <Col N="1511" /> trained abroad achieving the necessary level of competence in the Irish language.</P>
      <P>However, in order to overcome the current shortage of primary school teachers a scheme has been implemented to pay persons at the trained rate of pay who are working in a temporary capacity in primary schools; possess a primary degree and a higher diploma in education; and have obtained a grade C or higher in the higher level leaving certificate.</P>
      <P>The arrangements outlined above have been put in place for this school year as a short-term measure to overcome the difficulties caused by the shortage of fully qualified primary school teachers. It is expected that by paying such persons at the trained rate of pay, it will be attractive for them to teach in primary schools. While it is accepted that they are not qualified primary school teachers, it is considered to be the best option in resolving the current difficulties in the short-term.</P>
      <P>In addition to the measure outlined above, last year arrangements were put in place for primary degree holders with a higher diploma in education to be paid at the trained rate of pay in respect of any substitute work which such persons undertook. It is not a requirement for persons with such qualifications who are engaging in substitute work to possess a grade C in Irish as substitute work is normally of a much shorter duration than temporary work.</P>

      <P>The clause in the higher education grants scheme, referred to by the Deputy, precludes candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and are pursuing a second post-graduate qualification from receiving a grant in respect of the second post-graduate course. An exception is made in the case of candidates who, on completing a one year post-graduate course which has not led to the conferral of a qualification, are admitted to the second year of a post-graduate course. Grant aid for post-graduate students, under the scheme, is limited to a maximum of four years.</P>

    <P>A number of cases have been brought to the attention of my Department to the effect that, where a student might otherwise be eligible to <Col N="1512" /> receive a grant, this clause may be unduly restrictive, especially where a student has obtained, possibly after one year's study, a qualification at one post-graduate level and then wishes to progress to a higher level of post-graduate study.</P>

      <P>My Department has also provided the institutes with additional resources to enable them to expand existing programmes where possible. Extra staff have been sanctioned and additional funding is being provided to meet the cost of extra courses. In the two financial years 1998 and 1999 a total of £6 million of additional recurrent funding was provided to fund additional courses. A further £5 million extra is being provided this year. As a result of the measures taken to date the number of apprentices catered for in the educational system has increased from approximately 4,000 in 1997-98 to 6,700 in 1998-99 and to about 7,200 in the current academic year.</P>

      <P>Members of the Public Service Executive Union in my Department voted in favour of industrial action with effect from 17 January 2000 in pursuit of a staffing claim. Under the terms of the industrial action, the union has instructed its members not to carry out the following work: answering representations from public representatives; answering parliamentary questions; dealing with speeches and information notes for the Minister, Ministers of State and the Secretary General of the Department; dealing with new schemes introduced since 1 January 1999 where the required staffing resources have not been provided.</P>
      <P>At a meeting held with the union on Tuesday, 1 February, my Department clarified the position of management in relation to the allocation of additional staffing and has responded in writing to a number of specific queries raised by the union. The union is currently consulting with its members in Tullamore, Athlone and Dublin and aims to complete the process by tomorrow, Wednesday, 9 February. I wish to assure the Deputies that my Department is making every effort to bring about an early resolution of the dispute.</P>

      <Quest>the extent to which the special needs of pupils are being met in primary and second level schools to include assistance in overcrowded classrooms, psychological and other services, with particular reference to disadvantaged areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>All children with special needs, including those from disadvantaged areas, have access to a range of special support services at primary and second level.</P>
      <P>Where the special need is of a serious nature, such children can be catered for in special schools or in special classes attached to mainstream schools. At present, there are 100 special schools and 300 special classes. Each of these facilities is dedicated to a particular disability group. Each operates at a special reduced pupil teacher ratio and the pupils are also supported by child care assistants allocated by my Department. Children attending special schools and special classes also attract increased rates of capitation funding.</P>
      <P>Where the special need is of a less serious nature, children can be catered for on a fully integrated basis in mainstream classes with the support, if necessary, of resource teachers and/or child care assistants. Arising from a Government decision in October 1998 all special needs children within the primary system now have an automatic right to the support services they need to enable them to reach their full potential within the primary system. As a result of this development, special needs children within the primary system are now supported by 329 resource teachers and 937 child care assistants.</P>
      <P>At second level, special needs children have the support of 239 resource teachers and 68 child care assistants.</P>
      <P>Decisions on the placement of individual children and the nature and level of special support provided in each case are based on the professionally assessed need of each child and are in line with the recommendations of the special education review committee.</P>
      <P>The role of the resource teacher is to support the ordinary class teacher by providing special tuition and guidance to the special needs children. This can sometimes be achieved by withdrawing the special needs children from the ordinary classroom for periods of special tuition. The role of the child care assistant is to help the children in relation to mobility, toiletting etc.</P>
      <P>Ordinary primary schools are generally staffed to operate at a maximum class size of 30 pupils. However, a maximum class size of 29 pupils operates in the case of primary schools with disadvantaged status. Disadvantaged schools which are included in the urban element of the breaking the cycle of disadvantage initiative receive further staffing to enable them to operate their junior classes at a maximum of 15 pupils. An analysis of class sizes at second level indicates an average class size of 22.3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A psychological service is currently provided to all second level schools. However, the psychological service provided at primary level is still at the development phase. I am aware of the importance of ensuring that children with special educational needs have ready access to a psychological service. Schools in disadvantaged areas are being prioritised for access to the service in the <Col N="1515" /> development phase. On 1 September 1999 my Department established a dedicated National Educational Psychological Service. The process of recruiting a substantial number of additional psychologists to this service is almost complete. It is envisaged that all primary schools will have access to the psychological service at the end of a five-year period and most will have access before that time.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy of my commitment to ensuring that all special needs children have access to the range of services they require, at first and second level, to enable them to reach their full potential in the education system.</P>

      <P>From the earliest planning stages of the whole school evaluation, WSE, pilot project, representatives of the National Parents' Council, Primary, and the National Parents' Council, Post-Primary, were involved in consultations with the inspectorate of my Department. During the WSE <Col N="1516" /> pilot project, 1998-99, parent representatives on school boards of management were met by inspectors at both the WSE pre-evaluation and post-evaluation stages. These meetings afforded parents, through their representatives, the opportunity to give their views on the pilot project process as it related to their particular school.</P>
      <P>In addition, as part of a series of bilateral meetings held with the education partners following the publication of the WSE pilot project report, December 1999, inspectors within my Department had further discussions with representatives of the National Parents' Council, Primary, and National Parents' Council, PostPrimary. Parent representatives gave their overall reactions to the WSE pilot project, and their views as to how the WSE model might be further refined. Both parent organisations have also made written submissions to my Department on WSE.</P>
      <P>The consideration of parents' views on whole school evaluation has been an integral element of WSE from the outset.</P>

      <P>The number of mainstream assistants required for the appointment of an administrative principal will be reduced from eight to seven. This will be implemented from the commencement of the 2000-2001 school year.</P>
      <P>In addition, substitution cover will be allowed for teaching principals in the smaller schools with two to six teachers which have more than 25 pupils.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the need to improve the funding of secretaries and caretakers an additional £2.7 million has been made available this year to extend support to another 650 schools with a total enrolment of 90,000 children.</P>

      <P>The court decisions referred to by the Deputy relate to cases taken by parents on behalf of children with significant special needs and, in particular, children with autism and severeprofound learning disabilities. I can assure the Deputy that my Department takes very seriously its obligations as set down by the High Court and all decisions of the court are fully implemented. Provision which has been put in place for each child is regularly reviewed in order to ensure that it is working in the interests of the child and to the satisfaction of all concerned. In addition my Department, through a range of measures which I would like to outline, takes pro-active steps to ensure that the rights of children to education are provided for and that parents are not required to take legal action to achieve an appropriate level of education for their children. I am pleased to be able to inform the Deputy that the High Court has recently expressed its appreciation of the actions of my Department in this area.</P>
      <P>In November 1998, the Government agreed a major new initiative under which all children within the primary system assessed as having special educational needs arising from disabilities are now entitled to an automatic response to those needs. The response may take the form of full or part-time teaching or child care support, or both, depending on the number of children involved and the level of their special needs. Already, as a result of this initiative, my Department has allocated an additional 225 resource teachers and 638 special needs assistants to cater specifically for children with special needs. The process of deploying the necessary resources to meet the needs of all such children is continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department also formally recognises the distinct educational needs of certain children with autism. Arising from this development, my Department has already established an additional 50 special classes dedicated to the needs of such <Col N="1518" /> children. These classes operate at a pupil teacher ratio of 6:1 and each class also has the support of a special needs assistant. Further classes will be established where the need arises. On the day this initiative was announced the Irish Society for Autism referred to it as representing the end of a 25 year campaign.</P>

      <P>The upgrading of science facilities in second level schools is an important part of the physical sciences initiative, launched in March 1999 and currently being implemented by my Department.</P>
      <P>Since then a survey of the existing provision in school laboratories has been carried out to establish the level of resources required and to provide a basis for allocating additional resources to schools. An analysis of the data obtained from this survey is ongoing. When it is complete resources will be allocated to address identified needs in bringing the basic level of facilities in all our school laboratories up to an acceptable standard.</P>
      <P>Proposals are being drawn up to provide a PC, printer and relevant software to each school specifically for use in the teaching of the sciences.</P>
      <P>A special additional per capita grant of £10 for each pupil studying the physical science subjects at leaving certificate has been paid in 1999. This grant is intended for the purchase and maintenance of basic equipment and henceforth will be paid on an annual basis.</P>

      <P>The rate of transfer from primary school to post-primary school stood at 98.7% for the school year 1997-98, the latest year on which statistics are available. The provision of accurate, up-to-date information or early school leaving is, I believe, an important tool in addressing this problem. My Department is currently in the process of planning the development of a compre<Col N="1519" /> hensive database on individual primary school pupils. The new database will provide critical information, including the rate of transfer from first to second level schools. This database, and its use in strategies to combat early school leaving, will be given statutory underpinning by section 29 of the Education (Welfare) Bill, 1999 which is in the course of enactment in this House.</P>
      <P>The development of a database on all primary school pupils is a very significant undertaking involving the collection and processing of information on 450,000 pupils from more than 3,300 primary schools. It will take at least three years to put the full database in place and an allocation of £4.5 million has been provided for this purpose over the next three years, including £500,000 in the current year. The information technology unit of my Department is currently preparing a development plan for the project and it is intended to implement a first phase in a pilot group of schools during the coming school year.</P>

      <P>Apart from the support which is available to the children in question through the remedial teacher service, such children can be given special additional tuition in integrated settings in mainstream schools. Alternatively, where the condition is of a more serious nature, such children can be catered for in special schools or in special classes attached to mainstream schools which are dedicated to specific learning disabilities, including dyslexia.</P>
      <P>At present, there are four special schools and 16 special classes dedicated to catering for children with the condition in question. Each such facility is staffed to operate at a reduced pupil teacher ratio of 11:1. Children attending such facilities also attract enhanced capitation funding at a rate of £263 for pupils under 12 years of age and £423 for pupils of 12 years or over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Children with dyslexia may also attend mainstream schools on a fully integrated basis with the support, where necessary, of the resource teacher service. Arising from a Government decision in October 1998 all special needs children within the primary system, including children with dyslexia, are now entitled to an automatic response to their needs. The nature and level of the response is dictated by the assessed needs of the individual child. As a result of this development, special <Col N="1521" /> needs children within the primary system, including children with dyslexia, are now supported by a total of 329 resource teachers.</P>
    <P>At second level, a total of 239 resource teachers are deployed to support special needs children, including the children in question.</P>
    <P>In addition to the range of in-school supports described above, my Department is continuing to support the work carried out by the Association for Children and Adults with Learning Disabilities. In the current year, an allocation of £50,000 is being made to this body.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy's question relates to the five special schools for young offenders operated under the aegis of my Department. The detailed information requested by the Deputy in relation to these facilities is currently being compiled in my Department and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>While every effort is made to accommodate children placed on remand or sentenced to detention by the courts, difficulties do arise from time to time in providing immediate accommodation for individual children in the particular centre nominated by the courts. Generally, such children can be accommodated within a short period in an alternative facility, pending the availability of a place in the centre nominated by the court.</P>
      <P>The measures put forward in the Children Bill, 1999, are intended to address the issue of residential accommodation for children with special care needs and those coming into conflict with the law. This Bill provides for a comprehensive range of early intervention and non-custodial options which are intended to deflect children away from the criminal justice system. The Bill also provides for the establishment of a special residential services board which will play a key role in ensuring the efficient and effective delivery of custodial and non-custodial services for children in need of care or in conflict with the law.</P>
      <P>As part of a series of developments arising under the Children Bill, my Department is currently pursuing a major development plan. This plan envisages the development of additional custodial places for young male and female offenders and a major refurbishment of some of the existing custodial facilities. In parallel with this development, the health authorities are developing a significant number of high support units and special care units to cater for children with special care needs.</P>

      <P>Sections 28 and 29 of the Education Act provide a mechanism to deal with grievances at a local school level, and to deal with appeals on certain issues at a national level, respectively. Neither of these sections has as yet been commenced. It is my intention that they will be both commenced and implemented later this year; in any case, as the Deputy may be aware, the Education Act provides that all sections of the Act must be commenced by December of this year. The Deputy may also be aware that, in a little more than a year since the enactment of the Education Act, 51 of the 59 sections of the Act have already been commenced.</P>
      <P>Sections 28 and 29 are fundamental provisions of the Education Act. It is my intention to provide for their implementation in a structured manner. Accordingly, I hope to prepare a discussion paper shortly, to be circulated amongst all interested parties, to set out my own proposals as to how these sections might best be implemented, and to seek the views of the partners on these proposals.</P>

      <P>My Department is currently planning to extend the range of data gathered on special needs pupils, as part of the development of a comprehensive database on individual pupils. The objective is to develop a national database which will provide critical information on all pupils, including those with special needs, to support the development of policy.</P>
      <P>A total of £4.5 million is being provided to develop this database over the next three years. This includes £500,000 which is being provided in the current year. The IT unit of my Department is currently preparing a development plan for the database project and it is intended to implement the first phase in a pilot group of schools during the coming school year. It is anticipated that the project will use the latest internet-based technologies to facilitate the convenient transfer of data to my Department from schools.</P>
      <P>Arising from a Government decision of October 1998, all children with special needs within the primary system, including children with dyslexia, now have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs. Since this decision was taken, an additional 225 resource teachers have been allocated to the primary system to support children with special needs, including those with dyslexia. There are now a total of 329 resource teachers in the primary system.</P>
      <P>All primary schools have been advised of this development and have been informed of the information they are required to submit to my Department in support of any application for special education services. The information in question includes particulars of the special needs children in respect of whom support is being sought. Applications for support under this arrangement is already providing significant data on the levels of special need within the system.</P>

      <P>By way of background information, I wish to point out that the revised programme for basic pre-registration nurse education and training which was introduced in October 1994 and fully operational since 1998 is funded by the Department of Health and Children. Successful completion of the three year programme leads to a diploma in nursing studies and students are eligible to register with An Bord Altranais for employment as a nurse. While undertaking the diploma programme, the students' fees are paid by the relevant health agency and they receive an annual non means tested maintenance grant and other supports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children consulted with a number of colleges on the development of accessible degree programmes, which would be open both to nurses graduating under the revised programme and to nurses who graduated under the traditional model of education and training. These programmes were intended to offer post-registration qualifications on a part-time basis. A number of part-time degree programmes have been introduced on a self-financing basis and I understand that it is open to nurses <Col N="1527" /> who are employed by health agencies to apply to their employers for financial support towards the cost of undertaking such courses. Part-time courses do not come within the scope of the free fees initiative. Tax relief is available at the standard rate, under section 475 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, for tuition fees paid by eligible students who are attending approved part-time third level courses.</P>
    <P>The National University of Ireland, Galway, has introduced a one year full-time nursing degree programme for students who have completed the three year nursing diploma programme. As the Deputy will be aware, my colleague the Minister for Health and Children has stated that his Department is not in a position to meet the fees of students undertaking this programme.</P>
    <P>This degree course has not been included within the scope of my Department's free fees initiative. As this matter is at issue in the case of Sarena Tansey and Others <i>v.</i> the Minister for Education and Science, the Minister for Health and Children, the Western Health Board, Ireland, and the Attorney General, I do not consider it appropriate for me to make any further statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>I would, however, refer to the recommendation of the Commission on Nursing that the future framework for the pre-registration education of nurses be based on a four year degree programme, the third year of which will involve a 12-month continuous clinical placement as a paid employee of the health service. The commission further recommended that no third level institution should introduce a pre-registration nursing degree programme before the start of the 2002-03 academic year.</P>
    <P>The Nursing Education Forum has been established to prepare a strategy for the implementation of the new four year pre-registration nursing degree programme for the intake of nursing students in 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has not carried out research into the cost of maintaining a student at a third level college. The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for higher education grants to assist students to attend full-time third level education. For the 1999-2000 academic year, the rates of the maintenance grants payable are <Col N="1528" /> set at £1,690 at the non-adjacent rate and £676 at the adjacent rate.</P>
      <P>In relation to the value of the grant, I intend to follow the practice of recent years and increase third level maintenance grants in line with inflation as measured by the change in the consumer price index for the period mid-February to mid-February each year. I also intend to continue the practice in recent years of increasing the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage.</P>
      <P>This approach will ensure that the real value of maintenance grants is maintained. The question of providing further additional increases to the value of maintenance grants can only be considered having regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector. In this regard, I would point out to the Deputy that over 40% of third level students qualify for maintenance grants.</P>
      <P>This Government has introduced a maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses with effect from the 1998-99 academic year. Furthermore, the position of mature students in general, and, independent mature students in particular, has also been addressed under the student support schemes. The rate of maintenance grant payable is determined by reference to the distance from the student's normal residence to the college which she or he is attending. In the case of independent mature students, their normal residence is taken as their address while in attendance at college. Accordingly, a large proportion of independent mature students only qualified for the lower adjacent rate of grant. With effect from the current academic year, all eligible mature students will qualify for the higher non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant.</P>
      <P>The need to target resources at those most in need is well recognised and underpins this Government's approach to tackling disadvantage. There is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan. This fund will provide for additional financial support for disadvantaged students on top of the existing maintenance grants schemes. My officials are developing proposals for my consideration in relation to these financial supports and I will be announcing the details of the new arrangements in due course.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 107, 119 and 165 together.</P>
      <P>The Higher Education Authority carried out a study in 1994, which indicated a completion rate of 81% across the university sector, which compares favourably with international experience. The Authority has commissioned the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, to undertake a further detailed study in this area and I understand the study is expected to be completed shortly. The study will consider a range of factors as to their effect on completion rates, such as socio-economic factors, entry requirements, time of enrolment, availability of repeat examinations and the transition from second to third level education.</P>
      <P>The Institutes of Technology have also commissioned a similar study from the Educational Research Centre and a comparable study is also being undertaken by the Dublin Institute of Technology in conjunction with the ERC. My Department is funding these projects. A total of £1.5 million has been earmarked specifically to address the issue of non-completion of courses in the technological sector in 1999 and 2000, of which £0.5 million was spent in 1999. This funding supports and complements the programmes already in place and will have regard to the recommendations of the National Committee on Retention, which was established by the Council of Directors of the Institutes of Technology, on the funding of action projects-programmes both short and long-term based on best practice.</P>
      <P>In addition the institutes of technology have allocated £8 of the students' services charge to projects linked to access and completionnon-completion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A recent study conducted by three institutes of technology showed a non-completion rate among first years across the institutes of technology of approximately 37%. The study showed that there is a wide range of social, personal, academic, institutional and financial factors influencing retention. Failure in examinations can reflect many factors, including the basic ability of students, attendance and commitment, resources and support structures, entry standards, teaching methods and quality. These issues become more critical as the percentage of the age cohort securing places in third level education increases. Other factors include motivation often related to the course preference secured by the student, departure to another institution shortly after <Col N="1530" /> registration, departure from college to repeat the leaving certificate and personal reasons.</P>
    <P>Work is ongoing in all institutes to address the issue of non-completion including the assignment from this year of a dedicated member of the academic staff to work with students and staff to develop mechanisms aimed at improving retention rates. Work is also being done in collaboration with the National Centre for Guidance in Education, the post-primary inspectorate and the Department with a view to developing other positive actions in this area.</P>

      <P>A decision was taken in 1995 by the then Government to phase out fees for students attending full-time undergraduate courses in approved third level colleges. There are no plans to extend the free fees initiative to postgraduate students.</P>
      <P>I have, however, made proposals to the Minister for Finance, in the context of the Finance Bill to be published shortly, to the effect that tax relief should, in certain circumstances, be extended to fees paid by postgraduate students. Postgraduate students who fulfil the conditions of the third level maintenance grant schemes are eligible to have their fees paid by the grant awarding body.</P>

      <P>That Irish is less widely used than English in the community, in the media and in schools generally does have implications for learning and teaching through Irish. Measures have been in place for many years to counteract difficulties which might arise as a result. It is my Department's policy to provide both Irish and English versions of circulars, syllabi and other documents which it issues to schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1531" /> In relation to the certificate examinations, a wide range of services is provided through Irish. Irish versions of leaving certificate and junior certificate examination papers are provided each year. Arrangements are made for examination scripts in Irish to be marked by examiners who are competent in the language. Candidates who wish to use Irish are facilitated in relation to interviews, projects, practicals and aurals. While my Department does not prepare or approve textbooks for use in schools, An Gúm, now part of An Foras Teanga, prepares Irish translations of commercially produced textbooks.</P>
    <P>Article 31 of the Education Act, 1998 is designed specifically to support learning and teaching through Irish. That section, which came into force on 23 December 1999, provides for the establishment of a body of persons who will advise on policies relating to the provision and promotion of education through the medium of Irish. The body will have a specific remit in relation to textbooks and aids to learning and teaching through Irish and to the provision of support services to schools teaching through Irish.</P>
    <P>The Commission on the Points System presented its report on 8 December 1999. It recommends that the practice of allocating bonus marks in the leaving certificate to candidates who answer through the medium of Irish should end. The report represents the culmination of a lengthy period of research, discussion and reflection. This recommendation has given rise to considerable interest and debate among the public. It is important to allow adequate time for the public to become acquainted with the issues raised and with the recommendations contained in the report. I shall consider carefully any possible implications for teaching and learning through Irish before making a final decision on the commission's recommendations.</P>

      <P>Since September 1999, the remedial teacher service has been extended to all primary schools with a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or above. Schools with lower pupil teacher ratios may also seek remedial support from my Department where the level of their particular need warrants such a service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The special education review committee recommended that the general criteria for establishing remedial need should relate to pupils who have been identified as being below the 10th percentile on standardised tests in basic literacy and numeracy. The committee also recommended <Col N="1532" /> that the caseload of a remedial teacher catering for a single school should be 40 pupils. Where the post is shared with one other school, the committee recommended that the caseload be reduced to 38 pupils.</P>
    <P>The school to which the Deputy refers currently shares a remedial teacher with another school. The combined enrolment of the two schools is 374 pupils. In these circumstances, the allocation of one remedial teacher for the two schools is in line with the general approach recommended by the special education review committee.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the needs of the school in question will be fully considered in the event of additional resources becoming available to improve existing remedial services. There are no plans at present to meet representatives of the school referred to by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>April 1999 is the latest date for which figures are available regarding levels of implementation of relationships and sexuality education in primary and post-primary schools. Based on a 66% response rate in respect of primary schools and a 64% response rate at post-primary level, the data, collected in late 1998, indicated that 24% of respondent primary schools were already implementing an RSE programme, while 57% indicated an intention to teach RSE in some or all classes during the 1998-99 school year. Some 67% of respondent post-primary schools were already implementing RSE in some or all classes, and 78% indicated their intention to teach RSE in some or all classes during the school <Col N="1533" /> year. As regards current levels of implementation, it is intended that a follow-up survey will be conducted within the coming months, and I expect to be in a position to publish the results in May of this year.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied significant progress has been made regarding the implementation of RSE in schools and I am committed to monitoring levels of implementation on an ongoing basis. The RSE training support service, which is funded by the in-career development unit of my Department, acts as a support to schools in this work, and continues to organise information seminars for parents and for boards of management; policy development seminars for school-based committees; whole school staff seminars; and the production of resource materials for teachers. In this respect, senior cycle resource materials issued to schools in September 1999 and the final set of materials, for 5th and 6th classes at primary level, are currently being printed and will issue to schools within two weeks. I expect that all of these activities are having a positive influence on the levels of implementation of RSE in schools.</P>
      <P>As regards the time frame within which all schools will be implementing an RSE programme, it is not possible to be definitive in this matter. I recognise that schools are at different stages of implementation and that for many, the policy formulation process, which involves school management, parents and teachers working collaboratively, is a relatively new experience. Feedback from schools has indicated that this process has been extremely valuable for all concerned and I am confident that the range of supports being made to schools will speed up the process of implementation.</P>
      <P>We need to continue our efforts to ensure that all children have access, at the earliest possible stage, to an RSE programme which enables them learn about their own development and about their friendships and relationships with others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 and 146 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two dimensions of the Breaking the Cycle pilot project were introduced to 33 urban and 123 rural schools in 1996 to test models of intervention, which would offset the effects of educational disadvantage, over a five-year period. <Col N="1534" /> The principal features of the urban dimension are the introduction of a maximum class size of 15 pupils in the first four years of the primary school cycle (infants through second classes) and the secondment of a co-ordinator to the Department to support project development in the schools.</P>
    <P>The rural dimension of the project features the clustering of small rural schools and the appointment of a local co-ordinator in each of 25 clusters. All the schools in the project attract an enhanced capitation payment. They receive grants for the purchase of teaching and learning materials and may apply for funding for local in-school and out-of-school activities. The project schools must develop a five-year plan and participate in in-career development for teachers.</P>
    <P>The Education Research Centre, Drumcondra, was commissioned to evaluate the pilot project and carried out a programme of testing in English and mathematics in third and sixth class in the project schools in 1996 to establish baseline data against which future attainment test results will be compared. It is proposed to assess pupils' literacy and numeracy attainment again in May 2000 and the initial impact of the initiative on pupil achievement will be measured in this context. Any extension of the project's provisions to further schools will be considered in light of the final evaluation report.</P>
    <P>On 15 December 1999 the Taoiseach launched The New Deal A Plan for Educational Opportunity. This involves a three-year programme and the allocation of £194 million to tackle educational disadvantage at all levels. The initial step in implementing the programme will involve a survey of all primary schools during the current school term to identify the precise concentrations of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. The allocation of additional resources to the schools will be decided in the light of the survey information and the level and nature of the supports will reflect the level of need identified.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that it is my intention to attach particular priority to the issue of educational disadvantage and to ensure that an efficient and effective system of support for disadvantaged pupils is put in place by my Department.</P>

      <P>The commission on the points system considered the issue of courses that require high points for entry. It accepted that in the case of some professional courses, especially those attracting high unit costs to the State, there is a need to ensure relativity between the number of students admitted to courses and the available employment opportunities. In subjects where the number of places is capped, for example, medicine, the commission recommended that there should be regular review involving open and transparent decision making processes.</P>
      <P>On the wider issue of health care courses generally, the commission recommended that the key bodies involved set up a committee to explore the possibility of a preliminary third level course in life sciences followed by further study in a particular health care discipline. I am considering the report at present and planning for an implementation strategy is under way.</P>
      <P>On the specific issue of pharmacy provision, the Deputy may be aware of the recent study commissioned by the Higher Education Authority on the demand and need for graduates in pharmacy. The study was undertaken on behalf of the Higher Education Authority by Peter Bacon and Associates, economic consultants and details a need for some 50 extra graduates per annum to fill the pharmacy positions that will exist in the medium term. The Higher Education Authority is currently consulting with all interested parties on the findings in the report and will report to me in due course.</P>

      <Quest>the reason for the recent change in the status of Irish in secondary schools; and his views on whether there is a glaring inadequacy in the provision of the necessary basic and back-up services to make teaching through the medium of Irish a viable option for those who engage in it.</Quest>

      <P>From the beginning of the current school year, the requirement for all teachers appointed to permanent teaching posts in post-primary schools to have passed a special examination in Irish was removed. That change was intended to facilitate the mobility of teachers between this jurisdiction and Northern Ireland. Furthermore, the existing requirement, applying, as it did, to all teachers irrespective of whether they were required to use Irish in their work, was seen as unduly negative and counterproductive.</P>
      <P>However, teachers in Gaeltacht schools, in schools where Irish is the normal medium of instruction and those who teach subjects other than Irish through Irish are still required to pass a special examination in Irish. Subject to certain conditions, holders of a degree in Irish are exempt from the requirement. There is no diminution, as a result of this change, in the level of competence in Irish required of those who teach through the language.</P>
      <P>Other measures have been in place for many years to support teaching and learning through Irish. It is my Department's policy to provide both Irish and English versions of circulars, syllabi and other documents which it issues to schools. In relation to the certificate examinations, a wide range of services is provided through Irish. Irish versions of leaving certificate and junior certificate examination papers are provided each year. Arrangements are made for examination scripts in Irish to be marked by examiners who are competent in the language. Candidates who wish to use Irish are facilitated in relation to interviews, projects, practicals and aurals. While my Department does not prepare or approve textbooks for use in schools, An Gúm, now part of An Foras Teanga, prepares Irish translations of commercially produced textbooks.</P>
      <P>Section 31 of the Education Act, 1998, is designed specifically to support learning and teaching through Irish. That section, which came into force on 23 December 1999, provides for the establishment of a body of persons who will advise on policies relating to the provision and promotion of education through the medium of Irish. The body will have a specific remit in relation to textbooks and aids to learning and teaching through Irish and to the provision of support services to schools teaching through Irish.</P>
      <P>I am strongly committed to providing what support is necessary for teaching and learning through Irish.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that costs associated with the purchase of school books can place a financial burden on parents. To alleviate such burdens, my Department operates a grant scheme towards the cost of providing school textbooks for needy pupils in primary and post-primary schools.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of these grants, a needy pupil is a pupil from a family where there is genuine hardship because of unemployment, prolonged illness of a parent, large family size with inadequate means, single parenthood, or other family circumstances, such as substance abuse, which would indicate a similar degree of financial hardship.</P>
      <P>Principal teachers administer the book grant schemes in schools in a flexible way under the terms of the schemes based on their knowledge of particular circumstances in individual cases.</P>
      <P>A consultancy report, which was submitted to my Department in 1993, dealt with the factors which contribute to the cost of school text books. The main conclusion of the report was that book rental schemes are the most practical way of limiting the cost of school books to parents.</P>
      <P>The report, copies of which were sent to all schools, contains a number of useful suggestions, including a code of good practice for successful operation of book rental schemes. My Department endorses the recommendations and urges school authorities to put in place book rental schemes to the greatest extent possible.</P>
      <P>Special grants are provided to schools at second level, which are categorised as disadvantaged, to assist them in the establishment of book loan/rental schemes. At primary level schools that opt for book rental schemes are allocated enhanced grants to encourage schools to participate in such schemes.</P>
      <P>In 1999, £4.463 million was allocated at second level as aid towards the cost of providing school textbooks for needy pupils while an amount of £2.585 million was disbursed at primary level.</P>

      <Quest>if, further to Parliamentary Question No. 225 of 1 December 1999 in regard to the recent report on the high number of school suspensions, he will give the issue of school discipline and procedures urgent attention; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much aware of the issues of suspension from school and early school leaving which are in turn related to the problem of school discipline.</P>
      <P>The Education Act made provision for new appeal procedures in order to address grievances at school level and my Department is working on the implementation of these at present. The full implementation of the Act will bring a greater transparency to decisions by schools in relation to disciplinary matters generally and promote fair procedures at school level. In particular, the right to appeal to a national appeals committee in regard to decisions to expel, suspend or refuse admittance will bring a better balance to the rights and obligations of all concerned.</P>
      <P>The Education (Welfare) Bill 1999 which is currently before the House will, when enacted, require schools for the first time to prepare codes of behaviour which specify the types of behaviour requiring disciplinary measures, the nature of these measures and the procedures to be followed by school authorities. The code is to be prepared in accordance with guidelines which may be issued by a new national authority to be established under the provisions of the Bill. The purpose of the guidelines will be to provide guidance to schools in relation to the discharge of their duties regarding the drawing up of a suitable code of behaviour for the school. The guidelines will only be issued after consultations with parents, school management, teachers and other interests and would supersede and amend existing guidelines in this area where appropriate. I expect this legislation to be enacted shortly and implementation to commence shortly thereafter.</P>
      <P>The new national authority will also have responsibility for co-ordinating action in relation to school attendance on a nationwide basis. The focus of the authority will be the provision of assistance and support, through locally based educational welfare officers, to schools and families rather than on penalties for non-attendance at school. The Bill also includes specific measures for the early identification and support of children at risk of dropping out of the school system.</P>
      <P>Legislative solutions are not in themselves enough and it is vitally important that we also have in place strategies to encourage and support schools in retaining pupils to completion of senior cycle. The Government's recent stay in school initiative is designed to focus resources on schools where the problem of drop out is most acute. At the core of this new strategy is the empowerment of schools to participate in framing plans for addressing this problem.</P>

      <P>In March 1999, my Department formally requested the Office of Public Works to undertake a pilot survey in approximately 200 schools in the south-east of the country to ascertain the position relating to asbestos. This survey has since been extended to all schools nationwide, primary and post-primary, and the management authorities of every school have been informed accordingly.</P>
      <P>The survey is being conducted on a phased basis over three years by specialists. Where asbestos requiring removal is detected, either as a result of the survey or otherwise, arrangements to undertake the work are made by my Department and the Office of Public Works. All work relating to asbestos removal is undertaken by specialists in accordance with the appropriate safety procedures. These procedures are designed to avoid potential health and safety problems.</P>
      <P>The entire cost of the programme of detection and removal, which to date has been in the region of £1 million, is being borne by my Department.

      <P>Individual school authorities are responsible for drawing up school rules including requirements in relation to wearing school uniform.  Circumstances vary from school to school and it is only those intimately involved with a particular school who can draw up a set of rules including a code of dress appropriate to that school.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 129 and 163 together.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Early Childhood Education Ready to Learn, which was published last December, sets out a comprehensive strategy for the development of early childhood education for children aged from birth to six years. Action is proposed on a wide range of issues including: the promotion of quality of provision, measures to facilitate and encourage parental involvement in their children's early education and the development of a system of inspection to determine whether providers meet quality standards and to assist them in doing so. Particular attention will be paid to the target groups of disadvantaged children and children with special needs.</P>
      <P>Key principles underpinning the White Paper are that implementation will be undertaken on a phased basis and that progress will be achieved through a process of consultation with parents, providers and interested groups. Initial planning for implementation will be undertaken by a new early years development unit which will be established in my Department. An independent early childhood education agency will also be established to undertake a range of policy and executive tasks.</P>
      <P>In addition, consultation with other Government Departments and agencies involved in the early childhood area will be vital to avoid duplication of effort and to ensure a co-ordinated response to children's needs. Accordingly, the Government is putting in place structures to facilitate this consultation and my Department will participate actively in these structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of £74 million has been provided in the national development plan for the implementation of the White Paper proposals. Detailed planning for the distribution of this amount and for the implementation of the White Paper proposals, including the question of direct and <Col N="1544" /> indirect provision of places, will await the establishment of the early childhood education agency and the consultative process between Departments and with providers, parents and interested groups.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 and 429 together.</P>
      <P>The question of Department of Education and Science representation on the local drugs task forces has been under consideration in my Department for some time.</P>
      <P>I fully accept that education issues and, in particular, tackling educational disadvantage and early school leaving, are of concern in many drugs task force areas. These core issues, which have been well documented by the ESRI and other agencies as key factors affecting the life chances of disadvantaged communities, are also of concern to the 38 area based partnerships operating under the local and urban development programme. Tackling educational disadvantage has also emerged as a critical issue in the four pilot integrated services process areas, which correspond to a number of local drugs task force areas.</P>
      <P>My Department is already represented on the education and training sub-committees of each area based partnership by a Department inspector or psychologist. In addition, my Department has provided resources for the appointment of full-time and part-time education co-ordinators to support the work of partnerships in addressing educational disadvantage and preventing early school leaving. Virtually all of these partnerships correspond to the local drugs task force areas. Notwithstanding the aims and objectives of the partnerships and the local drugs task forces the educational issues for both agencies are essentially the same and the obvious way to address these issues is for the local drugs task forces, the education and training sub-committees of the relevant partnerships and the four pilot integrated services process areas to establish links and contacts at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1545" /> In this context my Department has had discussions with Area Development Management Limited about nominating the partnership education co-ordinators as my Department's representatives on the local drugs task forces.  ADM has advised that the education co-ordinators are very well placed to undertake this role and that it would provide a useful co-ordination at local level between partnerships and local drugs task forces.</P>
    <P>I will shortly be arranging for the partnership education co-ordinators to be nominated as representatives of my Department on the local drugs task forces. I am satisfied this arrangement will give the local drugs task forces a specific forum in which education issues of concern to them can be addressed. Such close links between these agencies would also ensure the best use of State resources flowing into the targeted communities.</P>

In that context, a number of joint literacy projects with the FÁS-funded community employment scheme are under way and are now being expanded to all FÁS regions.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming White Paper on adult education will again stress the priority given to adult literacy and repeat the commitment to include literacy development as a key part of every adult education initiative targeting those with limited skills.</P>
    <P>The following measures have been taken to improve literacy standards among children: The national reading initiative has been launched to tackle the problem of poor reading achievements by about 10% of pupils and 25% of adults, and to promote reading generally; £6.5 million has been allocated to schools to buy library books; and every school at first and second level has access to remedial teaching.</P>
    <P>Revised guidelines on remedial education-learning support will soon be published and sent to schools with the express aim of correcting deficiencies found in remedial teaching and with particular emphasis on ways of raising standards in schools in areas of socio-economic disadvantage.</P>
    <P>A revised primary curriculum in English has been sent to schools. It has a renewed emphasis on improving literacy standards and in-career training of teachers is under way at present. Standardised reading tests and pupil reading profiles will be supplied to schools and will be the basis for target-setting and benchmarking.</P>
    <P>There will be a media campaign to encourage parents to become more proactively engaged in promoting their children's reading through reading to them, listening to them read and telling them stories.</P>
    <P>A range of supports is in place to assist the education of Traveller pupils. My Department employs a national education officer for Travellers. The visiting teacher service has been extended from 20 to 30 whole time posts and, since last September, provides coverage of the whole country.</P>
    <P>The Department sanctions resource teacher posts in schools with a minimum enrolment of 14 Traveller pupils of primary school going age. Additional teaching hours are sanctioned in second level schools in respect of Traveller pupils. Capitation grants at enhanced rates are paid in respect of Traveller children enrolled in primary and post-primary schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>All teachers in primary schools were issued with a new programme in Science in September 1999 as part of the introduction of the revised curriculum. The programme is set out in two booklets &ndash; a curriculum statement, incorporating the aims, objectives and content for each class level and guidelines for teachers on the teaching of the subject. The new science programme comprises four interlinked strands, namely: (1) living things; (2) energy and forces; (3) materials; and (4) environmental care.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the revised curriculum will be on a phased basis over four to five years and will be supported by a comprehensive programme of in-career professional development for teachers. The expectation is that most schools will choose to follow the sequence of subject-areas followed in the in-career development programme from year to year. It is planned that in-career professional development in science will form part of the ongoing primary curriculum support programme in the next school year, 2000-2001. However, schools will be free to introduce subject areas as they see fit, taking account of the expertise and interests of their staffs.</P>
      <P>In order to encourage schools to incorporate science in their curriculum a new grant scheme for the teaching of science in primary schools was introduced. These grants were paid out in October 1999 and amounted in total to approximately £1.75 million. The size of grant varied with the size of school: however, a minimum grant of £400 was paid to schools with fewer than 50 pupils while schools with more than 500 pupils received the maximum grant of £1,000.</P>
      <P>It is not possible at present to quantify the number of primary schools that offer science as a formal module of the curriculum. There is no doubt, however, that their number will continue to grow as teachers become more familiar with the contents of the revised curriculum statements and guidelines and as more and more teachers are given the opportunity of attending in-career development seminars in the subject during the next school year.</P>

      <P>A total of 141 juvenile offenders were in the care of the special residential schools for young offenders operated under the aegis of my Department on Friday 28 January 2000. Forty-two of these children had been in residential care in the schools on previous occasions.</P>
      <P>Programmes of care and education are provided for the children in question in these schools. Effective child care practice requires that proper planning be undertaken when children enter residential care. This process includes measures to support and prepare the young person for re-entry into the community. Consequently no child is discharged from a special residential school for young offenders without a discharge plan being in place. This will normally make provision for discharge on the basis that the child returns to his or her family or to a hostel or other supportive environment. Efforts are also made to enrol the child on a FÁS course or to arrange some other suitable employment or training placement. The Probation and Welfare Service works closely with the young offender schools in this area.</P>
      <P>The importance of an effective after-care service for children being released from custody is recognised in the Children Bill, 1999, which provides for much closer co-operation between the agencies involved in this area.</P>

      <P>A working group was set up in Autumn 1997 to examine the potential problems caused by the weight of heavy school bags. The terms of reference of the working group were to consider the issue of heavy school bags and in particular: the extent of the problem; the factors which contribute to the problem; and possible implications of the problem, particularly for the health of pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group was also asked to formulate proposals to alleviate problems associated with the weight of schoolbags. The group presented its report in July 1998. The group's report outlined a number of recommendations that had implications, not only for my Department, but also for schools, parents and publishers. One of the main recommendations related to the need to heighten <Col N="1549" /> the awareness of the potential health hazards posed by excessively heavy schoolbags.</P>
    <P>In this regard my Department, at primary and post-primary levels, initiated an awareness raising campaign by disseminating the report, with an accompanying circular, to all primary and post-primary schools. Furthermore, information leaflets and posters were also distributed to all schools, highlighting the potential health hazard of heavy schoolbags and outlining a range of local measures that could be adopted in order to alleviate the problem. It is a matter for each school to choose those measures that would be most suitable to its needs.</P>
    <P>The report also recommended that my Department should examine the feasibility of providing for appropriate storage facilities in future specifications for furniture manufacturers. Accordingly, the building unit of my Department is examining the possibility of incorporating storage facilities in the provision of furniture in the future. The report further recommended that, in relation to second level schools, my Department should continue to afford schools the option of book storage in the case of new schools.</P>

      <P>At junior certificate the level of participation in science is very satisfactory, with 89.6% of the cohort studying the subject.</P>
      <P>At leaving certificate the level of participation in biology is also very satisfactory, with 48.8% of the cohort studying the subject. This level of participation is high by international standards. In Scotland, for example, about one third of senior pupils study biology.</P>
      <P>The issue of the uptake of the physical science subjects at leaving certificate level is a matter of concern to me. The underlying causes of the declining uptake of the physical sciences at leaving certificate level are complex and Ireland is by no means unique in relation to this particular problem. It affects most countries in the developed world to a greater or lesser extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1551" /> My Department is at present implementing a special science initiative to improve the participation rates in physics and chemistry. This initiative includes the following elements: revised syllabi in leaving certificate physics and leaving certificate chemistry are being introduced from next September, along with teachers' guidelines and reference handbooks; a review of the junior certificate science syllabus is being undertaken by the NCCA at present; a new physical science syllabus to replace the combined physics and chemistry syllabus, is being prepared by the NCCA at present.</P>
    <P>The accessibility of ordinary level examination papers in junior certificate science and in leaving certificate physics and chemistry has been addressed. A new format examination paper in junior certificate science will be introduced in this year's examination. The structure and layout of questions in leaving certificate physics and chemistry was initially addressed in the 1999 examination papers and it is intended that further progress will be made in this year's papers. This was undertaken to improve the accessibility of these examinations to candidates. Sample materials in relation to adjustments to these papers have been circulated to schools.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive in-career development programme for teachers of physics and chemistry at both leaving certificate and junior certificate levels is being implemented. All teachers of leaving certificate physics and chemistry have been provided with one day of in-service and a further one and a half days will be provided before the end of this school year.</P>
    <P>Increased provision for pre-service training for teachers of physics and chemistry is being introduced.</P>
    <P>A significant refurbishment programme for school laboratories is under way.</P>
    <P>A special<i> per capita</i> grant of £10 for pupils studying each of the three leaving certificate subjects physics, chemistry and physics and chemistry, has been paid. This will now be an annual grant.</P>
    <P>I am confident this initiative will make a significant contribution to addressing the issue of falling participation levels in the physical sciences. I am very conscious of the importance of these subjects in the context of our economic development and my Department will continue to keep the situation in relation to these subjects under review.</P>

      <P>One of my key areas of concern is that <Col N="1552" /> traditional approaches to tackling the problem of educational disadvantage have tended to lack the necessary flexibility to target individual and small groups of pupils suffering educational disadvantage. The system has tended to concentrate resources on schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantaged pupils, while failing to give adequate support to other schools with smaller but nonetheless serious pockets of disadvantage.</P>
      <P>The New Deal  &ndash; A Plan for Educational Opportunity which was recently launched by the Taoiseach provides for the expenditure of £194 million over the next three years on the main areas of education. The funding will be provided on a multi-annual basis and appropriate provision will be targeted at educationally disadvantaged pupils in each of the major areas of education, from early childhood education through to life-long and continuing education.</P>
      <P>Plans are already under way in my Department to implement a comprehensive survey of all primary schools to identify the level of concentration of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds in each school. While it is intended that the criteria to be used in this survey will be based on those used in setting up the Breaking the Cycle of Disadvantage project, the reliability of these criteria as predictors of educational disadvantage is under review and the precise criteria that will be used in this new survey have not yet been finalised.</P>
      <P>In response to the level of disadvantage identified in the survey, additional supports will be made available to schools to meet the needs of their pupils. The level and nature of these supports will vary depending on the level of need identified.</P>
      <P>My objective is to ensure that the system is in a position to accurately identify pupils suffering educational disadvantage and to provide extra support to enable them to gain maximum benefit from the education system.</P>

      <P>My Department has responsibility for five centres for the residential accommodation of young offenders up to the age of 16 who are placed on remand or sentenced to detention by the courts.</P>
      <P>My colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, has recently published the Children Bill, 1999. In addition to updating the provisions relating to young persons who have been sentenced by the courts, including the obligations of the centres under the aegis of my Department, the legislation will provide for a wide range of early interventions and non-custodial alternatives to cater for children coming into conflict with the law or with serious care needs.</P>
      <P>Development plans have been drawn up by my Department to meet the obligations which will arise under the new legislation. These development plans include for: major refurbishment and updating of the existing facilities at Trinity House, Lusk and St. Laurence's Finglas; the phased replacement of the existing outdated facilities at St. Michael's, Finglas and Oberstown Boys' and Girls' centres; the development of new pre-release units to serve the Finglas and Lusk centres; and the development of a new highly specialised secure unit at the Lusk campus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall development programme will extend over the next five years. Already, the new pre-release unit at Finglas has been completed and is in operation since the middle of last year.

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that many of the schools involved have already confirmed their participation in the escort scheme and are proceeding to appoint their escorts. <Col N="1555" /> Indeed, I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the commitment shown by these schools in co-operating with the introduction of the scheme.</P>
      <P>Some schools, while welcoming the funding made available for the scheme, had expressed practical concerns regarding its operation. For example, there was concern at the administrative burden involved in organising the service and at the difficulties which might arise regarding substitute cover if an escort was unavailable for duty on a particular day.</P>
      <P>Such concerns have been the subject of discussion between officials of my Department and the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education &ndash; NABMSE &ndash; which represents the management authorities of the schools in question. Arising from these discussions, my Department advised the schools in question that savings which had resulted from the non-appointment of escorts over the period September to December 1999 could be used to engage administrative assistance with the introduction of the scheme. The schools were also advised that any savings resulting from escort duties being less than the assumed six hours per day could also be used to acquire administrative assistance. My Department also advised the schools that arrangements would be made for the local bus contractors delivering the transport services to arrange for substitute escorts in the event of an escort not reporting for duty on a particular day.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that some practical difficulties may still arise in individual situations and my Department will make every effort to address any such situations. However, I am firmly of the view that the schools which cater for these special needs children on a daily basis are the most appropriate bodies to undertake the operation of the escort scheme. The schools are familiar with the children's needs and behaviours. They are dedicated to the children's welfare and are best placed to ensure that the escort scheme operates in a manner which ensures the safety of the children and provides parents with the reassurance which they require.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education and Science, I have met the national association of boards of management in special education and confirmed the above view. I have requested the association to use its best endeavours to ensure that all the schools involved proceed with the implementation of the scheme. I am hopeful that substantial and early progress can be made on this matter, in the interests of the children concerned and their parents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 149 and 151 together.</P>
      <P>The Higher Education Authority has commissioned Professor Patrick Clancy to undertake national surveys of entrants to higher education. Surveys have been undertaken on the cohort entering full-time higher education in 1980, 1986 and 1992 and I understand that Professor Clancy is currently working on a fourth national survey based on the entry cohort in 1998. I understand that this survey should be available in late Spring 2000. In his third survey, Access to College: Patterns of Continuity and Change, Professor Clancy examines the participation rates of different social groups, based on the students' fathers socio-economic grouping.</P>
      <P>The higher professional, employers and managers, salaried employees, lower professional and farmers categories were highly-represented. While the intermediate non-manual grouping was marginally under-represented, the other non-manual, skilled manual, other agricultural, semi-skilled manual and unskilled manual were significantly under-represented.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will appreciate the factors underlying the disparity in participation at third level demand a holistic approach to promote equality across the education system. There is a range of initiatives spanning the first and second level systems in recognition of the fact that fuller participation in third level depends on measures to ensure access to and retention of students in full-time education at first and second levels.</P>
      <P>In relation to initiatives focusing on the transition from second to third level and on the third level sector, many colleges have developed initiatives to promote disadvantaged access, through targeted funding provided to the universities by the Higher Education Authority and funding from within the overall financial allocations to the Institutes of Technology. These initiatives involve links with second level schools and local communities and examples of these activities include supervised study programmes, summer schools, study skills programmes and mentoring.</P>
      <P>There are two aspects to these programmes, one involving assistance to students to meet the points requirements for courses, enabling them to obtain a third level place through the standard CAO entry procedure. The other aspect of the programmes is the special entry arrangements through which more flexible entry criteria are applied and various supports are put in place for students entering by this method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1557" /> The Higher Education Authority has commissioned Dr. Bob Osborne of the University of Ulster to undertake an evaluation of the socio-economic access initiatives funded by the authority. It has also commissioned Professor Malcolm Skilbeck to advise on international issues and strategies in relation to access and equity in higher education. I understand that these studies will be completed in late spring 2000.</P>
    <P>Finally, as the Deputies will be aware, the report of the Commission on the Points System has made a number of recommendations in relation to disadvantaged students. This report is currently being considered by my officials and planning for an implementation strategy is under way.</P>

      <P>Increasing the retention rate to completion of senior cycle is a key education priority. Strategies to tackle this objective have included widening the educational experience available to students by expanding funding for new programmes such as the leaving cert applied and implementing a scheme targeted at those in danger of dropping out of school between eight and 15. These measures have been successful but do not represent a complete answer to this complex problem.</P>
      <P>Last summer my Department announced a major new stay in school initiative. This marks a significant departure from traditional policy in that funding will be granted to schools on the basis of plans which they will be helped to design themselves. The underlying objective of the initiative is to establish a direct link between schools experiencing serious retention problems and my Department with a view to agreeing multi-annual programmes of action with clear targets, which will be matched with appropriate resources. The core point of the initiative is that schools themselves need to take charge of tackling early school leaving and I will give them the supports they need to make an impact. In this regard I should add that my Department has appointed two experienced school principals who will co-ordinate the initiative and assist participating schools to formulate their retention plans and targets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In inviting applications for the initial phase of the initiative, priority was given to schools and VEC schemes with retention rates appreciably below the national average, 58 schools are participating in this phase. I expect that the number of schools participating will be expanded in 2000 and subsequent years. Schools will be selected for invitation based on their retention rate and over<Col N="1558" /> all enrolment. My intention is to include as many pupils as possible who are at risk of early school leaving in the initiative.</P>

      <P>All teachers in primary schools were issued with a new programme in science in September 1999 as part of a revised primary curriculum. This programme is set out in two booklets, a curriculum statement, incorporating the aims, objectives and content for each class level, and guidelines for teachers on the teaching of the subject.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the revised curriculum will be on a phased basis over four to five years and will be supported by a comprehensive programme of in-career professional development for teachers. It is planned that in-career professional development in science will form part of the ongoing primary curriculum support programme in the next school year, 2000-01.</P>
      <P>In order to encourage schools to incorporate science in their curriculum, my Department last year announced a new grants scheme for the teaching of science in primary schools. These grants were paid out in October 1999 and amounted in total to approximately £1.75 million. The size of grant varied with the size of school: schools of less than 50 pupils received £400 while schools of more than 500 pupils were paid £1,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At second level, a survey of the existing provision in school laboratories has already been carried out by my Department. The purpose of this survey was to establish the level of resources required to bring the basic level of facilities in all our school laboratories up to an agreed standard <Col N="1559" /> and to provide a basis for allocating resources to individual schools. An analysis of the data obtained from this survey is ongoing. When this analysis is complete resources will be allocated to target identified needs.</P>
    <P>Proposals are currently being drawn up to provide a PC, printer and relevant software to each school specifically for use in the teaching of the sciences.</P>
    <P>Starting in the current school year, a special annual<i> per capita</i> grant of £10 is being paid for each pupil studying one of the physical science subjects for leaving certificate. This grant is intended to provide for the purchase and maintenance of basic science teaching equipment.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the survey of laboratory resources will yield significant data on the current level of provision and so will result in the most efficient targeting of the substantial resources by my Department to the development of the physical sciences.</P>

      <P>My Department maintains regular contact with educate together and, in this way, remains fully briefed as to the anticipated growth of multi-denominational schools. The most recent information obtained indicates that a further ten such schools are being planned for the future.</P>
      <P>My Department provided Educate Together with funding of £26,000 in 1997, £27,000 in 1998 and £7,500 in 1999 to assist with their operational and administrative expenses. An application for increased funding was recently received by my Department and I have met with representatives of Educate Together in the last week. The question of providing additional resources to the organisation was discussed. I was happy to respond positively to the delegation and I will be writing to them in the near future.</P>

      <P>Systems of continuous assessment could of course be developed for use in the certificate examinations but it must be realised that there are serious practical constraints in releasing teachers from school if such assessment were to be conducted externally. Continuous assessment is in reality only a viable option if it is school based.</P>
      <P>A discussion paper was prepared by my Department in relation to assessment issues at junior certificate as a further contribution to the consultation process begun with the circulation of the junior cycle review progress report by the NCCA.</P>
      <P>The discussion paper argues that in the case of the leaving certificate, assessment leads to certification for selection and that the integrity of such a system must be beyond question. Consequently in such an environment the concerns of teachers in relation to participation in school-based assessment are understandable.</P>

      <P>I would begin by drawing the Deputy's attention to the Government's major initiative of December last to provide 1,000 additional teachers to Irish schools. This will still further reduce the pupil teacher ratio at both primary and post primary levels.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be also be aware that a range of other initiatives was introduced in the past two years to reduce the pupil teacher ratio in primary schools. They include improvements in the staffing schedule for the appointment and retention of teachers and particularly reductions in the retention and appointment figures for one-teacher schools. Other initiatives include the allocation of additional posts towards specifically helping the educationally disadvantaged and the introduction of a maximum class size guideline of 30. These initiatives have helped to improve substantially the pupil teacher ratio. The current ratio at primary level is 20.4 : 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other improvements have also taken place at second level in the same period. In the current school year 225 additional posts were created and a further 280 posts were retained. As a result the pupil teacher ratio has reduced from 15.4 : 1 in 1998/99 to an estimated 15.1: 1 in the current <Col N="1561" /> year. This will, of course, reduce further with the allocation of the posts announced last December.</P>

      <P>The information requested in relation to primary level will be forwarded to the Deputy. The information in relation to the number of untrained teachers employed in second level schools is not available. It is Department policy that, in as far as is possible, second level teachers should teach the subjects in which they are qualified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1562" /> A range of measures has been introduced to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers. The intake of trainee primary teachers to the colleges of education was increased substantially in the 1998-99 and 1999-2000 sessions. The total projected intake in the 1999-00 academic year is 1,283 compared with an intake of 500 in 1996/97.</P>
    <P>Between the 2000 and 2001 academic years it is projected that approximately 1,900 newly trained teachers shall graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates as compared with 1995 when 291 graduated.</P>
    <P>A number of other initiatives to reduce the number of untrained personnel have also been introduced. B.Ed graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification are now recognised as fully qualified.</P>
    <P>Since September, 1998 all primary degree holders who hold the Higher Diploma in Education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers and in the current academic year those with grade C Irish in the leaving certificate higher paper are paid at the trained rate when employed in a temporary capacity.</P>
    <P>Teachers with the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full-time course in the Association Montessori Internationale &ndash; AMI &ndash; College, Milltown, Dublin 14, and teachers trained in St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, Montessori who have successfully completed the full-time course of at least three years duration which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards are also recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers.</P>
    <P>The decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that concerns have been expressed by some schools and the parents of some children that the level of speech therapy services currently <Col N="1564" /> being provided is not adequate to meet their children's needs. I am also aware that individual health boards have been encountering significant difficulty in recruiting sufficient suitably qualified speech therapists to meet their needs.</P>
    <P>My Department has raised this matter with the Department of Health and Children in an effort to determine the precise extent of the problem and how it might be addressed. It is also my intention to liaise with the Minister for Health and Children on this matter in order to ensure that all school going pupils with speech and language disorders have access to an adequate level of speech therapy service.</P>

      <P>The level of funding for primary and post-primary school accommodation has been increased from £72.5 million in 1997 to £181 million in 2000. This has resulted in significant progress being made in the elimination of substandard accommodation in the recent past. It is my intention to continue to accord high priority to this area.</P>
      <P>In that regard, arrangements are under way for the conducting of a comprehensive survey of accommodation at primary and post primary levels to determine more accurately the level of need among schools. It is envisaged that within the next year or so, every school in the State will be visited by suitably qualified personnel who will thoroughly inspect the condition of each school and report findings to my Department. This information will be used to target funding more precisely where the need is greatest.</P>
      <P>In addition to the measures outlined above, in recent years, a devolved grant amounting £12 million per annum has been introduced at primary level. The purpose of this grant is to enable school authorities to undertake minor improvement works at a local level without further departmental involvement.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be referring to an article published in <i>Medicine Weekly</i> recently detailing studies carried out by John Sweeney of the Irish Society for Quality in Healthcare, which identified variations in the application of ISO 9000 standards in a hospital environment among different certifying bodies in different countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ISO 9000 is a general quality management system standard which can be used in all industrial and service sectors. Specific guidelines have been produced by national bodies or sectoral interests to clarify its application to specific <Col N="1568" /> sectors, but it is by no means compulsory to use these guidelines. Guideline documents are intended to provide assistance to companies in the interpretation of ISO 9000 in their particular sector. The guideline documents may vary but must remain within the generic requirements of the ISO standard.</P>
    <P>A network of the world's first class certification bodies &ndash; the International Certification Network or IQ Net &ndash; has been set up, one of whose aims is to ensure the equivalence of certification procedures and interpretations through an ongoing system of peer evaluation. The National Standards Authority of Ireland &ndash; NSAI &ndash; is an active member of this network.</P>
    <P>In addition, Ireland is one of seven countries identified by Mr. Sweeney who have produced guidelines for the application of ISO 9000 standards to health service providers.</P>
    <P>In 1997, following consultation with representatives from all areas of the health care sector the National Standards Authority of Ireland &ndash; NSAI &ndash; published a guideline document for the application of ISO 9000 in a hospital environment. This document is available free of charge to all health service providers and has assisted health care agencies in interpreting ISO 9000 registration in a range of services including acute hospital, mental handicap, care for the elderly and environmental health food control.</P>
    <P>The Irish health care industry is very aware that the ISO 9000:1994 series is undergoing revision and that the new ISO 9000:2000 is expected to be published later this year.</P>

      <P>The case under reference was the subject of a determination of the Employment Appeals Tribunal last year in which the EAT granted an award to the employee in question under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, 1977 to 1993 and the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, 1973 to 1991.</P>
      <P>Representation was made to my Department by the employee's solicitor in July, 1999 advising of non-payment by the employee's employer of the EAT award. My Department followed up on these representations by writing to the employer to request that payment to the employee be effected within a ten-day timeframe. On subsequently hearing from the employee's solicitor that payment within this timeframe had not been effected, my Department, in November 1999, referred the matter to the Chief State Solicitor's office for the institution of legal proceedings against the employer.</P>
      <P>I am now advised by the CSSO that certain difficulties have arisen which appear to have implications for the viability of further legal action by me on behalf of the employee. I am having these difficulties assessed by my officials at the moment before deciding what, if any, further action I can take to secure payment to the employee.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the British Authorities that, under this new system, a still image is taken of each passenger by a video camera situated in plain view behind the security officer. A bar code sticker linked to this image is attached to the passenger's boarding card, and the passenger then proceeds to the departure lounge. On leaving the lounge to go to the appropriate departure gate, passengers pass another desk, where a security officer can scan the bar code and <Col N="1574" /> immediately see the video photo to confirm that the person carrying the boarding pass is the person to whom it was issued. The physical sticker with the bar code number is the only link between the image and the boarding pass &ndash; the boarding pass is not scanned into the system, and no name or other personal information is associated with the photo. All photos are deleted at the end of the following day.</P>
    <P>This system applies to all passengers using the south terminal, which handles international flights; flights to Dublin, Cork, Shannon, Belfast and Newcastle, which are flights within the common travel area; and flights to the Channel Islands, which are not part of the European Union. The new system was introduced to ease the handling of passengers travelling to these various destinations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>In late 1997 my Department and Bord Gáis Éireann jointly commissioned a study of natural gas demand and related infrastructural requirements to the year 2025. The consultants examined a range of options and recommended the provision of a second Scotland-Ireland interconnector as the optimal solution on cost and other grounds.</P>
      <P>My Department engaged economic consultants to undertake an economic evaluation of the various supply options proposed under the Gas 2025 study and the possibility of a commercial gas find in the Corrib field which had emerged since the Gas 2025 study had been launched. The consultants confirmed the findings of the gas 2025 study that a second Scotland-Ireland interconnector, parallel to the existing interconnector, was the preferred choice. However, they recommended that a final decision on future supply infrastructure should not be taken until the position regarding the prospects for the commercial development of the Corrib field is clear. I understand from the Corrib partners that it will be towards the end of this year before such a decision is likely to be taken.</P>
      <P>A prudent approach to security of supply dictates that the decision on future gas supply infrastructure cannot be deferred indefinitely. In addition to the Corrib possibility, there have been a number of other developments including the recent announcement by Premier Transco of its proposal to build a North-South interconnector, if they can procure sufficient demand, and proposals by other parties for the provision of additional gas pipelines both to and within Ireland. The primary initiative in relation to a new pipeline rests with players in the liberalised gas market including BGE. BGE has signalled its intention to build a second Scotland interconnector and this must be considered in the context of all the options.</P>
      <P>My Department has commissioned consultants to advise on the policy approach to a regulatory regime for the authorisation of new gas pipelines. This will aim to promote the development of competition in the supply of natural gas and provide appropriate economic signals in relation to the establishment of new pipeline infrastructures.</P>

      <P>Following the accident at Tramore, County Waterford, on 2 July 1999 in which four members of the Air Corps were tragically killed, my colleague the Minister for Public Enterprise and I jointly directed that the accident be investigated under S.I. 205 of 1997, Air Navigation (Notification and Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Regulations, 1997. Pursuant to this direction the investigation is being conducted by the air accident investigation unit &ndash; AAIU &ndash; of the Department of Public Enterprise. A senior Air Corps officer with appropriate training is acting as investigator-in-charge. He is being assisted by inspectors from the AAIU, by Air Corps personnel and two experts from overseas, that is, a principal inspector from the UK air accidents investigation <Col N="1578" /> branch and the head of military psychology of the Swedish armed forces.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this investigation, which is wide-ranging and complex, is to determine the circumstances and cause or causes of the accident in order to prevent future such accidents. All issues, including those raised by relatives concerning safety, are being encompassed by the investigation. The final report of this investigation will be made public. The regulations provide that the final report should be published, where possible, within 12 months of the date of the accident. In this connection it is estimated that a draft final report will be ready for circulation to interested parties by the end of March next. Any safety measures proposed by the investigating team will, of course, be implemented as a matter of priority.</P>
      <P>In addition to the aforementioned investigation, a military court of inquiry has been convened to inquire into the circumstances of the accident. Its main thrust will be an examination of both the report of the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise and the coroner's report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 203 and 217 together.</P>
      <P>The regulatory framework arising from the Agenda 2000 agreement allows for greater flexibility in the operation of the milk quota regime. I have decided to take the opportunity to make changes in the system which operates in Ireland in order to ensure that active, committed producers have greater access to quota over the coming years.</P>
      <P>The objectives of the new arrangements are to provide for more flexibility and certainty for milk producers in the operation of the milk quota regime; greater priority access to additional permanent milk quota for small scale and medium size producers; the retention of as many dairying enterprises as possible; and greater competitiveness within the Irish milk production sector.</P>
      <P>Details of the changes to the quota system are as follows.</P>
      <P Just="Center">
        <i>1. Changes in the arrangements for the transfer of milk quota</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>I have decided that with effect from 1 April 2000 milk quota will no longer transfer with land, subject to the following exceptions: family transactions &ndash; conditions to be defined in the national implementing regulations; sale of a holding as a going concern where that enterprise will continue to be operated as an independent holding; a renewal of a lease agreement for land and milk quota between the original lessor and lessee or their successor-in-title where the original lease agreement was executed in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Milk Quota) Regulations, 1995, earlier national implementing legislation or national rules; and the transfer, by way of lease or sale, of land pur<Col N="1581" /> chased with quota between 13 October 1999 and 31 March 2000 &ndash; both dates inclusive.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>2. Scheme for the purchase and resale of milk quota</i>Apart from the exceptions outlined above, under the provisions of Article 8(b) of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3950/92, the transfer of milk quota will be through a scheme to be operated by way of a pooled system at co-operative-dairy level. Under this scheme, quota holders may, at the end of each milk quota year, offer all or part of their milk quota for sale to their co-operative-dairy. The co-operative-dairy in turn may only sell milk quota to eligible producers attached to that concern under detailed rules determined by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. While all producers will be entitled to purchase milk quota under this scheme, priority will be accorded to small and medium sized producers.</P>
    <P>The maximum price for the sale of milk quota under this scheme will be fixed at national level.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>3. Temporary leasing of quota held by persons no longer involved in milk production</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>With effect from 1 April 2000 it will no longer be possible for quota holders, not engaged in milk production, to temporarily lease their milk quota under the provisions of article 6 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3950/92 and Regulation 16 of the European Communities (Milk Quota) Regulations 1995, where the milk quota has been either temporarily leased or transferred in connection with a land lease agreement expiring during the 1999-2000 milk quota year or both of the foregoing for the preceding three milk quota years &ndash; 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000 &ndash; or for a longer period.</P>
    <P>With effect from 1 April 2000 such quota holders may either resume milk production in their own right during the 2000-01 milk quota year; sell the milk quota into the 2000 milk quota restructuring scheme referred to above; renew the land and milk quota lease agreement; or sell the milk quota without the land to the lessee on expiry of the lease agreement, where that is allowed. In certain exceptional circumstances, persons no longer involved in milk production may apply to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development for an exemption from this provision. These exceptional circumstances will be detailed in the national implementing regulations.</P>

      <P>I am aware that Denmark has achieved considerable success in promoting organic farming methods. Support for organic farming in Ireland is available under a number of measures. Under the rural environment protection scheme &ndash; REPS &ndash; additional payments are available to farmers who undertake organic farming under supplementary measure No. 6. The objective of this measure is to encourage producers in REPS to respond to the market demand for organically produced food. REPS is a voluntary scheme and benefits can only be paid to those who wish to participate in the scheme. To date a total of £461.2 million has been paid to farmers under REPS, of which £5.2 million has been paid to those engaged in organic production.</P>
      <P>Grants were available for marketing and processing of organic produce under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry 1994-1999 &ndash; OPARDF. Initially, there was limited interest in the numbers wishing to avail of these grants. There has been a progressive increase in applications in recent years and the total grant aid paid to date amounts to almost £370,000. Funding is also available to the organic certification bodies.</P>

      <P>Following the conclusion of consultation with member states, the European Commission has indicated that it intends to finalise the guidelines for its new rural development initiative, Leader+, when European Parliament observations are received later this month.</P>
      <P>Member states will then draw up operational programmes for Leader+. When completed, Ireland's operational programme will be forwarded to the Commission for approval with a view to commencement of the Leader+ programme as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Under the national development plan, funding of the order of £110 million will be available to support Leader-type activity in the period 2000-2006. Some £35.4 million of this is to be provided by the EU in respect of the Leader+ programme. The balance will come from the Exchequer and will comprise co-funding for Leader+ as well as support for a mainstream Leader&ndash;type measure. As with other measures provided for in the national development plan, approval by the European Commission is necessary to enable commencement of arrangements for the establishment of Leader mainstream activity.</P>
      <P>Pending EU clearance for Leader+ activity and mainstream activity under the NDP, it is not possible to define the precise arrangements for delivery. It is clear, however, that the Commission's intention is that funding will be confined to a limited number of rural areas and that the essential aim of the measure will be to encourage the emergence and testing of new approaches to integrated and sustainable development.</P>
      <P>The report of the task force on the integration of local government and local development systems will also have an important bearing on the arrangements for the operation of the new Leader measures. Of particular relevance will be the desire to avoid overlap between agencies and to explore mechanisms capable of combining rural development and rural partnership activities in rural disadvantaged areas specifically.</P>
      <P>I recognise the importance of continuity in the delivery of Leader and Leader-type rural development programmes. In this context, every effort will be made to secure the earliest implementation of the two new Leader measures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulatory framework arising from the Agenda 2000 agreement allows for greater flexibility in the operation of the milk quota regime. I have decided to take the opportunity to make significant changes in the system which operates in Ireland in order to ensure that active, committed producers have greater access to quota over the coming years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objectives of the new arrangements are to provide for: more flexibility and certainty for milk producers in the operation of the milk quota regime; greater priority access to additional permanent milk quota for small scale and medium size producers; the retention of as many dairying enterprises as possible; and greater competitiveness within the Irish milk production sector. The present situation where milk quotas transferred with land has made it difficult for producers in the small to medium sized categories to <Col N="1590" /> acquire additional quota at a reasonable cost. In many cases they had to take on additional land which they did not require in order to get additional quota. This clearly had consequences in terms of their production costs.</P>
    <P>I have decided, therefore, that with effect from 1 April 2000 milk quota will no longer transfer with land, subject to certain exceptions. These exceptions will include: family transactions  &ndash; conditions to be defined in the national implementing regulations; a renewal of a lease agreement for land and milk quota between the original lessor and lessee or their successor-in-title where the original lease agreement was executed in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Milk Quota) Regulations, 1995, earlier national implementing legislation or national rules; and the transfer, by way of lease or sale, of land purchased with quota between 13 October 1999 and 31 March 2000 &ndash; both dates inclusive. It will also be possible in the case of land and milk quota lease agreements executed prior to 13 October 1999 for the lessee to definitively purchase the milk quota from the lessor without the relevant land.</P>
    <P>After 1 April 2000 the main mechanism for transferring quota will be through a restructuring scheme based at milk purchaser level. A maximum price will be set nationally and priority access will be given to smaller and medium category producers. It is clear therefore, that a number of options for the transfer of quota will continue to be available to participants in the farm retirement scheme.</P>
    <P>I decided on the changes to the regime following wide consultation and I am satisfied that they represent the best way forward for the industry as a whole.</P>

      <P>The rate of early retirement pension payment was initially set in 1994 at a basic 4,000 ecus &ndash; £3,905 &ndash; and 250 ecus &ndash; £244 &ndash; per hectare up to a maximum of 10,000 ecus &ndash; £9,764 &ndash; for a farm of 24 hectares or over. With the devaluation of the Irish punt in 1996 the maximum pension increased to £10,016.26 and was paid at this rate from 1 January 1996 to the end of December 1998.</P>
      <P>The rate of pension paid to participants in the early retirement scheme was reduced by 5.055% from 1 January 1999 due to the introduction of the euro and the abolition of frozen green rates. This has resulted in a maximum pension of £9,509.93.</P>
      <P>Formal approval to pay compensation for this reduction to participants in the scheme was received from the European Commission on 8 December 1999. Compensation issued to current scheme participants with their January cheques.</P>
      <P>Two further tranches of compensation at reduced levels will be paid as soon as they are sanctioned by the Commission.</P>
      <P>The number of active participants in the scheme of early retirement from farming at the end of January 2000 was 8,789.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of measures and incentives in place aimed at encouraging young people to set up in farming.</P>
      <P>The national scheme of installation aid, introduced in December 1998, provides a grant of £5,600 to assist young qualified farmers under 35 years of age first setting up in farming. Under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, a new scheme is provided for and a higher rate of grant will apply.</P>
      <P>In addition, a comprehensive range of tax incentives apply, relating to stock relief, stamp duty relief, capital acquisitions tax, capital gains tax and probate tax, to facilitate minimisation of ownership transfer costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Priority will continue to be given to young farmers in the allocation of suckler and ewe pre<Col N="1592" /> mium quota rights from the national reserve. Special provision has been made for young farmers through the allocation of five million gallons from the first 20.5 million gallons of additional milk quota secured from April 2000 under the EU Agenda 2000 agreement. The National Development Plan, 2000-2006, has also made provision for a development programme for young farmers to provide for additional aid in respect of on-farm investment.</P>
    <P>I recently established a task force to review agricultural education and training, having regard to the changing economic and social environment.</P>
    <P>The early retirement scheme has been extremely successful since its introduction in 1994. The scheme will continue in the coming years and some £565 million has been provided for the measure in the period 2000-06. The scheme has a key effect in facilitating the take over of farms by young farmers.</P>

    <P>The general functions of the Western Development Commission are to promote, assist in, foster and encourage economic and social development in its region. For this purpose it may provide <Col N="1593" /> assistance from the western investment fund in such form as it considers appropriate, but not grant aid, for business and social enterprises and projects. It is intended that the fund will assist projects engaged in the processing and marketing of agricultural and fisheries products.</P>
    <P>Aid, irrespective of its form, is <i>prima facie</i> State aid once it is funded by the Exchequer. Accordingly, the western investment fund was notified to the European Commission last June seeking approval for its operation and negotiations have been ongoing since then. I am pressing the Commission for a decision in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>General budgetary measures announced in the period 1998 to 2000 have been aimed at reducing the burden of personal taxation on all workers, thereby increasing the incentive to take up employment in every sector, including the caring professions. These measures include increases in the personal allowances of £1,800 single and £3,600 married, reductions in both the standard and higher rates of tax of 2% and increases in the standard rate band. The individualisation of the standard rate band announced in Budget 2000 will have the effect of removing 125,000 taxpayers from the top rate of tax and, in particular, will increase the incentive for a second spouse to enter or rejoin the labour force.</P>
      <P>In relation to support for persons returning to work generally, the revenue job assist was introduced in April 1998 to assist the long-term unemployed back into employment. The scheme is a focused two-part initiative that gives employers an incentive to employ a long-term unemployed person. The scheme also provides the long-term unemployed person with a special additional tax relief, tapered over three years.</P>
      <P>In addition to the general tax measures outlined above, the tax code also contains a special allowance for an individual employing a carer to look after an incapacitated family member. The allowance is £8,500 per annum at the taxpayer's marginal rate and can be shared between family members who contribute to the cost of employing a carer.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals at present to introduce specific measures into the tax code to support those who wish to enter or return to work in the caring professions. As the Deputy will appreciate, I receive numerous requests seeking the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones. Tax reliefs, by their nature, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.</P>

      <P>Section 268 (1)<i>(g)</i> of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides for capital allowances in relation to nursing homes. These allowances apply in respect of capital expenditure incurred from 3 December 1997 on building new nursing homes, upgrading or extending existing homes or converting existing buildings into nursing homes. The allowance is 15% of the capital expenditure in years one to six, with 10% in year seven.</P>
      <P>As set out in the legislation, tax relief is only provided in cases where the nursing home is privately owned and registered with a health board in accordance with the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990. Furthermore the legislation provides for a clawback of the capital allowance if a premises ceases to be used as a nursing home within a period of ten years beginning with the time when the building was first used. The capital allowances are subject to the £25,000 limit per annum on the amount of allowances which an individual passive investor can claim against non-rental income.</P>
      <P>Issues relating to the quality of care rests in the first instance with the health boards and ultimately with the Department of Health and Children. If the Deputy is aware of any case where these standards are not being complied with, he should contact the relevant health board or the Department of Health and Children.</P>

      <P>The recent increases in international oil prices are having an impact on inflation. The energy products index of the CPI &ndash; which accounts for 9.1% of the overall index &ndash; rose by 9.4% in the year to December 1999. This added just under 0.9% to headline inflation.</P>
      <P>The full impact of the recent oil price increases have not yet been felt. Manufacturing output prices increased by more than 5% in December, in part as a result of higher fuel input costs. These higher prices could affect the CPI in due course.</P>
      <P>Of course, a stabilisation of, or reduction in, oil prices will reduce future inflation. In addition, any improvement in the performance of the euro will help in restraining these external inflationary pressures.</P>

      <P>Sunday, 23 July 2000, marks the final day of the G8 sum<Col N="1600" /> mit which is scheduled to take place in Japan. I understand that this date has been depicted as Debt Decision Day by the Jubilee 2000 organisation, which is campaigning for the total remission of Third World debt.</P>
      <P>Since Ireland is not a creditor of any of the world's poorest countries, nor a member of the G8, it is as a member of multilateral organisations, in particular the EU, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, that we can best exercise our influence to contribute to easing the debt burden of these countries.</P>
      <P>In my speech to the joint annual discussion at the IMF and World Bank annual meeting, last September, I stressed that debt relief is a vital element in a more broadly based development strategy aimed at growth and poverty alleviation. The full text of my statement is available under the annual meetings section of the IMF website &ndash; www.imf.org.</P>
      <P>The HIPC initiative, driven by the World Bank and the IMF, is the official response to the need for debt relief, particularly at multilateral level, but also involving substantial, if not complete relief, in respect of official bilateral debt. As originally conceived, the initiative aimed at both freeing the most heavily indebted poorest countries from the burden of the unpayable element of their debt and offering them a definitive exit from the debt treadmill which is seriously undermining their development.</P>
      <P>Following a review of the initiative, it was substantially enhanced &ndash; the amount of debt relief on offer has been doubled and a wider range of countries is to get faster and deeper relief &ndash; and my concern now is that these improvements are fully financed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the Deputy that Ireland was to the fore in calling for such improvements, in particular via the submissions made by my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs to the review of the HIPC initiative, which preceded them. I see the HIPC initiative as a suitable framework through which viable economic and social reform programmes, including debt relief measures, can best be achieved. In this regard the Deputy should be aware that Ireland is also pressing the multilateral institutions to ensure that programmes drawn up by HIPC countries take adequate account of the social needs of these countries. We are also supporting increased co-ordination between the various institutions involved and with a wider spectrum of society in the countries concerned to ensure that aid, including debt relief, is used in the most efficient way to promote development and protect the social sector. These efforts are bearing fruit with the recent commitment of the multilateral institutions to target their activities in a comprehensive and co-ordinated way on poverty reduction, that is, through the poverty reduction strategy papers, which will form the bedrock of <Col N="1601" /> the World Bank and the IMF's assistance to the poorest countries, and which will also inform the partnership between these institutions and the countries concerned &ndash; they will also be a key element in strengthening the link between debt relief and poverty reduction.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will recall that Ireland is contributing fully to the enhanced initiative. We are also participating in the alleviation of bilateral debt relief in relation to some of our priority aid countries even though our own bilateral assistance has been in the form of grants.</P>
    <P>With regard to the central point of the Deputies question, I am not convinced that a blanket call for debt cancellation is attainable. The HIPC initiative goes a long way towards tackling the issue of multilateral debt and poverty reduction. While it also envisages substantial reductions in bilateral debt, there is clearly scope for individual countries to go further on this and I am heartened by indications that an increasing number of countries are prepared to do so.</P>

      <P>As I said in my Budget Statement, I propose to modify the existing excise duty rebate on diesel fuel, which <Col N="1602" /> is available to CIE and to certain other bus operators, by stipulating that this concession will only be available where low-sulphur diesel is used. This restriction of an existing concession, which is currently available for all forms of diesel, is motivated solely by environmental concerns to produce cleaner air. This is one positive signal of the Government's firm commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as is required under the Kyoto Protocol. According to studies carried out by the UK Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions' Cleaner Vehicle Task Force, the effect of switching from a conventional diesel fuel to low sulphur diesel will reduce emissions of particulates by approximately 40%. Low sulphur diesel also allows the use of other abatement technology which can reduce emission of particulates, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide by a further 90%.</P>
      <P>The introduction of low sulphur diesel in Ireland should result in significant emission reduction with consequential health and environmental benefits. These improvements are needed now.</P>
      <P>Provision to give effect to the announcement in my Budget Statement will be made in the forthcoming Finance Bill. The relevant sections will be implemented by way of a ministerial order. Prior to the order coming into effect, a process of consultation will take place with the transport operators, the suppliers and with other Departments and agencies. It will be essential for the operators to co-operate in the early introduction of this cleaner and more environmentally sound fuel and for that reason, I will be seeking an early switch to this fuel type from the present, less acceptable alternatives.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 249 and 291 together.</P>
      <P>The administration of the registration system is a matter for an tArd-Chláraitheoir &ndash; the Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages &ndash; and for local registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
      <P>The Registration of Births and Deaths Acts, 1863 to 1996, and the Marriages Acts, 1844 and 1863, provide that An tArd-Chláraitheoir shall retain certified copes of the records of births, deaths and marriages returned to him on a quarterly basis by local registrars and that he shall compile and make available an index to such records at his office. Persons are entitled to search these indexes on the payment of the approved fees and to obtain certified copies of entries identified from the index. However, this is only one aspect of the services provided at the General Register Office, Joyce House, and the other services which are provided include the issue of authorisations for the late registration of events and the reregistration of births. In addition, An tArd-Chláraitheoir is concerned with the appointment of registrars and the administration of marriage law.</P>
      <P>The proposals from the Genealogical Society of Ireland would entail the transfer of microfilmed copies of indexes to the registers of births, deaths and marriages and microfilmed copies of the records over 70 years old to the National Library, the National Archives and nominated regional centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated in my reply of 3 February to a question in relation to services in the General Register Office, additional space was provided in the public reading room in Joyce House in July 1999, which resolved the difficulties in relation to overcrowding. Tenders have been sought for the further refurbishment of the General Register Office which will include additional improvements to the environment of the reading room and the improvement of customer services on the second floor of the office. The Deputies will also be aware that steps are being taken to maintain and improve indexes to the records of births, deaths and marriages, including the special project for the capture of the records of births, deaths and marriages and associated indexes in an electronic format, which has been ongoing in Roscommon for some time. This is a major project which will improve the efficiency, flexibility, access to and management of the archival records and the associated indexes. It will also provide potential for the development of a range of services, which would not be possible in a system reliant on printed indexes. This project, when completed, will benefit all customers of the registration service throughout the country, including persons who currently avail of the services of the reading room in the General Register Office. <Col N="1605" /> There is also an ongoing review on the registration service, including its structure, procedures and legislation to identify changes necessary to provide a modern and effective service based on the electronic recording of vital events.</P>

      <P>The fluoridation of the public piped water supplies is an important programme for the protection of dental health and is subject to the provisions of the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960, and various regulations made under the Act. The safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation as a public health measure has been evaluated frequently by the World Health Organisation and other reputable authorities, such as the Health Research Council of the United States, and concerns about adverse health effects have not been substantiated. In October 1999, the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland issued a report which endorsed the safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation. All of the reputable scientific evidence confirms the safety of fluoride when it is available in public piped water supplies at the optimal levels. These levels are the same as those required under the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960. A survey of adult dental health carried out in 1991 found no significant difference in regard to general health status between fluoridated and non-fluoridated areas. If an authoritative body in this country or internationally indicates that there is an issue of public health significance relating to the use of fluoride in water which should be investigated, my Department would support this research in the usual manner.</P>

      <P>The Southern Health Board has advised me that all investigations necessary for infertile couples are performed at Tralee General Hospital where facilities are available to treat basic forms of infertility. It is anticipated that the service will continue to develop in the coming years. The board has also advised me that there is an intra-uterine insemination service available for infertile women within the board's area at Erinville Hospital. This involves stimulation of the ovulation of the female followed by artificial insemination at a precise time. If the woman is not suitable for this treatment or if it is unsuccessful she will then be referred to the HARI Institute in Dublin, the regional fertility centre in University College Hospital, Galway, or the infertility centre in Belfast for intravenous fertilisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Blood Transfusion Service Board &ndash; BTSB &ndash; is required to meet the conditions of the Irish Medicines Board &ndash; IMB &ndash; in respect of all activities encompassed by its manufacturing licence which is granted by the IMB. It is a matter for the BTSB to determine how best to meet regulatory requirements in a manner acceptable to the IMB.</P>
      <P>In 1997 the IMB specified as a condition of the manufacturer's licence that the components laboratory at the Cork centre should be upgraded or replaced. In order to meet this requirement a number of options were considered by the BTSB including upgrading or replacement of the laboratory and the construction of a new centre. The figure of £5.8 million referred to by the Deputy was a provisional indication of the construction costs of one of these options, that is, the construction of a new centre. This option was not proceeded with by the BTSB so therefore the allocation of such an amount by my Department did not arise. In order to upgrade facilities at the Cork centre and meet the IMB requirements, my Department made available during 1998 and 1999 capital grants totalling £524,000 to complete the following works: a new components processing laboratory; a new product storage area; an upgrade of the donor clinic; and new office accommodation.</P>
      <P>In the light of these developments, the IMB advised the BTSB last December that the replacement of the components processing laboratory at the Cork centre was no longer envisaged or considered necessary. The IMB has deleted the special condition specified in the licence to which I have referred and has not specified any other condition which relates to capital projects at the centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding this, the BTSB considers that further capital investment in the Cork centre is desirable, and has approved an outline planning brief in this regard. A more detailed planning brief is now being prepared and a project team <Col N="1610" /> has been established within the BTSB. As the Cork centre is located on the campus of St. Finbarr's Hospital, the BTSB has written to the Southern Health Board seeking discussions in relation to its leasehold interest in the site.</P>
    <P>My Department will consider any application from the BTSB for further capital investment in the Cork centre as a matter of priority.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 261, 280, 281 and 282 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the contents of the document referred to by the Deputy. The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, gives powers to health boards to enforce high standards of accommodation and care in nursing homes, incorporating a system of twice yearly inspections by health board personnel. The Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations set out the standards with which nursing homes must comply in order to be registered by a health board. I am not aware of any grounds for potential conflict for health boards as suggested by the Deputy. I am satisfied with the present system of registration and inspections and I have no plans to introduce a licensing system which could result in limiting access to privately run and commercially operated nursing homes.</P>
      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, the health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care; however, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved.</P>
      <P>There are three rates of subvention payable, £70, £95 and £120, in accordance with three levels of dependency, medium, high, maximum, which are eligible for subvention. It had been hoped to increase the rates of subvention this year but it has not been possible to do so as substantial additional funding in excess of £5.3 million has had to be provided to meet the rising costs of the scheme. The additional expenditure is due to a number of factors such as the increase in the number of people in receipt of subventions, their higher levels of dependency, resulting in more people receiving the higher rates of subventions, and the change in the regulations whereby the ability of adult sons and/or daughters over 21 years of age to contribute is no longer taken into account. The amount made available for the scheme this year is £38.4 million.  My priority is to ensure that health boards have adequate resources to meet increasing demands. The question of increasing the rates of subvention will be kept under review in light of the availability of funding and competiting priorities.</P>

      <P>There are four types of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease &ndash; CJD. Sporadic CJD, the most common, usually affects individuals between the age of 50 and 75 years and is characterised by a rapidly progressive dementia. Familial CJD is an inherited disease associated with a gene mutation. Iatrogenic CJD results from transmission of the causative agent via medical or surgical treatment using accidentally contaminated materials, for example, surgical instruments. New variant CJD &ndash; vCJD &ndash; is a new disease which was first described in March 1996.</P>
      <P>Scientific evidence collected over recent years indicates that BSE and vCJD are most likely caused by the same BSE agent. In Ireland a system of active surveillance has been established to detect new cases of CJD. There has been one case of vCJD diagnosed in Ireland. This was in 1999.</P>

      <P>The regional health boards are responsible for the provision of services for the victims of domestic violence. These services, in the main, take the form of rape crisis interventions in addition to the provision of refuge accommodation for women and their families. The funding made available for this work has been increased over the past two years and there is now approximately £6 million spent on these services annually. In addition, I have made funding available this year through the Eastern Health Board in order to release two hospital based health care workers for a pilot project aimed at training accident and emergency staff to recognise the signs of domestic violence with a view to early intervention.</P>

      <Quest>the reason for the situation where the number of organ transplants fell in 1999 with the number of organ donors lower than in 1998; and the figures for each year.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned by the decline last year in organ donation and transplant rates. The number of multi-organ donors in the years 1998 and 1999 are as follows; number of organ donors 1998 &ndash; 91; number of organ donors 1999 &ndash; 72. The figures for organ transplants for these years in total are; 1998 &ndash; 201; 1999 &ndash; 150.</P>
      <P>The number of donors in 1999 was broadly in line with numbers reported in the years 1996 and 1997 but significantly lower than the 1998 performance.</P>
      <P>The Irish Kidney Association, with the support of national lottery funding allocated by my Department, conducts an ongoing national organ donor campaign and produces a multi-organ donor card. This has contributed to Ireland's position of having one of the highest rates of organ donation in Europe. The association's public awareness programme is recognised throughout Europe as being very effective and has been used as a model for donor campaigns in other countries. I have been informed by the association that, in collaboration with other donor support groups, they are in the process of launching a new campaign in the near future. The supply of an adequate number of donors is a prerequisite for the continuing provision and development of a comprehensive organ transplant service. Accordingly, I stress the continued need to highlight the importance of organ donation and to encourage people to carry the appropriate donor cards.</P>

      <Quest>if he will comment on a recent statement made by a person (details supplied) regarding certifying seriously ill patients for admission to St. Ita's Psychiatric Hospital in view of the fact that they would not voluntarily admit themselves due to reports of the out-dated facilities there.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Mental Treatment Act, 1945, as amended by subsequent Acts, provides the statutory framework for the detention of people with mental disorder. The criteria and admission procedures for voluntary and involuntary patients to a psychiatric hospital or unit are set down in the 1945 Act. <Col N="1615" /> The decision to admit a patient for care and treatment to a psychiatric hospital or unit rests with the consultant psychiatrist concerned and is based on clinical judgment. Those who require such care and treatment are first encouraged to enter a hospital or unit on a voluntary basis and it is noteworthy that a majority do so. The overriding concern of clinicians is to ensure that the appropriate care and treatment of the person concerned is provided and an order for involuntary detention may be required in order to achieve this.</P>
      <P>It has been acknowledged that much of the residential accommodation in the main hospital block at St. Ita's is no longer suitable to provide a modern therapeutic service for persons with mental illness. In view of this, additional funding has been provided for the following upgrade of facilities:</P>
      <P>(a) two new kitchen dining areas in the services based at Reilly's Hill &ndash; capital cost £130,000;</P>
      <P>(b) replacement of heating system and upgrading which is nearing completion &ndash; capital cost £118,000;</P>
      <P>(c) major upgrading and extension of the acute and assessment units, which is also nearing completion &ndash; £750,000.</P>
      <P>In addition, approval has recently been given to the provision of a 60 bed acute psychiatric unit at Beaumont Hospital at a cost of £5 million. When completed, this will enable facilities at St. Ita's to be transferred to Beaumont which will, in turn, allow the existing upgraded accommodation to be used for alternative care and accommodation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 14 December last, Judge Alison Lindsay, Chairperson of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the HIV and Hepatitis C Infection of Persons with Haemophilia and Related Matters, ruled on an application on behalf of the Irish Haemophilia Society for an interim order as to costs. The chairperson ruled that the tribunal does not have jurisdiction to grant an interim order for costs to any party and that, therefore, she was precluded from making an interim order in relation to costs in favour of the society.</P>
      <P>Immediately after this ruling was delivered, counsel for the Department of Health and Children informed the tribunal that the Department was prepared to consider, on a strictly without prejudice basis and not on the basis of any legal obligation to do so, the question of providing remuneration to legal representatives of the society appearing at public sittings of the tribunal. Counsel went on to indicate that the Department was prepared to have discussions with the society in relation to such matters as the amount and timing of any such payments and the avoidance of double benefit if the society was, in due course, to be awarded its costs in whole or in part by the tribunal. It was also indicated that the Department was determined that any such discussions would not delay the commencement of public sittings of the tribunal and would not be in contempt of the powers of the tribunal.</P>
      <P>On 17 December, an offer of exceptional financial assistance was made to the society on a strictly without prejudice basis. The main features of the offer were as follows:</P>
      <P>(i)a sum amounting to two thirds of counsel's brief fee to be made available by the Department, at the same rate as that set for the Department's counsel, in respect of not more than two senior counsel and two junior counsel;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)a sum amounting to two thirds of the refresher fees payable thereafter to counsel to be made available, at the same rate as that set for the Department's counsel, in respect of cer<Col N="1617" /> tified attendance by the society's counsel at sitting days of the tribunal;</P>
    <P>(iii)two thirds of the society's solicitors fees to be made available, at the same rate as that set for the tribunal's solicitor, in respect of certified attendance by the society's solicitor at sitting days of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>While there have been some informal contacts between the parties since then, the society has not yet given a definitive response to the offer. However, within the last few days, proceedings have been issued by the society on the question of costs against the tribunal, Ireland and the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to expert witnesses is that it is a matter for the tribunal to decide which witnesses will be called to give oral evidence. The chairperson has stated that the parties represented at the tribunal are free to suggest to the tribunal witnesses who they feel would be in a position to give relevant evidence and that the tribunal will consider all such suggestions. In the event of a witness recommended by the society being called by the tribunal, his or her expenses will be met by the tribunal.</P>

      <P>A number of complex legal issues remain to be resolved before heads of a Bill to amend the Act can be prepared, and officials of my Department are currently in consultations with the Irish Haemophilia Society and its legal advisors in this regard. When these consultations have been completed, I will consult the Attorney General in relation to those issues and in relation to the preparation of heads of a Bill.</P>

      <P>I note that the Deputy specifically refers to health insurance companies.

      <Quest>the way in which he proposes to deal with his Department's chief medical officer's report which states that the poorest groups in our society tend to suffer the greatest level of morbidity; and the action, if any, he proposes to take in order to reduce excess morbidity and mortality among this group.</Quest>
      <QRef>[3101/00]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>International research has found that there are large differentials in mortality and morbidity between the higher and lower socio-economic groups and the conclusions from this research are that health inequalities are primarily a consequence of material differences in living standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main principles underlying the 1994 health strategy are equity, quality of service and <Col N="1620" /> accountability. The strategy sets a framework for reorienting the health services to achieve health and social gain with a particular emphasis on improving the situation of people in the lower socio-economic groups. It states that the pursuit of equity must extend beyond the question of access to services and must also be concerned with variations in health status between groups.</P>
    <P>In 1998, my Department commissioned the first nationally representative survey of lifestyle practices, the national health and lifestyle surveys, to provide baseline data to plan future interventions. This research reached similar conclusions as the health strategy. The data forms the basis of my Department's new health promotion strategy for the years 2000 to 2005.  It will have specific strategic aims and objectives that in the long term will contribute to reducing health inequalities.</P>
    <P>Many of the causal factors of health inequalities, such as poverty and unemployment, are outside the direct control of the health services. Inter-sectoral collaboration is required to tackle these problems.</P>
    <P>The Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion chaired by the Taoiseach includes Ministers from eight relevant Departments who meet regularly. Senior officials of the social inclusion group from relevant Departments also meet regularly to prepare the agenda and recommendations for the Cabinet committee. The NAPS interdepartmental group provides the principal strategic focus for the national anti-poverty strategy &ndash; NAPS.</P>
    <P>The national anti-poverty strategy was published in 1997 and set out a programme to reduce poverty and social exclusion both in general and in a number of key policy areas. Substantial progress has been made in achieving the original targets. Although health or health targets were not included in the original NAPS targets, my Department has been involved in setting and reviewing annual workplans for NAPS.  In addition, in the context of the new partnership agreement, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, my Department will take part in a group to consider the setting of health targets to be included in the next phase of the national anti-poverty strategy.</P>
    <P>The national cancer strategy set a target of reducing the proportion of deaths from cancer in the under 65 age group by 15%. Funding, totalling £40 million to date, has been invested in a range of service developments under the strategy, to the benefit of all, including in particular those socio-economic groups at a greater relative risk of contracting cancer due to environmental or lifestyle factors.</P>
    <P>The recently launched cardiovascular health strategy had noted that the lower socio economic groups seem to suffer disproportionately from heart disease. In this context two targets have been set for 2010. The medium term objective is <Col N="1621" /> to bring Irish levels of premature deaths from cardiovascular disease in line with the EU average at a minimum. The longer term goal is to reduce Irish rates to those of the best performers in the EU.</P>
    <P>The waiting list initiative is aimed at ensuring that no adult has to wait longer than 12 months and no child longer that six months for access to an acute public hospital procedure. The achievement of these targets, which is being pursued through the implementation of a comprehensive set of short, medium and longer term measures, would represent an important improvement in access to care for those in the lower socio-economic groups and others relying on public hospital services.</P>
    <P>The overall budget for health services for 2000 excluding capital is almost £4 billion. This represents a substantial increase of just over one third over the past two years and is a clear recognition of the Government's commitment to provide a high quality health service directed at those most in need.</P>
    <P>The £2 billion earmarked in the NDP for health capital for the seven year period 2000-06 represents almost a trebling of investment compared to the previous seven year period. This investment will provide a physical infrastructure to underpin a public health service characterised by ongoing improvements in quality and accessibility and will be a significant ingredient in improving the mortality and morbidity of the poorest groups in our society.</P>
    <P>The ability of a society to create and maintain an environment which supports its people in attaining the highest level of health compatible with their natural endowment is one of the key indicators of the stage of development of a society and is recognised as such by its inclusion in the UN's list of human development indicators. Much work has already been done in Ireland on a multi-sectoral approach to poverty and social inclusion.  It is essential that we continue to build and improve on the framework in place in the context of revised NAPS targets, NDP funding and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

    <P>A group has been set up in my Department to <Col N="1624" /> consider how best to implement this policy.

      <P>There are a number of exemptions to the charge, including medical card holders, women receiving services in respect of motherhood, children up to the age of six weeks and children referred for treatment from child health clinics and school health examinations. Also exempt from the statutory charges, in respect of treatment for the particular condition, are children suffering from prescribed diseases and disabilities &ndash; that is mental handicap, mental illness, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, haemophilia and cerebral palsy. Where the exemptions do not apply the charge may be waived if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, payment would cause undue hardship.</P>

The Smokebusters project, which is aimed at primary school children &ndash; seven to 11 years in an urban environment &ndash; was developed by the Irish Cancer Society, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Service and the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>Action against smoking also continues at health board level and in the voluntary sector.

Approximately £50 million of this related to accumulated shortfalls arising in the period 1997-99. These shortfalls arose largely from higher than anticipated expenditure on the new high tech scheme introduced in 1997 and also above average expenditure on other newer drug therapies for the treatment of cardiovascular disease, mental illness and asthma. Improved estimating and reporting arrangements have now been put in place to ensure that adequate funding is in place to meet the future funding requirements of the drug schemes.</P>

My Department is in full agreement with BreastCheck on this issue. However, I have requested a more detailed technical evaluation of the study which findings I will be happy to make available to the Deputy when the work is completed.</P>

Locum cover, if used, is an interim arrangement, pending the filling of the post on a permanent basis. Locums may also be used to cover periods of sick leave, maternity leave or other periods of special leave. The use of a locum does not imply a lower priority for the development of mental health services. I am committed to the provision of quality health care in the delivery of psychiatric services.</P>

      <P>My predecessor, Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, has outlined in detail the work of the Department and the group established to oversee the implementation of the report &ldquo;Towards a Standardised Framework of Inter-country Adoption Assessment Procedures&rdquo;. Its work has already ensured that the first stage of the assessment process is being implemented according to the new model since the beginning of the year. In addition, a range of initiatives are taking place country-wide to meet the specific priorities which are particular to the different boards intercountry adoption services.</P>
      <P>An additional £26,000 has was allocated to the South Eastern Health Board in 1999 and an additional £48,000 in 2000 in respect of developing intercountry adoption services in the board's region. At the 1 of January 2000 there were 58 applicants on the waiting list of which 20 were in the Carlow/Kilkenny catchment area. From information received from the health board I understand that a competition has been held for a social worker post specifically for the Carlow/Kilkenny area of the adoption service and an appointment is imminent. Two additional posts for the regional adoption services are due to be advertised shortly. The board has also informed me that a child care manager has been given responsibility for the co-ordination of the new training elements involved in the standardised framework. This is the first stage in implementation of the framework which will ultimately ensure a more streamlined processing of applicants for assessment.</P>
      <P>Adoption services in the South Eastern Health Board area are provided by SEEK Regional Adoption Services which forms part of the board's community care programme. In addition to the priorities identified in the report on the standardised framework, the South Eastern Health Board has carried out a review of the regional adoption service. The report of this review is due to be presented to the committee of SEEK this week and I have been advised that it contains proposals regarding the organisation and staffing of the service.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that with these initiatives the board is doing its utmost to streamline the assessment process and increase throughput of applications. Together with an increased complement of social workers these measures should bring about a significant increase in the number of assessments being completed in the board in the year 2000.</P>

According to the Board there were 190 children in the Carlow-Kilkenny community care area on the waiting list for orthodontic assessment on 31 December 1999. There was a total of 634 children on the waiting list for orthodontic treatment in the South Eastern Health Board region as at 31 December 1999. The treatment waiting list is centralised at Waterford Regional Hospital. Having a centralised waiting list for the whole board has enabled patients from all over the region to be treated in chronological order resulting in no one county falling significantly behind another in regard to patients being treated. A total of 202 children from the Carlow-Kilkenny area were undergoing orthodontic treatment as at 31 December 1999.</P>

      <P>A voluntary code of practice on smoking in the workplace was launched in September 1994. This code is supported by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, Irish Heart Foundation, Irish Cancer Society, ASH Ireland and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.

While the code of practice is working well in some workplaces other workplace situations are less than satisfactory.</P>

      <P>The Irish health care system is structured to ensure that a high quality health care system is available to people based on need rather than <Col N="1692" /> ability to pay. This commitment to the principle of equity was reinforced in the national health strategy &ndash; Shaping a Healthier Future. In the context of this underlying principle of equity, it is considered that public funds can be utilised to best effect so that those who have the means to do so fund their own care or contribute to the cost of that care.  The OECD publication Economic Survey of Ireland (1997) concluded that the system based on a mixture of public and private care had &ldquo;resulted in good provision of health care at a relatively low cost to the tax payer&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Where people do not qualify for a medical card under income guidelines drawn up annually by health board chief executive officers, who have statutory responsibility for the determination of eligibility, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that a person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
      <P>Non-medical card holders are entitled, subject to certain charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultants services and out-patient public hospital services including consultants services. The current public hospital statutory in-patient charge is £26 in respect of each day a person is maintained, subject to a maximum payment in any 12 consecutive months of £260. Dental and routine ophthalmic and aural services are excluded from out-patient services available. However, such treatment is provided to children who have been referred from a child health clinic or a school health examination. Attendance at accident and emergency departments is subject to a charge of £25 where the patient does not have a referral note from his/her doctor. This charge applies only to the first visit in any episode of care. There are a number of exemptions from payment of these charges including women receiving services in respect of motherhood, children up to the age of six weeks, children suffering from a number of prescribed diseases and disabilities, and persons receiving services in respect of prescribed infectious diseases.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, a health board may consider any asset, including house property, of the person in respect of whom a subvention has been sought as a source of funding for nursing home care, subject <Col N="1693" /> to certain exceptions. For example a health board is obliged to disregard the principal residence in the assessment of a person's means if it is occupied immediately prior to or at the time of the application and continues to be occupied by a spouse, a son or daughter aged less than 21 years or in full time education or a relative in receipt of disability allowances or pension or who is in receipt of an old age non contributory pension. Subject to the above, a health board may impute an annual income equivalent to 5% of the estimated market value of the principal residence of the person, net of mortgage, loan, rental or purchase repayments existing prior to or at the time of the application. I am satisfied that these provisions are applicable under the terms of nursing home legislation.</P>

      <P>I have had inquiries made of the Children's Hospital, Temple Street concerning this matter. I have been informed that the hospital has not introduced any recent changes to their billing process for services and appliances to children and that bills are currently issued in accordance with my Department's guidelines for in-patient and casualty attendances.</P>
      <P>The children's hospital does not receive funding for the procurement of appliances in respect of out-patient prescriptions. I understand however, that, in the past, the children's hospital has made payments for certain orthopaedic appliances and that these were <i>ex-gratia</i> payments on behalf of parents. However, the hospital has also informed me that appliances fitted and supplied through prescription are not the responsibility of the hospital but rather the health board, in the case of medical card holders, or alternatively, the responsibility of the parents of the child to whom the prescription is made. It should be stated that all appliances fitted to children admitted as in-patients remain uncharged.</P>
      <P>In cases of hardship, the hospital, in accordance with its charter for the care of children, will continue to make a contribution towards the purchase of appliances where not to do so would interfere with the continuing treatment of the child. Such funding is provided from the hospital's social fund.</P>

      <P>The provision of child and family counselling services in County Roscommon is a matter for the Western Health Board. I understand from the board that there is a locally based child psychological service which is provided by one senior child psychologist and two child psychologists. In addition, there is an outreach psychiatric service provided on a one day a month basis and on demand when child protection issues arise. The hospital service based at St Anne's, Taylor's Hill, Galway is available to young people from Roscommon. The health board makes available grant aid of £13,000 per annum to the family centre in Boyle to provide a counselling service. Counselling services are also available through the neighbourhood youth project in Boyle.</P>
      <P>This year my Department made £190,000 available to the Western Health Board to establish a counselling service for victims of past abuse. This allocation will allow for the creation of a counsellor post to be based in County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I am aware that a number of voluntary groups have applied for additional funds from the Western Health Board to develop a range of counselling services and it is a matter for the board to decide on its priorities in the context of the resources available to it. The board received an additional £1.879 million for the further development of a range of child care and family support services in its net determination for 2000.</P>

      <P>Part B of the building regulations, which came into effect on 1 June, 1992, sets out the requirements in relation to fire safety in the design and construction of new buildings and the extension of, material alteration or change of use to existing buildings. Buildings built and/or extended in accordance with the 1991 edition of technical guidance document B required that the buildings be fitted with battery operated smoke alarms.</P>
      <P>I published a revised and upgraded technical guidance document B (fire safety) in December, 1997, which recommends that buildings built and/or extended on or after 1 July 1998 should be fitted with mains operated smoke alarms, rather than battery operated alarms.</P>
      <P>The National Safety Council actively encourages fire safety in the home as part of its ongoing fire safety education and publicity campaigns. Particular stress has been placed in its campaigns on the value of smoke alarms which, if properly installed and maintained, can provide early warning of fire and save lives. These campaigns have stressed the need to check batteries in smoke alarms regularly. The council has also carried out a campaign in recent years to install smoke alarms in houses occupied by the elderly and other vulnerable persons. In addition, local authorities have been asked by my Department to consider the provision of smoke alarms in their rented dwellings.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals to introduce legislation to provide for mandatory installation of smoke alarms in existing buildings generally. Fire safety is the responsibility of the individual property owners.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 339 and 340 together.</P>
      <P>The revised An Action Programme for the Millennium undertook to improve the Dublin taxi service through the introduction of measures to increase the number of taxi licences in Dublin as quickly as possible in order to ensure a proper balance between supply and demand in the market. On 30 November 1999 the Government approved measures for the early grant of a large number of new taxi licences in Dublin, involving the offer of one additional taxi or wheelchair accessible taxi licence to each individual who held a licence at end 1999, as well as 500 further licences to be granted to applicants under the current points assessment system. Of the licences to be granted 500 will be in respect of wheelchair accessible taxis.</P>
      <P>On 13 January 2000, I made regulations which establish an application process for all existing taxi licence holders in Dublin to apply for the grant of either a taxi or a wheelchair accessible taxi licence from Dublin Corporation. Individual notice to this effect has issued to all existing licence holders, and applications must be received by the corporation on or before 18 February 2000. The regulations also provide for the making of an offer to grant a wheelchair accessible taxi licence to each licence holder who expresses a preference for the grant of such a licence and who complies with the requirements of the regulations.</P>
      <P>The remaining licences, including those to be offered to applicants under the current assessment system, are to be allocated in accordance with a scheme which I will shortly finalise.  It is open to any individual to make application for the grant of one of the 500 licences under the assessment system. Such applications will be subject to the normal application process to be administered by Dublin Corporation. All licences to be granted will be transferable without restriction and restrictions on the transfer of certain existing taxi licences in Dublin will also cease with effect from 18 February 2000.</P>

      <P>A tenant of a local authority house for at least one year may apply to the local authority to purchase the house. The price of the house is based on its market value, as determined by the local authority. Any increase in the market value due to improvements by the tenant are disregarded in calculating the price. To assist long-term tenants to purchase their homes a discount of 3% of the value of the house is allowed for each year of tenancy, up to a maximum discount of 30% plus an additional discount of £3,000. In addition, a shared ownership option is available to enable a tenant to buy a share in the house now and the remainder within 25 years.</P>
      <P>A tenant who surrenders local authority or voluntary housing accommodation is eligible to purchase a home under the affordable housing and shared ownership schemes. Under the affordable housing scheme, houses are offered for sale at cost price and mortgage finance at favourable interest rates applies. Under the shared ownership scheme purchasers buy at least 40% of the value of the house and rent the remaining share. A subsidy is available under both schemes for households with incomes of up to £16,000 per annum.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme. Since this Government came into office a sum of £15 million has been provided for this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of £5 million has been allocated to the scheme this year. In general, grants under the Scheme cover from 50 per cent to 90 per cent of the once-off cost of the purchase and/or installation of the necessary security equipment. While <Col N="1711" /> the maximum grant available under this scheme is 90 per cent of the total cost, it is not possible to guarantee this level of funding in respect of all applications received under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Priority in allocating the available funds will be given to the most vulnerable older people. The actual amount of the grant will vary in the light of individual circumstances and needs and the overall demands which must be met.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme once-off grants can be made towards the cost of: small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially-monitored alarm systems such as the panic button pendant which is worn around the neck or wrist and operated via the telephone.</P>
    <P>Funding is not available under the scheme for conventional intruder-burglar alarms.</P>
    <P>To qualify for assistance under the scheme, older people &ndash; aged 65 or over &ndash; must be living alone or be living in households made up exclusively of older people, or of older and other people who are dependent and vulnerable and be unable to install or purchase the security equipment or alarm system themselves.</P>
    <P>I propose to have advertised the scheme in both the national and provincial press by mid-March, at which time any voluntary or community-based organisation working with or providing support for vulnerable older people may submit applications for funding.</P>

      <P>It is understood the Deputy is referring to the position of people who were aged 56 or over in April 1988 when social insurance for the self-employed was introduced.</P>
      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory pension &ndash; which applies to all insured people (both employees and the self-employed) &ndash; requires a person to have entered social insurance ten years before reaching pension age, which is 66. This condition has been a feature of the scheme since it was introduced in 1961. Its purpose is to ensure that entitlement to the pension is directed to those who have made a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of their careers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in line with this Government's commitment to extend contributory pensions cover<Col N="1712" /> age to people who narrowly failed to qualify for contributory pensions, last April I introduced new pension arrangements for a very specific group of people. These are self-employed people who were 56 years of age or over in April 1988 &ndash; when social insurance was extended to the self-employed &ndash; and who could not qualify for a pension as they did not satisfy the standard requirement of having entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.</P>
    <P>A special old age contributory pension is, therefore, now available to those self employed people who were aged 56 or over in April 1988 and who have, at least, five years contributions paid since then. Payment is at a flat-rate of 50% of the standard maximum rate with equivalent increases for adult and child dependants, where applicable. I consider these new arrangements to be fair reflecting, as they do, a certain consistency of commitment to the social insurance fund over a given period of time.</P>

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance a weekly supplement may be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to people in receipt of social welfare or health board payments.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to a supplement is determined by the health boards and supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6.</P>
      <P>This £6 represents the minimum contribution which clients are required to pay from their own resources. Applicants are also required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate towards their rent or mortgage interest supplement.</P>
      <P>When budget increases are applied, a rent or mortgage interest supplement recipient who gets an increase in their weekly payment which is greater than the increase in the basic rate of SWA will see a reduction in their rent or mortgage interest supplement equivalent to the difference in the two increases. These rules also apply to unemployed people and other rent supplement recipients who take up part-time employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter will be examined when the SWA <Col N="1713" /> scheme is reviewed as part of my Department's series of formal programme evaluations. A working group comprising officials from my Department and other relevant agencies has now been established and the review is expected to commence in a few weeks.</P>

      <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs' grant schemes provide support for community and personal development work undertaken by a wide range of local self-help groups. This support is designed to meet the needs of local groups and linked to form an overall framework of support and progression for community and family support groups at different stages of development.</P>
      <P>My Department acknowledges that disadvantaged people, in both urban and rural areas, can experience particular problems arising from poverty and marginalisation, and that community groups generally have an important role to play in tackling these problems.</P>
      <P>Under the 1999 scheme of grants to voluntary organisations, an application was received from Charleville Community Care and Garden Services Limited seeking funding of £25,000 towards the cost of equipment, required to set up sheltered work training and experience services for unemployed men recovering from mental illnesses, or having borderline social skills. The application was examined at both regional and local level but was found not to come within the scope of my Department's grant schemes. Funding for projects of this nature is primarily the responsibility of the local health board and FÁS.</P>
      <P>I am aware however that services provided by Charleville Community Care and Garden Services also include provision for family and bereavement counselling. In December 1999, an application was received from the group, under my Department's scheme of grants for marriage, child and bereavement counselling services, and I approved funding amounting to £1,500 which was paid to the group on the 22 December 1999. If Charleville Community Care and Garden Services wish to make an application under this year's scheme, application forms are currently available from my Department's family affairs unit, Marlborough Street, Dublin 1.</P>
      <P>In recent months, officials from my regional office in Limerick have been in contact with Charleville Community Care and Garden Services and on two occasions have advised the group that they may be eligible for assistance towards the cost of pre-employment training under my Department's employment support services scheme. To date no application under this scheme has been received from them.</P>

      <P>My Department has for a number of years operated a range of grants schemes and programmes which concentrate on a wide range of support for local self-help groups, <Col N="1715" /> community development, welfare rights and information work, and on the provision of seed money to enable community groups to pilot initiatives identified as meeting new emerging community needs.</P>
      <P>Funding is also available from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs towards the cost of staffing and equipping of local resource centres which provide a focal point for community development activities in disadvantaged areas and for work with specific disadvantaged groups under the community development support programmes; the community development programme, the family and community services resource centre programme and the programme of core-funding for locally based community and family support groups.</P>
      <P>Applications from groups seeking inclusion in these Programmes are assessed by an independent Technical Group established to advise me on the selection of new areas and groups for funding.</P>
      <P>Gingerbread Ireland has made an application to this Department, seeking core funding. This application was assessed by the technical group at their meeting on 8 December 1999. The recommendation from the technical group was that the application did not meet the criteria for inclusion, but that representatives from the Department should meet with the organisation to explain the situation and to discuss what possibilities might exist for funding work by Gingerbread, that would come within the remit of the Department's community development support programmes.</P>
      <P>This meeting took place on 12 January 2000 and the matter is now being referred back to the technical group for further consideration at the next technical group meeting on 22 February 2000. The group will be notified of the outcome of their application as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The legislative provisions relating to late claims for social welfare benefits are set out in Section 205 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993 as amended, and in Regulations made under that section. These provisions set out the times within which a person must claim, the disqualifications which apply where a claim is made late, and the circumstances in which the time limits may be extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1716" /> In the case of old age contributory pension, retirement pension, widow's and widower's contributory pension and orphan's contributory allowance, following changes made to the legislation in 1997, payment may be made on foot of late claims for up to 12 months. Furthermore, under Regulations which I made in 1998, where a claim under these schemes is more than 12 months late, the period of payment can be is extended on a proportional basis. In addition, payment may be made, without restriction on time, where: the delay was due to incorrect information having been given by my Department, or illness or a <i>force majeure</i> prevented a person from claiming earlier or, the person is dependent on the arrears of payment to relieve financial hardship.</P>
    <P>In all cases, the person must be able to show that he or she fulfilled all the relevant conditions governing entitlement throughout the period for which the claim is made.</P>
    <P>Payment on foot of late claims in the case of most other schemes may be made for a period &ndash; in nearly all cases six months &ndash; provided there was good cause for the late claim. In addition there are extra-statutory provisions for extending the time limits in exceptional cases. Regulations will shortly be made to put remaining extra-statutory provisions on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>The guidelines for staff entitled &ldquo;Claims and Late Claims&rdquo;, which detail how the above provisions should be applied, are published on the Internet on my Department's website at www.welfare.ie. I am arranging for a copy of these guidelines to be sent to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to Question No. 84 of 1 February 2000. As I have advised the House, the <i>Asgard</i> is in the ownership of the Minister for Defence. My sole responsibility in relation to it arose from an application from the <i>Asgard </i>Restoration Project Limited for a licence under the National Monuments Acts to alter the <i>Asgard </i>in order to bring it to full sailing and sea-going condition.</P>
      <P>A licence to alter the <i>Asgard</i> under the National Monuments Acts and the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997 was issued to the <i>Asgard </i>Restoration Project Limited on 23 December 1999 by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conditions attached to the licence are as follows: full report to be submitted to the National Museum of Ireland within six months of the completion of any alteration; curriculum vitae to be submitted to the National Museum of Ireland outlining the qualifications and experience of any professional persons to be involved with the alteration and the qualifications and experience of any tradespeople involved; a detailed proposal or work schedule in relation to the proposed work of alteration should be sent to the director of the National Museum of Ireland; list or lists to be provided to the National Museum of Ireland, at regular intervals, of all the individual components that it is proposed to remove restore, clean, drill, alter, or destroy; any components whatsoever removed from the vessel are to be stored safely and securely for inspection, if necessary by the National Museum of <Col N="1719" /> Ireland or a person duly authorised by the National Museum of Ireland; access by the National Museum of Ireland must be facilitated to inspect work in progress.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that this licence, issued under the National Monuments Acts and the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997, relates only to archaeological issues. Matters relating to health and safety, marine safety and any other relevant issues fall to be addressed by the relevant statutory authorities.</P>

      <P>My Department commenced work at St. Mary's Church, Gowran in 1994. Since that time the church has been re-roofed and conservation works have been carried out. At present conservation of the tombs, which will be permanently housed and displayed in the church, is in progress. The church is being re-wired and underfloor heating is being installed, the interior of the modern church will be re-plastered and the blocked arch between the tower and the nave of the 13th century church will be opened up. Works have also commenced on the tower of the church and guide facilities have been provided.</P>

      <P>While I recognise that additional funding could be used to good effect by the heritage council in carrying out its statutory functions under the Heritage Act 1995, the annual funding provided to the council has increased by 92% since I came to office in June 1997.</P>
      <P>In addition, I recently announced a special once off allocation of £750,000 towards the restoration of Ballyfin House, which will be administered by the heritage council.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This area is part of the proposed candidate special area of conservation known as Gweedore Bay and Islands. The area was proposed for designation primarily because of its importance as an example of natural progression in machair development from sandflat through saltmarsh to the mature machair phase. However my Department agreed to the removal of the playing pitch as it was degraded machair and unsuitable for inclusion within the proposed site. Further exclusions were requested including a site for the relocation of the football pitch within the site but <Col N="1721" /> these were not agreed to because there was no scientific basis for this.</P>
    <P>My Department has received no communication from the EU Commission in the matter.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that my officials acted correctly to protect the site.</P>

      <P>Over 1998 and 1999, funding of £11 million was provided for an equal opportunities child care programme which supported the development of child care from a social inclusion and equal opportunities perspective. This programme provided supports under a number of strands including capital grants for the establishment, upgrading and enhancement of 106 community based child care facilities and grants towards the cost of two senior level child care personnel in each of 25 identified flagship community projects. The programme also supported an employer demonstration initiative designed to encourage employer involvement in the development of services for their employees which led to the establishment and upgrading of child care facilities in eight projects involving 21 employers. Funding has also been provided under the programme for the development of six national voluntary child care organisations, training and development in community based child care projects, the development of a national child care census and database, research into family friendly policies and for child care training for staff in drug service locations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, child care has been identified as a priority area for investment in the National Development Plan 2000 to 2006 which provides £250 million to my Department to support the development of child care service provision over the next seven years. This funding will support the following range of measures. Expanded equal opportunities child care programme including capital grants to establish, upgrade and enhance community based child care facilities; staffing grants for community based child care services; training supports for community based child care services; supports for the national voluntary child care organisations; supports to build on existing child care initiatives; supports for new innovative and flexible child care initiatives; support towards the development of local child care networks; and new capital grant scheme for child care service providers <Col N="1723" /> catering for up to 20 child care places. The grants will support providers to establish, upgrade or enhance their services assisting them to provide a safe environment for children. It is intended to advertise the availability of these new schemes in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>In the recent budget, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, announced the introduction of a scheme which will provide for accelerated capital allowances at the rate of 100% in the first year for expenditure on the construction, refurbishment or extension of premises used for child care purposes. This relief is available to all child care facilities whether provided by employers or commercial child care operators. The measure came into effect from 1 December 1999 and is subject to clearance by the EU Commission.</P>
    <P>In addition the provision of free or subsidised child care facilities by employers, whether &ldquo;in-house&rdquo; or in premises made available by the employer in another location, is exempt from a benefit-in-kind charge on employees benefiting from the facilities.</P>
    <P>My Department has also been assigned responsibility for co-ordinating child care service delivery and structures are being established at national and local levels to this end. The structures include an interdepartmental committee on child care, a national co-ordinating child care committee, both of which will be chaired by my Department and county child care committees which will be led by the relevant health board. It is intended that the structures will facilitate an integrated approach to child care service delivery.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The height requirements for entry to the Garda Síochána, which are historical, are prescribed by regulation and are currently under review. All aspects of this issue, including the differential in the height requirements for men and women, are being carefully considered in the context of this review. The review is ongoing and requires wide <Col N="1724" /> consultation. I am not in a position, at this stage, to indicate when it will be completed. Any proposals I may have in this regard will be submitted for consideration by the Government in due course.</P>
    <P>The height differential is not contrary to existing employment equality legislation. The Employment Equality Act, 1998, permits the application of different height criteria for men and women provided that the criteria chosen are such that the proportion of women in the State likely to meet the criterion for women is approximately the same as the proportion of men likely to meet the criterion for men.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the drugs unit based at Blanchardstown Garda station covers the Finglas area, in addition to the areas of Blanchardstown and Cabra. This drugs unit works closely with uniform patrols, detective units, the crime task force, and the divisional traffic unit. The unit is comprised of one sergeant and eight gardaí and the Garda authorities have assured me that it operates with a high degree of efficiency and success.</P>
      <P>As I stated in my reply to the Deputy's Parliamentary Question No. 660 of 26 January 2000, in addition to dedicated local drugs units, all members of the Garda Síochána in the Dublin metropolitan region have a responsibility for, and are tasked with, the enforcement of drugs legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that <Col N="1726" /> the establishment of a local Garda drugs unit in the Finglas and Cabra district is not envisaged at the present time.</P>

      <P>A system of direct provision will for the most part represent a cashless system with the State assuming responsibility for funding suitable accommodation, for providing health and education services and other essential needs. Genuine asylum seekers who are actually fleeing persecution, will, I believe, welcome this service and are unlikely to view it as a diminution in the quality of the services provided by the State, given that one of its purposes is to prevent fraud, and as a result lead to a more speedy identification of those who are in need of the State's protection.</P>
      <P>The introduction of direct provision in this State will simply bring us into line with other member states. It is widely accepted that a harmonised approach to asylum matters is by far the best approach and in introducing this system I am satisfied that it will represent a fair and effective means of meeting the basic needs of our asylum population. In addition the decision of the UK to move to a system of direct provision on 1 April 2000 must be taken into account. Given that we maintain a common travel area with the UK which is of enormous value and relevance to the island of Ireland and Irish people generally, a decision of this character by the UK has to be taken into consideration very seriously by any Irish Government.</P>
      <P>The Government decided on 9 November 1999 to establish a central directorate to deal with matters relating to the dispersal of asylum seekers throughout the country and preparations of plans for a system of direct provision of housing, health needs, etc. The directorate is currently examining various options that might be available to meet asylum seekers needs by a method other than full cash payments. These include the introduction of smart cards which could be credited on a specific date and used in outlets which have smart card readers; the introduction of vouchers which could be redeemed in specific outlets for goods and services or the provision of full board accommodation which would enable accommodation and dietary needs to be met directly in the same facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to the accommodation shortage in the Dublin area, some asylum seekers are cur<Col N="1727" /> rently being provided for on a full board basis, with a reduced personal allowance, at locations throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I will shortly bring before the Government proposals outlining the strategy for the dispersal of asylum seekers and for meeting their needs through direct provision.</P>

      <P>The main powers and functions of the National Disability Authority, NDA, are set out in sections 7, 8, 10, 13, 14 and 15 of the National Disability Authority Act, 1999. The authority is expected to be established on a statutory basis on the dissolution of the National Rehabilitation Board which is expected to take place in the first half of this year.</P>
      <P>Section 7 establishes the authority as an independent statutory body under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Section 8 provides that the principal function of the authority shall be to advise the Minister and keep him or her informed of developments in the areas which concern issues of policy and practice in relation to people with disabilities. The authority is also charged with assisting the Minister in the co-ordination and development of policy, the undertaking of research, acting as an advisory body on the development of standards in programmes and services and monitoring the implementation of standards and codes of practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 10 provides that the authority may draw up codes of practice. Section 13 gives the authority right of access to information relevant to its functions which is held by a public body. Section 14 empowers the authority to seek information concerning a programme or service from those responsible for its provision. Section 15 requires the authority to report to the Minister on an annual basis and in any additional cases where it thinks fit and further empowers the authority to recommend to the Minister that funding <Col N="1728" /> provided for programmes and services be the subject of review, reduction or withdrawal.</P>
    <P>The budgetary allocation for the NDA is approximately £2 million for the year 2000.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that it is an offence to drive, or be in charge of a vehicle, while under the influence of drugs. Section 49 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as inserted by section 10 of the Road Traffic Act 1994, prohibits the driving of a mechanically propelled vehicle by a person while under the influence of an intoxicant &ndash; an intoxicant includes alcohol and drugs and any combination of drugs and alcohol.</P>
      <P>Where a Garda suspects a motorist of driving a vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant, a sample can be taken and forwarded through the Medical Bureau of Road Safety to the State laboratory at Abbotstown for analysis. If the presence of drugs in the driver's system is evident from the sample analysis, then this evidence coupled with the evidence of driving defects can be presented in court to prove the offence.</P>
      <P>I am informed that in 1998, on request from the Garda Síochána, the medical bureau arranged for 32 samples to be analysed by the State laboratory for the testing for presence of drugs, the corresponding figure for 1999 was 50.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 384 and 385 together.</P>
      <P>Negotiations between the Irish Medical Organisation and officials of my Department in relation to claims for increases in all fees for medico-legal work conducted by GPs on behalf of the Garda Síochána and restructuring of the relevant fee schedules were concluded in late December.</P>
      <P>With effect from 1 December 1999, the basic fee for doctor attendance at a Garda station is £50 between 9 a.m and 5 p.m and £80 between 5 p.m. and 9 a.m. Previously, the fees ranged between £25.09 and £63.33 depending on the time of call-out. The higher rate of £80 is paid for duty on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays. Additional fees are payable where the doctor is required to examine more than one patient &ndash; £30 and £55 for office and out-of-office hours, respectively. The higher rate of £55 is paid for examinations on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays.</P>
      <P>The revised fees for court attendance by GPs on behalf of the Garda Síochána, also effective from 1 December 1999, are £200 for half-day attendance and £400 for full day attendance. Previously, the fees ranged between £55.89 and £123.64 depending on the number of hours absence from home. In addition, where a doctor is required to employ a locum while in court, he is entitled to claim vouched expenses up to a limit of £75 for a half-day or £150 for a full day.</P>
      <P>Court attendance by consultants generally, arises in relation to civil cases and the fixing of fees for such attendance is a matter for the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and Law Society. I have no role in the matter.</P>

      <P>Garda management had raised concerns about the arrangements for medical matters within the organisation. The existing structure was centred around the post of Garda surgeon and dates back to the establishment of <Col N="1730" /> the Garda Síochána. The holder of that post has a rank equivalent to assistant commissioner and has full Garda powers, which may not be appropriate in this day and age.</P>
      <P>I am of the view that it is time to modernise the situation and allow for a more flexible approach. As part of this process, the Garda authorities are seeking to have a doctor employed with expertise in occupational medicine to be appointed as a chief medical officer. The salary scale will be £47,795-£57,000.</P>
      <P>One of his or her most important roles will be advising Garda management on matters relating to the welfare of the force which has now reached a strength of nearly 11,500 men and women. There will obviously be some overlap with the duties carried out by the former Garda surgeon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither I nor the Government have any plans to introduce an amnesty for existing asylum seekers in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The question of a possible amnesty here was considered in 1998 by the interdepartmental committee on immigration, asylum and related issues. Having taken into account all necessary factors, the committee recommended that an amnesty should not be introduced as to do so could have an adverse impact on the integrity of the asylum processing system.</P>
      <P>I understand that the amnesty introduced in Belgium was a qualified one and was coupled with the measure of closing off its borders in a bid to counteract illegal trafficking. As Ireland operates border controls on arrivals from outside the common travel area with the UK, including arrivals from Schengen states, the introduction of a measure similar to that of Belgium would entail the introduction of systematic immigration controls on persons coming here from the UK. There are no plans to take such a course of action, not least because of the enormous benefits which the common travel area provides for Irish and UK nationals.</P>
      <P>I believe that the most effective way of dealing fairly and humanely with asylum seekers here is to establish a coherent framework within which they will have their applications processed speedily and, in accordance with the best international practice, and to integrate those persons granted refugee status fully into Irish society. My Department has made significant progress in this regard and I consider that the introduction of an amnesty would undermine this progress and, indeed, send out the wrong signals especially to those who are engaged in the trafficking of persons.</P>
      <P>The number of asylum applicants in the State who meet refugee criteria, as laid down by the Geneva Convention 1951, is quite small. Approximately 25% of applicants are found to be entitled to refugee status having completed the application process, including those cases adjudicated upon by the independent appeals authorities. Thus an amnesty, if introduced, would mainly benefit a large number of applicants who would not normally be entitled to refugee status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that Ireland fulfils its international obligations to those seeking asylum. These obligations are a reflection of our humanitarian concern that persons suffering persecution, <Col N="1733" /> and in need of protection when they reach our shores, will receive that protection.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether the issuing of vouchers instead of direct payments to asylum seekers is discriminatory, inhumane and economically unsound; if he will end the administrative backlog; and if he will employ additional interpreters to alleviate the stress and delays being experienced by asylum seekers.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>A system of direct provision will for the most part represent a cashless system with the State assuming responsibility for funding suitable accommodation, for providing health and education services and other essential needs. Genuine asylum seekers who are actually fleeing persecution will, I believe, welcome this service and are unlikely to view it as a diminution in the quality of the services provided by the State, given that one of its purposes is to prevent fraud, and as a result lead to a more speedy identification of those who are in need of the State's protection.</P>
      <P>The introduction of direct provision in this State will simply bring us into line with other member states. It is widely accepted that a harmonised approach to asylum matters is by far the best approach and in introducing this system I am satisfied that it will represent a fair and effective means of meeting the basic needs of our asylum population. In addition the decision of the UK to move to a system of direct provision on 1 April 2000 must be taken into account. Given that we maintain a common travel area with the UK which is of enormous value and relevance to the island of Ireland and Irish people generally, a decision of this character by the UK has to be taken into consideration very seriously by any Irish Government.</P>
      <P>The Government decided on 9 November 1999 to establish a central directorate to deal with matters relating to the dispersal of asylum seekers throughout the country and preparations of plans for a system of direct provision of housing, health needs, etc. The directorate is currently examining various options that might be available to meet asylum seekers needs by a method other than full cash payments; the use of vouchers is one option being considered.</P>
      <P>In response to the accommodation shortage in the Dublin area, some asylum seekers are currently being provided for on a full board basis, with a reduced personal allowance, at locations throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I will shortly bring before the Government proposals outlining the strategy for the dispersal of asylum seekers and for meeting their needs through direct provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unprecedented number of asylum applications in the latter half of 1999 inevitably placed intense pressure on the asylum services in the State. However, I have taken steps to deal with this increasing number. These include the allocation of additional staff resources, maximising the use of accelerated procedures and increasing the number of appeals authorities. I have also brought forward amendments to the Refugee Act, 1996, to make that act workable and it is my intention to implement it in full very shortly. Applications have been invited for the post of refugee applications commissioner and the com<Col N="1737" /> petition for the position of chairperson of the refugee appeals tribunal will commence in the coming weeks. If additional resources are required in due course, I will provide them.</P>
    <P>The appointment of additional interpreters is not the key issue to clearing the administrative backlog or to delays being experienced by asylum seekers. The assignment of the additional staff approved by Government together with the maximum use of accelerated procedures to deal with cases speedily which are manifestly well-founded and manifestly unfounded at an early stage will ensure that a person who is likely to succeed in the asylum process gets the benefit of refugee status as soon as possible without being unnecessarily delayed in the backlog.</P>
    <P>My Department has always provided and continues to provide interpretation facilities so that where necessary an asylum seeker does not have to present his or her case without the benefit of an interpreter. Interpreters involved in the asylum application process receive training, which is conducted primarily by the UNHCR and which outlines the role of the interpreter/translator and highlights the sensitive and confidential nature of dealing with asylum applicants. Interpreters are aware of their role &ndash; an interpreter is a conduit of information without being participative. My Department will continue to monitor the service provided by interpreters and will take whatever steps that may be necessary to continue to provide an effective service to those who may require it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary and secondary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers in primary and secondary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. This would of course include any pay increases that apply to these school secretaries and caretakers under the national agreements. This scheme is, however, being phased out, as posts become vacant.</P>
      <P>Arising from the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, a second scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary and secondary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita </i>grants. This scheme does not provide for the linking of the additional <i>per capita</i> grants to any particular pay scale. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. Secretaries and caretakers employed by schools are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are employed. The question of the application of the national agreements in these cases is a matter to be resolved between the management authorities of the schools and the employees.</P>
      <P>Since its introduction in 1992, the scheme of additional <i>per capita</i> grants to schools in respect of secretarial and caretaking services has been expanded in line with undertakings given in the PESP. With effect from January of this year, all primary schools with 100 or more pupils have become eligible for a grant towards secretarial and caretaking services under this scheme. Costing £2.7 million, this improvement of the scheme will benefit approximately 650 schools serving 90,000 pupils. My Department is currently making arrangements for the issue of these grants to schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An additional £9 million has recently been secured which will enable me to extend and improve the supports available to all primary schools over the next two years. Details of the implementation of this will be worked out in the <Col N="1740" /> near future following consultations and will, when taken together with the earlier move, make a major contribution to assisting schools in providing for secretarial and caretaking assistance.</P>
    <P>At second level, voluntary secondary schools with 200 or more pupils receive a <i>per capita</i> grant of £30 subject to a maximum of £10,500 per annum towards the provision of secretarial services and a grant of £25 per pupil to a maximum of £8,750 in respect of caretaking assistance. Financial allocations for 2000 are currently being finalised and existing provision for secretarial and caretaking services is being reviewed in this context. The terms and conditions including pay scales for secretaries and caretakers employed in the community and comprehensive and VEC school sectors are determined centrally. Personnel in these sectors also receive increases agreed under the various pay agreements.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department is aware of the needs of schools in relation to secretarial and caretaking services and I am committed to improving existing provision this year and in future years in the budgetary context and in light of available resources.</P>

      <P>As part of the minimum academic <Col N="1741" /> requirements specified by my Department for entry to primary teacher training all candidates, including school leavers, mature students and university graduates, must have a minimum of a grade C in higher level in Irish in the leaving certificate or an approved equivalent. This requirement embodies both the written and oral element of a student's proficiency in Irish. My Department considers it to be the minimum standard in Irish necessary for students entering a teacher training course which will equip them to teach Irish to pupils at all levels of the primary school.</P>
      <P>While I have no plans at present to amend this requirement, requirements in this area are kept under review by my Department in consultation with the authorities of the colleges of education, and are also being considered by the working group established by my predecessor to review the full-time pre-service teacher training courses.</P>

      <P>The programme of substance misuse prevention education for primary schools, &ldquo;Walk <Col N="1742" /> Tall&rdquo;, was developed by my Department in consultation with the partners in education and with relevant Government Departments and other agencies over a two year period and finalised by the end of 1998. The development and implementation of the programme in a small pilot group of primary schools was evaluated independently with positive outcomes. As a result it was decided to disseminate the programme to primary schools generally over a two year period. This dissemination commenced in January 1999 and continues during the current year. At the end of 1999 the programme had been introduced to approximately 1150 schools.</P>
      <P>The dissemination process includes one-day staff training seminars for the teaching staff of individual schools organised by a national project officer and a team of six teacher trainers. Detailed educational resource materials for each class level in primary schools are provided free of charge to schools as their staffs participate in the training provided.</P>
      <P>At post-primary level the substance misuse prevention education programme, &ldquo;On My Own Two Feet&rdquo;, was developed by my Department in consultation with the partners in education and relevant agencies over a two-year period prior to 1995. The development and implementation of this programme was evaluated independently in a small pilot group of post-primary schools with positive outcomes. Since early 1995 the process of dissemination of this programme to post-primary schools generally has continued. At the end of 1999 approximately 570 schools, representing 75% of the total of these schools, provided this programme.</P>
      <P>Educational resource materials are provided free of charge to post-primary schools participating in the provision of the &ldquo;On My Own Two Feet&rdquo; programme for students. The dissemination is also supported by the organisation and provision of in-service teacher training courses for teachers. The dissemination process continues during the current year.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;Walk Tall&rdquo; and &ldquo;On My Own Two Feet&rdquo; deal with alcohol and tobacco as well as the use of other substances, which are commonly considered as drugs. They are designed for educational use with students generally, at primary and post-primary levels respectively, all of whom are likely to face decisions regarding the use of mood-altering substances during their lives. The programmes will be integrated into social, personal and health education, which will be introduced over the next three to five years as part of the revised curricula for primary schools and the junior cycle of post-primary schools.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy on the number of incidents in County Mayo where a remedial teacher serves seven schools is not readily available in my Department. However, I have arranged to have the information compiled and forwarded to the Deputy in due course.</P>
      <P>In September 1999, the remedial teacher service was extended to all primary schools in the country with a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or above. Schools with lower pupil teacher ratios may also seek remedial support from my Department where the level of their particular need warrants such a service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The special education review committee recommended that the general criteria for establishing remedial need should relate to pupils who have been identified as being below the tenth percentile on standardised tests in basic literacy and numeracy. The committee also recommended that the caseload of a remedial teacher catering for a single school should be 40 pupils. Where the <Col N="1744" /> post is shared by a cluster of schools, the committee recommended that the caseload be reduced by two for each extra school involved, subject to a maximum reduction of eight. My Department makes every effort to adhere to the above arrangement and to take account of distances between schools.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the schools to which he refers will be fully considered in the event of additional resources becoming available to improve existing remedial services.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that I am very anxious that no students with special needs should be prevented from completing their education.</P>
      <P>In general, students who attend special schools complete their programme and graduate at the end of the school year in which they reach their 18th birthday. Such students can then progress to attendance at a vocational training centre where they receive programmes of education and training designed for young adults with disabilities.</P>
      <P>However, my Department will consider allowing a further year's attendance at a special school in the case of any individual student whose needs are such as to warrant an extension. For example, in the case of a pupil studying for State examinations, my Department may sanction an additional year in a special school. All such cases are considered on an individual basis having regard to the particular circumstances involved. There are no proposals at present to alter this arrangement.</P>

      <P>The current position in relation to the length of the school year and other related issues was outlined to schools by circular in 1995. School authorities are obliged to ensure that schools adhere to the prescribed minimum number of teaching days per annum. At primary level the minimum number of teaching days per school year is 183, while at second level, schools are required to be open for teaching for 167 days.</P>
      <P>At second level, the minimum number of instruction hours per week is 28, six per day or three in a half day. A full school day at primary comprises a period of not less than five hours and 40 minutes. Any day on which the pupils complete two hours and 50 minutes but less than five hours and 40 minutes is regarded as a half school day.</P>
      <P>Subject to the requirement in the primary sector that the schools must close for the months of July and August, the organisation and structure of the school year are matters for individual boards of management or vocational education committees, which are charged with the direct governance of schools.</P>

      <P>Payment from the youth allocation is made for informal education youth purposes.</P>
      <P>My Department is represented on the EU monitoring committee for the local urban and rural development programme and maintains an ongoing liaison with the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. It does not have a funding role in relation to the access programmes within this relationship.</P>
      <P>Most third level colleges have developed initiatives to promote disadvantaged access, through targeted funding provided to the universities by the Higher Education Authority and funding from within the overall financial allocations to the institutes of technology. These initiatives involve links with second-level schools and local communities and examples of these activities include supervised study programmes, summer schools, study skills programmes and mentoring. There are two aspects to these programmes, one involving assistance to students to meet the points requirements for courses, enabling them to obtain a third level place through the standard CAO entry procedure. The other aspect of the programmes is the special entry arrangements through which more flexible entry criteria are applied and various supports are put in place for students entering by this method.</P>
      <P>Funding of £150,000 has been approved for the Dublin Northside Partnership in respect of its higher education support scheme, which enables students from disadvantaged families to proceed on to, and remain, in higher education, for the 1999-2000 and 2000-01 academic years. I am aware that other partnership companies operate similar further education support programmes and my officials are engaged in discussions with the Area Development Management Ltd. to explore how best to support initiatives being taken and indeed, to learn from the various experiences.</P>
      <P>The report of the commission on the points system has made a number of recommendations in relation to disadvantaged students. The commission indicated the need to develop a national approach to ensuring that special access schemes encompass disadvantaged students who are attending non-designated as well as designated schools. This report is currently being considered by my officials and planning for an implementation strategy is under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, there is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan. This fund will provide for additional financial support for disadvantaged students on top of the existing maintenance grants schemes. It will also facilitate the development of outreach initiatives being undertaken by colleges and the expansion <Col N="1750" /> of counselling and mentoring services to meet the needs of non-traditional students.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Financial assistance is available to mature students in respect of postgraduate studies under the higher education grants scheme which is administered by the local authorities.</P>
      <P>In general, students who are entering or re-entering approved postgraduate courses for the first time are eligible for grant assistance towards maintenance and fees, up to a maximum fee limit, which in the current academic year is £2,891, where a full or part maintenance grant is being paid, where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means, and nationality.</P>
      <P>The higher education grant schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. The current scheme defines a mature student as a candidate who is at least 23 years of age on 1 January of the year of entry or re-entry to an approved course. The Acts further provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for the making of grants to mature students whose means and those of their parents, where the mature students are dependent on their parents, and the means of their spouses, if any, do not exceed prescribed limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the higher education grants schemes, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature candidate who was not ordinarily resident with his/her parents from 1 October of the year preceding their entry to an approved course. Inde<Col N="1751" /> pendent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address. Under a concession effective from the current academic year, all eligible mature students will qualify for the higher non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant which in the current academic year is £1,690. A prospective mature student should contact his/her local authority in order to have his/her eligibility for grant assistance assessed under the terms of the scheme.</P>

      <P>Plans are already under way to implement a comprehensive survey of all primary schools to identify the levels of concentration of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds in each school. While it is intended that the criteria that will be used in this survey will be based on those used in setting up the &ldquo;Breaking the cycle&rdquo; project in 1996, the reliability of the criteria as predictors of educational disadvantage is under review and the precise criteria that will be used in this new survey have not yet been finalised.</P>
      <P>The criteria used for &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; referred to background characteristics and dealt with: long-term unemployment of the main bread-winner in the home; receipt of financial assistance due to low farm income; medical card holding; residence in rented local-authority accommodation; lone-parent families; whether the mother had sat the group of intermediate certificates and whether the father had sat the group of intermediate certificates.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 436 to 439, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>My Department commissioned the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to carry out a survey of radon levels in all primary and post-primary schools in the country. The survey, which is being conducted in three phases, involves recording the concentration of radon gas present in a school over an academic year.</P>
      <P>The RPII recently issued results to schools that participated in the first phase of the survey. At that time the RPII advised in a press release that the results were issuing to the relevant schools and that my Department was making arrangements for remedial action to be taken where required, with priority being given to the cases of greatest need.</P>
      <P>A total of 175 schools showed radon levels in excess of the national reference level with 13 schools showing levels that require immediate mitigation. A consultant has already been engaged to advise in relation to this task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In compliance with public procurement procedures, it is necessary that the contract for the appointment of an expert to advise on mitigation in the remaining schools requiring attention be advertised in the EU Journal. It is anticipated that an expert will be appointed in the near <Col N="1754" /> future. Thereafter, my Department will then arrange for a mitigation programme to be drawn up, with priority being given to the cases of greatest need. My Department will meet the cost of mitigation. I expect the mitigation programme will provide for further testing of radon levels after mitigation has been undertaken in the affected schools.</P>

      <P>My Department published a report on <Col N="1755" /> the whole school evaluation pilot project in December 1999. This report is an important contribution to the development of a new model of school evaluation and focuses on the pilot project experience from the perspective of all participants. The conclusions of the report are detailed in chapter seven under the sections entitled &ldquo;The lessons of the WSE pilot project&rdquo; and &ldquo;The future of Whole School Evaluation&rdquo;. The principal conclusions drawn by my Department as presented in the WSE pilot project report are as follows: the WSE model is an effective approach to evaluating the functioning of schools and the pilot project schools indicated considerable support for its continued development; the WSE process should take full account of the planning development priorities identified in the school plan-as both school development planning and WSE evolve in the education system, this link can be strengthened; WSE criteria of evaluation used in the pilot project need further refinement, particularly in the areas of the quality of school ethos and support for students; the WSE process should be developed to provide for greater consultation with parents by inspectors. This issue is being addressed in the context of a draft circular on WSE currently being prepared; WSE school reports which contain recommendations with resource implications for schools should be fully considered by relevant sections within my Department and since time demands on schools and the Inspectorate during WSE proved very significant, further reflections on time management in relation to the WSE process is required. This is currently being examined in the context of revised guidelines on WSE for inspectors and schools.</P>
      <P>All conclusions drawn by my Department in relation to the WSE pilot project are being carefully considered in consultation with the education partners.</P>

      <P>The principles for the geographical distribution of psychologists of the National Educational Psychological Service &ndash; NEPS &ndash; agency were outlined in the report of the planning group for NEPS. This was accepted by the Government in February 1999. In line with the recommendations in the report, psychologists are assigned to regions corresponding to the regional health boards, rather than to constituencies. This is in order to facilitate communication and collaboration with clinical services for children. As soon as there is a sufficient number of psychologists within each region, they will be further organised in small local teams near to the schools that they serve. It is envisaged that eventually there will be a team assigned to practically every county.</P>
      <P>At present, educational psychologists are assigned to primary schools as follows: Eastern Health Board region &ndash; schools designated as disadvantaged in the city of Dublin, plus 16 schools in north County Dublin, 13 schools in south County Dublin, six schools in west County Dublin, 25 schools in County Kildare and 17 schools in County Wicklow; Midland Health Board region &ndash; 20 schools in County Offaly; Mid-Western Health Board region &ndash; schools designated as disadvantaged in the city of Limerick, plus 26 schools in County Clare, six schools in County Limerick and 25 schools in north Tipperary; North-Eastern Health Board region 24 schools in County Louth and 15 schools in County Meath; North-Western Health Board region &ndash; 30 schools in Sligo-Leitrim; South-Eastern Health Board region &ndash; all schools in South Tipperary; Southern Health Board region &ndash; schools designated as disadvantaged in the city of Cork, plus 28 schools in County Cork, and Western Health Board region &ndash; 23 schools in the city and county of Galway and 31 schools in County Mayo.</P>
      <P>A competition for recruitment to the National Educational Psychological Service agency is currently being organised by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners. This is now at a very advanced stage, and it is envisaged that there will be approximately 50 additional psychologists in post by the end of this year. This will make a substantial difference to the level of service available in all areas of the country.</P>
      <P>The general principles for deployment of additional staff have been agreed by the management committee of NEPS, in consultation with the NEPS national policy advisory board, which is representative of the main client groups. They have agreed that, after current vacancies have been filled, each new cohort of psychologists should be distributed between all regions, on a pro rata basis, according to the pupil numbers in each region. The ultimate target is that, by the end of the development phase of NEPS, end 2004, all schools will have ready access to educational psychologists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some time now the management of NEPS has been collecting evidence of need on a county by county basis, using Government and Depart<Col N="1757" /> ment statistics and data supplied by local interests. Within each region, priorities will be set according to these identified needs and to the level of current access to psychological services.</P>

      <P>Since 1997 the funding allocated to primary and second level schools has been increased substantially in accordance with the Government's commitment to giving education a clear priority in the allocation of resources as set out in the policy document An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the standard capitation grant at primary level was increased by £5 in 1998 and £10 in 1999 which brought the standard grant to £60 per pupil. This constitutes a 33% increase over the period. In addition, the grant is being increased by a further £11 this year. In relation to voluntary secondary schools, the standard per capita grant was increased to £184 from £177 last year with a further increase of £8 planned for this year. Budgetary allocations to the other second level sectors are increased on a <i>pro rata </i>basis.</P>
      <P>These increases have outstripped the rate of inflation for the years concerned. I am satisfied that they represent a meaningful response to demands for increased funding from schools generally. I am committed to improving further the funding position of primary and second level schools in the context of forthcoming budgets and in light of available resources.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available. The provision of extra facilities at national schools depends on a number of factors such as the completion of architectural design, planning permission, etc. In so far as is possible, it is intended to allow pro<Col N="1763" /> jects which have completed architectural design and for which tenders have been sought to proceed to construction.</P>

      <P>A competition for recruitment to the National Educational Psychological Service NEPS is being organised by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners. This is now at a very advanced stage and it is envisaged that there will be approximately 50 additional psychologists in post by the end of this year. This will make a substantial difference to the level of service available in all areas of the country, including County Kildare.</P>
      <P>For some time now the management of NEPS has collecting evidence of need on a county by county basis, using Government and Department statistics and data supplied by local interests. Within each region, priorities will be set according to these identified needs and to the level of current access to psychological services.</P>

      <P>As my predecessor informed the Deputy in reply to parliamentary Question No. 237 on 1 December 1999, my Department carried out an assessment of primary and post-primary accommodation needs in Naas during 1998.</P>
      <P>At primary level, temporary accommodation has been provided at existing schools in the Naas area to cater for immediate requirements. Architectural planning for a new 16-classroom school is under way and it is expected that, when this building becomes available, there will be sufficient accommodation available in the town to meet medium/long-term requirements.</P>
      <P>At second level, building projects are well under way in all three schools in Naas. It is envisaged that the accommodation thus provided will enable the schools to meet the immediate and long-term requirements of the area. The proposed extension at one of these schools has been revised to include 100 additional places. This will enable the school in question cater for 900 pupils in the long-term. My Department will continue to monitor developments in Naas to ensure that any emerging additional demands are promptly addressed.</P>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to Kill, County Kildare, is not available due to an industrial dispute in my Department.</P>
