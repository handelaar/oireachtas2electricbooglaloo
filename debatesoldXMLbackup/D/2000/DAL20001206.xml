      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31. I propose to deal with the two topics separately and I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
      <P>I have received notice from Deputy Neville and I call on him to state the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the terms of Standing Order 31 I give notice of my intention to seek to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent attention, namely, the fact that clinical trials have been carried out over the years on patients in psychiatric institutions and the need for the Minister for Health and Children to make a comprehensive statement addressing among other areas the level of consultation, if any, with patients and their families, the types of trials which were carried out, the extent of the experiments, any adverse effects on the health of the patients involved in such trials, the protection of patients' private integrity and right to privacy and the need for a full investigation into the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 20<i>a</i>, motion re Referral to Joint Committee of Proposed Approval of Extradition Act, 1965 (Application of Part II) Order, 2000 &ndash; Draft, to be taken upon the conclusion of Private Members' Business; No. 21, motion re Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996; and No. 21<i>a</i> the Budget Statement and Financial Motions by the Minister for Finance to be taken at the conclusion of questions to members of the Government. It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m., that the motion for the general financial resolution shall be moved not later than midnight whereupon business shall then be interrupted and the Dáil shall adjourn forthwith. No. 28 shall be decided without debate. The proceedings on No. 21, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m. and the following arrangements shall apply: the speech of a Minister, a Minister of State and the main spokespersons for Fine Gael and the Labour Party shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; the speech of each other Member shall not exceed five minutes and Members may share time. Following the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance and the statements of the main spokespersons of the Opposition parties, the sitting shall be suspended for 30 minutes. Private Members' Business shall be No. 109, motion re Government Policy on Taxi Licences (resumed), to be taken directly after the Order of Business and to conclude after 90 minutes.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> The Dáil should not accept the Order of Business on the basis that it makes no provision for the Government to update the Dáil on two critical issues which face us, namely, the failure of the Government to resolve the teachers' grievances and the consequent fall-out for students and the chaos in the taxi industry. On these matters the Government is about as useful as a bag of meat and bone-meal is to farmers. We have no opportunity to discuss these issues. The Dáil must make provision to discuss these critical matters today.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that a report of a review group on food quality assurance schemes, which was to be published this week, has been suppressed? The formation of this group was announced on 20 December last year by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe. Its function was to advise on the application of best practice to food production generally. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, addressed the first meeting of the group on 29 February 2000. The group was to have produced its report this week. Can the Taoiseach confirm that because of the embarrassing circumstances surrounding the activities of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, in relation to food quality we are now not to have the benefit of the considerations of this group? Can the Taoiseach tell the House when we might expect this? </P>
      <P>Is it the case that the Taoiseach has completely abdicated all political responsibility for the performance and the standards of work of members of his Government and office holders to the Public Offices Commission? Is he saying to the House, as he said to Deputy Fleming, when he told him about money that had gone astray, &ldquo;Don't tell me, tell the lawyers&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It has long been the case that the Taoiseach is responsible for the actions of the members of his Government and of office holders in the Government. There is no sense in which any legislation can be prayed in aid by a Taoiseach who wants to avoid taking political responsibility for the action of his office holders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;that by the time the Taoiseach has listened to Deputy Howlin, to whom I will give way in a moment, he will not have forgotten the drift of my question because I would like him to confirm that my understanding of the suppression of this report and the reason for it is correct.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same matter, a complaint to the Public Offices Commission is on a point of law and does not exonerate the Taoiseach from general responsibilities and it should not be used as a shield for that purpose. I will ask the Taoiseach a direct question. The Agricultural and Food Delegation of Ministerial Functions (No. 2) Order, 1997, devolved the regulation of the meat and bonemeal to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe. Was the Taoiseach informed, as is required under section 13 of the Ethics in Public Offices Act, of the conflict of interest that arose between the regulator of that product and the licence holder at that time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one simple, net question. Under section 13 of the Act, office holders are clearly required to declare additional interests where there may be a conflict of interest. I will not read out the section, as I am sure the Taoiseach knows it well. When the Taoiseach, by order, devolved ministerial responsibility for regulating meat and bonemeal to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, was he made aware that the Minister of State was a licensed holder for meat and bonemeal? That is a simple question.</P>

      <P>Now that we seem to have established that the Taoiseach is entirely irresponsible for the actions of the members of his Government, could I ask on a different issue if he proposes to hold any consultations to prepare for the visit of President Clinton next week to ascertain if that visit can result in any positive outcome in terms of the peace process, particularly in view of the IRA statement of yesterday?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been involved in consultations during recent weeks and particularly the past few days. Last night the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, had a very useful and important meeting with the Secretary of State, Mr. Mandelson, and that process is proceeding at official level today in London. We will continue with all of the parties involved in that regard. I had a meeting with John Hume, the leader of the SDLP, on Monday and we have also had direct involvement with a number of the other parties and we will continue that. Whether it is useful in terms of what we can agree before President Clinton arrives next Tuesday, I do not know, but the elements of the difficulties we must resolve are fairly clear to everybody. They continue to move around what happened at the Unionist Party Conference at the end of October, the issues of demilitarisation and decommissioning and the completion of the implementation of the Patten report. I do not think there are any new elements. I hope between the two Governments, and even more so between the parties, we can get understandings that would allow further progress. I hope we can and we will do our utmost to achieve that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>There are four Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development Bills on the Order Paper. Will the Taoiseach prioritise any of those Bills that would help to resolve the BSE crisis? The Organic Food and Farming Targets Bill is not on the list but has been published by the Green Party and would be of definite assistance in this crisis as organic farming would not countenance feeding animal residue or feed to stock.

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Gilmore. I spoke last night about the debacle surrounding this issue and the fact that a lay person could have seen that it was discriminatory to issue 3,000 plates to existing plate holders. It was inevitable that the judgment would find that this route could not be taken and now we have full deregulation of the taxi service.</P>
      <P>My party and I do not believe this is the route to take. Full deregulation has not worked in other cities and some areas have had to reregulate. This is really a Dublin problem, which is something we should look at; the taxi service has worked effectively in other cities but we have had queues in Dublin for many years. The taxi forum would have produced 3,200 licences by 2002. In Melbourne, a much larger city than Dublin, there is a proportionate number of plates and yet its taxi system works effectively. Why do we have the queues when we would have had a sufficient number of plates? The answer is quite simple: certain taxi plate holders have not been using the plates, particularly at night. We know there are problems for taxi drivers at night and that is the reason they decided not to come out. We need proper regulation to ensure that those who own plates will actually use them. It is still possible for the Government to introduce legislation. The court judgment does not preclude that. It could introduce the legislation and we would then have a proper taxi service in this town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other problem is that the taxi service is often seen as a replacement for an inadequate bus service. People may use public transport to come into town but then they are left stranded. Throughout this city, and in my constituency we have seen cutbacks in essential bus services. Recently, the No. 13 bus service in my constituency has been cut back, yet we are trying to encourage people to use public transport but they have to use taxis. The taxi service should not have to be used in that way. If we had proper regulation we could then have a GPS system, as they have in other cities, and people could get to their destinations quickly. Taxi drivers would know when there were people in the area who required a taxi. Recently, a colleague of mine was in Stockholm and was amazed at the way the com<Col N="796" /> puterised system worked. It was able to tell the driver immediately, who simply keyed in the destination to be informed how to get there quickly. The system could indicate when the next person in an area required a taxi. That is the sort of system we need.</P>
    <P>Also, from an environmental point of view, taxis should be regulated to such an extent that they would run either on LPG or compressed natural gas. That is the way they are run in other cities. If we are to have thousands of taxis on our streets, that would make sense from an air quality point of view.</P>
    <P>Another problem is that our bus lanes could become clogged up if there are too many taxis. We have to be honest with ourselves and ask the question: when does regulation work and when does deregulation work? In terms of deregulation we have seen instances elsewhere in relation to buses, and particularly in Britain where it simply has not worked. Were we to adopt the same system in relation to additional buses, it would be a recipe for chaos because it would be more or less a free for all. A free for all solution cannot work. We must ensure that we have an integrated system and that we have proper public transport. That requires huge investment. Similarly, we must upgrade the taxi service properly so that people can use the taxi service.</P>
    <P>We need proper regulation of our taxi service. Throwing numbers at the problem is not the solution. I have my doubts as to whether this proposal will work out in the long term so I ask the Minister to rethink it because I am sure that in a number of years, we will have to revisit this issue. This is a short-term solution but in the long term it simply will not work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, is the Minister named in the motion, this motion is about striking a blow at the kind of double speak that has become the hallmark of this Fianna Fáil Government. To be fair, we all engage in a bit of double speak, and double speak is not confined to politics. It can be used from time to time by people in churches, journalists, trade unions, business people and so on. When one looks at the PPF and the Good Friday Agreement, it can, on occasion, be used with good effect but this Fianna Fáil Government has made double speak a kind of official political dialect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are good reasons Government should speak not like the Tower of Babel but with one voice. The principle of collective responsibility is not some kind of an archaic convention. It is there so that the public can know and be clear that when Government speaks, it speaks with one voice, that it is providing clear leadership and that there is not confusion in relation to public policy. Every Minister and Minister of State who has ever been appointed to Government knows that if one takes the shilling, one follows the drum, accepts and honours the principle of collective <Col N="797" /> responsibility and does not make public utterances that are in conflict with Government policy.</P>
    <P>Why should we in the Opposition be so concerned that the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, appears to be intent on leading a particularly double speaking, double crossing Government where a Minister cannot be sure that he or she will not be publicly shafted by a colleague if an issue of public policy becomes a bit too hot to handle? We have had a succession of examples of that. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, called publicly for public protest against the policy enunciated by a colleague Minister. It is not so long ago since another Minister described as a shambles the Government policy on asylum and immigration. The Taoiseach is a bit of a Mairtín Ó Cadhain in relation to the kind of double speaking political dialect we have come to expect from this Government. If the going gets rough, for example, in relation to a budget, he will have no difficulty in disowning the Minister for Finance. If there is a gaff in the Minister for Finance's budget this afternoon, we can expect that the Taoiseach will not have read the budget and will not have seen it and that, when questioned about it on Thursday morning, he will tell us he will have a quiet word with the Minister to try to sort it out.</P>
    <P>The reason we are concerned about it is that the double speaking performance of this Government has left many areas of public policy in a mess. The reason we have no taxis on the streets of Dublin as we approach Christmas is that Government has been engaged in double speak. While pursuing one official policy, Fianna Fáil has been sending a signal to taxi drivers that it will look after them and it was the perceived failure of Fianna Fáil to look after the interests of taxi drivers that now has the taxi industry so angry and withdrawing its services as we approach Christmas.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the reason traffic is snarled up in this city is that of the double speak of Fianna Fáil in particular on the one hand officially pursuing a policy which is aimed at increasing public transport while, on the other hand, giving nods and winks to vested interests in this city which have delayed the appearance of Luas and quality bus corridors and kept the traffic of this city snarled up.</P>
    <P>We have a similar problem in relation to housing policy in that again we have public utterances from Government and a public declaration of policy that it is in favour of people being able to buy and own their own homes while, at the same time, it is pursuing in practice a policy which favours land speculation and vested interests in the building industry and in the building professions. We had an example of that last week with the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, who, in any other country, would no longer be a Minister of State with responsibility for food. I cannot think of a better contrast to the Minister of State than the former Minister <Col N="798" /> for food in the United Kingdom, Edwina Curry. As she nibbles on her scrambled eggs this morning, she must be wondering, as she reads <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>, the <i>Daily Mail</i>, the <i>Irish Independent</i>, or whatever Tory newspaper she reads, why the Irish Minister with responsibility for food is still in office and why he has not started writing his first racy novel.</P>

      <P>On Thursday night, 23 November, I addressed a large meeting of taxi and hackney drivers in Limerick. I now realise that some of the remarks I made at that meeting were intemperate, insensitive and insulting to my colleagues and I wish to take this opportunity to apologise unreservedly to the Tánaiste and to the other members of the Progressive Democrats, particularly the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, for any offence caused. I have always had an excellent working relationship with my Progressive Democrats colleagues and hope that it will continue.</P>
      <P>I wish to dispel a report in last Thursday's <i>Irish Independent</i> of a stand up row between me and the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy. I state unequivocally that the report was a work of fiction, worthy of Roald Dahl, author of &ldquo;Tales of the Unexpected&rdquo;. The row did not happen. I cannot recall it and the Minister of State cannot recall it. It exists only in the fevered imagination of the journalist who wrote the story.</P>
      <P>I make it clear that, whatever my private views on this issue, I fully support Government policy on deregulation. I subscribe fully to the notion of collective responsibility. Having studied Mr. Justice Murphy's judgment in full, I realise there are legal constraints which prevent the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, or any other person occupying that position from having one regime for taxis in one area and a different regime in another area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In saying that, I refute with all the strength at my disposal the accusation made by certain opinionated newspapers columnists and Members of the House that I said one thing privately in Limerick and something else publicly in Dublin. One can also speak publicly in Limerick. I cannot understand how addressing a meeting of 400 people in Limerick can be said to be speaking privately. I agree with Deputy Olivia Mitchell that one cannot segment and give different versions to different audiences. I know that and do not need Deputy Mitchell to tell me that. I find it more difficult to understand how an interview on local radio in Limerick can be said to be private and not accessible to people in Dublin. I find it even more difficult again to understand how an interview with a local newspaper which <Col N="799" /> has mass circulation in the mid-west and is available in the Oireachtas Library, namely, the <i>Limerick Leader</i>, can be said to be speaking privately or giving a different message in Limerick. I gave those radio and newspaper interviews before this controversy arose.</P>
    <P>In so far as the remarks attributed to me about not knowing that I was being taped are concerned, all I said is that if I had known my remarks were being taped and directly transmitted to the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, and others I would have moderated my tone and been less offensive and insulting. This is not an earth shattering admission and any reasonable person would also admit this.</P>
    <P>Last night in the House Deputy Owen accused me of condoning or encouraging illegality. People are protected by privilege in the House and I want Deputy Owen to withdraw that scurrilous and untruthful allegation. I want her to withdraw that remark before the debate concludes or repeat it outside the House. I want to make it perfectly clear that I took great pains in my speech in Limerick to say that I did not condone illegality, that I would not ever condone it, and that taxi men in Limerick and other areas were entitled to make peaceful protests within the law. I did not condone illegality. That section of my speech did not appear in the tape publicised by RTE and if I were a person of cynical disposition, which I am not even at this stage, I would say that the reason RTE omitted this section from its broadcast version is that it would have taken much good out of the story. I am not cynical, so I will put it down to time constraints. However, the tape is available for anyone who wants to listen to it. If the section where I told them I did not condone illegality and to desist from any further illegality were included it would give a very different tone to the speech.</P>
    <P>Hypocrisy has permeated this debate from start to finish. I want to give some examples. Last Tuesday, 28 November, taxi drivers from outside Dublin met in the Mont Clare Hotel. That meeting included a large contingent from Limerick. All rural TDs were summoned to the meeting. One of the first people to accept the summons and to address the meeting was the senior Front Bench spokesman for the Opposition, Deputy Noonan, who represents Limerick East. I do not know whether he is the leader in waiting or the lost leader, but it is irrelevant to me.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Did Deputy Noonan attend that meeting of angry Limerick taxi drivers in the Mont Clare Hotel to tell them he stood foursquare behind deregulation, that they would have to accept their fate, that he agreed with Government policy and that the Government was correct? To paraphrase and moderate the tone of a famous Mr. Bailey in another context, &ldquo;did he, <Col N="800" /> hell&rdquo;. Deputy Noonan was quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 29 November as saying that Limerick was different from Dublin and a separate case would have to be made for Limerick. He was extremely worried about taxi drivers in Limerick and the implications of deregulation for them.</P>
      <P>Last night I did not notice anyone in Fine Gael referring to Deputy Noonan's performance. I have not noticed any attempt to rebuke Deputy Noonan or to remonstrate with him. More important, I have not noticed any move by Deputy Bruton to cause Deputy Noonan's resignation. It will probably be shortly the other way around and everybody I know in Fine Gael dearly wishes for that consummation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Michael D. Higgins made a statement which was directly contrary to Labour Party policy as I understand it. When he spoke in Galway Deputy Quinn stood up and pointed the finger to Limerick. There was not one word about Deputy Higgins directly contradicting Labour Party policy on deregulation. He is still on the Labour Party Front Bench and there has been no contradiction of what he said or no effort to say that his remarks were contrary to Labour Party policy. I want to give another example of hypocrisy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan was not the only Deputy from Limerick East to attend the meeting. Deputy Jan O'Sullivan obeyed the summons and scurried down to the Mont Clare Hotel as fast as her legs could carry her to be greeted effusively by the taxi men as she gushed sympathy all over them and joined them for tea. I seriously doubt that she told them she supported deregulation and they would have to accept the <i>fait accompli</i>. I call on Deputy O'Sullivan to clarify her position on this issue in the House. I will also challenge her to do this in Limerick.</P>
      <P>In apologising to my colleagues in the Progressive Democrats I also want to apologise to my party for any embarrassment caused. I specifically extend that apology to the Taoiseach for whom, as everyone knows, I have a high personal regard. The only mitigating factor from the Fianna Fáil point of view is that I am a mere junior officer in the great army of Fianna Fáil. Deputy Yates may laugh&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>We remember the Urlingford disaster, the Dominic Lynch cock-up, the Duncan extradition fiasco, the cancellation of the prison programme, crime being out of control and Garda morale shattered. The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, I and others came into the House night after night and called for her resignation as Minister for Justice as she repeatedly damaged the administration of justice. We all know the reaction &ndash; she remained firmly wedged in position on the Government Front Bench, supported uncomplainingly by everyone from that man of integrity, Deputy Bruton, to the Trotskyite tendency. The excuses were always the same &ndash; she did not get her post, she did not understand the technicalities and people were keeping things from her. Ignorance was always the defence. If Deputy Bruton is such a man of integrity how could he keep such an ignorant Minister of Justice in office for two and a half years in charge of the Department responsible for the maintenance of law and order.</P>
      <P>Last night Deputy Gormley correctly wondered what all this is about, how I had become such an important person as to warrant the use of the Private Members' time of the main Opposition party. The answer to this lies in Deputy Owen's speech. She was upset about the articles I write for certain national newspapers. I will make a deal with Fine Gael. If the party stops telling lies about me, I might stop telling the truth about it.</P>
      <P>It is extremely ironic to be lectured on party loyalty by the dynamic duo of Deputies Bruton and Owen, both of whom are immaturing with age. If Deputy Bruton, and by extension Deputy Owen, who is Deputy Bruton's creature, had even a shred of loyalty to their party, they would stand aside, leave the stage and at least give the party a fighting chance. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that Fine Gael has the capacity to produce a leader &ndash; I am looking at Deputy Yates &ndash; and deputy leader who might be marginally more popular than the whooping cough.</P>
      <P>At a recent Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting, Deputy Belton, who regularly entertains us from the Opposition benches, called on Deputy Bruton &ldquo;to look in the mirror&rdquo;, in opposing his leadership. I presume the same injunction applies to Deputy Owen. If Deputies Bruton and Owen can bear to look in the mirror they will see a pair looking back at them whose re-election as leader and deputy leader of Fine Gael caused uninhibited celebration and joy in the households of every Fianna Fáil supporter from one end of Ireland to the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not take the protestations of the Labour Party too seriously. I note the restrained tone of <Col N="802" /> Deputy Gilmore's contribution. I also note Deputy Quinn's personal circumstances and I sympathise with him. A number of different versions of policy have emanated from the Labour Party and, therefore, I cannot take anything it says too seriously.</P>
    <P>I return to the thrust of the Fine Gael approach, which is to present the Taoiseach, one of the most successful in the State's history, as weak, vacillating and ambiguous in dealing with recalcitrant colleagues and Deputy Bruton as a man of integrity who is strong, decisive and predictable and who is the antithesis of what the Taoiseach might be.</P>
    <P>Let us examine Deputy Bruton's integrity. When Deputy Lowry's position was exposed, Deputy Bruton's initial instinctive reaction was that it did not matter what he did, whether it was tax evasion, murder, mayhem or rape because it happened before he was appointed Minister. Ultimately, public opinion forced Deputy Bruton to get rid of Deputy Lowry. When the final break occurred and Deputy Lowry resigned from Fine Gael in March 1997, Deputy Bruton professed himself to be so scandalised by Deputy Lowry's activities that he said he would not even request his vote in the event of a hung Dáil. However, three years later Deputy Bruton says Deputy Lowry, a proven and admitted tax evader, is welcome back into the bosom of Fine Gael. Where is his integrity?</P>
    <P>When the late Deputy Coveney's activities first came to light &ndash; I do not want to be hard on him as he is deceased &ndash; Deputy Bruton deliberately waited 36 hours to ascertain which way the wind was blowing and then in the words of one of his own colleagues, Peter Barry, &ldquo;he moved him sideways&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton was on record time and again saying he would not do business with the former Workers' Party because of his suspicion of its subversive past. Having made such statements he then jumped into bed with the party when his political survival was at stake. He has now come full circle and has apparently extended an invitation to Arklow's own Che Guevara, Councillor Nicky Kelly, to join Fine Gael. The party fought tooth and nail to keep Nicky Kelly in jail but now it is prepared to welcome him into Government. I presume this is Deputy Bruton's secret recipe to make the trains run on time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton gave evidence on oath to the McCracken tribunal regarding the fundraising activities of his party. He also gave evidence on oath about the same events to the beef tribunal. The problem was that the two versions of the evidence were diametrically different. Deputy Bruton presided over a Government from which more Ministers resigned in disgrace than any Government in the history of the State and that does not count those who should have resigned but did not.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates was kept on in Government despite his claims to be able to bi-locate.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton presided over a Government of which Deputy De Rossa remained a member after he misled the House about advertising a position in a policy unit in the Democratic Left news letter. When Fine Gael realises that Deputy Bruton's integrity is bland, broad and is not sufficient to get over his charisma deficit, it says he is an original thinker. If so, he is the only original thinker in the history of civilisation who has succeeded in keeping all his original thoughts firmly to himself because nobody has ever heard him utter one.</P>

      <P>It should spend more time on policies, listening to the grassroots and on the public service and less on spending the precious time of the Dáil on cheap publicity stunts it knows it cannot win. The Dáil is for making laws to improve the lives of the people, not for publicity stunts. It is time for Fine Gael and Labour to think beyond tomorrow's &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and <i>The Irish Times</i>. They should think about the people who put them here. They should give us policies, not public relations, valuable input and common sense, not more Celtic snails and the same old champagne socialism.</P>
      <P>The Opposition has clambered on to the high moral ground once again to hide the fact that it has no sensible policies. Fine Gael relaunched its ridiculous year-old Plan for the Nation last month. It still wants to build new cities on the basis of 30 year old plans and develop towns on the basis of regional favouritism. Labour still has its mad health policy and would shut local hospitals. It also has a financial policy which would raid the pension funds and keep high taxes.</P>

      <P>When I heard last Thursday that this motion was being put on the Order Paper calling for the resignation of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, my first reaction was one of incredulity. I could not believe the Opposition parties had reached the low ebb of having no policy matters to address but were reduced to making this attack on the Minister of State. My worst fears for the motion were confirmed last night and this morning when I heard the tone and content of what was said by speakers. While there were a few exceptions, by and large, the level of hypocrisy was astounding, as the Minister of State said.</P>
      <P>It is a major mistake at this stage to try to apply criteria of common sense and logic to establish the motive behind this motion. One must assume it came from the same marketing stable which produced the Celtic snail last week. That surely, among all the debacles in political marketing or marketing of any type, will forever rank in the top three or four. It is extraordinary. I admire the attempts of the Minister of State's colleague to distance himself from it on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; on Monday night last and postponing an answer to it because, if any element of common sense were applied to marketing an idea or the consideration of a marketing campaign or slogan, it would be difficult to devise one which was more certain to rebound on those who devised it. Therefore, I am forced to dispense with logic in trying to figure out how the element in the motion relating to the Minister of State was included. I would welcome a proper debate on the taxi issue and I will deal with some of the matters relating to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State is correct in his analysis that his transgression has much more to do with the fact that he manages to consistently head the <Col N="807" /> poll in his constituency and stymie the leadership ambitions of his party colleague&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">

      <P>&mdash;with extraordinary help from some of those in Fine Gael who, clearly, are not in contact with the situation. Deputy Carey is entirely wrong to suggest that Fianna Fáil ever had plans to close Ennis General Hospital. The only plans which ever came forward came from a Government of which he was a backbench member and which people such as Deputy Daly and I spent the past ten, 13 or 14 years fighting successfully to ensure it was remedied.</P>

The sewerage schemes did not appear at the planning stage or anything like that. I welcome the opportunity to clarify all these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deregulation of taxis is a serious issue. I welcome the Government amendment, especially <Col N="808" /> the third part where the House is asked to note the Government's commitment to a process of dialogue with existing licence holders which is under way and which is welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is also asked to note the Government's readiness to provide special tax allowances and an administrative scheme for certain licence fees by way of mitigation for appropriate cases. It is important that that element of the amendment to the motion is properly explored. Some of it can be explored here. Clearly most of it can be explored in direct talks between the Minister of State and the taxi drivers' lobby.</P>
      <P>Some people put themselves in considerable debt and some, perhaps foolishly, mortgaged their houses to buy taxi plates. Whatever else they were doing, they were certainly trying to provide themselves with the opportunity to earn a livelihood. I would not be happy if they were penalised for that and I welcome this part of the amendment to the motion in that it will address that.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that there are taxi owners and drivers who have genuine fears for their livelihoods and it is not helpful that that would be debased and laughed at in any sense in this House or elsewhere. I agree with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, in what he said about some of the people at the meeting last Tuesday week in the hotel in Clare Street who said one thing in the House and the opposite at the meeting. I was present for the entire meeting and know what was said. I did not avail of the opportunity to say anything, foolish or otherwise.</P>
      <P>That element of the issue needs to be addressed and there is a need for standards of quality to be imposed. We need a proper taxi service in future. Work is required in that regard and it can be done in co-operation with taxi owners. That will happen. The taxi lobby did not deserve to be treated the way it was in the media. It made mistakes and has done so over three or four years. It refused to address the issues or adopt a policy which would have allowed this matter to be dealt with by negotiation. However, it did not deserve the campaign of vilification waged against it. It was under pressure, its members feared for their livelihoods and it made mistakes, but claims made against it were wildly exaggerated. Any Member, the Minister of State or anyone else, is entitled to express a level of support and sympathy for the taxi drivers' plight.</P>

The very fact that the Minister felt it necessary to make a very adequate apology to the Taoiseach and the Progressive Democrats in itself indicates that he was at fault and deserves the censure of the House. The bluff and bluster that he has indulged in is an attempt to hide the fact that he was at fault, deservedly had to apologise, and deserves the censure of the House in respect of that.</P>

      <P>None of us is, but when we make a mistake we should admit it and accept the consequences. There are occasions and issues where a vote of no confidence is justified and necessary. One of these issues concerns the long-established principle of collective responsibility in Government. It is one of the central pillars of our democratic system, without which our parliamentary democracy would not work. It is particularly necessary in a coalition Government made up of two or more parties. Parties in such a Government cannot go their separate ways, unless of course on matters of conscience where it has been agreed that collective responsibility will not apply. The same applies to individual Ministers who make up such Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a long time since I described a Stormont Minister for Agriculture as having foot and mouth disease, in that every time he opened his mouth he put his foot in it. One may call that personality politics, even vulgar abuse, and I have been guilty of that on occasions in my time. Thankfully, however, foot and mouth disease is not the threat to animals and the agricultural industry that it once was. As we are only too well aware from current developments, it has been succeeded by BSE. Foot and mouth disease appears to be virulent, however, among Ministers of this Government and in recent times among the ranks of Ministers of State in particular. The Minister of State with responsibility for food, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, spoke and voted on a motion calling for a total ban on the feeding of meat and bonemeal to all animals, without disclosing his own interest in a pig and feed mill. <Col N="810" /> The Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy Ó Cuív called for the activities of the Department of Defence at Baldonnel to be transferred to his constituency in Galway west, a demand contrary to the policy of the Government to which he belongs, without even the knowledge of the Minister for Defence. It was an act of policy-making on the hoof, if I may describe it as such.</P>
    <P>As regards the subject of this debate, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, not only came out against the policy of the Government but also asked his listeners to resist the judgment of the courts. The gentlest criticism I can make of his action is to say that it was opportunistic. In terms of saying something in private he was not prepared to say in public, it was hardly based on sound moral ground.</P>
    <P>One is entitled to ask in relation to this virulent outbreak of foot and mouth disease, where is the vet and what is he doing? Surely the Taoiseach has a responsibility to defend what I have described as one of the central tenets of our parliamentary democracy &ndash; collective ministerial responsibility. Surely, even in his own interests of maintaining authority and discipline in the Government, particularly when the call of resistance was made against a member of his coalition partners in Government, he should have taken action, but no, the Taoiseach, apparently, is not a man for such decisions, maybe not a man for any decisions. That is not his style or inclination. He prefers to put off until tomorrow decisions which should be taken today. He reminds me of the man jumping from the 34th floor who is overheard shouting, as he passes the 13th floor, &ldquo;So far, so good&rdquo;. This failure by the Taoiseach to stamp his authority on the Government will inevitably have a sorry end for him.</P>
    <P>My first experience of the political relationship between Fianna Fáil and the taxi industry was during my very first election to the Dáil. I was more than a little surprised to find outside certain polling stations in the constituency rows of taxis where the sign on the top was covered by a poster with the name of a certain Fianna Fáil candidate. I was more than a bit surprised also to see the length of those taxi queues and I wondered why they were there. Later in the day when I visited another part of the constituency, I saw similar rows of taxis bearing the name of the other Fianna Fáil candidate. I wondered about that because I come from a place where black taxis operated, particularly in west Belfast, and we knew who controlled them. I wondered, therefore, what the political relationship was between people in the taxi industry and the Fianna Fáil Party. I have come to know much more about that matter as time has progressed. It is perfectly clear from the reaction of some taxi drivers to the prospect of deregulation that they expected a return for such political support. The vehemence of the response by so many taxi drivers underlines their bitter disappointment and feelings of betrayal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="811" /> During this crisis for the taxi drivers, some Fianna Fáil backbenchers, as well as Deputy O'Dea, have persisted in leading taxi drivers up the garden path to destruction. How sincere are they? Have they put their seats, or even their party membership in this House, on the line? That would be a test of conviction, of being true friends, but no, they have cynically manipulated taxi drivers, dropped them in it and betrayed them.</P>
    <P>There should be deregulation of the taxi business. I have been of the opinion for some time that the taxi men's leaders were leading them into a cul-de-sac, that the failure to make proposals themselves to improve the service was a bad mistake, that public opinion in this city in particular would eventually force something akin to what has now happened, that their public relations effort was atrocious, that their espousal of confrontation was bound to lead to their defeat in any contest for public opinion, and that a row with a PD Minister &ndash; grasping at any straw for public rehabilitation &ndash; was a recipe for disaster.</P>
    <P>The taxi men have been badly advised and badly led, but I object to the way in which they have been vilified in some sections of the media by some commentators. Some taxi men have come across badly and have behaved badly, damaging themselves and their cause in the process. Threats to the media amounted to pure stupidity. Those people who were so loud and confrontational on the streets and who were involved in acts of inexcusable intimidation at Dublin Airport were only a small minority of the taxi drivers involved in the dispute. The great majority are ordinary decent people who are afraid for their future and that of their families, and rightly bitter because of their feelings of betrayal.</P>
    <P>There are some who deserve what they have got. I refer to the speculators, those with many plates, some of whom have never driven a taxi in their lives. They have speculated and, like all speculators, they win some and lose some. This time they have lost and I have no sympathy for them. There are others, however, who deserve our sympathy and full compensation for their loss. I refer to the man or woman with his own plate and car doing a day's work and working long hours, ordinary decent hard-working people whose wit and conversational capacity have added much to the reputation of our city and country for conversation. I refer to the cosy, who has been used, abused and exploited by those who sit at home or have other occupations and who use the wealth generated by the sweat of the cosies on foreign holidays or other similar luxuries. I refer to the widow &ndash; one is particularly well known to me &ndash; who was bequeathed a plate as a form of pension and now, having no other pension, must think in terms of employment to keep body and soul together. Some have had to come out of retirement to take up low paid jobs in order to do so. I refer to others who have been forced to retire because of bad health, for <Col N="812" /> example, and are now at wit's end. All these people deserve our sympathy and, more than that, they require to be fully compensated. I hope to hear this from the mouth of the Minister for Finance later today. They are the people who are suffering and deserve to be fully compensated, not those who have been speculating and led the people mentioned into this dreadful position.</P>
    <P>I hope a solution is found before Christmas. We are all aware of the dangers to young people. As the father of young people, I share the fear of parents about their children on the streets of Dublin trying to find their way home. I hate to think of what might happen over Christmas when the lack of taxis will encourage the less responsible to take a chance and have that extra pint or two. Whereas previously they would have called for a taxi, they will now have their cars with them. This is a real danger, if the dispute is allowed to continue over Christmas.</P>
    <P>In one respect the Ministers of State, Deputies O'Dea and O'Keeffe, should count their blessings. Those of us who were Ministers or Ministers of State in the Government led by Deputy John Bruton know how long he would have tolerated such activity. He would not have tolerated it for 24 hours. That would have been the maximum. That is only right. The Ministers of State who have been so irresponsible in their breach of ministerial responsibility and the Taoiseach who allowed them to do so have a lesson to learn from the way Deputy Bruton behaved when Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, saw fit to leave the House. He could have no more pressing business than his own survival and accountability to the House. He is able to dish it out in terms of his hysterical vitriol this morning, but not able to listen to the points being made. He should reflect on the fact that the cause and source of his difficulties are his own utterances, not the Opposition. It is our job to hold members of the Government to account for Government policy. That is the purpose of the House and the function of the Opposition. We have an adversarial system. The Minister of State has nobody to blame for his difficulties but himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is valid for any member of the Government to hold a view on any issue which deviates from that of the Government. It is not unprecedented <Col N="813" /> in other jurisdictions for politicians to disagree with Government policy, take a stand on principle, resign from office and freely articulate and defend that point of principle from the backbenches, but in this instance we have a Minister of State who is running fast with the hare and even faster with the hounds. He said as late as one hour ago that he still retains the private view that he does not agree with Government policy, but at the same time he is happy to vote for an amendment in support of the Government. I find it intensely difficult to listen, as we did this morning, to lectures on hypocrisy to Deputy Bruton and my party from the Minister of State who still retains such private views while expressing public support for the Government at the same time. Lectures from the Minister of State are impossible to stomach given his stated position.</P>
    <P>If the Minister of State really wants to be a rebel and supports the case of taxi drivers who are opposed to deregulation, he should resign on a point of principle and act accordingly. What he is trying to do is have his cake and eat it. He is trying to have it both ways simultaneously whereby he can say out of one side of his mouth, &ldquo;Keep up the pressure, lads, we are right behind you&rdquo; and out of the other make a grovelling apology to the Tánaiste, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, and the Progressive Democrats. It is that type of double speak and double standards which has made politics one of the most disreputable professions in Ireland. It is as blatant as that.</P>
    <P>The authority of the Taoiseach has taken hammer blows during the lifetime of this Dáil. He was not prepared to hold former Minister, Ray Burke, to account. Neither was he prepared to hold Deputy Lawlor to account or to deal with the Foley and Ellis affairs. Like Mr. Justice O'Flaherty, he left them twisting in the wind until they had no choice but to resign. That is not good leadership or authority.</P>
    <P>If one is looking for an example of the way in which this debate should be dealt with, one need look no further than the comments of the Tánaiste last Thursday. The joint leader of the Government, the deputy Prime Minister and leader of one of the coalition parties has set out her stall, which is very clear. The headlines read, &ldquo;Willie lashed over two faced taxi speech&rdquo;, &ldquo;Harney blasts O'Dea for backing &lsquo;the lads' &rdquo;, and &ldquo;Harney rounds on O'Dea&rdquo;. She had some good quotes. She said that any member of the Government who advised taxi drivers that there would be a change of policy was being very foolish. She added that it would be unreasonable and unfair for a member of Government to mislead taxi drivers. The Tánaiste has put it up to the Minister of State to stand by his principles or step down.</P>
    <P>There is a view that, &ldquo;Ah sure, it's all right if Minister O'Keeffe does one thing and preaches another&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ah sure, it's all right if Minister O'Dea didn't realise he was being recorded&rdquo;. Is it any wonder Fianna Fáil has the unique record in Irish politics that once a party enters a coalition with it, it will not do so at the subsequent <Col N="814" /> general election? The Tánaiste has made it clear that she will not be fighting the next general election on a joint platform with Fianna Fáil. Whatever one may say about it, the three parties in the last rainbow Government fought the subsequent general election together on one single platform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>At a time when he was under enormous pressure from street blockades and a taxi strike and at a time when he was being vilified by the taxi sector, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, found that he was being accused of being impotent or impertinent by a fellow colleague. If that is the type of support which minority parties in government can expect, one should not be surprised to find there is no queue of small parties lining up to coalesce with Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>The principle of collective responsibility has been abandoned by the Government in this instance, but we must go deeper. It is not just the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea. The Taoiseach is probably saying the same to his taxi driver friends in Drumcondra, as are Deputy Callely and the Taoiseach's brother, Deputy Noel Ahern. I am sure they are crying salt crocodile tears to the taxi drivers who displayed their logos and electioneering material during the last general election. It reminds me of what happened this time last year. When the heat came on individualisation in the budget, a succession of backbench TDs were sent forward to the plinth.</P>

      <P>It was orchestrated double speak and the Minister for Finance was left to hang out to dry. It is a well established tactic by the Fianna Fáil press office that when the heat comes on, the second violin begins playing to ensure an organised campaign is put in place against Government policy.</P>
      <P>This comes back to the basic issue in this debate, the Government's credibility. How credible is it for the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, to say he supports the Government and then say he did not know there was a tape recorder at the meeting when he told taxi drivers to keep up the pressure? Even more serious, it was a call to keep up the pressure against the Justice Murphy judgment in the High Court which said the Government had no function in limiting the quantity of taxis to be licensed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="815" /> The Government's credibility is in tatters. I am not sure of the exact phrase used by the late Deputy Kemmy but it is apt in this debate. It was to the effect that Deputy O'Dea was a mighty mouse in the constituency and a church mouse in this Chamber. It is the job of my party to expose and embarrass the Government on foot of its hypocrisy, double standards and double speak.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the taxi licence issue. The present impasse is due to Fianna Fáil misleading the taxi industry, at every level, over the past four or five years. It misled the industry about the proposal that was then before the local authorities. The previous Government devolved the issue to local government and there was clear intent on the part of Dublin Corporation to bite the bullet and provide extra taxis. With the change of Government in 1997 a taxi forum was established to put the issue back into a paralysed state of consultation.</P>
    <P>This was followed by the decision to allocate 3,100 extra licences on a plate for plate basis. Now, three and a half years later, there is a direct conflict between what is good for the consumer, given the huge queues for taxis, and what is good for the vested interest. Fianna Fáil is trying to support the vested interest. That is the kernel of this issue.</P>
    <P>I am deeply unimpressed by the Government's handling of this matter. One thing Fianna Fáil excels at is counting. There are approximately 2,750 taxi operators on strike at present but there are 5,500 hackneys in this country trying to ply their trade. I am most concerned about the intimidation leveled at the hackney industry. That has been swept under the carpet by the Government. It is unacceptable for any group to blockade Kildare Street and access to the national airport and for the Garda authorities to claim they can do nothing about it. That is a further sign of a lack of good authority on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government is in disarray. This is the first time I have attended a Private Members' debate on a specific issue at which the Minister with responsibility has not contributed. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, has not set foot in the House and he is responsible, when he is not in Mexico, for this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">

      <P>No, the amendment tabled by the Government is in relation to taxi policy. The motion deals with the hypocrisy of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, and his untenable position as a member of the Government, but the Government's response is on taxi policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chief Whip, Deputy Séamus Brennan, was sent to tick off the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea. This demonstrates an abandonment of leadership by the Taoiseach. If there is a problem with an office holder, he simply does not want to <Col N="816" /> know about it. The chickens will come home to roost because this is but the latest example of his leadership. I believe a great deal more in relation to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, has still to emerge. The Taoiseach, however, wants to hear no evil and speak no evil. Ultimately, the credibility and authority of the Government, with the undermining of the junior partner in Government, will become unacceptable. The Government is supporting a vested interest against the public interest in the taxi issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That a Minister of State should act against the interests of a fellow Minister of State shows the failure of the Government to govern the State. It is unacceptable that a Minister of State should see fit to ambush a colleague, a fellow player in the Administration.</P>
      <P>If such a fundamental disagreement exists, the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science should do the decent thing and resign his post so he can pursue his objection to Government policy from the security of the backbenches or, perhaps, from the back seat of a taxi. The behaviour of the Minister in his Limerick constituency, where he is reported to have encouraged his taxi owning voters to continue to obstruct the deregulation of the taxi trade, must force the Taoiseach to remove Deputy O'Dea from office.</P>
      <P>Every Deputy is aware of public anger at the operation of the taxi trade, particularly as it functions in the Dublin area. There is a lack of taxis on the street when they are required, continuous complaints that taxi drivers want to cherry-pick their journeys and many cars in service are old and unsuitable for the task. Often customers complain that they are subjected to ongoing whinging by the drivers on just about every topic. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, ought to be aware that if taxi drivers were operating today it is likely that he would be the subject of their whines.</P>
      <P>The need for the taxi market to be opened up has been obvious to everybody for many years. Of course, the Minister of State could be forgiven for being confused. When the joint Dublin local authority committee dealing with the issue of increasing the number of taxi licences was making progress towards putting more taxis on the streets, the Taoiseach caved in to the demonstrations of taxi drivers and set up a taxi forum. It acted to undermine the progress and functions of the Dublin authorities.</P>
      <P>As a member of Fingal County Council, I took part in many debates in which councillors worked hard, in co-operation with the taxi plate owners, to ensure a taxi service would be made available. The committee was making progress with Dublin Corporation whose members also worked hard on this issue. However, the Taoiseach proceeded to set up the forum to put the issue on the back-boiler. If that had not occurred, there would be an extra 2,500 taxis in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="817" /> The Government must accept much responsibility for what has developed. The taxi operators are convinced that their Bertie will scupper deregulation and they are encouraged in this view by Deputy O'Dea and other Members of the House. Like Deputy Currie, I remember the last general election and the taxis scurrying around Dublin supporting Fianna Fáil Party candidates and encouraging customers to vote for those candidates. I am sorry that happened. It was a big mistake and another element of the party's poor PR. Deputies on this side of the House well remember that element of the campaign. The Taoiseach needs to support and protect the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, and the Government and, working together, they must find ways to improve the number and standard of cabs on the streets while helping to address any issue of hardship resulting from deregulation.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to cosies who work for taxi plate owners. They work very hard and should be considered in any new issue of taxi licences.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to contribute to this debate and to record my confidence in my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea. We heard the Opposition criticise the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, for his statements on the Government decision to deregulate the taxi business. We heard the Minister of State apologise to his Government, to his Government partners and particularly to Deputy Molloy, Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Fine Gael, in its Private Members' motion, is extreme in its criticism of the Minister of State and its calls for the Taoiseach to remove him from office are emotive and lack careful consideration.</P>

      <P>Last night, we heard the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, outline the many achievements of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, since he was appointed to office in 1997. In a matter of weeks after his appointment, he realised how inadequately our adult literacy service was funded under the past Government and almost immediately he argued successfully for additional funding to remedy this. This was followed by a provision of £73.4 million over the term of the national development plan. We also heard the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, outline how the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, raised the profile of adult education and in a matter of less than three years produced a Green Paper, followed by a White Paper entitled Learning for Life. This has <Col N="818" /> been instrumental in bringing adult education to the forefront of the education system and making people aware of the importance of creating a lifelong learning culture.</P>
      <P>In youth affairs, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, has secured a substantial increase in funding from £13.345 million in 1997 to £18.872 million for the year ahead. He has requested the National Youth Advisory Committee to prepare a national development plan to map out the way forward for youth work over the next five years.</P>
      <P>On the school transport front, the Minister of State was instrumental in securing funding to enable every special school to have escorts on their school bus services for those children who need them.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, is a talented parliamentarian. He has displayed a depth of ability in bringing complex legislation to the Dáil and Seanad for other Departments often at short notice. He was clearly wrong in his address to taximen recently and he has fully admitted this and has apologised for it. I hope all sides of the House will see that the achievements the Deputy has made in his position as Minister of State far outweigh his recent error of judgment. He clearly stated that he will comply with the Government's decision on deregulation. He has apologised to the Taoiseach and to our partners in Government. This matter has been extensively debated in this House and in the media. It is time to put it to rest and allow the Government to move forward and to continue in our delivery of effective Government. Political life is a complicated one and I am sure there are very few Members of the House who can reflect on their political careers and not recall a moment when they were spontaneous and said something which they later regretted. I listened to the contribution earlier today of my former college colleague, Deputy Gilmore, who admitted the matter of double speak. If ever we heard double speak, it is surely in this motion. The Opposition put down this motion to try to deflect from the qualities of the Minister of State as an individual of great intellectual capacity, as a professional of outstanding record&mdash;</P>

      <P>The vitriolic contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, this morning is a little hypocritical because the expert on the Celtic snail must be the Minister of State himself. He should look in the mirror because when the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, came in here last night and was told to speak for 30 minutes on the actions the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, has taken in the Department for the past three and a half years, he found it very difficult to come up with a script. The Minister of State has typified the inaction of this Government over the past three and a half years he has been Minister of State. He is the Minister of State with responsibility for school transport, so important to him that a page and a half of the script of the Minister, Deputy Woods, referred to school transport. That shows what he thinks of the 160,000 school children who are brought to school every day on unsafe, dilapidated and overcrowded buses. Children sit on wet seats because the rain comes through the roofs of the buses. A serious accident is waiting to happen on our school transport fleet and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, has ignored this issue. He has had a report before him for the past 12 months which <Col N="820" /> has been gathering dust and on which he is not prepared to take action.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Woods, and Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, spoke about escorts on school buses. Yes, the Minister of State provided the funding for escorts but he did not provide a structure to distribute the funding. He did not provide the insurance or the regulations and he showed absolutely no interest in children with a disability on school transport because he threw in money without putting the structures in place. If a school bus breaks down, where are the mobile phones that were supposed to be installed on these buses? They have not been provided. If a bus breaks down in the middle of nowhere, the bus driver is stranded with a busload of children and it makes no difference to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea. What about the appeals system that was supposed to be put in place for school transport, the system which the Comptroller and Auditor General criticised the Department for not putting in place? The Minister of State has not introduced that. If one wants to know the record of this Minister of State one has only to ask the parents of pupils, the 160,000 who travel on school transport or the bus drivers who are threatening industrial action. We should ask them what the Minister of State has done in regard to school transport. He has done nothing. He has ignored the issue and is continuing to ignore it.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Woods, decided to allocate six pages of his speech to youth affairs, the other responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, who is the scarlet pimpernel of the youth affairs brief. Youth organisations seeking a meeting with the Minister of State asks a member of the Opposition to put down a parliamentary question to get a meeting with him. That is the only way they have got a meeting to date with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea. It has taken him three and a half years to publish the Youth Work Bill. Initially, he said it would be published prior to Christmas 1997, then it was Easter 1998, summer 1998, Christmas 1998, summer 1999, then Christmas 1999 and eventually it was published in April of this year. It took another six months for it to come into the House and it is still on Second Stage after three and a half years. Yet the previous Minister of State, Deputy Allen, in two and a half years, brought similar legislation before the House, had the consultations and delivered on it. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, does not make this a priority. I am pleased that at long last the Minister of State has recognised the existence of the Youth Work Advisory Committee. He did not allow a meeting of this committee to take place for up to 12 months after he had taken over the brief. That was his priority on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has received critical correspondence on numerous occasions, and from many youth organisations, on the actions or lack of actions by this Minister of State on the youth affairs brief. Last night, the Minister spoke about the local youth clubs grants scheme, the funding <Col N="821" /> for which was increased from £365,000 to £1 million in 2000, and clapped the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, on the back for his action. He did not say that the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation who is responsible for the budget in this area has denied youth organisations that funding. No additional funding is being provided.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, was praised for his action in regard to adult education. The Minister's comments ran to 15 pages; it must have been very difficult to come up with a script. If the programme of adult education had not been outlined in the programme for Government, no action would have been taken in this area either. We have heard endless discussions on the matter but no action has been taken. Three and a half years on, some 500,000 people still have poor literacy skills and one in eight children leaves school with poor literacy skills. The Minister has singularly dragged his heels on this issue since he took office. He has been big on sound-bites but very poor on action.</P>

      <P>I welcomed Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea's presence in the House this morning as he entertained us highly. Like Deputy Currie, I do not like no confidence motions because they, inevitably, become too personal. However, having witnessed the Minister of State's hypocritical and vitriolic performance, I was reminded why it is sometimes necessary to table such a motion. His contribution reinforced my view that he is not fit to be a Minister. His presence in the House this morning marked a departure from the opening of the debate when nobody from the entire Fianna Fáil benches was in the House, with the exception of the Minister for Education and Science. The Taoiseach did not come into the House to defend his Ministers.</P>

      <P>If I were the Tánaiste, I would begin to feel that this Taoiseach is not 100% behind her party's Minister and the proposal to liberalise the taxi market. Perhaps those seeds of doubt have already taken firm root and are threatening to break the very fragile threads which hold the Government together.</P>
      <P>One would have expected that some Deputies from the ranks of the great Fianna Fáil Party and the dwindling Progressive Democrats would have felt obliged to subscribe to the notion of collective responsibility and come into the House to restate the Government's position which the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, assured us had the backing of the Cabinet. Yet, nobody turned up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that nobody came into the House to support the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, was <Col N="822" /> not surprising. Indeed, I found it encouraging as it offered the possibility that people had perhaps recognised that he did not do the Government any service. His behaviour in trying to have it both ways did a disservice to good politicians from all parties who regularly put their heads on the electoral block at local and national level and stand up for their beliefs rather than pander to vested interests for the purposes of some short-term political gain.</P>
    <P>Nobody, with the exception of Braveheart himself, the Minister for Education and Science, came into the House to support the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea. The senior Minister was ordered out of the trenches to come into the House all on his own to defend his junior Minister. In fairness to the Minister, he did his best. We were treated to a 30 minute contribution in which the Minister catalogued Deputy O'Dea's virtues and achievements, although I suspect it was delivered without any great enthusiasm. It certainly did not receive thunderous applause from the back benches. The empty back benches were a silent affirmation of Fianna Fáil Members' opinions of the Minister of State's virtues.</P>
    <P>Just when we were all about to nod off, the Minister surprised us by asking the House to support the Government's initiative on taxis. We would love to do that but simply do not know which part of the Government we are being asked to support or which particular initiative we are being asked to support. Are we being asked to support the collective responsibility of Government of which we see so little these days? Are we being asked to support the Progressive Democrat's arm of the Government, as represented by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, or the Fianna Fáil wing, as represented by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea? Then there is the conundrum of where the Taoiseach fits in; which wing does he lead?</P>
    <P>What initiative are we being asked to support? Is it the delaying tactic embodied by the Taoiseach's forum initiative which was established exclusively to establish what taxi drivers wanted without a thought for the needs of the public? Is it Minister of State, Deputy Molloy's quick fix gimmick of giving an additional plate to all members of the cartel, the solution which the Minister of State persists in calling his radical solution? In the end, it turned out to be both radical and redundant. It is amazing that the resident expert in the House on these matters could not have offered the Minister of State some legal advice before he came out with that idea. Even the dogs on the street knew that could not survive a court challenge.</P>
    <P>We then come to the deregulation initiative. Leaving aside the puzzle of how the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, can claim a lost court case as his initiative, I cannot understand how the Minister for Education and Science had the audacity to seek the House's support for an initiative which his own junior Minister would not support. Where will the Government go from here? When will it start governing? When will we see taxis back on the streets? Will the gardaí protect the <Col N="823" /> new licence holders at the end of the week? Will businesses continue to lose customers and lay off staff and will the public continue to be subjected to untold disruption and danger? Does anybody in the Government have any idea what the next step is? If they do, will they please share the information with the rest of us?</P>
    <P>I have my own suspicions that the next step will be a step backwards into a committee, a Taoiseach's forum mark II in which members of the taxi industry will have their ruffled feathers smoothed and their fears allayed. The public interest will be way down the agenda and we will be informed that deregulation will happen but not just yet. It will happen when the lads are happy with it.</P>
    <P>The Government has covered itself with shame on this issue. For years, Fianna Fáil has supported, protected and sustained the taxi cartel but now it finds it has turned into a monster over which it does not have any control.The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea's despicable display of manipulation and deception personifies the ambivalence towards this issue displayed by many members of his party, in spite of the public's anger and the frightening admission by the gardaí that even they cannot control the taxi drivers.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has stood by, apparently completely unperturbed by this behaviour. He appears to find it quite acceptable that a Minister of State should openly undermine a Government decision and actively incite opposition and anarchy in a group of people whose members were already out on the streets behaving in a totally intimidating fashion.</P>
    <P>We are faced with mayhem on our streets, loss of business etc. and it is up to the Taoiseach to state that the taxi drivers' behaviour is intolerable. He should make it clear to the public that it <Col N="824" /> is the Government, not vested interests, which is running the country. The Taoiseach was elected to lead the Government and make decisions. He is supposed to be the person to whom we can all turn in times of crisis to provide leadership. If he is to retain any credibility, the Minister should start providing that leadership soon.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, came into the House today to offer his apology. He obviously apologised to the Taoiseach and the Progressive Democrats; indeed, he was probably told to do so. He devoted the remainder of his contribution to attacking everybody else but himself. Members of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties were not spared. Everybody was wrong except him. He did not even spare the dead in trying to deflect the blame from where it should clearly lie &ndash; firmly at his feet. The Minister of State spoke out of both sides of his mouth at once, sat on the fence and did what Fianna Fáil has always done. He showed very clearly, lest there was any doubt about it, just how fundamentally he has failed to grasp what he did wrong or the nature of his sin. He has let down all politicians by his two-faced performance. He has deceived his constituents. He has disgraced his Government. He has let down his Cabinet colleagues and he has not looked after the interests of Limerick taxi drivers. As I said last night, if he really supported them and cared about the issue, if he believed the Government was wrong, he would have resigned in protest.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann resolves that sections 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996 (No. 29 of 1996), shall continue in operation for the period ending on the 31st day of December 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="827" /> The resolution before the House today seeks approval for the continuation in operation of those sections of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, which relate essentially to the detention provisions contained in that Act.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Act provides that sections 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 would cease to be in operation at the expiry of 12 months after the date of its commencement unless a resolution has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas resolving that it shall continue in operation. The Act, including the sections that are the subject of the resolution, was brought into operation with effect from 9 September 1996. The sections would, therefore, have ceased to operate on 8 September 1997 had appropriate resolutions not been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas before then. In July 1997 the necessary resolutions were moved in both Houses to continue the relevant sections in operation until 31 December 1998. In December 1998 both Houses passed similar resolutions to continue the sections in operation for a further two years, that is, for the period ending 31 December 2000. It is now proposed to continue them in operation for a further two years, that is, until 31 December 2002. The two year period for the further extension of the operation of the sections will allow the Garda to continue its current level of activity against the drug traffickers and it will also ensure that the House will have an opportunity to debate the appropriateness of the sections in combating drug-related crime after a further suitable interval.</P>
    <P>It is important that Members of the House should have the opportunity, at appropriate intervals, to re-examine legislative provisions such as these to determine the need to retain them. They are provisions that give strong powers of detention to the Garda and we have a duty to examine them to assess whether a need for them still exists. Unfortunately, all the indications, including levels of drug seizures, point to the fact that we have not yet reached a stage where we can allow these provisions to lapse and we must continue to employ the detention provisions of the 1996 Act as an integral element in the fight against the drugs menace.</P>
    <P>Down through the years we have seen ample evidence of how the trade of drug trafficking can ravage whole communities and lead vulnerable young people into often inescapable cycles of addiction, crime and even death. We know the vast amounts of money which drug traffickers can make out of the havoc they create in our communities and how this profit incentive is the only morality that governs the activities of these criminals. It is little wonder that it is probably the nightmare of every parent that their child will fall victim to the activities of drug traffickers.</P>
    <P>Members of the House will be aware of the concerted action of the law enforcement agencies in recent years to eliminate this menace. Legislation such as the Act we are considering is only one side of the law and order approach to the <Col N="828" /> drug problem, the other is the need for a strong Garda operational response. Without such a response, even the strongest legislation would have little effect. The strength of this response is shown by recent drug seizures. Seizures with an estimated street value in excess of £120 million were made during 1998 and 1999 in operations carried out by the Garda Síochána, some of which involved the Customs and Excise service.</P>
    <P>The Garda national drugs unit is to the fore in tackling the major trafficking groups and co-ordinates largescale operations against those involved in this nefarious trade. Because of the international aspect of drug trafficking the unit works closely with international agencies to counter international drug trafficking and has built up a professional network of contacts to generate accurate drug trafficking intelligence. Since the foundation of the Garda national drugs unit, a number of significant internationally driven seizures have been made. The Criminal Assets Bureau has also been extremely successful in depriving criminals of the profits of their illegal activities. It has continually targeted the proceeds of drug trafficking as well as targeting the suspected proceeds of other criminal activity. Street level drug dealing must also be tackled and the Garda has put in place a number of operations to tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>Operation Dóchas, begun in October 1996, is designed to combat the drug problem in Dublin by identifying critical areas requiring action and the deployment of the requisite Garda resources to this operation in those communities. The initiative operates through an overt Garda presence in these areas and through intelligence driven operations against those involved in illegal drug activity. This operation has proven to be extremely successful, with drugs worth an estimated street value of £14 million seized and more than 8,000 arrests made during 1999. From January to end September 2000 4,289 arrests were made and drugs with an estimated street value of more than £2.9 million were seized.</P>
    <P>Operation Cleanstreet, which commenced in December 1997, targets street dealers. It is a joint operation between local gardaí and the Garda national drugs unit. During 1999 Operation Cleanstreet yielded seizures of drugs with an estimated street value of more than £6,000 and resulted in 180 arrests. In the current year to end September more than 1,400 arrests have been made and drugs with an estimated street value of more than £108,000 have been seized.</P>
    <P>Operation Nightcap is designed specifically to target drug dealing in public houses and nightclubs and is co-ordinated by the Garda national drugs unit. Since the beginning of this operation in December 1997 and up to 14 November 2000, 113 persons have been arrested, charged and convicted and seven premises closed under this operation. In addition, 50 warning notices under the Licensing (Combating Drug Abuse) Act, 1997, were served on licensees during this same period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="829" /> I also remind Members that I recently announced that the Government has approved plans for a major expansion of Garda CCTV systems. It is worth noting that the CCTV systems in operation have proved to be a valuable tool in the prevention and detection of crime, in particular crimes such as drug dealing and syringe attacks.</P>
    <P>I welcome very much this proactive Garda operational approach and the success it has enjoyed. I am happy to have this opportunity to praise the Garda for their efforts in striving to protect our communities from the drugs menace. However, we must also take a longer-term preventative approach. The Government accepts fully that as well as tackling the supply side, comprehensive measures need to be taken also in relation to the demand side. I remind the House that a wide range of initiatives have been put in place to steer people, young people in particular, away from the clutches of drug abuse and in this respect tremendous progress has been made through the allocation of funding by the Government under various schemes. A figure of £10 million has been allocated on an annual basis to support the implementation of more than 200 projects proposed by local drugs task forces in their areas. A further £15 million will be allocated over the next two years to support the implementation of new service development plans currently being prepared by the 14 local drugs task forces.</P>
    <P>The Government has also allocated £35 million over three years, under the young people's facilities and services fund to assist in the development of preventative strategies in a targeted manner through the development of youth, sport and recreational facilities and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the steering committee, established by the Courts Service to organise and monitor a pilot drug court in Dublin, recently confirmed the plan to hold the first sitting of the drug court on 9 January next. The pilot programme marks an important stage in the creation of a drug courts system, which is one of the key priorities of the Government. The pilot programme represents a major policy initiative in the criminal justice system and is designed as an alternative measure, involving supervised treatment programmes for dealing with less serious and non-violent drug offenders. I look forward to assessing the results of the pilot project in due course.</P>
    <P>I have given some indication of all that is being done to tackle the drug problem, but this battle must go on. That is why I ask this House to approve the resolution before it today.</P>
    <P>To assist Deputies on the sections of the 1996 Act that are the subject of the resolution, I will outline the contents of those sections. Section 2 of the Act deals with powers of detention and permits the detention of a person suspected of having committed a drug trafficking offence for up to a maximum of seven days. The first 48 <Col N="830" /> hours of this period may be authorised by a member of the Garda Síochána of specified rank. Thereafter, authority to detain the person up to the maximum of seven days must be obtained from a judge of the Circuit Court or a judge of the District Court. In each case the authorisation may be granted where a court is satisfied that the detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned and the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously.</P>
    <P>Section 3 involves an amendment of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990, to allow for the taking of bodily samples in the case of a person detained under the Act. Deputies will be familiar with other sections. I do not have time to deal with the details but they can be circulated.</P>
    <P>The report required under section 11 shows that the number of persons detained under section 2 in the previous period &ndash; that is, between 1 December 1998 and 17 December 2000 was 1,435. Of these, 611 were detained for a period not exceeding six hours, which is the initial period of detention permitted under section 2, while 522 were detained for a period of between six to 24 hours, 272 for a period between 24 and 48 hours, 26 persons for a period between 48 and 120 hours and four persons for a period between 120 and 168 hours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, was introduced under the previous Government and came into operation in September 1996. The purpose of the Act was to increase the powers of the Garda and Customs and Excise officers in combating the supply and distribution of drugs into and around the country.</P>
      <P>Section 11 of the Act provided that sections 2 to 6 of the Bill would cease to be in operation after 12 months from the date of commencement unless resolutions were passed by the Oireachtas to ensure their continued operation. In July 1997 the Oireachtas passed the required resolutions after seeing the necessary report provided by the then Minister for Justice in order to continue the operation of the aforementioned sections within the Act for a further period.</P>
      <P>That period expired on 31 December 1998 and a further resolution was then passed in the same way to continue with the operation of the relevant sections for a further two years. That 24 month period will expire on 31 December 2000 and a resolution is now required again if the Houses wish sections 2 to 6 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, to continue to be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 refers to powers of detention. The Act provided additional powers of detention to the Garda in relation to persons suspected of having committed a drug trafficking offence and the initial period of detention provided for under this section was six hours. However, this period may be extended to 24 hours when a member of the <Col N="831" /> Garda not below the rank of superintendent has reasonable grounds for believing that such further detention is necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 3 relates to an amendment to the 1990 Act dealing with increasing Garda powers to collect forensic evidence. The effect of the section is to allow for the taking of bodily samples in the cases of persons under investigation for drug trafficking offences.</P>
    <P>Section 4 relates to re-arrest, providing that re-arrest is only permitted on the authority of a judge and only when new information has come to light regarding a specific case.</P>
    <P>Section 5 refers to the application of certain provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, and in particular to the release of a person from detention due to lack of reasonable grounds for holding him or her. It relates to issues such as destroying records after someone is released, access to a solicitor and medical treatment and so on.</P>
    <P>Section 6 relates to regulations regarding Customs and Excise officers. The section provides for the attendance of such an officer at the questioning of persons detained under the provisions of the original Act.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael recognises now more than ever that there is a need for continuing with these provisions. The Garda has strongly indicated that these provisions are important in the investigation of drug trafficking offences and we as legislators must take all reasonable steps to ensure they are given the extra powers they need to combat drug trafficking. The type of criminal involved in organising or participating in drug trafficking is often intelligent, violent and ruthless and organised gangs control this murky business in different parts of our towns and cities. Garda drugs squad members and ordinary gardaí deserve huge credit for their work in this area, as it is often difficult and dangerous to secure convictions given the type of criminal one is dealing with. I pay tribute to the work of gardaí in such operations as Operation Nightcap, as did the Minister.</P>
    <P>In the report recently received by the House we can see that the total number of persons detained under section 2 of the Act in the period from December 1998 until 17 December was 1,435. Of these, 969 were charged and only 347 have been convicted, while 605 cases are pending. Regarding those 605 cases, what in the Minister's opinion is an acceptable period for a person who has been charged to have to wait for his or her case to be heard? Our courts system is under such severe pressure that it is not capable of dealing with its caseload. We were promised a courts and court officers Bill before the end of the year and I would like that to be confirmed so that we can appoint extra court staff and judges, if necessary, to speed up the system. We must ensure that when persons are charged convictions occur quickly, particularly in drug trafficking offences, <Col N="832" /> so that public confidence in this vital area of the justice system is maximised.</P>
    <P>We have a huge drug problem. The ecstasy and cannabis seized this weekend in Cork were worth almost £500,000. In 1999 alone Garda drug seizures amounted to 230,000 ecstasy tablets, over 16,000 grammes of heroin in Dublin and 2,500,000 grammes of cannabis resin. With an estimated 13,000 heroin addicts in Dublin and experimentation with soft drugs becoming the norm for young people in their late to mid teens in almost every town and city, the drug problem is now one of the biggest threats facing young Irish people.</P>
    <P>Despite all the seizures in the last three to four years, almost every type of drug still seems to be widely available, which is worrying. I am aware of the work of the national drugs strategy group with local drugs task forces but are we putting enough resources into trying to stop the problem before it gets to the addict by cutting off the supply? Perhaps we are not. The Garda is doing an excellent job with the resources it has but I would like to see drug education for gardaí extended beyond Cork and Dublin so that rural gardaí would also have the equipment and intelligence necessary to deal with problems as they arise.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measures the Minister has implemented in relation to CCTV and Operation Nightcap. As he knows, I also welcome the pilot scheme in relation to the drug court and I hope when that pilot scheme is under way, both in the capital and, I hope, outside it, we will see a court system that is not under massive pressure as it is currently because of the huge number of drug convictions. We can try to separate drug offences from mainstream criminal offences. Only when that happens will we start to deal in a positive way with the reasons people commit crime under the influence of drugs or because of drug addiction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>At the time of its enactment, the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, was described by the then Government, of which I had the honour of being a member, as exceptional legislation because it gave to the Garda Síochána exceptional powers to deal with what was and is an exceptionally serious menace facing this country &ndash; the availability and abuse of drugs. The Labour Party acknowledged the need for that legislation, as part of the Government that brought it in, but in the face of strong resistance from the Department of Justice which demanded that there would be in the legislation a built in mechanism for review to allow the Dáil and the Seanad to decide on a periodic basis whether the sweeping powers that were put into the Act were required to continue to battle the menace of drugs and drug abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be reluctant to see any legislation providing for prolonged periods of detention. The legislation we are talking about provides for periods of detention of up to seven days for suspected offences. We have to be very careful in providing any mechanism to have people's liberty <Col N="833" /> taken away for periods of that order when they have not been convicted of any offence but we deemed at the time that this issue warranted it. It is our view that, unfortunately, the position has not improved since then and those powers are still required. For that reason, the Labour Party will not oppose the motion the Minister has put before the House today.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the exceptionally serious drug problem that formed the background to the introduction of this legislation in 1996 is still with us today. In many respects, the problem has got worse. We have seen a series of tragic deaths this year from contaminated heroin in the greater Dublin area. The critical issue is that the menace of drugs that this legislation and a range of other issues were designed to combat unfortunately still exists.</P>
    <P>We have seen very positive results from some of the measures that were put in place at that time, particularly the local drugs initiatives. They have had a remarkable impact at ground level but the reality is that rather than overcoming the menace of drug abuse, it appears to have spread more seriously in this city and, worryingly, across the country. At a seminar organised by the Garda Síochána earlier this year, the assistant commissioner, Kevin Carty, stated: &ldquo;Living in a rural community does not offer any special protection from those who seek to profit out of the misery of others&rdquo;. He made it clear that drugs, including ecstasy and heroin, were now available in communities across the country. The menace exists and the measures to oppose the menace have to be bolstered. We will do that.</P>
    <P>Under the Act the Minister is required to lay a report before this House periodically on its operation. The report that he has put forward contains some interesting facts. For instance, of the 1,435 people held under section 2 of the Act, some 466, or almost one third, were released without charge. It is also interesting to note from the statistics provided by the Minister that almost 98%, or 1,405, of the people were held for less than 48 hours. Just 26 people, less than 2%, were held for between two and six days, and just four individuals, 0.2%, were held for between six and seven days. If we are talking about four individuals who were subject to the most rigorous parts of this provision, the question legitimately arises as to whether there is a compelling reason to have this power in place. Perhaps the Minister might address that point when responding to the debate. Unfortunately, the report does not give any indication as to whether those held for the longest periods were among those subsequently charged. The Minister might give us that information.</P>
    <P>Everybody acknowledges that full co-operation between the Garda and the customs authorities is essential if we are to defeat the drugs menace. The Act introduced by the rainbow Government gave the Minister the power to make regulations providing for the attendance of an officer of Customs and Excise and the participation of such an <Col N="834" /> officer in the questioning of persons detained under this Act. It is disappointing to note that more than four years after the Act was passed, the Minister is still keeping the question of making regulations under this provision open to review. Perhaps he would indicate why that is the case and why the regulations are not in place. Why is it not accepted as correct for the Customs and Excise officers to be present, where appropriate, at such questioning?</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that the drug court would finally begin on a pilot basis on 9 January next. I welcome that. I would like to have more detail about the period of the pilot scheme. How long will the evaluation take before there can be a general application of the drug courts and to where is it envisaged that it will be extended? What is the roll-out programme envisaged or intended by the Minister should the pilot be successful?</P>
    <P>A new report, which is extremely worrying, is commented upon in today's newspapers. It concerns a study carried out by the department of general practice in UCD, TCD and the eastern regional training programme for GPs which found that the age for using heroin was falling ever lower, as low as 15 in its survey, and that the initial abuse of heroin was starting at a younger age than when this measure was first put in place. It is extremely worrying if all the initiatives outlined by the Minister, which are supported by the House, have not cracked that nut. Not only is the problem getting worse, as can be seen from the statistics, but the impact on ever younger children seems to be a reality. This is an awesome, depressing and worrying reality.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to Operation Dóchas, Operation Cleanstreet and Operation Nightcap. I would welcome more detailed comment from him on their scope and the resources available to them. On Operation Cleanstreet, the figure given for drugs seizures of an estimated £6,000 is not impressive. I support this motion, which should be taken as a determined effort by the House to finally come to terms with this dreadful scourge in society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We are aware of the horrific effects drug addiction have on drug abusers and their families. Drug abuse is a serious social problem and a multifaceted approach is needed if we are to defeat drug traffickers. We are aware of the money made by drug traffickers on the backs of the weakest elements in society. It is disadvan<Col N="835" /> taged areas which still have the highest level of drug addiction. However, as those of us who represent rural constituencies know, drug addiction is not confined only to those areas.</P>
      <P>I fully support the motion. The Government is, in effect, seeking the continuation in force of sections 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, until 31 December 2002. These sections give important powers to the Garda in its battle to defeat drug trafficking. The Government must be tough on hardened drug criminals, as otherwise the fabric of many communities will be destroyed by the wider spread of drug abuse. If we want to succeed in the important battle to have drug pushers jailed, the above mentioned sections of the Act must continue in force for another two years.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years 1,435 people have been detained under the Act. It is the opinion of the Garda and the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, that the continuation of these legislative provisions is an important piece of armoury for the law enforcement agencies if drug pushers are to be properly investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the continuation in force of these exceptional provisions, as getting rid of them at this stage would send out the wrong message not only to drug godfathers but also to communities, particularly in Dublin, which have borne the brunt of the heroin problem. According to recent information made available to us by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Report, the problem has spread and is beginning to appear in other cities and towns. This is alarming.</P>
      <P>While the provisions relating to interrogation, arrest etc. are stringent, the sentences handed down by the courts, particularly to heroin dealers, do not reflect the seriousness given to the problem by the House. I apologise if I am wrong, but I did not see any reference in the Minister's speech to his initiative of a ten year minimum sentence, which has been an unmitigated disaster simply because the Judiciary refuses to implement it. This element of the measures taken by this House needs serious review. There must also be a serious review as to why the Judiciary is not implementing it. My criticism of the initiative at the time was that it did not focus on heroin, the drug which is causing the misery, destruction and crime in communities.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately the extent and severity of the drug problem are getting worse. One has only to listen to the Marian Finucane radio programme to hear parents who have to buy methadone and heroin on the street for their sons and daughters who still cannot get treatment after a number of years of addiction. When they go to treatment centres they are told to come back in three or four months. Until such time as this issue is resolved we will not deal effectively with the drug problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="836" /> The drugs court will be held in my constituency in January. While I welcome this, I wonder if the services available will allow for the proper implementation of this court. I very much doubt it. I regret I do not have time to make further points.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that this debate is being rushed in this manner. It is important that as many public representatives as possible show their support for the marvellous work being done by the Garda in this area. Drug trafficking is a terrible scourge which inflicts problems on families not only in Dublin but nationwide. The Garda is doing marvellous work but I question whether it has sufficient resources. We have read reports on the quantities of drugs seized and the number of detentions and convictions. However, I have been told by people whom I respect that drugs are freely available within five minutes walk of this House. If this is the case, adequate resources are not in place and the Garda is not being given sufficient back up. There should be no limitation on the resources available to the Garda in its efforts to stamp out this wicked activity once and for all. Drug traffickers are ruthless people, with low moral standards and no regard for life. Gardaí put their own lives at risk in trying to apprehend these people. Gardaí have been threatened that their families will suffer if they do not leave these people alone. This in itself gives an indication of the type of people with whom we are dealing.</P>
      <P>I want to issue a word of warning to young people. During the festive season they should socialise in groups so that they can look after each other, which is what young people in County Cavan do at the weekend. I have been told that if drink is left unattended it can be spiked. This ruthless behaviour must be stamped out. If this requires additional resources the Minister will have the support of the House in allocating them.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Those who bring heroin and other lethal drugs into working class communities and wreck the lives of young people, families and entire communities have to be dealt with in the harshest fashion, particularly by allowing them no place to hide. The Minister acknowledged that some of these measures are stiff. I am always worried about the introduction of extreme measures to deal with a specific crisis which can be applied generally. This is not the most effective way to deal with the problem. On the 26 people detained between two and five days and the four people detained between five and seven days, the Minister should have told us the outcome of the detention, whether the charges were successful and if the detention was for serious trafficking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the Government is doing enough to deal with the problems on the demand side. The living environment of working class communities needs to be transformed to give young people an alternative to the nightmare of heroin. A distinction should be made between <Col N="837" /> heroin, cocaine, crack cocaine and other drugs which are not as lethal. The £750 million that the Taoiseach proposes to spend on a national stadium would transform the living environment of working class communities in terms of facilities which are seriously lacking.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the resources provided for the rehabilitation of those currently in recovery. It is difficult to stay off heroin and more resources and supports need to go into long term rehabilitation programmes so that those who are in recovery can be supported in the long term to leave behind completely the addiction which has destroyed their lives. I regret this discussion must be shortened because it is vital for many of our communities.</P>

      <P>The Government announced last December its plans for MediaLab Europe and a multimedia village in Dublin to be known as the Digital Media District. The district will be located in a central Dublin location. Earlier this year the Government, under the auspices of my Department, established a new body, Digital Media Development Limited. The functions of the company are threefold: to oversee the development of the Digital Media District as a creative centre for digital industries, such as multimedia, Internet and electronic commerce, to acquire suitable property, and to implement the contractual agreements between the Government, MediaLab Europe and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has played a co-ordinating role in developing the MediaLab Europe and Digital Media District projects, having regard to the range of issues and Departments involved. A report has been received from the board of DMDL covering the arrangements for the establishment of the media village, including its location and the provision of a permanent home <Col N="838" /> for MediaLab Europe. The report is being examined by my Department with the other Departments concerned, including the Departments of Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and I anticipate that decisions will be made shortly on the next phase of the development of the project.</P>

I said our aim in developing the new district was to ensure that a mixture of residential, commercial, educational and leisure facilities was developed to provide a living community anchored in a new digital economy in the heart of the city. When I have met the individuals involved or they have met officials of my Department, I have said repeatedly, not that there is any argument or issue with me on it, that, in the work they have done in scoping the project with assistance from Enterprise Ireland, Dublin Corporation, the IDA and others, they should ensure the building blocks are put in place from the beginning and that the local communities are fully consulted in the process.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach assure the House that the jobs which will be provided in the area will be focused on residents and locals and that appropriate training will be put in place and skills development facilities provided for them? Will he set up an appropriate task force to ensure that happens?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have raised the jobs and employment issues and they cover many areas, such as those I outlined, like the building of the facilities and the residential and other aspects. The purpose of the Digital Media District concept is to develop a purpose-built environment specifically as a premier international location for Internet, multimedia and information and communications technology industries which would build on the strong base of the existing computer manufacturing and software industries in the country and which would contribute to making Ireland Europe's centre of creative excel<Col N="839" /> lence and the leader of the Internet economy. MediaLab Europe will be the high profile anchor tenant but it is only one part of the village.</P>
      <P>The district will also be home to a range of other facilities, such as incubation units for indigenous, high technology companies. Enterprise Ireland handles that. The district will also house divisions of larger companies, including multinationals, which operate in the electronic commerce sector. The IDA handles that. The district will also house local business services along with suitable leisure and accommodation facilities. While some of the jobs may not be suitable initially for some local employment needs, as was the case with the Irish Financial Services Centre, it is desirable that, from the beginning, training is put in place. I accept that fully. Even if people cannot take up many of these jobs, they should at least be able to aspire to the technical jobs.</P>
      <P>Deputies know the speed with which this has moved. The number of companies, mainly from outside the country, interested in the project is much greater than anyone expected in summer. It should certainly create employment and the company should maintain involvement with local companies. The IDA and Enterprise Ireland already have local involvement and contact in the community, as does FÁS.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Bruton and local Deputies know better than I, there is a large amount of open, derelict and unused space in the locality, for one reason or other. I accept what Deputy Bruton said. That fear always exists. I saw what happened in the area around the Irish Financial Services Centre, an area with which I am familiar, and I know what can develop from a project such as this. Provision was made in the Estimates for 2000 for the purchase of some property for this development. It is important the property end is handled efficiently and quickly. Otherwise, it will cause a house price escalation crisis which would not be helpful. The board has pointed this out clearly to me and it is attempting to take some corrective action.</P>

      <P>Second, as regards the £100 million allocated, I understand a commitment of £31 million has been announced by the Taoiseach. On what, specifically, will that £100 million be spent? To date, for what has the £31 million been used? </P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the property element of it has been, although not an enormous amount. I hope Media Lab Europe will be the flagship project of the digital media district. It is generating enormous interest because of its world wide network. The company has put 15% of its European research projects into this venture. Six months ago I said that some 15% of new European sponsorships or grants would be allocated at the end of Media Lab Europe's first year of operations. I did not think its activity would generate as much interest as it has, but people physically follow those involved in it and that is what is generating the interest. The total cost to the Exchequer of Media Lab Europe will be £28 million in start-up capital over four years, together with the cost of suitable premises estimated at £15 million, and £1 million per annum for the joint work done by Media Lab Europe and the Irish universities. The premises remain in State ownership and will be leased to Media Lab Europe for a nominal rent. Some of those costs, therefore, have already been expended.</P>

      <P>I welcome this proposal and am sure that all the local Deputies would like to be kept informed by the Taoiseach of the progress being made. Given the progress that has been made in Ennis, does the Taoiseach agree there is a golden opportunity to encourage access by local people in the Liberties and the Coombe to computers and the Internet? Will the Taoiseach consider the sort of proposals Fine Gael has made whereby half the cost of installation might be met by the Government, thus including local people in this welcome development?</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach consider consulting on a regular basis with the south west inner city network and others so that their views are taken into consideration? Given what happened in the International Financial Services Centre &ndash; a welcome development, but one that does not attract people as a residential area &ndash; would the Taoiseach consider ensuring that the design of the media village will incorporate housing? If we have shops with homes over them, is there any reason housing should not be incorporated in this media village? The Taoiseach should consider those suggestions.</P>

I will bring all the Deputy's points to the attention of the group involved. I raised the issue of training in particular with the Media Lab board whose members are already involved in such matters. Mr. Nicholas Negraponte is familiar with all these issues, as is Dr. Danny O'Hare, the former president of Dublin City University, who did a tremendous job in involving the people of Ballymun.

I have not seen the report but it addresses this issue. I will make them aware at the next meeting of the views of local Deputies who know the area best. The area was picked as the location for the centre because it is the main remaining one of high long-term unemployment and social disadvantage in the greater Dublin region, if not in the entire country.</P>

Does the Taoiseach agree that the results of such a survey would give a clear indication of what needs to be done to ensure that this is a multimedia community involving locals as well as newcomers, and that proper provision is made to achieve that objective?</P>

      <P>The entire community should be involved in it. A survey was carried out, although I do not know its extent or content. I saw some preliminary reports of the number of people in the community who use personal computers. Those points of view should be taken into account, if they have not been already. This project &ndash; the European centre of excellence for the Media Lab of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology &ndash; has been recognised by all our state-of-the-art high technology companies as an enormous opportunity, not only for this district but also for the country in general. The people participating in it are, as they like to say themselves, creating the future. To do that successfully we must take account of the residential, commercial, educational and leisure facilities of the area. Every Deputy would like to have the centre within his or her own community.

That is what the Massachusetts Institute of Technology &ndash; the model used &ndash; has been doing for some years and what Media Lab Europe will be doing. The IDA and Enterprise Ireland, which have been trying for many years to attract investment here, have spelled out the benefits in detail.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Abridged Estimates for Public Services, which were published on 16 November, include an Estimate of £44.11 million for my Department <Col N="844" /> in 2001 and indicate a forecast outturn at £73.9 million for the year 2000. The Estimate will be submitted to the House early next year in the usual way and considered by the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service in accordance with the procedures set out in Standing Orders. It is only in the context of that process that the matter of a general statement arises.</P>
    <P>The final outturn for my Department for the year 2000 will be incorporated in the Appropriation Accounts for that year when published. The Appropriation Accounts will then be dealt with under Standing Order 46 by the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>By how much will the salaries subhead of the Department's Vote have to be increased to take account of the agreement which the Department recently negotiated with the social partners? What are the reasons for the fall in the provision for the multimedia developments subhead and the reduction in the provision for grants under the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate for my Department does not take account of the agreement concluded the other night. While I do not yet have a breakdown for my Department, the figures will be included in today's budgetary figures.</P>
      <P>On the multimedia village, the 2001 allocation includes payments due to Media Lab Europe under the agreement between that body, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the State and the costs of Digital Media Development Limited, the company established by the Government in advance of the proposed digital media district. I expect to receive a report from the board of the development company in the very near future covering the arrangements for the establishment of the media village, including its location and the provision of a permanent home for Media Lab Europe. I anticipate that decisions and an announcement will then be made. The provisions for much of the work will be the responsibility of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the IDA and, in particular, Enterprise Ireland which, probably, will be the main driving force behind the project.</P>
      <P>On the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Fund, the allocation of £100,000 represents the balance remaining in the Estimates. In all, a total of £1.2 million has been disbursed to 59 projects. There are a few outstanding payments which remain to be made.</P>

      <P>When is it expected that the fund in question will be empty and wound up? What is the reason for the provision of £8 million in the Estimate for his Department for millennium celebrations? Is it the case that the Department of the Taoiseach has taken an each way bet on whether the millennium began on 1 January 2000 or will begin on 1 January next and it wants to spend money on both, or is it the case that all <Col N="845" /> the bills have not yet been paid and it wants to make provision for paying some of them next year, or is the case that there will be a millennium celebration every year for the next 1,000 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That might be a good idea, we had such fun last year. The Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Fund has effectively been wound up. There are a number of outstanding payments in respect of some of the 59 projects in question which remain to be made. I am not certain that a sum of £100,000 remains outstanding.</P>
      <P>On the millennium celebrations, expenditure both last year and this year was lower than originally anticipated, mainly because there is a significant capital element involved and projects must be completed or near to completion. There is a longer lead-in time on such projects. The millennium office assures me that the grants will be paid. The allocation of £8 million for next year represents the unspent balance of the overall allocation of £33 million for the programme. For planning reasons and because of delays and difficulties encountered in local fundraising, some of the projects in question did not commence as planned. In others, final accounts have not been produced. Unfortunately, there are no new projects.</P>

We will also focus on our continuing efforts to implement all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement and on further deepening the relationships between Ireland and the United States.</P>
      <P>Officials from my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Garda Síochána and other Departments and agencies will work closely with the US advance team and officials from the United States Embassy up to and during the President's visit.</P>
      <P>I sent a letter of congratulations to the Prime Minister of Canada, Mr. Jean Chretien, on his successful re-election last week.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the first visit by President Clinton to Ireland and Britain was crucial in launching the twin-track process by John Major and me which ultimately resulted in the Good Friday Agreement and overcoming Washingon III? Will the Taoiseach agree that this third visit by President Clinton is an opportunity to clear up a range of issues that potentially endanger the Good Friday Agreement if they are not resolved? They include decommissioning, policing, demilitarisation and the boycott on North South participation imposed by the Unionist leadership on Sinn Féin. Will the Taoiseach also agree it is important that the next few days are used in whatever format is most appropriate &ndash; be it a round table or bilateral format; my own preference is for round table &ndash; to get these issues brought to a point where President Clinton has a basis for assisting their resolution by his presence here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree. We have spent several weeks, particularly since the last Saturday in October and the Ulster Unionist meeting, trying to resolve issues that arose from that conference as well as issues that have been around for some time which gave rise to what came out of that conference, and trying to build on the basis of the statements of 5 and 6 May and the re-establishment of the institutions. The issues are, as the Deputy said, policing, full implementation of the Patten report in so far as that can be achieved, demilitarisation, decommissioning, other related issues and the proper operation of the institutions <Col N="847" /> following the Unionist decision on the last weekend in October.</P>
      <P>President Clinton told me in the first week of September that he would visit in Christmas week and he will honour that commitment, even though the visit is during the last couple of weeks in December and he is busily engaged in finalising other issues. However, he has made some days available to visit here and the North and to meet the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, at Chequers. Over recent weeks we have been trying to get the parties to move on a number of the issues. We must try to bring the Patten proposals to a conclusion and get an understanding on the other issues. There have been statements from some groups in recent days restating their positions.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and the Secretary of State, Mr. Mandelson, had a long and useful meeting to finalise as many of these issues as possible. My senior officials are at 10 Downing Street today, again trying to come to conclusions. To be frank, there is not much writing up on the issues but in so far as they need to be written up, they are doing that. With regard to the channels of communication, it would be good if it could be done bilaterally or in a round table format but that is not feasible for one reason or another and through no fault of ours. It has to be done bilaterally with the groups. We are endeavouring to do that and, as always, to get enough understanding and commitments from everybody to reach successful conclusions and, if not, at least to have it at such a stage that the discussions President Clinton will have with everybody will be conducted in such a way that he can help us. He is anxious to do that and to encourage people to move a step further and stretch themselves so conclusion can be reached on these issues.</P>
      <P>Aside from that, it is dangerous to let the Christmas period pass without achieving this. Otherwise, in January we will be faced with the inevitable Ulster Unionist Council petition and we will be back on the merry-go-round again. I cannot think of one good reason for not doing this now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Taoiseach. However, why did the Taoiseach, the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, the First Minister, Mr. Trimble, and the Deputy First Minister, Mr. Mallon, not launch a round table talks process lasting for a period of ten days, for example, in the run up to President Clinton's visit so all these issues could be thrashed out and, if possible, a package put together? Will the Taoiseach not agree that we will only make progress on the basis of a package? Will he not further agree that the experience of bilateral meetings last May was particularly bad? Sinn Féin claimed on the one hand that it was given assurances by the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, which the Prime Minister either said he did not give or could not legally have given. This has <Col N="848" /> caused bad faith accusations to be traded, which is causing no end of problems at present.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that it is necessary at this stage to get everybody into the same room? We owe it to President Clinton to make every effort not to talk about bilaterals but to get everybody into the same room, even if it is only for two or three days before the President arrives, and try to solve the problem. If this continues into January and a new UUP council, we will not get anywhere.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that on this occasion Sinn Féin should place itself in a position where it will be able to talk as a plenipotentiary on behalf of the Republican movement rather than give undertakings, like it did on Good Friday with regard to decommissioning, which are then repudiated by the IRA? The mistake of Irish history, which was made in 1921 and 1922, of sending people to negotiate who did not have the power to do so should not be repeated. It is at the heart of our current difficulty.</P>
      <P>Sinn Féin's assurances on decommissioning have not been lived up to by the IRA because the IRA claims it was not part of the agreement. Will the Taoiseach not agree that on this occasion we owe it to President Clinton to ask the republican movement and the loyalists to give their political party leaders a mandate to negotiate on arms, get the best deal they can and deal with the matter once and for all? If this issue drifts into January, and the Taoiseach does not disagree, I am afraid that we are facing a difficult situation which would mean that the Taoiseach's work, my work and the work done by John Major, Tony Blair and Dick Spring could be washed away in a welter of recrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of what Deputy Bruton said is common knowledge. With regard to his questions, I do not agree that the May series of bilateral and round table meetings were unproductive. I would argue strongly to the contrary. From 11 February all the institutions were suspended. What was achieved in May was the re-establishment of those institutions and they have worked extremely well, notwithstanding the one difficulty that still exists.</P>
      <P>In all these sessions there are arguments about the interpretation of what can and cannot be done. I will not go into that; I know both sides of the arguments and the recital of the issues does not help. However, the same recital is made when there are round table meetings so what was set down in May was useful. In May there were understandings on demilitarisation, some of which has taken place and some of which was not possible for good and not so good reasons. On the other side of the issue, we received the clear words of the IRA the day after those talks, that it believed that for the process to reach a conclusion the issue of arms, disarmament and putting arms permanently beyond use had to be dealt with. That has been restated in the past 24 hours and it comes directly from those discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="849" /> If putting Seamus Mallon, Tony Blair, Bertie Ahern and David Trimble into one room could have solved this problem, it would have been long solved. We have spent more time in the same room than I care to remember. Unfortunately, it is not much use because neither Seamus Mallon nor David Trimble control IRA arms. They can add nothing to decommissioning aside from stating their positions. Seamus Mallon, David Trimble and I can do nothing about demilitarisation either. It is a matter for the British Government alone. I can add nothing to it other than put the cases of Northern Nationalists, both republican and members of the SDLP. As far as arms are concerned, Seamus Mallon, David Trimble, Tony Blair and I cannot do anything. It is a matter for the Provisional IRA and the other groups that have them. All we can do is collectively urge them to commit themselves to what happened in May.</P>
    <P>There is no disagreement between the British Government and the Irish Government or between Seamus Mallon and David Trimble on what we believe could resolve some of these issues. I assure Deputy Bruton there is not disagreement between the British Government and ourselves or Seamus Mallon and David Trimble on what we think could resolve some of these issues. There would be some difficulty, perhaps, on how to solve problems with regard to things like flags and emblems. However, there are not enormous difficulties on these issues. The arguments and the positions are well known and over the next few days we should try to get some movement. That is what we have been trying to do in recent months on the basis that we knew President Clinton would come. However, even if he did not come, we would try to get some movement and we will continue to do that.</P>

In relation to the input he has had in Northern Ireland and to political affairs in this island as a whole, does the Taoiseach agree that we have often been too dependent on his intervention? Since he will not be in office beyond January next is it incumbent on ourselves now to resolve the outstanding matters and can he tell the House specifically what mechanisms are being employed?

      <P>Regarding Larne, we have received a report and have received a number of deputations from the people in Larne including the Assembly member from Larne who has put his case very forcibly. What is happening there is deplorable. We have raised their case, not just in the recent meetings, but particularly over the past 18 months. From early summer last year, the situation in Larne has been extremely difficult and there is a group which has been involved in extreme intimidation of Nationalist people. Its members have threatened local elected representatives and generally made life extremely difficult for people who attempt to represent Nationalists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other issues to be considered in regard to punishment beatings. However, I believe clear, unequivocal statements should be issued to the effect that any kind of punishment beatings or actions, not to mention armed killings, should cease. There are people who can con<Col N="853" /> trol the incidence of these actions, although it may not be possible to control them completely. Punishment actions of any kind should cease completely.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to state at the outset that the provision of a 24 hour Dauphin helicopter search and rescue service by the Air Corps from Finner Camp, County Donegal has not been suspended. I also want to categorically state that the Department of Defence has not delayed in any way the provision of crash rescue equipment at Finner Camp, County Donegal. In this regard, last May, I raised with the military authorities the issue of a fire tender for Finner Camp. I undertook to have the fire tender provided and I instructed the military <Col N="854" /> authorities, to whom responsibility for these types of purchases has been delegated for some time now, to initiate a tender process to acquire a new fire tender for Finner Camp. The fire tender is scheduled for delivery early next year.</P>
      <P>As I have stated previously in the House, the safety of personnel working in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service, at home and overseas, is of paramount importance. Safety issues are monitored on an ongoing basis by the military authorities and any necessary work to ensure the continued safety of Defence Forces personnel in carrying out their various tasks will be carried out with my full backing as a matter of priority.</P>
      <P>Following media reports in October 2000 I was advised that an internal report had been prepared by Air Corps personnel for the military authorities dealing with the issue of crash rescue services at Air Corps installations. The report suggested that the crash rescue services at these bases were inadequate.</P>
      <P>I take all safety issues very seriously. I arranged for an immediate briefing by senior military officers, including the General Officer Commanding the Air Corps. The meeting took place on 10 October. At the briefing, I was presented with a copy of an internal military report and received categoric assurances from the senior military officers present that any shortcomings identified in the report were being dealt with as a matter of urgency. I was also assured that there were no other safety questions of which I was not aware.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information.</i>I took the opportunity at the meeting to again impress on the senior military officers and the General Officer Commanding the Air Corps that safety standards in both equipment and facilities are of paramount importance. Funding is not an issue where safety is concerned. Funding is, and will continue to be, available to improve and modernise safety equipment.</P>
      <P>Pending the delivery of the fire tender and the provision of a crash rescue service at Finner, a Defence Forces working group has examined the matter and has recommended that the Air Corps Dauphin be relocated at an early date to an alternative location in the north-west on an interim basis. The matter is under urgent examination by the military authorities and a decision will be made shortly. In the meantime, search and rescue operations are continuing to be carried out. It is planned that when the fire and crash rescue service is in place on a 24 hour basis the Dauphin will return to Finner Camp.</P>

      <P>How long has the Air Corps operated out of Finner Camp? Will the Minister indicate why it has taken so long to provide crash rescue equipment? At the previous Question Time on defence matters, we focused on Waterford and the safety deficit there. Does the Minister agree there is a serious safety deficit in Finner Camp which would not be permissible were <Col N="855" /> the camp operated under the aegis of the civil aviation authorities? Why is a military authority allowed to operate without proper safety equipment?</P>

      <P>This matter was first brought to my attention last May at which time I immediately instructed the military authorities to proceed with the process to acquire a fire tender. I have delegated full responsibility for this matter to the military authorities who have proceeded with the tender process. I understand the new fire tender will be delivered next March. Once safety considerations are brought to my notice, funding is not a problem and I will proceed to provide whatever is necessary in this regard.</P>

      <P>While one recognises the Minister acted in May, the Air Corps has operated out of Finner Camp for the past four years. Is it not, therefore, a sad reflection on the military authorities that they waited until May to notify the Minister of a specific problem in regard to the fire tender? Is the Minister disappointed at the possibility that a lax attitude towards safety exists within the Defence Forces, of which this case is a classic example?</P>

      <P>We could engage in the blame game. I received a relatively blank sheet when I took up office as far as resources were concerned. For the first time ever, the military authorities have access to the kind of financial resources of which they could only have dreamed heretofore. They are in a clear position to respond to any safety matter which arises and that has been exemplified in a range of areas. I held a meeting with the military authorities and requested them to inform me of any further safety requirements. The provision of funding for such requirements will not be a problem.</P>

      <P>An Air Corps officer of Lieutenant Colonel rank has been appointed by the GOC Air Corps to carry out the duties of air safety officer. The question of the further assignment of personnel in connection with the work of the air safety officer is a matter to which the GOC Air Corps is giving urgent attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> I am pleased to report that the procedure for the selection of an appropriate agency to undertake an air operations safety audit of the Air Corps, as recommended in the report of the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise into the accident at Tramore on 2 July 2000 has commenced. The report envisages that the results of this audit will form the foundation for the new Air Corps air safety office.</P>
    <P>As I have outlined previously in the House, I have directed that this audit be carried out at the earliest time possible and all support necessary will be provided by my Department and the Defence Forces to the chosen agency to carry out its work.</P>
    <P>As I have stated previously in the House, all of the safety recommendations set out in the report which call for action by the Department and the Defence Forces are being considered as a matter of priority with a view to their immediate implementation and, in this regard, I have put in place arrangements to monitor progress in regard to the implementation of the recommendations.</P>
    <P>The second meeting of the working group charged with overseeing the process was held recently in the Department of Defence, involving representatives from my Department, the Defence Forces and the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. Progress reports from the various bodies involved were presented and reviewed and a composite progress report is currently being prepared in the Department, which will be presented to me within the coming days. This group will continue to meet on a regular basis in order to ensure the speedy implementation of the safety recommendations set out in the report. I am aware that progress is also being reported by other bodies involved.</P>

      <P>Is the safety officer a member of the audit group which is being established? Has he been involved in all of the meetings between the Department and the relevant agencies and what back-up services exist? I have asked the Minister this question on previous occasions. I acknowledge that safety is one of the Minister's top priorities but it seems strange that, having appointed a safety officer, the necessary back-up services are not provided to allow the officer to investigate problems such as the one in Finner and the 25 safety recommendations made in regard to the Tramore accident. Is he a central figure as regards the audit group, meetings and contact with the Minister?</P>

I have asked the general officer commanding the Air Corps to ensure that any back-up arrangements, staffing requirements or additional resources that will be required to make his job as effective as possible will be provided. He has indicated that he is dealing with that with all urgency.</P>

The Department is conducting work that relates to the training of the search and rescue units and the special expertise that is required in that area. Even though it is early days following publication of the report, efforts are being made to ensure the maximum number of recommendations are put in place without delay. I have reported to all other Departments that have a special function in this area &ndash; they will be aware if they have special responsibilities &ndash; to ensure we have a more coherent and comprehensive approach to these matters.</P>

      <P>The problem in regard to air traffic control as it arose in the context of our previous discussion had to do with out of hours services.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>On 20-21 November, a number of meetings were held in Brussels which centred on the capabilities commitment conference. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, attended the commitment conference on my behalf due to my absence overseas accompanying <Col N="858" /> the President on her recent visits to the Balkans, including SFOR and FKOR and the Middle East. The Minister for Foreign Affairs attended the General Affairs Council embodying security and defence elements and the associated conference meetings with the third countries wishing to contribute to the EU headline goal.</P>
      <P>The conference chiefly provided the opportunity for EU member states, including Ireland, to indicate formally the resources they can make available for potential humanitarian or crisis management operations. These contributions were made in the context of the voluntary headline goal agreed at the European Council at Helsinki last year.</P>
      <P>Ireland offered to contribute up to 850 members of the Defence Forces to the headline goal from within our existing commitment to the United Nations standby arrangements system of 850 personnel. The largest element of the commitment involves a light infantry battalion of up to 750 personnel, along with an army ranger wing platoon of 40, in addition to small numbers in national support, headquarters and observer elements that make up the remainder.</P>
      <P>A declaration by EU member states was issued after the conference which outlined progress to date on the elaboration of the voluntary goal in the lead up to the Nice European Council. It clearly stated that the Union's contribution to international security would be made in keeping with the principles of the United Nations charter. Moreover, it reiterated that these steps did not imply the creation of a European army.</P>
      <P>In summary, Ireland's contribution of up to 850 members of our Defence Forces does not in any way affect our long standing policy of military neutrality to which the Government remains firmly committed nor is any mutual defence arrangement involved.</P>
      <P>Participation by Ireland in any Petersberg mission remains a sovereign decision to be taken by the Government. The Government will decide on a case by case basis whether, when and how to commit either troops or other resources. In our interventions at the conference, Ireland reiterated these points and specified that in our case, in compliance with the terms of the relevant Irish legislation, we will participate only in missions authorised by the United Nations.</P>
      <P>With regard to the confidential annexes associated with the outputs of the capabilities commitments conference, there is no additional material in these in relation to the commitment of Irish Defence Forces personnel to the EU headline goal which has not already been put into the public domain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>More generally, I wish to reiterate that Ireland supports the transparent and open approach as regards access to EU information which is embodied in the Amsterdam Treaty. Restrictions on the availability of information should be kept to a necessary minimum. However, in the context <Col N="859" /> of the development of European security and defence policy, there is also a need to ensure the protection of certain sensitive information. In relation to any military planning work, it is appropriate that it should be seen as being of a confidential nature. With regard to the contributions to the headline goal, the release of information in relation to individual country commitments was felt to be a matter for each of the member states concerned.</P>
    <P>As regards more general matters, I reiterate that the planned contribution to the EU headline goal in no way downgrades our commitment to UN peacekeeping. In fact, this contribution reinforces, in a very conspicuous way, our continued intention to support efforts to maximise international peace and stability. At a time when the UN increasingly looks to regional organisations to undertake peace support operations on its behalf, it is critical to support efforts at EU level to give effect to the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam. What is involved in developing the headline goal is no more than giving effect to the treaty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister probably knows there is concern about the rapid response unit. While he has clarified the issue we have never debated it in the House. He has probably heard Deputy Gormley outline his concerns. With regard to EU secrecy policies on security and defence, did Ireland vote on that and did other countries oppose it? If we are in the rapid response unit from January 2003 and have a force ready within 60 days, when will the training process start? Will we continue to play the UN type role we played in Lebanon and other countries in the past in parallel with our rapid response unit responsibilities? Will the Minister clarify a statement made in Germany that not alone will the role of the rapid response unit be outside Europe but we could be within 2,500 miles of Brussels in places such as the Middle East and Africa? Does the Minister see us having a role in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer the last part of the question first, we operate only under a UN mandate. Each time there is an application or opportunity to participate, it will be examined on a case by case basis. It will depend on resources and will be a sovereign decision taken here. We have operated under a UN mandate in Africa and Somalia. I will not deal with where problems might arise. We have seen tragic injustices, genocide and unspeakable atrocities and we want to play our part, consistent with our tradition, on a case by case basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to training, we have introduced a number of modern systems. There is the United Nations training school in the Curragh. Training is centralised there. There is greater use of modern technology, simulation and other methods so that whatever demands are made of us, and wherever we decide to go, the operation, equipment, <Col N="860" /> facilities and training will be as up to date as we can possibly make them, primarily for the safety and security of the men and women who will go.</P>
    <P>We and most of our partners want the EU to be as open and transparent as possible. However, we supported a motion put forward by the French Presidency for certain matters to remain secret in the interim. This would not have been long lasting as there is an amendment to the EU Treaty &ndash; article 255 &ndash; and next May the final decision will be taken as to how these matters are to be dealt with in future. Everything in that annexe has been made public. One of the reasons for this approach was that a request was made that only the countries making the contribution would make the announcement. In other words the announcement could not be made by the Commission or somebody else.</P>

      <P>The provision of a 24 hour search and rescue service by the Air Corps from Finner Camp, County Donegal, has not been suspended. I state categorically that the Department of Defence has not delayed in any way the provision of crash rescue equipment at Finner Camp, County Donegal. Last May, following a meeting with RACO, where the issue of the non-availability of a fire tender at Finner was first brought to my attention, I immediately raised this issue with the military authorities.

      <P>The issue of safety at Finner was brought to the Minister's attention last May or June by RACO. If one attended the RACO AGM in Kilkenny, as we did, one would know there is still great concern within the association regarding safety in the Air Corps. Given that this was brought to his attention last May, how many meetings has the Minister had with RACO on the matter? Is RACO satisfied with what has been put in place in terms of addressing safety? As a result of its AGM in Kilkenny has it again brought it to the attention of the Minister? If so, what action has the Department taken in terms of addressing its concerns, which were very strongly expressed at the conference in Kilkenny?</P>

They proceeded to decide the kind of fire tender required and embarked upon the tender process, and I am assured the fire tender will be delivered next March. Therefore, everything possible on my side and as far as the military authorities are concerned has been done following the indication of concern from RACO in May.</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware of the statement by his colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, made in Waterford on 1 July 1999 that we have a world class service. In terms of search and rescue missions and the loss of more lives, the Minister and I know we do not have a world class service. We have a 12 hour service in Waterford. There are serious question marks over the Dauphin helicopter which is being used on a 24 hour basis in Donegal, operating from Finner Camp. When will the Minister do something serious about restoring a 24 hour service and having a serious search and rescue service throughout the country, which was the original intention?</P>
      <P>Regarding the order for two medium lift helicopters to be delivered in 2004, the Minister should seriously consider leasing helicopters for Waterford and Finner, if necessary, to provide this world class service and not wait until 2004.</P>

The Deputy will appreciate that providing finance is the first and fundamental way of dealing with this matter. No financial resources were being provided for this purpose. Aircraft cannot be provided without money, and I have provided the money. I want to create the flexibility either through the tender process or through leasing to ensure we have enhanced aircraft which the Government accepts is required by the Air Corps.</P>
      <P>A number of different comments have been made about Dauphin helicopters and that is one of the matters which will be considered by the working group.

      <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
      <Quest>the representations he has made to the President of the District Court regarding the recent negative comments of a District Justice on a service provided by members of the Defence Forces with UNIFIL; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>On 24 November 2000, arising from the comments made by Judge Desmond Windle on 23 November 2000 when he was reported in the media as describing overseas service by members of the Defence Forces as a &ldquo;farce&rdquo;, a press release was issued on my behalf in which I took issue with these comments.</P>
      <P>In the press release I indicated that Judge Windle would appear to be poorly informed of the enormous contribution made by Irish troops on United Nations peacekeeping duties for the past 40 years. This contribution of personnel and the manner in which they go about the business of peacekeeping is a matter of national pride. I also indicated that, as Minister for Defence, I have first-hand knowledge of the positive contribution made by Irish soldiers in the cause of world peace and that I can say without fear of contradiction that United Nations service in Lebanon and other countries has made a difference and continues to make a difference to the lives of ordinary people in these trouble spots. The professionalism, dedication and even-handedness with which Irish soldiers carry out their peacekeeping duties has received praise at the highest level internationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I observed that the easiest way to really discover the effectiveness of the Defence Forces on peacekeeping missions is to meet the local communities in Lebanon, Kosovo and Bosnia Herz<Col N="864" /> egovina and hear their glowing comments on the impartiality and the undoubted help and support given to their communities by Irish soldiers.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to make representations to the President of the District Court regarding Judge Windle's comments, as suggested by Deputy O'Shea, as he has since issued a statement saying he in no way intended to reflect on the courage, competence or integrity of any member of the Defence Forces serving abroad. He regrets that any of his comments were interpreted in a negative way. In particular, he regrets any upset to the relatives of those who may have died on UN service especially in the Lebanon.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, as are the military authorities, that this matter is now closed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's reply and the statement he made at that time. We are not highlighting in the media or through other available resources the major contribution the Defence Forces play throughout the world. A recent article in the <i>Sunday World</i> highlighted the good work of the Defence Forces. Perhaps more PR is required on the work they do overseas in the Lebanon and elsewhere. While I accept the representative association publishes a magazine, will the Minister consider publishing a release on the Defence Forces on an ongoing basis to highlight the work being done by them. That might prevent esteemed people such as Judge Windle from making the remarks he made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We could easily make the mistake of believing Judge Windle's comments were close to reflecting the public view. I am certain they do not. In the past few years our esteemed President and the Taoiseach were the first in their offices to visit our troops overseas and those visits got fantastic publicity, good coverage and speak well of the attitude of people in our highest offices to the work of the Defence Forces. The Deputy is correct in that there are other ways in which we can enhance the public image of the Defence Forces, and I would be pleased to do that. I do not believe Judge Windle's comments reflect the public attitude towards the Defence Forces. I will leave it at that.</P>

We would not do any great service to the Defence Forces by maintaining a row, particularly when we genuinely believe those comments have been withdrawn and do not reflect the public view of the Defence Forces.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 43 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>The Government fully recognises that there are urgent equipment modernisation requirements in the Air Corps. In recognition of these requirements, I announced on 1 March 2000 the allocation of up to £55 million over the next three years for this purpose. These funds will initiate vital investment in new aircraft for the Air Corps. The first indicator of this investment is the current project for the acquisition of medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tender competition for the acquisition of the helicopters is progressing well. This major investment programme involves the acquisition of two medium lift helicopters with an option of a third for search and rescue purposes as well as an <Col N="866" /> option for two medium lift helicopters for general purpose military transport.</P>
    <P>The tender competition is being carried out in two stages, a request for proposals stage and a request for tenders stage. Responses to the request for proposals were received in the Department on 21 September 2000. Six responses were received. The responses are being evaluated at this stage and a short list of companies for participation in the tender stage will be drawn up shortly. It is expected that the tender stage will commence early in the new year with a contract being placed in mid-2001.</P>
    <P>The responses to the proposals stage carry a range of possible delivery dates for the proposed helicopters. However, the lead-in time for the delivery of the helicopters is a matter that would have to be discussed with the successful tenderer in due course. I can assure the Deputies that every effort will be made to have the helicopters delivered at the earliest possible dates.</P>
    <P>Last month a working group was established consisting of representatives from the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, the Irish Coast Guard and the Department of Defence to deal with the subject of dedicated helicopter search and rescue assets.</P>
    <P>In tandem with the current tender competition for the supply of medium lift helicopters, the group will determine the overall resources required, civil and military, and the optimum deployment of same to cover marine emergency management. The group will identify and make recommendations on the specific air corps resources which will have to be committed and deployed to meet this requirement. This work will include making recommendations on the Dauphin helicopters. The group will also consider all the options for the provision of interim solutions for the overall requirements taking into account the lead time for the delivery of the medium lift helicopters to the Air Corps.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I will focus on the Question No. 43, as the Minister has given a reassurance that he will lease helicopters while awaiting delivery of the helicopters that have been purchased. As he is aware, the Dauphin helicopters were ordered in 1982. The five of them were specially built by Eurocopter. In 1986 they were delivered. Is he aware that in many cases the avionics in those helicopters are obsolete, it is impossible to get spare parts for them and the Air Corps has to cannibalise other helicopters to get parts for them? The Minister should reconsider whether to refurbish those helicopters at a cost of £1.5 million each. He needs to evaluate what is required to provide an effective service for the future, and the Dauphins may not be part of that service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The working group I established last month to evaluate the resources that would be required in the Air Corps for the future in terms of search and rescue and marine management involved examining the future use of the <Col N="867" /> helicopters and whether the overhaul operation should be carried out. I expect that group will report in the new year, at which stage I will be in a better position to inform the Deputy of the outcome of its deliberations. I accept the aircraft which were purchased are no match for what is currently coming on stream. There would be no reason to provide the additional £25 million if I thought everything we had was adequate. The fund is being provided because the Government accepts the requirement to upgrade the aircraft for the Air Corps, both in terms of search and rescue, military transport and whatever other operations are necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware there is a difficulty in training pilots for the Dauphin helicopters in that there is not a simulator facility available for aircraft training here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We have from time to time availed of simulator facilities in other countries to train our pilots. This is primarily a matter for the GOC of the Air Corps. I am not directly involved in training and I do not have the technical capacity to suggest what should be done about this but plenty of other countries avail of the facilities of other sources in the same way as we do. I cannot determine at present whether that is the way to proceed as I am concentrating on the aircraft, safety resources and training &ndash; whatever facilities the GOC requires. Sending the pilots abroad is fine as far as I am concerned. The important thing is to ensure they are properly and fully trained to modern specifications and standards.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now moving to the tender stage and we expect to be able to place a contract in mid-2001. We will then discuss the delivery time scale with the successful tenderer. There are some limited types of aircraft which are almost ready-made but the Air Corps' specific standards may mean we have to start from scratch with manufacturing. There are other options, such as leasing, that I am looking at in the interim but this is primarily a matter to be discussed with the company submitting the successful tender. I cannot give a definite answer on that now.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
      <Quest>if, in view of concerns expressed about some selections for overseas duty, he will publish the criteria for selection; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The criteria for selection of volunteers for overseas service are broadly as follows: competence and suitability, professional expertise, recommendations from reporting officers, seniority, health and age as well as family and social considerations. The Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1960, provides that an officer appointed or a man enlisted after the date of its passing is liable to serve outside the State with a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force despatched for service with international forces established by the United Nations. With the passage of time since 1960 all personnel of the Permanent Defence Force are now liable for such service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1960 Act service with an international United Nations force was confined to a force established for the performance of duties of a police character. The Defence (Amendment) <Col N="869" /> Act, 1993, dispensed with this requirement. Anyone entering the Permanent Defence Force on or after 1 July 1993 is liable for service under the new arrangements. However, we have relied practically entirely on volunteers to date.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy of continuous recruitment to the Defence Forces has resulted in recent times in a significant increase in the number of volunteers for overseas service. However, due to organisational changes in the Irish Battalion in Lebanon to reflect new operational requirements in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon following the Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon in May of this year, it was necessary to detail two technical officers and 31 other ranks for service with the 88th Infantry Battalion. The 31 personnel comprised 20 technical personnel and 11 line personnel. Personnel deployed recently to all other missions have been drawn from volunteers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>The President of RACO, in his address to that body's conference in Kilkenny, expressed concern about the fact that the criteria for selection were not published. It is obvious that there is concern within RACO regarding the process of selection for overseas service. Have representations been made by RACO to the Department in relation to those concerns?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The selection of personnel is done under an operations order from the Chief of Staff. Until this contingent was picked it was based primarily on volunteers; this was one of the first occasions that a number had to be detailed. This occurred because of the specific nature of this assignment and the changes since Israeli forces withdrew back to the border. But for the fact that the Government introduced continuous recruitment and that 40% of contingents are now going for the first time, we would have had extreme difficulty filling the contingents. In fairness to the men and women concerned, we are there 23 years and serving soldiers have gone 12, 14 and 16 times. That amounts to eight years of their lives and is a huge contribution. That is one of the reasons I have signalled our intention to withdraw when circumstances permit. It has been a drain and were it not for the many new recruits it would have been much more difficult. This is primarily a matter for the Chief of Staff; he is responsible for the operations order for the selection of personnel to go overseas.</P>

      <P>The new Naval Service organisation, which I hope to be in a position to implement shortly, provides for a total of 1,144 personnel as follows: 189 officers, 537 NCOs and 418 seamen.</P>
      <P>The continuous recruitment policy that I introduced should be of considerable benefit to the Naval Service in filling the outstanding appointments. As we are all aware, however, staff recruitment and retention difficulties are no longer just public service issues. These problems are characteristic of the booming economy and are affecting employers throughout the public and private sectors. In such an environment, we need to have flexible recruitment policies so that we can get the calibre of people that we need.</P>
      <P>In relation to vacancies for junior officers in the Naval Service, this matter requires a creative and innovative response. Among the initiatives that must be examined in this context are graduate recruitment, short service commissions and a more active programme of commissioning from the ranks. The military authorities, having consulted with RACO, are developing proposals in this area. Once received by me, I will ensure that the proposals are examined by my Department to ensure the earliest possible implementation.</P>
      <P>Competitions for direct entry watchkeeping officers and marine engineer officers are currently under way.</P>

      <P>Before calling on the Minister for Finance I want to issue my usual reminder that the Principal Features, along with the Minister's speech, are being circulated strictly on condition that the budgetary measures remain confidential until the Minister has announced them in the House. I ask everyone in the Chamber to respect the confidentiality of the information being supplied to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to present my fourth budget to the House. In doing so I will outline my proposals for the coming year. I will also set out the goals and <Col N="873" /> targets which we will achieve next year in the fifth budget of this Administration &ndash; the last before the general election.</P>
      <P>RECORD OF ACHIEVEMENT</P>
      <P>When this Government took office in June 1997, we set out clearly what we intended to do. Our record since then is one of significant achievement. Because of our policies and performance, 250,000 jobs have been created in the economy and more than 100,000 people have been taken off the live register. This has brought our unemployment rate from 10% in 1997 to below 4%, a record low. We have improved our public services with significant investment. Overall spending on the health service has increased by 86%, or £2.3 billion, and funding for education has increased by 67% or £1.4 billion. The weekly take home pay of the average single industrial worker has increased by £60, when tax reductions and wage increases are taken into account. There are many more that I could mention, but by any yardstick this Government's achievements have been impressive. This budget will build on that success. It will set the scene for continued progress in achieving a prosperous and fair society.</P>
      <P>BUDGET OBJECTIVES</P>
      <P>This budget has four basic objectives: to manage our economy to secure our continued prosperity; to improve our quality of life; to promote a fairer society; and to reward work and enterprise through ongoing tax reform.</P>
      <P>In meeting these key objectives, the Government recognises the role of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. This budget focuses very much on the appropriate response to inflation. In framing my budget, I have taken the views of the social partners into consideration, particularly their views on inflation, living standards and child care.</P>
      <P>The budgetary targets and goals are based on the over-riding need to keep our economy competitive and on the need to ensure that this is reflected in our approach to how we reward ourselves. In particular, the budgetary targets are dependent on the delivery of the commitments, including the industrial peace commitments which were underlined and strengthened in the recent agreement negotiated with the social partners. If this scenario is departed from, our ability to achieve these goals will be jeopardised. The competitiveness upon which our growth is based will disappear and we will be in danger of heading back to the days of significant unemployment and emigration. The budget depends for its success on respect for, and adherence to, the terms of the PPF.</P>
      <P>ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT TO SECURE CONTINUED PROSPERITY</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Economic and Budgetary Targets</i>The first major objective of this budget is to <Col N="874" /> secure the basis for continued prosperity in the years ahead. We have already seen living standards raised to the EU average. We can make further progress on this through the sensible management of our economy.</P>
    <P>The budget is framed against the prospect of strong, but moderating, economic growth. I expect growth to slow from an estimated 8.6% in GNP terms this year to an average of 6% in 2001 to 2003. Employment should grow by about 2.5% annually, with unemployment declining a little further. Full details of the economic projections underlying the budget are included in the Stability Programme Update, which I am publishing today.</P>
    <P>If these economic prospects are realised, living standards will be towards the top in the EU. Achieving this, however, is conditional on implementing the disciplined approach to wage developments provided for in the PPF, which has just recently been confirmed by the social partners.</P>
    <P>This strong economic performance means an expected Exchequer surplus in 2000 of £2,478 million. This is after taking account of an increase of £178 million in the assets of the capital services redemption account. This surplus will be used to reduce our national debt, thereby cutting the burden of future interest payments and allowing room for lower taxes and better services in years to come. The general Government balance for 2000, as defined for EU purposes, will show a surplus of about 4.7% of GDP.</P>
    <P>Taking account of the measures I am announcing today, the budget targets for 2001 are as follows: a general Government surplus of £3,900 million or 4.3 per cent of GDP; an Exchequer surplus of £2,538 million, including a release of £400 million from the capital services redemption account to meet interest costs on the national debt; a current budget surplus of £6,145 million; a capital budget deficit of £3,607 million; and a debt to GDP ratio of 33 per cent.</P>
    <P>The increase in 2001, post-budget, in net current spending as defined in the context of the Government parties' document, An Action Programme for the Millennium, will be 6.6%. This is the annual average increase in 2001 over the 1997 outturn. This figure includes provision for the agreement between employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on an adjustment to the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, and takes account of the £400 million I referred to earlier. The Government decided that an increase beyond the target 4% limit was justified to make more rapid progress in key social spending areas and to help secure industrial peace.</P>
    <P>The Government also intends to run significant budgetary surpluses beyond 2001, reflecting economic good sense and our obligations under the stability and growth pact. A general Government surplus of 3.8% of GDP is foreseen in 2002 and 4.6% in 2003, with the debt ratio falling from <Col N="875" /> about 39% in 2000 to 24% by 2003 and falling also in absolute terms this year and next.</P>
    <P>The EU Council of Agriculture Ministers agreed on 4 December a package of measures to deal with BSE and its impact on the beef market. There is no reliable estimate of what the cost to the Exchequer might be and I am, therefore, making no provision for it in my budget.</P>
    <P>We will continue to allocate at least 1% of GNP annually to build up the national pension reserve fund which will be formally established early in the new year. The decision to establish the fund represents a sound and far-seeing approach to budgetary planning. The amount in the fund already stands at over £5 billion.</P>
    <P>Today's budget reinforces the basis for economic growth and social progress over the period ahead, by continuing the responsible management of the public finances which has characterised the Government's term of office to date.</P>
    <P>Today's budget also reinforces the basis for progress. It does so by improving the attractiveness of work and enterprise through further reform of the tax system and by ensuring, through a high priority for investment, that infrastructural pressures do not inhibit growth. However, future prosperity depends to a large extent on the recent commitments entered into by the social partners being honoured. We should not fool ourselves into thinking we can continue on the path of economic and social progress if we lose our disciplined approach.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Service Pay</i>The agreement reached on Monday night between employers, the Government and the ICTU provides for a pay adjustment of 2% with effect from 1 April 2001 and a non-pensionable lump sum equal to 1% of annual pay on 1 April 2002. As a result, public service employees will receive ongoing pay increases under the PPF amounting to 18% over 33 months and nearly 22% in the case of those benefiting from the 3% early settlers' agreement, in addition to the once-off lump sum of 1%.</P>
    <P>It has also been agreed that one quarter of whatever increases may be recommended by the public service benchmarking body, which is to report by 30 June 2002, will be implemented with retrospective effect from 1 December 2001. The balance will be implemented on a phased basis to be agreed between the parties in discussions which are to commence immediately following receipt of the benchmarking body's report. This represents a very significant improvement in the arrangements for implementing the outcome of the benchmarking process.</P>
    <P>These improvements highlight the benefits which can be achieved by working within the PPF framework. The Government has made it clear that it cannot countenance claims by any single group outside the PPF framework and the benchmarking process for which it provides.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="876" />
      <i>Anti-Inflation Package</i>The Government is in no doubt that the recent increase in inflation is a key challenge, though largely not of our making. Last summer we announced measures to address domestically-generated inflation. We, like others, expect that the inflation rate will fall next year. This should happen as the effects of recent oil price and exchange rate developments and other once-off factors unwind. However, as indicated to the social partners at that time, I am determined to take some additional specific measures to reduce our inflation rate. That is why today I am announcing a further anti-inflation package. This package consists of: first, direct tax measures to increase participation in the economy; second, cuts in indirect taxes to bring down the CPI and ease transport costs; and, third, measures to encourage consumers to save rather than to spend. The estimated inflation rate for 2001 will average 4.5%.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Indirect Taxation</i>To reinforce our commitment to counter inflation, I am announcing a cut in the standard rate of VAT of one percentage point, reducing it to 20% from 1 January 2001. This cut in VAT also reflects the valid concerns expressed about this country's competitive position in an age of e-commerce where differences in VAT rates between different trading partners will influence how successful we are in exploiting this new means of commerce.</P>
    <P>The Government expects to see the VAT reductions passed on to the consumer and not absorbed in higher retail margins. If this does not occur, the wisdom of further VAT cuts will be placed in doubt. We will be monitoring the situation and I hope consumers will be vigilant in seeing that the VAT reduction is passed on to them.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that a cut in VAT would reduce the retail price of cigarettes. I will, therefore, be adjusting the excise duty on tobacco to offset the VAT reduction and leave retail prices of tobacco unchanged. A number of calls have been made for tobacco to be excluded in calculating our inflation rate. I see merit in this proposition and I have asked my Department to examine the issue further with the Central Statistics Office.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Road Hauliers</i>I propose to cut the excise duty on auto-diesel by 6p per litre to just above the EU minimum rate, giving a VAT inclusive reduction of 7.3p per litre from midnight tonight. With the 1% VAT reduction in January, this will mean a cumulative tax reduction of 7.8p per litre in the new year on average auto-diesel prices. This will be of significant benefit to the haulage sector and to diesel users generally. The cut will ultimately feed through to the retail prices of all goods and services.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to encourage the use of lowsulphur diesel for environmental reasons. While the current excise reduction of 6p will apply to all <Col N="877" /> diesel for the present, I propose that in the future this lower rate will apply to low-sulphur diesel only. Such a differentiation in excise rates requires EU approval which my Department will be seeking in the near future.</P>
    <P>A number of non-tax measures to help the haulage sector are being undertaken. These include a significant increase of the Department of Public Enterprise's capacity to regulate and develop the road haulage industry. I am also providing additional funding for the Irish Road Haulage Association to enhance its professional service to its members.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Unleaded Petrol</i>I propose also to cut the excise duty on unleaded petrol by 2p per litre from midnight tonight, giving an immediate VAT inclusive reduction of 2.4p per litre in the price at the pump. With the VAT reduction of 1% in January this will mean an ultimate tax reduction of 3p per litre.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Hybrid Engine Technology</i>I am concerned also to encourage the use of the new hybrid engine technology in motor vehicles so as to help reduce emissions and conserve energy. I intend to provide in the Finance Bill that, for a period of two years, purchasers of any new vehicles fitted with hybrid engines would have 50% of the VRT which was paid refunded to them, on application to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>
      <i>CPI Impact</i>The full year cost of all VAT and excise measures is £349 million and, if passed on in full, will reduce the Consumer Price Index by 0.5%.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Savings Measures</i>Reducing inflation also means influencing the inflationary psychology. We need, therefore, a further weapon in our hands and this involves using the tax system to encourage consumers to save rather than spend, to create real wealth rather than to consume.</P>
    <P>I have already acted, to the discomfort of some, by cutting taxes on capital accumulation, by incentivising pension saving both through tax changes and by giving savers a greater choice and control over their nest eggs. Some of these measures were criticised at the time. The rationale behind them is now apparent. In the case of capital gains tax, the rate cut has brought the yield to about £600 million in this year alone &ndash; in 1997 the yield was £132 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Credit Unions</i>I was approached by the Irish League of Credit Unions recently regarding the taxation of credit union interest and dividends.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The league suggested a basis for a solution which meant that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="878" />&ndash;all credit union shareholders would have the option of maintaining the current tax status of their shareholdings;</P>
    <P>&ndash;interest on credit union deposits would be subject to DIRT at 20 per cent;</P>
    <P>&ndash;a new option would be provided for credit union shareholders to place shares in special credit union savings accounts which would be subject to DIRT at 20 per cent and</P>
    <P>&ndash;for members who placed their shares in new medium-term accounts for a minimum period of either three years or five years, a tax exemption would apply to the first £375 or £500 of dividend income per annum, respectively.</P>
    <P>The league has written to me stating that it has consulted widely within the movement and it is satisfied that there is a general acceptance of the proposals by the credit union movement. It has asked me to proceed with them in the budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Accordingly, I propose to legislate for this arrangement in the Finance Bill. The full details of the credit union scheme are set out in the summary of budget measures.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Other Deposit-Taking Institutions</i>I believe that the proposal to encourage medium-term savings by allowing a measure of tax free income is a useful one in the current economic climate and I would propose that it be extended to all other relevant deposit taking institutions. This will be discussed with the institutions concerned before the Finance Bill. I will also consider suggestions for further savings innovations before the Bill is enacted.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Life Assurance </i>I am also making two changes in the taxation arrangements for life assurance products. First, I am abolishing from 1 January next, the stamp duty of 0.1% on the value of life assurance policies. The annual cost to the Exchequer will be £20 million. Second, I am applying the same rate of tax to both Irish and certain foreign life assurance savings products. Further details are contained in the summary of budget measures. I will outline further general tax changes later in this statement.</P>
      <P>IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE</P>
      <P>In order to improve the quality of life of all Irish people, the Government is taking action on three fronts:</P>
      <P>by developing the physical infrastructure; </P>
      <P>by improving the standard of, and access to, public services and </P>
      <P>by taking a major initiative in relation to child support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="879" /> IMPROVING THE PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE</P>
    <P>This Government is improving our quality of life by enhancing our physical infrastructure. That is why almost £22 billion of the £40 billion national development plan is targeted at infrastructure needs. Exchequer capital spending will be increased next year by 23% over the 2000 Estimate to more than £4 billion. Overall by next year, Exchequer capital spending will have increased by 150 per cent since 1997.</P>
    <P>It is vital that the infrastructure programme of £22 billion in the plan is delivered in a cost effective and timely fashion. The Cabinet Sub-Committee on Infrastructure and Public Private Partnerships is actively engaged in this area and has already overseen the introduction of a number of initiatives to better assist efficient and effective delivery of key infrastructure projects.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Roads</i>We have set aside £6.3 billion for roads in the NDP. A total of £620 million is being provided for national road improvements in 2001, an increase of 26% on this year. This increase will facilitate further substantial upgrading of the network in line with plan commitments. We are also providing funding in the NDP for a special programme to facilitate non-national roads schemes supporting residential and other developments.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Transport </i>The NDP includes a provision of just over £2.25 billion for public transport infrastructure. This reflects a substantial increase on previous levels and will significantly enhance our public transport services. Total public capital programme spending in this area next year will be £420 million.</P>

      <P>This investment will ensure that projects in the NDP are progressed, including the Luas in Dublin and the railway safety programme nationwide.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Housing</i>This Government has put in place a broad range of measures to increase the supply of housing. Next year we will spend just over £1 billion in total on local authority social and affordable housing. We have seen clear positive results from the measures introduced. Housing output increased by 20% since 1997 to 46,500 housing starts last year. Average house price increases for the third quarter of 2000 are well down. Average prices for new houses in Dublin decreased in the third quarter by 2.3% on the previous quarter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of £346 million is being provided in 2001 for investment in water and sewerage ser<Col N="880" /> vices. I can also announce today that I am providing an additional £1.5 million for the housing management initiative which will improve the estate management of local authority housing.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Harbour Infrastructure</i>I am announcing today a significant programme of capital works, with an additional allocation of £11.5 million in 2001, to address infrastructural deficiencies around the coast which will promote socio-economic well being in peripheral coastal regions. This additional funding will assist the fishing industry by upgrading harbour infrastructure and allow for the exploitation of important marine tourism and leisure opportunities.</P>
    <P>I am also allocating an additional £4 million expenditure in 2001 to an Bord Iascaigh Mhara for the development of the sea fisheries sector.</P>
    <P>IMPROVING THE STANDARD OF SERVICES </P>
    <P>This Government has increased substantially the amounts spent on public services to improve standards. Taking account of the additional expenditure I am announcing today, by next year we will have increased net voted current spending by over 55% since 1997. This significant injection of funds goes a long way to ensuring that we have the resources needed to provide public services which are effective, efficient and of a high standard.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Education</i>We are committed to maintaining and improving all levels of our education system. Our actions have put this commitment into practice. This Government has invested heavily in our education system at all levels. The total spend provided in the Estimates for Education in 1997 was £2,111 million. The Estimates published last month will provide £3,524 million, up 67% in four years.</P>
    <P>
      <i>School Transport</i>I am today providing for a number of improvements to the school transport system, the main element of which is the introduction of a standard two mile qualifying distance for all primary children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This replaces the three mile eligibility threshold for primary children over ten years of age which has stood since the inception of the scheme. The other improvements to the scheme are listed in the summary of budget measures, as are a number of other improvements which I am funding in the education sector.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Health Services</i>I have drawn attention on a number of occasions to the extraordinary rate of increase in health spending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="881" /> I regularly hear claims despite this increase that the health services suffer from under-funding. Let me give some of the plain facts which refute this. Current numbers employed in the health services stand at some 80,000 compared to less than 59,000 in 1990. There are now 540,000 admissions to in-patient care every year, and day cases have doubled since 1992 to 300,000 annually. There are also about 2 million outpatient attendances and 1.25 million accident and emergency visits.</P>
    <P>In the expenditure Estimates last month I provided for gross expenditure of £5,015 million in 2001 in the Health and Children Vote. A Supplementary Estimate for 2000, which I have approved, will require that figure to be increased by a further £89 million. I am today announcing a further increase of £195 million, which will bring the total for 2001 to £5,299 million. The contrast with the 1997 Estimate of £2,754 million speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>This development funding covers a wide range of health programmes, including services for older people, physical and intellectual disability, child welfare and mental health. Acute hospital services will receive extra funding for a number of priority measures, including waiting lists, bed capacity and the cancer strategy. Full details are set out in the summary of budget measures.</P>
    <P>Addressing health problems, and indeed all aspects of public expenditure, is not simply a matter of additional resources. We must assure ourselves that we are getting the best value from existing expenditure. Consultants were appointed last May to carry out a comprehensive value for money audit of the health services. I look forward to their recommendations in the spring on the development of a management information system for the health services. For the same reason, the management reforms in the Civil Service will place a greater emphasis on the outputs achieved by public spending programmes than has been the practice to date.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Medical Cards for Older People</i>In my 1999 budget, I announced that the income limits for medical cards for people aged 70 years or over would be doubled over three years, commencing in 1999. That process will be completed next March, and it is now proposed to take the next step. I am pleased to announce that, from 1 July 2001, entitlement to the medical card is being extended to all those aged 70 years or over.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Intellectual Disability</i>The Government gave a commitment in 1999 <Col N="882" /> to meet the identified needs of those with intellectual disability within a three year timeframe. A great deal of progress had been made, with substantial additional service funding up to the end of 1999, but the level of unmet need remained unacceptably high and we were determined to address the issue. In last year's budget, I commenced the process by allocating significant extra funds to enhance the overall level of residential, day and respite services throughout the country. This year, I am providing an extra £28 million for the coming year, and £35 million in a full year to help meet our targets. This will bring the overall level of spending on these services to about £450 million next year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Other Services for the Disabled</i>I will refer later to improvements in social welfare services for the disabled. Last June, the Government completed the mainstreaming of the disability services of the National Rehabilitation Board into the relevant Departments and agencies and additional resources have been allocated to bodies such as FÁS, Comhairle and the national educational psychological service for next year to enable them to carry out their added responsibilities.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government is making very considerable progress in upgrading transport services for the benefit of this group; a further 140 wheelchair-accessible buses are due for delivery to Dublin Bus in the coming months; new wheelchair-accessible DART and Arrow rail cars are being commissioned; and by the end of next year it is expected that Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford will have fully wheelchair-accessible bus fleets. I am also increasing the maximum grant under the disabled person's housing grant scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Screening for Breast and Cervical Cancer</i>Pilot programmes for breast screening and cervical screening have already begun. Because of the complexity of the screening process and the crucial need to meet quality assurance requirements, it is necessary to proceed on a phased basis. We must also, of course, ensure that treatment capacity is in place to address the new cases that will inevitably be identified. To secure these objectives, I am providing an additional £1.5 million to the breast screening-treatment programme next year. Our aim is to ensure that women at risk will have an entitlement to free screening throughout the State.</P>
    <P>Hospital cancer services are also being given priority, with an extra £13.5 million next year, rising to £24.5 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>CHILDREN</P>
    <P>In the PPF, we recognised the importance of policies to support children and family-friendly life. The Government and society values the role of those working in the home who are looking after others. Today I am announcing a major initiative in relation to children which goes well <Col N="883" /> beyond what the PPF would have involved. The measures which I will now outline amount to the largest ever package of supports for children and their parents. Last month, we published Ireland's first ever national children's strategy. This strategy has been welcomed both here and abroad as marking a major move forward in public policy.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Child Care</i>The Government has put in place a wide range of measures to increase the supply of child care places in all parts of the country. The national development plan includes £250 million for child care and the Government subsequently allocated a further £40 million for this purpose. To facilitate early action, this spending is being front-loaded through the allocation of £104 million in the Estimates for next year.</P>
    <P>There is a very substantial increase in the allocation to the lead Department, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, from £20 million this year to £74 million next year for the expansion of the programmes already in place: capital grants for commercial crèches and for community-based child care facilities; staffing grants for community-based projects; and a national childminders' initiative. The balance of the £104 million allocation is for a number of Departments to fund: the use of spare classrooms for child care; a national after-school initiative; child care employment grants; and the provision of child care in local authority developments.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Child Support</i>The House will be well aware of the great diversity of views that are held in relation to addressing the child care issue. The Government's core objective is to provide support which will offer real choice to parents and will benefit all our children. This we can do through child benefit. I am pleased to announce, therefore, that the child benefit rates for first and second children are being increased by £25 to £67.50 per month and by £30 to £86 per month for third and subsequent children. The new rates will be payable from next June, which is three months earlier than usual. This increase of over 50% in current payment rates marks the first step in a three year programme.</P>
    <P>At the end of this process, an additional £1 billion will have been invested directly in our children's wellbeing. Child benefit monthly payments will stand at £117.50 and £146, well beyond the PPF commitments. This will mean up to £90 per month extra for each child at the end of three years. By then, a family with four children will be receiving the equivalent of over £120 per week in child benefit support.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This unprecedented increase will help all parents with the costs of caring for their children and will represent a major move <Col N="884" /> towards achieving the goal of ending child poverty in this country.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Maternity Protection and Parental Leave</i>The Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium committed us to improve maternity protection legislation as a key component in the development of equality for women. In that regard, I am today announcing a four week extension of the period of paid maternity and adoptive leave to 18 weeks at an estimated cost of about £20 million in a full year. In addition, the period of unpaid leave will be doubled from its current level to eight weeks. This means that, from early April next, a mother can take up to six months leave in the period around the birth or adoption of her child. During the coming year, it is proposed to advance the promised review of the parental leave legislation with a view to the improvement of the arrangements in this area.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Employers and Child Care</i>In previous budgets I introduced a number of changes to tax law aimed at encouraging the increased supply of child care facilities and these are having an effect. The exemption from benefit-in-kind for employer-provided child care should also help supply. I will, however, be discussing with employer bodies how the rules for this scheme might be modified to secure further increased provision of child care facilities at a reasonable tax cost to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Government is conscious of its responsibilities as the largest employer in the country. I am, therefore, providing for the introduction of a major Civil Service child care initiative. This entails establishing crèches for the children of those working in Departments. It is also the intention to pursue this approach in the context of the decentralisation policy.</P>
      <P>I am allocating £10 million capital over two years to allow for the provision of 15 Civil Service crèches over the next two years. I intend that other public service employers would also adopt a similar approach in this area.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Child Care Support Structures</i>To increase the level of practical supports for child care providers and to underpin a greater emphasis on the quality of provision, I am providing for the recruitment of additional child care support staff throughout the health board system at a full year cost of £1.2 million to operate a voluntary notification system for childminders. Additional funding is being allocated to FÁS for the training of extra child care workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Foster Care</i>The Government recognises the immense contribution to society made by families which offer a home and support to vulnerable children through fostering. I am, therefore, providing an additional £9 million in the context of restructuring the existing payments and support systems. I am also amending the capital acquisitions tax <Col N="885" /> rules to give foster children similar rights to other children.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Sport</i>Sport can play an important role in combating social exclusion and in personal and community development. To meet the plans of the Irish Sports Council, the Government intends to double the council's annual budget over the next four years to £20 million. As a first step, I am now allocating an extra £2.5 million next year to the Football Association of Ireland and the other relevant sports governing bodies. The details are set out in the summary of budget measures. In addition, I am providing a further £2.5 million to encourage greater under-age participation in major field sports and £0.5 million for the promotion of a healthy and active lifestyle among older people.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Drugs </i>The Government is committed to combating drug addiction. On this occasion, I am providing an additional £2 million for the national drugs strategy, over and above the £15 million already allocated in the Estimates. This funding will ensure that the new action plans emanating from those areas worst affected by the drug problem can be put in place as soon as they are ready. I am adding £5 million to the Health and Children Vote for the expansion of the drug treatment and rehabilitation services. In addition, I am allocating £10 million over the next three years for the accommodation requirements of community based projects, starting with £3 million next year. The additional funding confirms the Government's continued commitment to the national drugs strategy and will provide an important impetus for the new strategy which will be launched in the new year.</P>
    <P>A FAIRER SOCIETY</P>
    <P>The third aim for this budget is to promote a fairer society. This is one of the Government's core objectives and one of the aims of the PPF. The social inclusion agenda of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness sets out the key objectives and necessary actions to achieve a fairer and more inclusive Ireland, through expending an additional £1.5 billion over three years on social inclusion.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Opportunity to Work through Training</i>In a fair society everyone should have the opportunity to work and to acquire work skills through training. The national development plan includes £10 billion, or one quarter of its funds, for employment and human resources programmes. By next year the Government will have increased spending on training to £220 million &ndash; almost 65% higher than in 1997. We will have also increased the numbers of apprentices being trained by almost five times to 25,000. The National Training Fund which I announced in the budget last year will play its part in this. This <Col N="886" /> innovative measure allows the State and employers to work together in this area.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Welfare</i>Today's social welfare improvements will cost an estimated £850 million in a full year. The 1997 budget equivalent was £215 million. Last year's figure was £400 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Payment Date</i>I am keeping the promise made in my first budget to bring forward the payment date for weekly social welfare increases to coincide with the beginning of the tax year. In 1997 the weekly social welfare increases were paid in June. The 2001 increases will be paid in April, the beginning of the income tax year, which is four weeks earlier than in 2000. Moreover, I have already decided that, from 2002, the increases will apply from January when the tax and calendar years are being aligned.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Older People/Old Age Pensions</i>This Government has made income support for pensioners a priority. Pension rates were increased by a total of £18 per week in my first three budgets. Today, I am increasing the full personal rate of old age and related pensions by a further £10 per week or by up to 11.5%. This will bring the rate of the old age contributory pension to £106 per week. In addition, in an initiative which will be of major benefit to pensioner couples, I am beginning a phased increase in the qualified adult allowance for those aged 66 years and over to bring them up to the old age non-contributory pension rate. As a result of these changes, a full rate old age contributory pensioner couple, both aged 66 or over, will receive an increase of £25 per week next year, bringing their combined weekly payment to £185.60, or £52.20 per week more than in 1997. No one can say that this Government does not recognise and appreciate the part played by the workers of yesterday in laying the foundation for so much of our current economic success.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Welfare Weekly Payments and Qualified Adult Allowances </i>Social welfare recipients will have their living standards protected and improved by the increase of £8 per week, which I am announcing. This is double the increase paid in 2000 and is equivalent to 10.5% on the lowest rates. Last year, I signalled that the qualified adult allowance would, in general, be increased over a three year period to 70% of the personal rate. In the second stage of this move, these allowances will be increased by a minimum of £7 per week. Thus, from next April, couples on full rate social welfare payments will receive an increase of at least £15 per week. Families with children will also benefit from the very considerable child benefit improvements which I have already announced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="887" />
      <i>Incentives and Employment Supports</i>In order to maintain the incentive to work, the income thresholds for the family income supplement are being increased by £25 per week from next April. This will result in average payments of £56 per week for existing recipients. A range of extensions and improvements are also being made to various employment support schemes designed to facilitate the ending of welfare dependency among disadvantaged groups.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Widows</i>Up to this, the contributory pension for widows aged 66 years and over has been lower than the old age contributory pension rate. I have decided to eliminate this gap over a two year period commencing next year. As a result, the widows in question will receive a special weekly increase bringing the widows contributory pension to £102 &ndash; a total increase next year of £12.90.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Disability</i>Persons with disability deserve particular consideration. Accordingly, I am extending eligibility for the living alone allowance to all qualifying recipients of invalidity pension, disability allowance, unemployability supplement and blind persons pension. As a special measure, I am also removing the limitation whereby only a reduced rate disability allowance is paid where the person's partner is in receipt of any other social welfare payment.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Free Schemes</i>Last year, the social welfare free schemes were made available to all those aged 75 years and over irrespective of income or household composition. I am now extending such availability to all those aged 70 years and over from next May. More than 40,000 households are expected to benefit from this change. Those over 70 will also benefit from the medical card changes already announced.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Fuel Allowance</i>I am extending by three weeks the period during which the fuel allowance is payable. From now on, the allowance will be payable from the first week in October until late April.</P>

    <P>
      <i>Carers</i>In recognition of the important role they perform, recent budgets have contained many improvements in the supports available to carers. On this occasion, I propose to grant a very significant relaxation in the income disregards which apply in relation to the means test for carer's allowance. Details of this change are outlined in the summary of budget measures. This will <Col N="888" /> increase the numbers who will qualify for the allowance by some 5,000 as well as benefiting many current recipients. In addition, the annual respite care payment will be increased to £400, with a double payment applying where a recipient is caring for more than one person.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Other Social Welfare Improvements</i>The summary also contains a range of other social welfare improvements, full details of which will be announced by my colleague the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Homelessness</i>The Government is determined to tackle the problem of homelessness in a concerted and coherent manner. Capital funding is being doubled from £20 million to £40 million over the next five years to provide additional accommodation for homeless persons, particularly transitional accommodation to facilitate moving out of emergency accommodation. An additional £6 million current funding a year is being made available to local authorities to fund increased subventions for hostel accommodation.</P>
    <P>TAX REFORM</P>
    <P>The fourth and final objective of this budget is to reward work and enterprise by continuing our programme of tax reform.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Income Tax </i>Tax reform is also a matter of fairness. I have in my first three budgets made radical reforms to the whole tax system. I have made the income tax system inherently fairer by introducing tax credits. I have cut tax rates to improve the incentive to work and contribute to the development of the economy. I have removed substantial numbers from the top tax rate and, for the first time in many years, ensured single earners on the average industrial wage and others on modest incomes no longer face the top rate of income tax.</P>
    <P>I have also radically improved the position of the lower paid in the tax system. To listen to some commentators, one would believe that all the gains from tax reform have accrued to those they like to call high earners. Let me set the record straight. The Government's achievements in assisting the low paid in the tax system are second to none. In the past three years I have removed 176,000 low income earners from the tax net; cut the burden on the lower paid in half; reduced the tax rate on the low paid in many cases by up to 10 percentage points or more, and done far more than in many other advanced economies in cutting taxes on single and married earners on low and middle earnings.</P>
    <P>These facts are recognised by international commentators. A recent European Commission report praised our progress in this regard, which is ahead of most other countries. I have pursued <Col N="889" /> a consistent and balanced course and delivered on what the electorate was promised.</P>
    <P>In this budget I will follow the path laid out and marked clearly in advance by me. The personal tax reductions I am about to announce will benefit taxpayers by £1,231 million or nearly three times the amount we promised under the PPF for this year. I am happy to be able to do this and to acknowledge the policy input of the social partners in this regard.</P>
    <P>Before announcing the details, I should remind the House that the next tax year will be a short one running from 6 April to 31 December 2001 to accommodate the introduction of the calendar-based tax year from 1 January 2002. In addition, we will complete the move to tax credits. The changes, which I will give in terms of full year amounts for the sake of comparison with this tax year, must be converted into nine month equivalents. The relevant details are set out in the tables in the Summary of 2001 Budget Measures. The tables also give amounts in euro. As the House will be aware, euro notes and coins&mdash;</P>

        <i>Increases in Tax Allowances</i>Since the Government came into office we have increased the entry point to the income tax system from £77 per week to £110 per week. I am proposing to increase this entry point to £144 per week by increasing the basic personal allowances by £800 for a single person and £1,600 for a married couple to £5,500 and £11,000 per annum, respectively, and by increasing the PAYE allowance from £1,000 to £2,000 per annum. These measures and those for the aged which I will come to shortly, will remove 133,000 taxpayers from the tax net. This is more than three-quarters of the total who were exempted in the past three years.</P>

These are hardly the wealthier part of our community, for whom high marginal tax rates are usually reserved.

      <P>
        <i>Income Tax Rates</i>The marginal rate at which tax is paid has an effect on the incentive to work. Clearly, we should seek to reduce the disincentive effect of tax rates in a manner that includes all taxpayers, more than 500,000 of whom now pay tax at the higher rate. The Government has decided, therefore, to reduce the standard rate and the higher rate of income tax by 2 percentage points in each case, that is, from 22% to 20% </P>

      <P>
        <i>Distribution of Income Earners</i>As a result of these changes, the percentage of income earners in the tax exempt category will be 38%, those on marginal relief will represent less than 1% and those on the standard rate and top rate 39% and 23%, respectively. For the benefit of Deputy Yates, there will, therefore, be 668,000 persons in the tax system who will be exempt from paying tax altogether.</P>

      <Col N="891" />
      <i>Reform of PRSI and Levies</i>In my last budget I announced that it was my intention to address the whole area of PRSI and levies in my next budget to see if I could rationalise the current complex structure of different allowances, thresholds, rates and ceilings. As a first step in this reform, I propose to make a number of changes this year. Apart from employer PRSI, which I will come to later, the changes relate to the self-employed and full-rate employee categories.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided that the PRSI income ceiling for the self-employed and proprietary directors should be removed and that the contribution rate for this category should be reduced from 5% to 3%. We are also abolishing the PRSI free allowance of £1,040 per annum for the self-employed and reducing the minimum payment to £200 per annum. Most of the additional revenue from removing the ceiling comes from those earning £100,000 per annum or more. Allowing for the reduction in the rate on existing contributions and other adjustments, the net yield from the changes is £21 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The ceiling for employee PRSI contributions is being increased from £26,500 to £28,250 per annum, which reflects the normal earnings-related increase as was assumed in the Estimates. In addition, I have decided to reduce the Class A contribution rate paid by most employees from 4.5% to 4%. This will cost some £63 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Total Cost</i>The full year cost of these personal tax and PRSI changes in this budget is £1,231 million, of which £540 million represents changes to allowances, £278 million to bands, £371 million to rates, and £42 million to PRSI.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Increases in Disposable Earnings</i>The Government has ensured that through social partnership, workers living standards have been raised substantially. Compared with last year, a single worker on the estimated average industrial wage has £1,602 more in his or her pocket in a full year due to wage increases and tax reductions in my last budget. This overall increase represents a 13% increase for that workers disposable earnings on last year. This is more than double the average inflation rate this year of 5.5%.</P>
    <P>After todays budget, this worker next year will not only receive a further 5.5% from the second phase of the PPF, and an additional 2% as a result of the adjustments agreed on 4 December, but will benefit from tax reductions in this budget to give a total increase in disposable income next year of 13.5%.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tax Relief for the Elderly</i>The Government is committed to reducing the tax burden on the elderly. I am therefore increas<Col N="892" /> ing the income tax exemption limits by £1,000 for a single person and £2,000 for a married couple. This means that since I took office the exemption limits for the aged have been increased by up to 85%.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Planning for Future Care Needs</i>In line with what I have done on pension reform, I also favour providing tax relief at the standard rate for premia on insurance products geared at providing for future care needs, with any stream of income in the future being taxable. Discussions will take place with the insurance industry before the Finance Bill to see if we can develop an appropriate scheme to provide for such specific and ring-fenced products. This will also contribute to the overall strategy of encouraging savings and providing for real future needs.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Medical Expenses Relief</i>Medical expenses relief currently can be claimed only in respect of a relative where the claimant qualifies for a dependent relative allowance. I will be changing the rules to allow people to claim medical expenses relief where they are paying on behalf of a dependent relative whether they qualify for the dependent relative allowance. I am also removing the existing restriction on relief for routine maternity care. Where a person is employed to care for a family member who is incapacitated, a carer's allowance is claimable. The amount allowable was last increased to £8,500 in budget 1998. I propose to increase it to £10,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Corporation Tax</i>As part of the move to a single standard corporation tax rate of 12.5%, the rate of corporation tax which will apply from 1 January 2001 will be 20% on trading income as provided for in the Finance Act, 1999. Last year in order to assist small and medium sized firms, I decided that the prospective 12.5% rate of tax should apply from 1 January 2000 to the trading income of a company where that trading income does not exceed £50,000 per annum. I propose to increase this ceiling from 1 January 2001 to £200,000 trading income per annum. This means that only just over 13% of companies liable for tax will now pay at the standard rate. The total cost of both changes is £214 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Stock Valuation at Discontinuance of Trading</i>I have recently been informed of a tax avoidance scheme based on a loophole in relation to valuation of stock at discontinuance of trading. The 2001 Finance Bill will contain provisions aimed at closing off this loophole with effect on and from today. The details of these provisions are contained in the summary of budget measures.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Allowances</i>Capital allowances for plant and machinery apply on a straight line basis over a seven year <Col N="893" /> time period. I now propose to reduce this to five years from 1 January next. Motor vehicles have historically been excluded from the seven year straight line system. They will now be included in the five year straight line system. The car value threshold for both new and secondhand cars will also be increased to £17,000. This move will benefit the business sector as a whole including the self employed sector. It will result in a substantial cash flow loss to the Exchequer of up to £140 million in the next few years.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Employer PRSI</i>The employer PRSI contribution ceiling now stands at £36,600 and was assumed to increase to £39,000 in the Estimates. In line with the reform of the self-employed ceiling which has already been mentioned, the Government has decided that this ceiling should be abolished. Over and above the Estimates decision, this measure will bring in £159 million in PRSI in a full year as well as an additional £10 million for the national training fund.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Social Insurance Fund</i>Thanks to the strong economic performance of recent years and the reforms proposed, the social insurance fund is in a healthy financial situation; moreover, on the basis of current forecasts, this position is projected to strengthen further in the immediate years ahead. It is important, of course, that the fund's surplus should be used to best advantage, having regard to emerging demands and the overall interests of its contributors. Accordingly, I propose, in consultation with the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, to have an early examination of possible strategies in this regard.</P>
      <P>
        <i>BES and Seed Capital Scheme</i>The business expansion and seed capital schemes are due to lapse on 5 April 2001. I propose to renew these schemes to the end of 2001 while a review is carried out by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on their continued effectiveness. I also propose to recognise county enterprise boards for the purpose of certifying suitable projects under the schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Farmer Taxation</i>Turning to farmer taxation, I am proposing a number of tax incentives in this area which are aimed at promoting increased farm investment. <Col N="894" /> First, farmers like other business sectors will gain from the general increase in the annual capital allowances for investment in plant and machinery from 15% to 20%. Second, I am proposing to renew both the general 25% stock relief and the special 100% stock relief for certain young trained farmers for a further two years from 6 April 2001, subject to conformity with EU State aid rules. Third, I am extending the time period for reinvestment for roll over relief for capital gains tax purposes, where farmland is the subject of a compulsory purchase order for road building. The details are contained in the summary of budget measures. Finally, the flat rate of VAT charged by unregistered farmers to registered traders and the associated VAT rate for livestock will be increased to 4.3% from 1 January.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Probate Tax</i>Probate tax was introduced in 1993 as a limited revenue raising measure to compensate for the low yield from taxes on capital generally. I have always held it to be an invidious tax, penalising small legacies unduly. Over the years its scope was narrowed because of its wide and sometimes harsh effect. I increased the exemption threshold last year from £10,000 to £40,000 but this year I have decided to abolish the tax fully at a cost of almost £30 million in a full year to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Rented Sector Reliefs</i>A commission was established last year to examine the rented housing sector and to make recommendations to improve its operation. The Government is considering the report of the commission and its recommendations will be examined for the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Rent a Room</i>There are many homes where the possibility exists of spare accommodation being rented out. A barrier is often the fact that such income is taxable. I am providing that gross rental income of up to £6,000 per annum from the provision of residential accommodation in a person's principal private residence will be exempt from tax. Where an individual claims this relief, mortgage interest relief, the capital gains tax relief on one's principal private residence and the stamp duty relief on owner occupied residences will continue to apply.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Rent Relief</i>I am conscious of the impact on some tenants of the increasing cost of rent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Currently, rent relief allowed for under 55s is significantly less than for the over 55s. I am therefore increasing the rent allowable for under 55s from £750 per annum to £1,000 per annum for a single person and from £1,500 to £2,000 in the case of a married couple. In the case of widowed persons I will be increasing the rate <Col N="895" /> of relief for widowed persons to the married rate in all cases.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Trade Unions</i>I have received strong representations from ICTU and individual trade unions for tax relief on trade union subscriptions. Having considered the case and in recognition of the role of trade unions I propose to provide a flat rate allowance of £100 at the standard rate of tax in respect of trade union subscriptions. The sum of £100 is roughly the amount most members pay each year.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Gainsharing, Profit Sharing and Share Options</i>Giving employees a stake in their company or organisation's future is an important way of recognising and rewarding work and effort. There are a number of schemes already applying in this area. A consultative committee established under the PPF has been examining the potential for encouraging gainsharing, profit sharing and share option schemes by the provision of favourable tax treatment and I will give careful consideration to the outcome of these discussions in that context. I will consider these matters further for the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Major Changes in Tax Administration</i>This is a time of major change in tax administration. By April next, the changeover to the more equitable system of tax credits will be completed and the process of moving the income tax year into line with the calendar year will begin. Of course, from January 2002, all taxes will be paid in euro.</P>
      <P>I would like at this point to pay my own personal compliment to the management and staff of the Revenue Commissioners at all levels who managed under great pressure and with little advance notice to implement the major reforms of the income tax system which I have made over the past two years. The dedication and expertise of the Revenue Commissioners in coping with this challenge is highly commendable.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Other Taxation Measures</i>I have further measures in mind to rationalise the tax system.</P>

    <P>In the context of rationalising existing tax <Col N="896" /> reliefs, I will also examine before the Finance Bill the myriad of tax reliefs for donations of various types to different causes to see if we can come up with a more sensible and coherent system to encourage more gifts for genuinely good causes. A number of further tax measures not specifically mentioned in my statement are set out in the summary of budget measures.</P>

    <P>Note that figures may not add due to rounding</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notes to Table 1</i>Note 1.The projections reflect:</P>
    <P>(a)the impact of the measures announced in Budget 2001;</P>
    <P>(b)technical provisions under the expenditure and tax headings for possible future budgets, with full year costs of £1.3 billion in 2002 and £1.2 billion in 2003 in respect of changes in tax and gross current expenditure which include the changes indicated in Budget 2001 for those years. The level of these changes will be subject to review in light of emerging economic conditions.</P>
    <P>(c)unchanged interest rates;</P>
    <P>(d)the cost of reducing Corporation Tax rates by 4 percentage points in 2002 and 3.5 percentage points in 2003;</P>
    <P>(e)a decrease in Capital Services Redemption Account assets of £400 million in 2001 and £230 million in 2002. The estimate for the 2000 outturn for non-voted current expenditure includes a payment of £178 million into the Capital Services Redemption Account in 2000.</P>
    <P>Note 2.Appropriations-in-Aid are Departmental receipts which, with the approval of the Dáil, may be retained by a Department or Office to offset expenses instead of being paid into the Exchequer Account of the Central Fund. Details of gross voted Departmental expenditure are contained in the Estimates for Public Services. PRSI receipts accrue to the Social Insurance Fund.</P>
    <P>Note 3.Departmental balances are those amounts issued from the Exchequer Account of the Central Fund for Departmental spending in one year which remain unspent at year-end and are carried forward to be used in the next year.</P>
    <P>Note 4.This includes the annual set-aside of at least 1% of GNP for the pre-funding of part of the future cost of social welfare and public service pensions and in addition, receipts arising in 2000 from the sale of Telecom Eireann which were assigned to pre-funding.</P>
    <P>Note 5.The 2000 figure excludes the repayment of a loan of £100 million by the Insurance Compensation Fund. This loan was made to the Insurance Compensation Fund in 1985 for a 15 year term.</P>
    <P>Note 6.This is a contingency provision against all budgetary costs which cannot be quantified at this stage.</P>
    <P>Note 7.The 2000 outturn estimates are identical to the White Paper figures except in the case of (1) Tax Revenue which is £8 million lower due to the change in Excise receipts as a consequence of the Budget changes and (2) an outturn for voted capital which is £39 million lower than the White Paper figure.</P>
    <P>Note 8.The figures for GDP and GGB values are the ESA 95 equivalent.</P>

    <P>(a)The above figures for 2002 and 2003 are National Prices Commission projections of the post-Budget 2000 figures (as set out in Table 5) and are consistent with the Exchequer Capital expenditure portion of the allocations in the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>

    <P Just="Center">Explanation of net difference between Exchequer Surplus and General Government Surplus</P>
    <P>The Exchequer Surplus is the traditional domestic budgetary aggregate which measures Central Government's net surplus or borrowing position. It is the difference between total receipts into and total expenditure out of the Exchequer Account of the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>The General Government Balance (GGB) measures fiscal performance of all arms of Government, i.e. Central Government, Local Authorities, Health Boards, Vocational Education Committees and non-commercial State sponsored bodies, as well as Funds such as the Social Insurance Fund which are managed by Central Government Departments. It thus provides an assessment of the fiscal performance of a more complete &ldquo;government&rdquo; sector.</P>
    <P>The GGB does not reflect the position of commercial State sponsored bodies as these agencies are classified as being outside the General Government Sector.</P>
    <P>The GGB is calculated in accordance with ESA95, a consistent standard developed by the EU to facilitate budgetary comparisons between EU Member States in accordance with their obligations under the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>Details of the variation between the Exchequer Balance and the GGB are set out in the table below.</P>

    <P>(a)This adjustment reflects the requirement, under ESA95 rules, that changes in the assets of the Capital Services Redemption Account and capital gains or losses on foreign exchange contracts, swaps, etc., should be excluded from the interest to be recorded for the purpose of calculating the GGB.</P>
    <P>(b)Equity and loan transactions are excluded from the GGB on the basis that they affect the composition but not the level of assets and liabilities. The proceeds from the sale of shares in Eircom (formerly Telecom Éireann) does not affect the GGB as this is treated as a financial transaction under ESA conventions and is not counted as income of the General Government Sector.</P>
    <P>(c)Transfers between units within the General Government Sector do not affect the GGB.</P>
    <P>(d)The Temporary Holding Fund and the National Pensions Reserve Fund (to be established in 2001) are part of the General Government Sector and transactions within the Sector do not impact on the GGB. These figures include the contributions paid from the Exchequer and a provision for interest earnings by the funds.</P>
    <P>(e)This adjustment is required in respect of certain transactions recorded on an accruals basis in calculating the GGB. The main adjustments are in respect of Value Added Tax receipts and Departmental Balances.</P>

    <P>(a)This table shows the effects of the implementation of the Budget day measures on the pre-Budgetary position shown in the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure.</P>
    <P>(b)The Budget Measures have an impact on the economy with changes in consumption and investment patterns etc. leading to estimated additional tax buoyancy of £791 million.</P>
    <P>(c)This figure reflects the technical adjustments to the Health and Children Vote.</P>
    <P>(d)The full Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs expenditure in respect of the social welfare package in this Budget is £850 million. In the year 2001, the total gross cost of the package is £587 million of which £384 million is funded from the Exchequer and £203 million is met from the Social Insurance Fund.</P>
    <P>(e)Departmental balances are those amounts issued from the Central Fund for Departmental spending in one year which remain unspent at year-end and are carried forward to be used in the next year. They have no effect on Departmental spending which is governed by the allocation in the Estimates for Public Services.</P>

    <P>Note that figures may not add due to rounding.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notes to Table 1</i>Note 1.The projections reflect:</P>
    <P>(a)the impact of the measures announced in Budget 2001;</P>
    <P>(b)technical provisions under the expenditure and tax headings for possible future budgets, with full year costs of 1.7 billion in 2002 and 1.5 billion in 2003 in respect of changes in tax and gross current expenditure which include the changes indicated in Budget 2001 for those years. The level of these changes will be subject to review in light of emerging future economic conditions.</P>
    <P>(c)unchanged interest rates;</P>
    <P>(d)the cost of reducing Corporation Tax rates by 4 percentage points in 2002 and 3.5 percentage points in 2003;</P>
    <P>(e)a decrease in Capital Services Redemption Account assets of 508 million in 2001 and £292 million in 2002. The estimate for the 2000 outturn for non-voted current expenditure includes a payment of 226 million into the Capital Services Redemption Account in 2000.</P>
    <P>Note 2.Appropriations-in-Aid are Departmental receipts which, with the approval of the Dáil, may be retained by a Department or Office to offset expenses instead of being paid into the Exchequer Account of the Central Fund. Details of gross voted Departmental expenditure are contained in the Estimates for Public Services. PRSI receipts accrue to the Social Insurance Fund.</P>
    <P>Note 3.Departmental balances are those amounts issued from the Exchequer Account of the Central Fund for Departmental spending in one year which remain unspent at year-end and are carried forward to be used in the next year.</P>
    <P>Note 4.This includes the annual set-aside of at least 1% of GNP for the pre-funding of part of the future cost of social welfare and public service pensions and in addition, receipts arising in 2000 from the sale of Telecom Éireann which were assigned to pre-funding.</P>
    <P>Note 5.The 2000 figure excludes the repayment of a loan of 127 million by the Insurance Compensation Fund. This loan was made to the Insurance Compensation Fund in 1985 for a 15 year term.</P>
    <P>Note 6.This is a contingency provision against all budgetary costs which cannot be quantified at this stage.</P>
    <P>Note 7.The 2000 outturn estimates are identical to the White Paper figures except in the case of (1) Tax Revenue which is 10 million lower due to the change in Excise receipts as a consequence of the Budget changes and (2) an outturn for voted capital which is 49 million lower than the White Paper figure.</P>
    <P>Note 8.The figures for GDP and GGB values are the ESA 95 equivalent.</P>

    <P>With the introduction of the new Local Government Fund in 1999, 310 million is included in the 2001 Estimates which is not included in 1998 and earlier years. To allow a proper assessment of the annual average increase in current expenditure, 310 million must be removed from the 2001 figures.</P>

    <P>(a)The above figures for 2002 and 2003 are National Prices Commission projections of the post-Budget 2000 figures (as set out in Table 5) and are consistent with the Exchequer Capital expenditure portion of the allocations in the National Development Plan 2000-2006. It is expected that other non-Exchequer sources of finance (e.g. PPP) will be available to finance NDP. It is anticipated that PPP spending will be accelerated in 2003.</P>

    <P Just="Center">Explanation of net difference between Exchequer Surplus and General Government Surplus</P>
    <P>The Exchequer Surplus is the traditional domestic budgetary aggregate which measures Central Government's net surplus or borrowing position. It is the difference between total receipts into and total expenditure out of the Exchequer Account of the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>The General Government Balance (GGB) measures fiscal performance of all arms of Government, i.e. Central Government, Local Authorities, Health Boards, Vocational Education Committees and non-commercial State sponsored bodies, as well as Funds such as the Social Insurance Fund which are managed by Central Government Departments. It thus provides an accurate assessment of the fiscal performance of a more complete &ldquo;government&rdquo; sector.</P>
    <P>The GGB does not reflect the position of commercial State sponsored bodies as these agencies are classified as being outside the General Government Sector.</P>
    <P>The GGB is calculated in accordance with ESA95, a consistent standard, developed by the EU to facilitate budgetary comparisons between EU Member States in accordance with their obligations under the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>Details of the variation between the Exchequer Balance and the GGB are set out in the table below.</P>

    <P>(a)This adjustment reflects the requirement, under ESA95 rules, that changes in the assets of the Capital Services Redemption Account and capital gains or losses on foreign exchange contracts, swaps, etc, should be excluded from the interest to be recorded for the purpose of calculating the GGB.</P>
    <P>(b)Equity and loan transactions are excluded from the GGB on the basis that they affect the composition but not the level of assets and liabilities. The proceeds from the sale of shares in Eircom (formerly Telecom Eireann)  does not affect the GGB as this is treated as a financial transaction under ESA conventions and is not counted as income of the General Government Sector.</P>
    <P>(c)Transfers between units within the General Government Sector do not affect the GGB.</P>
    <P>(d)The Temporary Holding Fund and the National Pensions Reserve Fund (to be established in 2001) are part of the General Government Sector and transactions within the Sector do not impact on the GGB. These figures include the contributions paid from the Exchequer and a provision for interest earnings by the funds.</P>
    <P>(e)This adjustment is required in respect of certain transactions recorded on an accruals basis in calculating the GGB. The main adjustments are in respect of Value Added Tax receipts and Departmental Balances.</P>

    <P>(a)This table shows the effects of the implementation of the Budget day measures on the pre-Budgetary position shown in the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure.</P>
    <P>(b)The Budget Measures have an impact on the economy with changes in consumption and investment patterns etc. leading to estimated additional tax buoyancy of 1,004million.</P>
    <P>(c)This figure reflects the technical adjustments to the Health and Children Vote.</P>
    <P>(d)The full Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs expenditure in respect of the social welfare package in this Budget is 1,079 million. In the year 2001, the total gross cost of the package is 745 million of which 488 million is funded from the Exchequer and 258 million is met from the Social Insurance Fund.</P>
    <P>(e)Departmental balances are those amounts issued from the Central Fund for Departmental spending in one year which remain unspent at year-end and are carried forward to be used in the next year. They have no effect on Departmental spending which is governed by the allocation in the Estimates for Public Service.</P>

      <P>Many of us think the leaks were more interesting than the budget. They certainly went farther. Many people listening to the Minister on radio or watching him on television know that when Governments run surpluses, they take in more in taxation than they need for the day to day spending to run the country. What most people will say after hearing the Minister is that they are getting back some of their own, they are getting back some of the taxes they paid already&mdash;</P>

They should not cancel the book<Col N="948" /> ings just yet. I am a little sorry for the Minister because he has to stand here today and deliver a budget which does not have any of his hallmarks. It is quite clear that it is only partially the work of the Minister. This budget, because of last year's disaster, has been constructed by a committee. The social partners have ridden shotgun on the Minister and this has all the signs of a budget designed by a committee with no underlying fiscal policy. Somebody said once that a camel was a horse designed by a committee. This is a camel of a budget with bumps and lumps on it but no fundamental fiscal policy underpinning it.</P>

      <P>This is quite clearly a budget designed by a committee. I am genuinely sorry for the Minister because whether one liked his budgets previously, one could say this was a man with a fiscal view and a view of how the nation should be run. None of that comes through in this budget. Apart from the social partners riding shotgun, the ministerial colleagues also ran the metal detector over the budget to ensure there were not any landmines. The spin coming out from Government Buildings was they had the Minister for Finance almost under house arrest. The Government Whip was let in occasionally with the bread and water or the bowl of thin gruel. Occasionally also, the Tánaiste smuggled in a food parcel.</P>

      <P>Truffles from Provence or some such tack like that. The Government colleagues did not do a great job because in riding the Minister so tight and putting him on such a tight rein, they have not eliminated every mistake. There are some landmines still in this budget but the biggest problem of all is the danger that it is a booby-trap which will blow the prosperity of the economy up in the air.</P>
      <P>Government now no longer controls fundamental policy. No Government can raise interest rates any more, that is done in Frankfurt. No Government can arrange exchange rates any more, that is done abroad also. The last policy left to Governments in this jurisdiction is fiscal and there is no fiscal policy apparent in this budget. The economy is overheating, everybody knows that now. This budget, together with the Book of Estimates and the other recent spending announcements, put our prosperity at risk. The Government today and in the Book of Estimates has injected about £4.5 billion of extra demand which will fuel inflation and also the twin of inflation, the congestion with which we are all so familiar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Minister's reputation was built a decade ago. He was a prudent manager who advocated expenditure controls. He advocated fiscal prudence when other distinguished luminaries of the school of '87, such as Mr. Haughey and Mr. Burke, were letting it all hang out. This man from the backbenches said we should control expenditure and he was right at the time. When he was spokesman on this side of the House, he insisted that a commitment went into Fianna Fáil's pro<Col N="950" /> gramme, and to the programme for Government, that expenditure would be held at 4% per annum. If that had been fulfilled, total expenditure at the end of 2001 would have been 17% higher than on election day. On the basis of the Book of Estimates, it is not 17% higher than on election day, it is 43.6% higher than on election day and that does not take into account the additional expenditure announcements made today. It is a pity to see a man who built his reputation on fiscal prudence being reduced to a type of Santa Claus figure dispensing largesse without any underlying policy with various elements of the budget contradicting other elements of it. We know from our experience in this House over the past 12 months that the economy is almost at full production. We know what has occurred with inflation and that we are now at four times the European average, almost at 7%. We also know the consequences of that because our citizens have decided to take back in wages what has been eroded by inflation. That is why there are no teachers in the schools, the trains do not run and why Dublin Airport is closed down so frequently. That is why there are six separate industrial disputes in Aer Lingus and three separate industrial disputes in Iarnród Éireann. In spite of the best efforts of partnership, the Minister failed on Monday night to tie the ASTI into his recent solution and the TUI voted 4:1 for industrial action.</P>
    <P>Inflation causes industrial chaos and the Minister has today sown the seeds for further industrial chaos. Inflation and congestion are effectively two sides of the same coin. We see what is happening on the streets of all our cities and on the DART which is reminiscent of the train service between Delhi and Calcutta. Nothing is working in this country any more and much of that is due to the congestion caused by Government spending. The Minister is over-stimulating an economy which is running at full tilt.</P>
    <P>We have virtually full employment and there is very little which can be done in terms of fiscal policy to get more people into the workforce. The most recent labour force survey shows that in the 12 months up to September, approximately 40,000 fewer people took up employment this year than last year. This is also a form of inflation. That is why it is impossible to get nurses and junior doctors in the Dublin hospitals. That is why people cannot get an electrician to fix a faulty plug. That is why it is impossible to get someone to build an extension to one's home. That is why one cannot get a plumber to fix a leaky pipe. More than anything else, it is why house prices continue to escalate, with only 20% of taxpaying citizens in the housing market. Some 80% of our sons and daughters expect to be housed in public housing or not at all. They certainly will not be in a position to own their own homes.</P>
    <P>Inflation is working its way through the domestic economy which no longer has the capacity to deliver. What does the Minister think an additional £4.5 billion will do to demand when the domestic capacity does not exist to deliver it? <Col N="951" /> The Minister has a facile theory on this to the effect that we are part of the great EU market and there is nothing which cannot be imported at consumer level if sufficient demand exists. That is not the issue. The issue is not what we can import in terms of consumer goods, the issue is congestion in the domestic economy.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the Government's capacity to spend &ndash; with a commitment to confine spending to 17% but ending up with 43.6% for openers, we cannot doubt the Minister's capacity to spend &ndash; I question the quality of that spending although I do not doubt the Minister's capacity to spend the additional £4.5 billion. According to the Minister's figures, the health budget has increased by 75% since this Government was elected, but the service has worsened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a new phenomenon in the Irish health service, imported from Disneyland, where people now have to queue to join the queue.</P>
      <P>No real evaluation of Government expenditure has been carried out. I questioned the Minister last week about the 370 expenditure programmes of which only 50 have been evaluated in some way, issues such as prison transport, canal usage and Irish aid to Ethiopia. In the health services, dental health and intellectual disability have been evaluated. What about the work of the acute hospitals? What about the crisis work in emergency departments? The Minister is throwing money at the problem without carrying out any structural reform. The expenditure of a huge amount of money is overheating the economy, causing inflation and industrial chaos. The more the Minister spends, the worse the situation becomes because he is creating the very congestion which defeats his own solutions. That is the fundamental difficulty with what the Minister has been doing and he has aggravated that further today.</P>
      <P>Members will be familiar with the statistical analysis of taxation, particularly income taxation, published by the Revenue Commissioners and circulated to them last week. They may not, however, be familiar with the NCB evaluation of that analysis which states:</P>
      <P>The overall income tax burden has not been cut to any significant extent in the last ten years. The proportion of aggregate income paid in tax remained at roughly 21% between the 1990-01 tax year and the 2000-01 tax year. Income tax changes have just offset the tendency for the average tax rate to rise as the progressive tax system pushes taxpayers into or further into the higher rate band as income rises. The money amount of tax cuts required to keep the average tax rate unchanged rises each year and would need about £0.25 billion in the upcoming budget just to stand still.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="952" /> The NCB commentary on Revenue's statistical analysis has not been contradicted. We do not index bands and allowances, as happens in the UK, so there is always a distortion on budget day which seems to indicate that people are receiving big reliefs. However, if one indexes at a 7% inflation rate, the result will be different. That explains why taxpayers are so delighted the week after the budget but are not remotely delighted in the second week of April when they get the money in their pay packets. The Minister has spent in the region of £1.2 billion today but, according to NCB's evaluation which has not been contradicted, the first £0.75 billion is merely money required to stand still. People will realise they are really only getting back their own money and the budget will not be the big election winner the Minister thinks it will.</P>
    <P>I note that the Tánaiste was successful in one policy aspect. Arising from the committee system which gave rise to this budget, the Tánaiste succeeded in cutting the top rate of tax from 44% to 42%. I question the wisdom of that. People on the minimum wage currently enter the tax net at £110 per week. The Minister has been dragged kicking and screaming by Fine Gael, Labour and the social partners to completely exempt many people on less than the minimum wage from the tax net with the result that people will now enter the tax net at £144. Had the Minister not cut the top tax rate, he could have increased that by a further £10 per week. Who needs the money more, people on a wage of £150 or £160 per week or people on an annual salary of £50,000, £60,000 or £70,000? If one examines the examples outlined in the Budget Statement, one can see that this budget displays the same old fault of the Minister's previous budgets, namely, that the more people earn, the more they get. The gap between the rich and the poor continues to increase. I blame the Minister and his soul mate, the Tánaiste, for this misguided policy. The social partners dragged the Minister back to some level of moderation in respect of low paid people but the benefits are still distorted.</P>
    <P>The Minister has persisted with individualisation in this budget. While I admire his courage, this requires some explanation. A one income family will enter the top tax rate after £29,000 when the budget provisions come into effect whereas a two income family will enter the top rate after £40,000. There is an £11,000 gap there which, at 22%, is a relatively wide gap.</P>

      <P>The Minister's metal detecting colleagues missed out on one small aspect of the budget of which I am sure the Minister is aware. When he decided to move people on the minimum wage up to £145 before they enter the tax net, he did not do so solely through the use of personal allowances for cost reasons. He did it <Col N="953" /> through a combination of personal and PAYE allowances. The PAYE allowance is only paid to people in employment so the additional £1,000 PAYE allowance is doubled for those people. As it is completely wiped out of the tax net, that £1,000 is taxable at 44% rather than 22%. In the most extreme case, for a couple with an income of £29,000 who do not have dependants and are not in receipt of the £3,000 allowance the Minister introduced as a corrective measure last year, the tax advantage is about £60 per week in cash. If the Minister can justify a difference of £60 per week between families with the same kinds of expenses and outgoings, he will have to explain it again to the lads who went on to the plinth last year because he has no corrective measures this year.</P>

      <P>I am not talking about a tax credit of £60 per week but hard cash. If someone has a dependant and there is only one income earner in the family who receives the £3,000 allowance, the difference is between £32,000 and £40,000, which is £8,000 at 22% and another £1,000 on the PAYE allowance. There is a double tap on it. Those on the committee who only looked at their own input forgot to cross-match. There is the basis for the same row as the Minister had last year on the combination of the two.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael believes the total minimum wage should be exempt from tax. We were first on that base early last year and we are still committed to it. In Government with suitable colleagues and partners we will fulfil that commitment and it will be our priority when we implement tax policies next year.</P>

      <P>One never knows, even the Tánaiste could have a Pauline conversion. People who are interested in this budget will look at three items, did it do anything to make housing affordable, did it do anything to help pay for having children minded when parents are at work and did it do anything on income tax relief?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see very little about child care. The child benefit increases are welcome. It is a policy to which we have been committed for a long time and to which the rainbow Government was committed. Our flag was nailed firmly to that mast a long time ago and we continue that commitment. We are in favour of big increases in child benefit. However, we see child benefit as an anti-poverty measure. The latest studies show that the incidence of poverty has reduced with the boom and rather than 15% of families being in poverty it is now 10%. Poverty is highest among that 10% of families where there is a greater number of children. We are committed to supporting children <Col N="954" /> and the measures taken in regard to child benefit. When we change sides in the House early next year we will do more than what the Minister has promised.</P>
    <P>The Minister did nothing for child care. Many young couples living in the far-flung suburbs of our cities, particularly in Dublin, will ask where are the child care measures. Fine Gael carried out a survey in different parts of this city, and depending on whether you had informal child care or a fully regulated system and creche, the weekly cost of child care ranged between £70 and £120 per week. If there were two children it was £200 per week on average. It is the same in Limerick. That is a lot of money after tax. It is over £10,000 per year after tax.</P>

      <P>If that is so, the Tánaiste's arithmetic is not up to the test. One hundred pounds a month does not compensate for a payment of £100 per week. It will benefit people, but very marginally. It is way below expectations. Not only is there a problem with paying for child care but there is a problem getting places in the first instance. One of the most disgraceful cons perpetrated on couples in need of child care are the announcements made by the Government in the last budget. The Minister announced that he would invest almost £50 million to provide child care places, £23 million of which was for local programmes. Does the Government know the drawdown on that at the end of the year? It is £57,000.</P>

      <P>Nothing is being done on the supply side. While child benefit is important we see it as an anti-poverty measure and a family support measure. We do not see it as an answer to the child care problem. It will haunt the Government because it is the same people who are put to the pin of their collar to pay extraordinarily high mortgages who have to pay extraordinarily high child care costs. They are being hammered on the tax side as well.</P>
      <P>As regards social welfare, we expected that pensions would be increased to over £100 per week. That was well flagged. It will be appreciated and we welcome it. On the generality of welfare increases, the increase is £8 per week. Those who have been following this debate among the social partners and in the wider public know that three figures were quoted. The minimum to cover inflation, especially when payments are being introduced in April this year, with child benefit being introduced in June, is £8. Organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, which would be familiar with the amount needed to live and the costs incurred by people reliant on welfare, had in mind a figure of £10. The fourth pillar of partnership led by CORI, people like Fr. Seán Healy and Sr. Brigid, were talking in terms of £14. If this was the budget where the Minister for Social, Family and Community Affairs was going to attack poverty, if this was going to be the great leap forward in terms of social inclusion, it has not happened. The £8 is at the bottom of the range of expectations. It comes in at the bottom of the demand.</P>
      <P>If the Government cannot launch the necessary attack on poverty at a time of unprecedented surpluses, when will it do it? When will it happen? Are we back to the position where Labour must wait, as one of the Minister's illustrious predecessors said? Is it a question of the poor always waiting? Eight pounds will not satisfy anyone and I would lay money that if people from the fourth pillar of partnership are commenting on it on radio or television, they will say exactly what I am saying.</P>

      <P>The health services are a sorry mess. We have heard a series of PR type announcements. The Minister for Health and Children is a nice man. He leads a charmed existence. He was very popular when he was Minister for Education and Science. Then the Minister, Deputy Woods, was appointed and he brought in a senior civil servant to evaluate that Department. He found the practices there reminiscent of coal mining in Victorian England. He has now moved to the Department of Health and Children and we have another series of PR announcements, and we got more of them again today. Of course, when he goes to Nemo Rangers they will say it will be great to have the medical card at 70 years of age, but what about single people on £95 per week who cannot get a medical card or a hus<Col N="956" /> band and wife on £135 per week, or a husband, wife and two children on £167 per week who cannot get a medical card? They pay their taxes and have to pay their doctor, spend £42 on drugs and cannot get a place in hospital if they need one because the Administration which has increased health expenditure by 75% has increased waiting lists so that people are now waiting longer than ever for ordinary surgical interventions. We will have more PR, spin and smiles and more bedside manners, but we will still have a Dickensian health system at a time when Ireland has never been richer and when we boast about having the greatest growth rates among OECD countries. This is a disgraceful performance.</P>
      <P>I remind the Minister that the Fine Gael health policy contains a commitment to giving medical cards to people at 65 years of age. Why should everybody on a pension not have a medical card? Why should they have to wait until they are 70? Like our colleagues in the Labour Party, we are also committed to abolishing the two-tier system and giving the advantages of private medicine to everybody through a universal social insurance scheme and to gearing up the health services so they can deliver. Money thrown at problems has never worked and will not work now.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister reduced the VAT rate by 1%. In our pre-budget submission we proposed a reduction of 2%, but we should be thankful for small mercies. I accept the Minister's point about e-commerce. If our standard rate of VAT is in excess of the European average, it is futile to try to sell things on the Internet as the rate of VAT in the country of sale is that which applies, not the rate of VAT in the purchaser's country, with some exceptions.</P>
      <P>I hope the reduction in VAT will be passed on. The VAT and excise reduction, according to the Minister, will reduce the CPI by 0.5% if it is passed on, but will it be passed on? This morning my colleague, Deputy Owen, briefed me on the disastrous state of the Competition Authority, with many vacancies which the Tánaiste did not bother filling. How does the Government expect the Competition Authority to work, or the Director of Consumer Affairs, whose office has failed over the years to put any order on forecourts or petrol pumps? This could go straight to the profit margin and threats that this will be the last reduction will not be listened to by multinational companies which now sell the bulk of petrol and diesel in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister moved to aid hauliers. It is right to reduce excise on diesel for hauliers given the obnoxious disc which non-nationals must display on UK roads, which costs Irish hauliers £1,500. I hope the Minister will also move to give them capital allowances on their depots and that he will move on the tax treatment of certain allowances, which is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the abolition of probate tax. It was a nasty tax which had to be paid by the poorest people, very often when a parent died and often on the family home. This nasty tax was intro<Col N="957" /> duced by the current Taoiseach when he was Minister for Finance in 1993. Many people were hurt by it and before the Minister claims too much credit for its abolition he should consider allowing people who were hurt to claim back what they paid. Then we might have a progressive measure in terms of probate tax.</P>
    <P>Regarding corporation tax, it is sufficient to say that what was put in place by Deputy John Bruton and Deputy Quinn in their discussions in Brussels is still in place. We will be moving to a universal standard rate of corporation tax of 12.5%, and we welcome the further instalment which has been delivered in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the ordinary decent farmers got such short shrift. Of all the crises facing us, that in farming, particularly beef farming, is an absolute disaster. There is no suggestion that the Government is aware of the disastrous situation. Had Ministers attended a meeting last night in Abbeyleix or the scheduled meeting for Tullamore they would know very quickly the extent of the disaster. There is nothing in terms of income support for decent honest farmers who see their livelihood being taken away from them, who complied with every regulation from Brussels in terms of cleanliness, hygiene and quality control and who have been misled by the Government and badly led by certain members of the Administration in the areas of food safety and food quality. The VAT rebate has been increased from 4.2% to 4.3%, but that is hardly a big deal. It will hardly delight farmers or result in parties being held in parish halls in my constituency to celebrate a reduction in VAT of 0.1% as they see their livelihood and that of their children going down the drain.</P>
    <P>The Minister has finally made peace with the credit unions. Like Neville Chamberlain, when he finally met the credit unions the Minister was waving a piece of paper saying &ldquo;Peace in our time&rdquo;. I hope the Minister delivers on what he has said. He has made a half commitment that the same regime will apply to other financial institutions. We will wait and see &ndash; I presume his legal advice was that he would be crucified in Brussels if he favoured credit unions above other financial institutions.</P>
    <P>The budget is very disappointing. It lacks an underlying fiscal policy. There is a feeling of an economy still roaring forward but being guided by a Government that has gone adrift, a Government which knows how to spend money but does not know how to spend it effectively, a Government with no values. We see the way women are being treated by the Government, which illustrates the underlying thinking, if any thinking exists. Women are being conscripted into the labour force through the individualisation proposals and the increase in the PAYE allowance. Those who stay at home are being treated as a different type of woman. Fine Gael believes that women should have choice and should not be conscripted into the labour force. The tax regime should encourage their participation in the labour force <Col N="958" /> and we should have an affordable child care system which ensures their children can be looked after to the best possible standard while they are at work. We would like a situation in which women can make choices and would not feel they are trapped in a job. For example, we would like a woman who decided to have a baby to be able to take a year or two out&mdash;</P>

The same regime should apply to men, but not putting too fine a point on it, we are basically talking about women, although it is politically correct to talk about spouses. None of these values comes through in the budget. There is a bad attitude in the budget where people are just seen as units in the taxation system.</P>

Even though the Minister had more money to spend this year than last year and even though he spent more, he has fallen into the same traps. This is a soulless, valueless Administration.</P>
      <P>The Government is in its fourth year. It has failed to do anything about the cost of housing. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, and the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, would have been described very well if that irate shareholder who criticised the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, had applied his criticism to them. They are like weedkiller. Everything they touch withers. After three Bacon reports the price of houses continue to rise. I was given an example of the housing situation by a parliamentary colleague today. A house in a housing estate located between Bray and Greystones cost £86,000 in 1997. When the last of the houses in that development were sold two years later, they cost £120,000. Those houses were on the same stretch of land and built by the same builder. One was sold last week for £205,000, a three bed-roomed semi-detached house in a nice location a bit out of town. The report on taxation, to which I referred previously, also includes a section on housing. It is said that £35,000 joint income is the minimum required to get into the market. Only 20% of those who wish to can get into the market. There is a housing disaster, a traffic disaster, a public transport disaster and industrial chaos. I am waiting for the grave diggers to go out. It is about the only group the Government has not yet aggravated, but it is well on its way to doing so.</P>

      <P>This Administration has no relationship with the ethical standards one would expect in a national parliament. I am not talking about Mr. Haughey and Mr. Burke. We all know the names. They are still in the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party. If it is illegal, one loses the Whip and if it is not illegal, nothing really happens, but when it comes to standards, ethics, good example and leading the people, this Administration is not at the races.</P>
      <P>The farming crisis is the greatest crisis to hit this economy. When all is said and done about the financial services, the IT industry and everything else, in bad times we will still rely on the food industry and on the goodwill of the family farmer and the farming community, yet there is nothing in the budget for them.</P>
      <P>If we were to apply a quality of life criteria to the Budget, what could anyone say? Despite all the money that will be spent, one would have to admit, even the Taoiseach's backbenchers would have to do so, that the quality of life next year will be worse than it is this year because money is being pumped into an economy that does not have the capacity to take it. The Government is not reforming the economy at a structural level to enable it to take the spend. Services get worse, we all get more frustrated and the Government is amazed it is not getting better value for money. It is clear why it is not getting value for money. The problem with this Administration is that it is too cute by half. It thinks it has purchased half the electorate and conned the other half, but it has forgotten the long memory of the Irish electorate. They are waiting in the long grass for the Taoiseach. His intention to hide from them for as long as he can is a very prudent decision.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Just as Nigel Lawson sabotaged the boom in 1980s Britain, so too the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has done much the same in much the same way in Ireland of the 21st century. The Minister's budget is little more than an invitation to party. Champagne Charlie rides again. I enjoy a party as much as the next man, and most of us do, but we all know that a bad hangover follows a major binge. I will wager with anyone in this House that within a year we will all be paying <Col N="960" /> the price, irrespective of whether we have been invited to the Minister's party.</P>
    <P>The economy is already slowing down and that is no bad thing, but today the Minister has immeasurably increased the possibility that the economy will crash land rather than slow to a level of growth that is sustainable into the future. As ever, not everybody has been invited to the Minister's party.</P>
    <P>For much of the past month, the newspapers have been full of quotes and leaks from Ministers, notably the Taoiseach, that the tax measures of this year's budget would favour people on low and middle incomes. We were told that the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, had learned the lesson from last year. We were told there would be no cock ups, no scrubs, that he was on a leash, that the leopard had changed his spots, Ministers were even betting on it. They were wrong. The leopard has not changed his spots. Today's budget is a mirror image of last year's. It is shamefully unfair. It gives by far the greatest benefit to the better off. It extends the discrimination against one income families to a degree and in a way that most people would have considered impossible following last year's fiasco. Far from learning the lessons of last year, the Minister has given us a repeat performance.</P>
    <P>Last year he took two points off the top rate of tax, this year he has taken another two points off the top rate of tax. Last year he took two points off the standard rate, this year he has taken a further two points off the standard rate. Last year he started the process of individualisation, this year he has extended it even further, though remarkably one could scour the Minister's speech and not see the word or even the figures but they are very much there. They are there in an enhanced form.</P>
    <P>Last year's budget was the most divisive in living memory and this year's is no better. For weeks we have been told that the Taoiseach was resisting a reduction in the higher rate of tax because he did not want the budget to be seen as a give-away to the rich. It is not difficult to see why the Taoiseach would want to put out this story, but one would need to be pretty naive to have bought the spin. The implication was simple and not very subtle. We are being asked to believe that all this rich man's stuff was to do with the Minister for Finance and his soulmates, the Progressive Democrats, and nothing to do with the Taoiseach, the man of the people. We are being asked to believe the Taoiseach had no control over his Minister's budget, not just last year but in 1997 as well, though I suspect the Taoiseach is more than happy to take credit for the more progressive budget in 1998. It is nonsense. A budget cannot happen without the explicit say-so and close involvement of the Taoiseach, and the current Taoiseach is as responsible as the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, for what has happened over the past four years. Let me make this point as forcibly as I can one more time. A reduction in <Col N="961" /> the upper rate of tax is of no benefit whatever to two-thirds of taxpayers and it is worth very little to the majority of the rest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's party recommended a reduction of four points two years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Reducing tax rates in itself favours the better off. It is no coincidence that the Progressive Democrats prefer this route to reduce taxation. By my calculations since 1989, everything else being equal, reductions in the tax rates have benefited the well off at the expense of somebody on an average industrial wage &ndash;  nearly 8% for a person on £10,000 in 1989 but over 13% for a person on £100,000. It goes without saying that the reduction in the upper rate is worth nothing to someone earning the average industrial wage or less, but many people in traditional middle class jobs also gain nothing. For example, a school teacher on starting salary of £20,000 would not benefit by one penny from the reduction in the upper rate, nor would a garda or most of the people working in the many call centres that have blossomed here recently. Even a single person on £30,000 stands to gain less than £100 a year from the reductions in the 44% rate announced today. The truth is that only people on large salaries stand to gain in any significant way from what the Minister has done with the top rate.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach told &ldquo;The Week In Politics&rdquo; on 8 August that he had no difficulty with what he called high earners in our society paying 44%. This cannot be his view any longer, although it is difficult to see what has happened between then and now. Where the Taoiseach is confused or confusing, Deputy McCreevy is more straightforward: he is an old-fashioned Tory or perhaps a new-fangled Tory. He does not believe in a progressive tax system. He simply does not believe that taxpayers should pay according to their means. I am not altogether sure that the Minister believes in the need to raise taxes at all. Nobody believes in tax for the sake of it but most of us accept that taxation is needed to fund those services which go to make up a civilised society. We know too that we get what we pay for but one of these days the Minister will doubtless tell us there is no such thing as society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two years ago the Minister introduced a series of tax credits and I congratulated him at the time but I am beginning to wonder why he bothered, as he has allowed the system to wither on the vine ever since. True, he has dedicated approximately £300 million today to increasing the personal tax credit but if he had put every penny spent on tax reductions today into tax credits, as the Taoiseach knows, he would have produced a much fairer result than what is before us. Tax credits were introduced to allow the Department and the Government to reduce tax by a flat amount for each taxpayer. This gives benefit to everyone but a proportionately higher benefit to those on low and middle incomes. The lower one's taxable <Col N="962" /> income the better proportion of relief one receives. This is why the Labour Party has been advocating channelling reductions in tax in that way for several years.</P>
    <P>I emphasise this point because it is not just the poor or the low paid who are being screwed or ignored by the Minister. The average worker and middle class professional is also getting less than a fair shake. It is not just the bottom 10% or 20% who are getting a raw deal; fully three quarters of us have cause to complain about the way Fianna Fáil has divided up the larger cake it has available today.</P>
    <P>I am rather more sanguine about the reduction in the standard rate. It is not a particularly fair way to reduce tax but neither is it as spectacularly unfair as reducing the top rate. The more one earns the more one benefits from the rate reduction but at least there is a ceiling beyond which the benefit is equal. There is a particular problem we should be aware of in going down this road, however; if we reduce the standard rate of tax we also reduce the value of the tax credit. Before today a personal tax free allowance of £1,000 converted into a tax reduction of £220. After today the same personal allowance is worth only £200. This has the perverse effect for someone in a part time job, earning £6,000 or £7,000 per year, of making them worse off as a result of the reduction in the standard rate of tax if that measure is taken alone. In fairness, that loss is wiped out by the increase in the tax credit but the increase is worth significantly less than it appears at face value.</P>
    <P>My party leader famously said that we had failed to get across our message in relation to tax equity during the 1997 general election and he was right. There is a simplicity to reducing headline rates but it is a simplicity that politicians with any concept of fairness and social justice should reject. Sadly, there seem to be few of those in this Government. The lesson is simple and is one I thought the Government had learnt two years ago: tax credits are the way to go. For many, changes in tax rates provide little more than the illusion of tax reform.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister began the process of what he himself called individualisation. It caused a furore, not least on the Fianna Fáil back benches, and the Minister later produced what he called balancing measures. Overall, the fiasco helped to fuel this year's inflation even further. Despite that furore, the Minister, to be fair, said that the only thing he regretted was the use of the word &ldquo;individualisation&rdquo; and if one scours this document one will not find that word in it. His only other regret was that his backbenchers did not have the gumption to keep their mouths shut while he got on with the job.</P>
    <P>This year the Minister has gone further. A married couple with two incomes can now earn up to £40,000 before hitting the higher rate of tax while a couple on one income can earn only £29,000 before the 42% rate kicks in. Incidentally, I cannot understand why he increased the £28,000 limit <Col N="963" /> to £29,000. It is at the very least a fig leaf and seems to be totally meaningless. This process is objectionable on two grounds: first, it is an outrageously unfair way to reduce tax. An ESF report published a few days ago revealed that almost all of the benefit of the individualisation done last year benefited the top 20% of income earners. This year an even greater percentage of the benefit will go to an even smaller number of well-off taxpayers. The total cost of completing the Minister's project, as he set out last year, is £600 million and fully five sixths of taxpayers will not gain a penny from the process.</P>
    <P>What is equally disturbing about this project is what it tells us about the Government's attitude to parenting, caring for children and the institution of the family. Since the early 1980s the Irish tax code has underpinned marriage and the family. A married couple with one income got more or less the same tax breaks and allowances as a married couple with two incomes. The primary effect of this was to allow one partner, usually though not always the woman, to take time off, usually to look after children, without suffering a complete collapse in income as a result.</P>
    <P>It is not the business of the State to tell lone parents or married women or men with children whether or not they should go out to work. That is their business and their choice. The business of the State is to allow them that choice and until now our tax system has facilitated that but not any more. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have now made that choice for them and from now on women will be heavily penalised if they take time off work to look after their children and fewer young parents will be able to choose to stay at home, usually only for a couple of years while the child is young. For the Government the needs of the labour market come first and the needs of society barely register at all.</P>
    <P>This budget, as Deputy Noonan said, opens up a new era of discrimination against one income couples. Last year the Minister gave us individualisation for the middle classes. This year he has extended the process to everyone else by starting the process of individualising the tax credits. I have been arguing for some time that we should take the first £200 of income out of the income tax net in the case of a single person and twice that, £400, in the case of a married couple. The Minister said he has gone some distance towards meeting that target and in a manner of speaking he has. However, he has done so in a way that further discriminates against home-makers. The £1,000 PAYE allowance is available only to PAYE workers, which is fair enough, and extending it sounds great. However, unlike the rest of the personal allowances, it is not transferable between spouses, so what we have is an increase in the tax credit on the cheap to pay for tax breaks for the rich, together with a dollop of poor man's individualisation. The big losers yet again are the one income families, the unfortu<Col N="964" /> nate men and women who want to take a few years off to take care of their children.</P>
    <P>It is time the Government came clean on this issue. When the Minister started the individualisation of the standard rate band last year many people eventually gave him a fool's pardon. It was seen as a mistake or a gaffe but we now know it was nothing of the kind. It was a deliberate strategy to force one parent out to work and to direct more money into the pockets of the better off. We need to know where all this is going. Does the Minister intend to finish the job he started last year? Last year he told us it was going to be a three year project while today he refers to completing it in future budgets, so clearly he is not going to hold to the timetable he set out last year. Does he intend to individualise all the personal allowances, for example, just as he has begun to do with the standard rate band?</P>
    <P>What is wrong with couples with children taking a few years off to look after those children? It is not as if the Minister is providing adequate child care places. Is he afraid that many of them may not return to the labour market? I would not worry unduly, as his Administration's disastrous housing policy, which has led to astronomical mortgages, has already taken care of that. I am reminded that at least some members of Fianna Fáil opposed divorce in the 1980s on the grounds that we should look to support the institution of marriage rather than providing for marriage breakdown. Now some of the same people are actively dismantling one of the very few means by which the State gave active support to marriage and parenting. How they square the two is beyond me.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has delivered what most of us suspect is his last budget, and we can now clearly appreciate his legacy and that of the Government. The NESF pointed out last week that income distribution in Ireland is among the most unequal in Europe. The Combat Poverty Agency reiterated the same point this week. Relative poverty has increased dramatically during his time in office. The top 20% of income earners have enjoyed a bonanza at the expense of the rest of the population. It is fair to say that the boom which started in 1994 has continued apace, but the Minister has ensured, through his changes in the tax system, that the bulk of the benefit has gone into the back pockets of those who needed it least. I do not suppose that any of this would upset the Minister, but those of us who see the tax system as a means of addressing inequality and injustice have every reason to bitterly regret the day the Minister crossed the threshold of Merrion Street.</P>
    <P>I said at the start of my contribution that this budget signals the beginning of the end of the so-called Celtic tiger. Maybe it is not for Opposition Members to criticise measures which may enjoy a bit of short-term popularity, but we are in this House to do more than just court short-term popularity, and I intend to call it as I see it. Inflation now stands at 6.8%, inflation in domestic services is several points higher than that and house price inflation is off the scale. Some of it is externally generated but an increasing share <Col N="965" /> is home made. Today's package is certain to lead to a further increase in inflation, not just in prices but also in wages. If this is combined with a change in the external environment, for example, an increase in the value of the euro, we could very quickly lose competitiveness and everything that flows from that.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows all that. Indeed, in the past he has prided himself on being hawkish on these issues. For three years he stuck to what I always considered to be a bizarre strategy of limiting spending increases to an annual increase of 4%. Soon after the election in 1997, he said that ensuring increases remained at that level was an exact science. This year though he has gone for three times that &ndash; nearly 12% &ndash; and follows it up with tax reductions on a scale which virtually independent expertise considers to be off the wall. He is priming the pump at a time when the well is about to overflow. To continue the metaphor I mentioned at the start of my contribution, he is throwing oil on an already blazing fire and it should surprise no one if it blows up in our collective faces.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, the ESRI and others predicted that the Minister's policies would fuel inflation. They were characterised as left wing &ldquo;pinkos&rdquo;, something which I think the Minister regards as less than a compliment. The European Commission and other independent experts got the same treatment, but if we strip away the rhetoric it is clear that the left wing &ldquo;pinkos&rdquo; were right, and there is every reason to think we will be right again.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also provided for a reduction in VAT of one point off the top rate. The move is inoffensive in so far as it goes, but it is ludicrous to suggest that it will have anything other than a very short-term effect on inflation, if that. It is worth looking at the top rate of VAT. It is made up principally of goods which already attract excise, mostly goods which are in the discretionary area. It is made up of drink, motor cars, tobacco and cigarettes. Do we seriously believe that reducing VAT by one point, from 21% to 20%, on, for example, the price of a pint will dent inflation in any serious way? Can it possibly be called a serious anti-inflationary focus, to use the phrase we have heard from Government in recent weeks? I doubt it. Does a once-off reduction of 0.4% or 0.5% in the CPI, presuming that it is passed on, amount to an anti-inflationary strategy, an anti-inflationary focus? I do not think so. We might just reduce the price of the pint by 2p or 3p until the publicans find some reason to put it back on, and we are abandoning any effort to dissuade young people from smoking cigarettes.</P>
    <P>The Minister seeks to take credit for his indirect tax measures. He also seeks to take some plaudits for the fact that he has abandoned his short-lived effort to dissuade people from smoking, but strangely enough he makes no effort to assess the increase in inflation which will surely flow from the other measures he has taken today. The Minister raised spending by nearly £3 billion <Col N="966" /> in the Estimates. He has pumped a further £1.2 billion into the economy in tax reductions aimed at those who already have large amounts of disposable income, and the social welfare package is worth about another billion pounds, so in total we are talking about in the region of £5 billion extra pumped into the economy. Is the Minister seriously asking us to believe that none of this will impact upon inflation?</P>
    <P>A few months before he came to office in 1997, Deputy McCreevy in opposition excoriated my party leader, Deputy Quinn, then Minister for Finance, about the inflationary effects of his budget. The size of the reductions involved at that stage was £400 million, yet the same Minister, Deputy McCreevy, would have us believe that injecting £5,000 million pounds into an economy will have apparently no inflationary effect whatever. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the Minister for Finance, or perhaps some of his officials, have taken leave of their collective senses. We have done well in recent years in avoiding a serious bout of inflationary pressure but what the Minister is doing today is pushing our luck too far.</P>
    <P>The Minister will say that the Labour Party has been arguing for a programme of investment in services, which would also entail public spending, and he is right, but unlike them we were prepared to limit our demands to reduce taxation, although the people on low and middle incomes whom we sought to target would have done as well from the package we announced as they have from the Government's package.</P>
    <P>Our fiscal policy has only a passing similarity to Fianna Fail's recent efforts. For a start it is costed and set out carefully over a three year period. It is also careful, not reckless. We have argued for a sustained programme over three to four years to bring about measurable and sustained improvements in services. Fianna Fáil, on the other hand, is spending for one reason and one reason only &ndash; to get re-elected. Does Fianna Fáil really think that the people are fools? For three and a half years it studiously ignored the problems with the health service, the homeless children on our streets, the ever-growing numbers of people on the local authority housing waiting lists and the needs of carers. For three years it ignored underfunded services which were crying out for investment and now, a few months before an election, it loosens the purse strings as if by magic and expects us to take it seriously. The 2001 Estimates published some weeks ago have nothing to do with the interests or the needs of the country and everything to do with the electoral needs of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil believes in being all things to all men. It does not believe in choices and certainly not in hard choices. By contrast, we in the Labour Party believe in being straight with people. We believe that the time has come to change direction, to change our priorities. We can continue to channel the fruits of growth into our back pockets <Col N="967" /> or we can invest in the services on which we all depend.</P>
    <P>I want to stress the word &ldquo;all&rdquo;. For generations we provided services for those who could not pay for them. Public provision was as much about charity as it was about citizens' rights but now is the time to move on. Now we can afford to design and fund services which everyone, regardless of income, will be happy and proud to use.</P>
    <P>We need a public service, a health service which guarantees equal access for all and excellence in service. We need to provide a public transport service for everyone, not just for those who do not have or cannot afford a car. The State should provide recreation facilities everywhere, not just in areas where the private sector refuses to go. We should work in close co-operation with the private sector but ultimately the responsibility lies with the State to see to it that our citizens get the standard of service to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has made it clear that we want to see greater investment in services and that this will entail more public investment. We want higher public spending because we want to improve the quality of life of our citizens. We want targeted initiatives combining public investment, structural reform and rigorous evaluation because we know that if we want stable, non-inflationary growth, we have to increase the productive capacity of the economy. In the first instance that means tackling the bottlenecks which are so obvious to all. It means easing traffic congestion, providing child care facilities and facilitating people who want to work, whether they already live here or come here from overseas.</P>
    <P>When we talk about infrastructure we are not only talking about roads, airports and fibre optic cables. We need to invest in these areas, but we also need to invest in people. The new economy is a knowledge-based one and this means we must invest in education from the cradle to the grave. Investing in people entails more than education and training. It is also about providing health care, housing and social services. This provision is necessary if people are to stay in Ireland, develop themselves and, in turn, develop the economy. This cannot be done by cutting tax. Putting money into the pockets of the better off is fine on budget day, but it is not of much use if one has a disabled child or one has to bring an elderly parent to hospital. One cannot skip the accident and emergency queue because the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, cut the top rate of tax.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste seems to believe that the economic success of the future is ensured by following the formulas of the past. Not for the first time, she is wrong. The choice between private consumption and public investment is at the heart of the choice posed by the Tánaiste a few weeks ago. She stated, without apology, that she felt closer and more comfortable with American free market capitalism than the European social model. I know I speak for all members of my party when <Col N="968" /> I reject that view with all the forces at our collective command.</P>
    <P>For many years Fianna Fáil was an enthusiastic supporter of EU membership, but there are worrying signs that may be changing. The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands gave a jingoistic speech in Boston recently when she seemed to say that the obligations of membership had become a little tiresome now that the money is running out. Until very recently the Taoiseach was ominously silent on the issue and he still has not publicly rebuked the Minister for what she said.</P>
    <P>It is as well to acknowledge that the question of Boston or Berlin is not a choice in any real sense of the word for many of us. For many of us, particularly younger people, the question of European identity is a matter of fact and not a matter of choice. I am a Dubliner, Irish and European. There is no conflict in these layers of identity and I do not see how there ever could be. I never want to go back to the insular backward-looking definition of Irishness which was the prevailing theology on this island until a generation or so ago. Many of us have embraced the fact that we are equal citizens of a multi-cultural Europe and we will continue to do so even after the Germans have stopped paying for the roads.</P>
    <P>My party will support the European political project come what may, but this is not to say we are indifferent to the sort of Europe we have, far from it. It is important for the Labour Party that the Union is more than just a free market. It is important that it is a Union where citizens have human and social rights which can be vindicated even in the teeth of international capitalism. It is important to us that workers cannot be fired at will, that parents have a legal right to parental leave when their children are born and that the health and safety of workers is guaranteed by law. The Tánaiste may regard these rights as unnecessary regulation, but we regard them as an important statement of the sort of society in which we live.</P>
    <P>For too long we have asked pensioners to live on much too little. Approximately 60% of pensioners have no means of support other than a State pension. Many others live off occupational pensions which are not as generous as they should be. I include in that category many former employees of semi-State bodies. For many years we found it difficult to afford the increases needed to bring the pension up to a decent level, but that has now changed. We have the resources to make a substantial increase in pensions, not just for old age pensioners but for everyone, including widows, people on invalidity, blind people etc. who are long-term dependent on the State for a living. In many cases these are the people who built the boom we are enjoying but they have no independent means of benefiting from the healthy state of the economy. They do not benefit from tax cuts and cannot go out and earn an extra few bob in the labour market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="969" /> Last year the Minister had the money to raise the pension to £100 per week. Shamefully, he held back so as to delay the increase until a few months before the election. Today he has raised it to £106 per week. I welcome this as far as it goes, but he should have gone a good deal further. A few weeks ago my party indicated that it would seek to increase the pension to £120 per week in the event of being returned to office at some point during the next year. I reiterate that commitment. The clock will be ticking from 1 January on that increase. As a precondition for entry into Government we will insist that the increase is backdated to 1 January 2001. A once-off increase in pensions is good but it is not good enough. We need a mechanism for benchmarking, not just the old age pension but all social welfare payments. We also need a mechanism for deciding on future increases. The Labour Party will set out its proposals in that regard in the coming months.</P>
    <P>The really big losers during the past year are the people who depend on social welfare payments other than pensions and pensioners under the age of 66. These people got a miserly increase of just £4 in last year's budget. Much of this was eaten away by local authority differential rents long before inflation kicked in. It is a simple undeniable fact that social welfare recipients are significantly worse off in every possible way as a result of the meagrely rise in last year's budget and the bout of inflation which followed it.</P>
    <P>This was a deliberate decision of Government at that time. Even at the time of last year's budget the Government was projecting a rise in average incomes of 6% while giving social welfare recipients less than that. In other words, it was a deliberate decision of Government last year to make people who depend on social welfare relatively poorer than they already were. To make up for this, a weekly increase of at least £10 was needed before today. We must look at the Minister's announcement of £8 per week in that context. It remains that the poorest of the poor will get relatively poorer over the next year, and this will happen because of a deliberate decision of the Government.</P>
    <P>Child care must be the single biggest failure of the Government. It has been clear for years that female participation in the workforce has been increasing and that child care facilities are inadequate and simply non-existent in some areas. It has also been obvious for years that nothing short of Government intervention would sort out the problem, yet the Government has done nothing about this issue. We have had reports, interdepartmental groups and studies, promises and recommendations, but virtually no action. Action is required to address this issue on at least two levels: first, and most importantly, we must address the issue of supply and, second, we must deal with affordability. Needless to say, the two issues are inextricably linked &ndash; if one sorts out the supply side the likelihood is that affordability will look after itself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="970" /> Before I go any further I acknowledge one straightforward and important fact. The majority of parents, particularly mothers, would prefer to have as much time off as possible to look after their children. This choice should be underpinned by the tax system. Instead the Minister has decided to do exactly the opposite since his individualisation measures are designed to coerce many mothers out to work. Flexible work practices and improved maternity and paternity leave would also help parents to spend time with their children. It would be churlish of me not to welcome the extension of maternity leave announced by the Minister today.</P>
    <P>The second option for many parents is to leave their children with a relative or neighbour. Sometimes this involves payment and other times it does not. One way or the other, we should seek to ensure that a person who looks after one or two children is favourably treated by the tax system. In this context, we could provide that the first £70 or £75 of income from this source would be exempt from tax, provided the individual concerned was not engaged in the business of child minding. We should not, in our anxiety to provide for a well regulated standard of child care, impede the informal arrangements many parents prefer.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister announced capital allowances for investment in child care facilities. Earlier this year the Government announced £50 million in capital grants, much of it aimed at the voluntary and private sectors. As Deputy Noonan said, these amounts have been repeated in the Estimates as most of the money was not spent. These schemes have come late in the day and, in fairness, it is too early to make a complete judgment as to their effectiveness. However, it has to be said that the early signs are not encouraging and the take-up has been slow.</P>
    <P>I have no problem with these measures in principle, but the almost total reliance on the private and voluntary sectors cannot solve the problem of supply and certainly will not deal with the issue of affordability. Let us think of it in simple terms. If we insist, as we should, on a minimum ratio of one child care worker to each three or four children, it will take a weekly charge of £80 or £100 to ensure that person earns a half decent wage, and this is too much for many parents, especially if they have more than one child. This can be dealt with by giving parents a subsidy towards child care costs and in the short term there is little alternative but to do so. However, a more acceptable long-term solution would be for the State, through the health boards, local authorities or, perhaps, the Department of Education and Science, to pick up part of or all the salaries of qualified child care workers.</P>
    <P>Essentially what is needed is for the State to take responsibility for ensuring the facilities are available, whether by way of crèches, playgroups, pre-school facilities or montessori schools. This can be done by providing support for the voluntary and private sector through capi<Col N="971" /> tal grants and salary subsidies but direct provision will also be needed. Our ultimate aim should be to provide for a seamless transition from care through pre-school to formal education.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced a significant increase in child benefit, which I welcome. The payment is made directly to mothers and all the studies suggest it is well used and goes some way towards defraying the cost of bringing up children. Even before today the Minster was committed under the PPF to raise the level of benefit to £100 per child, but I am glad, nonetheless, he has gone a considerable way to meeting that commitment.</P>
    <P>However, it is wrong to suggest the increase in child benefit will address the child care issue. Not one extra place will be created as a result of the increase in child benefit. Likewise, the increase in no way impacts on the affordability of child care. An extra £6 or £7 in child benefit, however welcome, is of little use if it costs £80 or more to have one's child cared for. The Minister should have taken his courage in his hands and made a targeted payment towards the cost of caring for young children. The fact that he has not done so means that the issue remains to be addressed on another day.</P>
    <P>The Government's national development plan was announced with great fanfare just over a year ago. While those of us in Opposition may differ in terms of detail there is a consensus in the House that the plan must be delivered in good time, but there are already worrying signs that this will not happen. Construction costs have spiralled and it is a certainty that all the major projects set out in the plan cannot be delivered within budget. Government will be required to provide more money or to take action to keep costs within limits.</P>
    <P>We have had the opportunity to discuss this matter in the House in the recent past and there is no doubt we will come back to it in the near future, but I want to mention one issue in particular where the abject failure of the Government is stark, that is the business of providing a decent public transport system in Dublin. Driving in Dublin has become a nightmare. Those of us who live or work in the city know that travelling from one part of it to another by car is a frustrating experience at just about any time of the day. Most of us acknowledge that the only solution to this problem is public transport and urgent action is needed now.</P>
    <P>The Government has lead us through a myriad of reports, consultative processes, recommendations and inter-party wrangling and the end result is little short of pathetic. In three years it has delivered three QBCs, a few dozen extra buses on the streets of Dublin and a DART service to Malahide and Greystones which runs approximately once every two hours. There is little prospect of any improvement in the near future. The Government talks about metros, Luas, PPPs and so on, but there is no sign of anything happening on the ground.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="972" /> I am not a fan of the recent plan produced by the DTO, but it is a good deal better than most of what went before. The Government and other authorities, therefore, should take the bull by the horns and make it happen. The citizens of Dublin are entitled to nothing less.</P>
    <P>A few months ago the Department of the Environment and Local Government set out its proposals in the national climate change strategy. The report is full of very worthy stuff. It is long on aspiration but a good deal shorter when it comes to specifics. In the context of today's budget, I examined the section on taxation.</P>
    <P>The statement begins with full-blooded support for the notion of eco taxes, without any hint that excise duty would be reduced on petrol, but then it goes on to deal with &ldquo;Integration with Overall Economic and Taxation Policy&rdquo;. Most importantly, the report states that emissions taxation will be introduced &ldquo;in the context of acceptance by the social partners and will be put in place from 2002 on a phased incremental basis and in a manner that takes account of national economic, social and environmental objectives&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely clear that the Government does not have the remotest intention of doing anything about our Kyoto obligations and it should be honest enough to say so publicly. It is not good enough that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government delivers one message when he strides the world stage while the Minister for Finance and his Department do their level best to ensure nothing happens. The Department is very good at ensuring nothing happens.</P>
    <P>Three years ago the Government promised us a tax on plastic bags, but that has not been introduced. A year ago the Minister for Finance announced a BIK charge on parking in Dublin city centre, but that has not been introduced. It is difficult to think of a single environmental measure taken by the Government which was not imposed by Brussels and financed wholly or largely by European funds.</P>
    <P>I do not pretend that meeting the Kyoto targets will be easy but it is made all the more difficult because politicians of all parties have connived in spreading the notion that clean air can be achieved painlessly, without cost, without any change in our lifestyles and without any impact on economic growth. This issue will not go away. It is here for the foreseeable future and it is one of those issues which needs an all-party approach and, ideally, a consensus. One way or other a dose of honesty would be a good start. It is time for the Government to say what it means and mean what it says. At the moment it is doing neither.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to restate the support of the Labour Party for the so-called Tobin tax. This is a well worked out idea intended above all to bring some stability to international capital markets and its merits are obvious. We all know there are real difficulties in implementing something such as this, which depends on a high level of <Col N="973" /> international co-operation, but we are happy to work with like-minded parties and individuals to establish whether a way can be found around it. Many of our sister parties in the EU have taken a similar position and we will be happy to work with them in dealing with the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is a man who likes to trumpet his own consistency. He is given to starting every second sentence with the words &ldquo;I have always believed&rdquo;. He has always believed that the Fianna Fáil manifesto of 1977 was wrong. He prides himself as one of the few in Fianna Fáil who opposed it at the time. However, what the Minister has done today puts 1977 in the halfpenny place. Having preached fiscal prudence for decades the Minister, in the autumn of his political career, has dramatically reversed everything he ever believed in so as to court electoral favour. He will live to regret the day, if he does not already do so.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an seans seo labhairt ar cáinfhaisnéis 2001. The Green Party operates by the principle of thinking globally and acting locally. In other words, the welfare of each individual in society depends ultimately on the well-being of the life support systems on which all of us depend. The Minister either chooses to ignore this reality or is forced by more selfish interests to reject it.</P>
      <P>Ghandi coined the principle, &ldquo;There is enough for everyone's need, but not for everyone's greed&rdquo;. This planet has a total productive area which works out at approximately two hectares per person. Allowing 12% to protect the rest of the species in the world, a suspiciously modest figure emanating from the World Commission on Environment and Development, we are left with 1.7 hectares per head available for human use. When the Government came to office in 1997 the average human ecological footprint was already 35% bigger than nature could regenerate on a continual basis and was growing quickly. In that year in the sustainable development strategy for Ireland prepared by the Government, UCD's environmental institute used four measures of domestic consumption, namely, fossil fuels, built-up land, food and forestry, to arrive at an Irish ecological footprint of 2.38 hectares per person or a total of 86,325 square kilometres, about 1.25 times the size of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rapid expansion in Ireland's footprint should surprise no one. It is part of a global trend but also special to the velvet spur of the Celtic tiger ravenous for imported resources. What has <Col N="974" /> kept our footprint relatively small in the past has been our low population density and high percentage of productive agricultural land, a ratio now in rapid change. The sprawl of buildings and roads across farmland, the soaring importation of building materials and fuel, the demand for new machinery, cars and computers and acquisitions such as the largest trawler in the world all add to the cost of energy and the pollution we pile up in other countries as well as our own. Even our productive agriculture is heavily subsidised ecologically in fossil fuels, fertilisers and remedies for pollution.</P>
    <P>The new forestry targets, the imported wind turbines, the plans for wave power and the new natural gas supply could help eventually to shrink our national ecological footprint by a toe or two. However, habits of affluent consumption in an island of such narrow manufacturing resources could have us in hot pursuit of the seven hectare ecological footprints of places such as Iceland and Singapore.</P>
    <P>Not only is Ireland becoming less sufficient in terms of wasting energy and failing the most vulnerable people, Irish reliance on exports to long haul destinations means our economy is now more vulnerable than ever to a worldwide rise in oil prices. The OECD has warned us once again that a slump in our economy is approaching. The advice from the OECD, to remove disincentives to boosting labour supply and improve energy efficiency, are in line with the Green Party pre-budget submission. By ignoring this advice, the Government is turning the Celtic tiger into a Celtic ostrich.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech is a classic example of ostrich thinking. The magazine, <i>The Economist</i>, hardly a radical journal, realised back in 1989 that GDP and GNP alone are misleading measurements. No one is surprised that GDP and GNP are increasing but, in green terms, this is a result of selling the family silver &ndash; companies such as Eircom &ndash; and burning bits of the house as fuel, indicated by our reliance on oil which is greater than ever.</P>
    <P>However, the index of sustainable economic welfare has been decreasing since 1974 &ndash; the Minister made no reference to that &ndash; in terms of gridlock and transport, which have been well discussed already in the House, energy inefficiency, Ireland being second from the bottom of the list of developed countries in that regard, our Kyoto obligations in tatters and waste, which is rising at more than 4% each year with no meaningful measures to minimise it and, as was mentioned, plastic bags still going unhindered and untaxed, in spite of Government promises.</P>
    <P>There is also the cost of TB eradication over the years, which has been a scandal. The Minister mentioned dealing with BSE, but he will not say what is the cost. The sky is the limit. I predict that, in future, in biopatenting of life there will be another open-ended cheque when the effects of that begin to be felt in the long term.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="975" /> Anyone unfortunate enough to be struck down by illness or injury will know and understand how the Fordham index of social health is also deteriorating and has been since 1974. Again, it is no surprise that the Minister did not mention that measurement.</P>
    <P>Giving medical cards to all those over 70 sounds wonderful to Government backbenchers and there will be many who will be offered peace of mind, but it is no guarantee of treatment. Primary health care is suffering as vacancies for medical and nursing staff remain unfilled. I know, for example, the town of Balbriggan is losing night time doctor's services as doctors rationalise and retreat to Drogheda. How is a medical card holder of 70 years of age to get to the Cottage Hospital in Drogheda from Balbriggan and surrounding areas in north County Dublin at 2 a.m.? That medical card is about as useful to that person as it would be in a game of patience.</P>
    <P>Hospital facilities in Tallaght Hospital cannot handle the demands for treatment. My brother, who is seriously ill and is a VHI contributor, spent a second day yesterday on a trolley in a corridor, while others were left on chairs. His drip was suspended from a coat hanger. I was told Tallaght Hospital has 100 fewer beds than the three hospitals it replaced. Clearly a medical card is cold comfort to many people facing that service. The Minister omitted to tell the Dáil that Ireland spends less than the GNP EU average on health.</P>
    <P>Naturally additional allocations to services are to be welcomed, but they are cold comfort to those who see others prosper while their lives become more vulnerable and stressful. As a rapporteur on the Committee on Education and Science report on school transport, I welcome the measure from the Minister to reduce the three mile limit eligibility rule to two miles. However, he did not go further and, for example, give an allocation to adult escorts on buses, to buses needing to be renewed, to increase the capacity of buses so that each secondary pupil can have a seat, or to install safety belts for all pupils.</P>
    <P>The reality of the budget is that, as it does not address the problem of teacher shortages, resulting teacher mobility means teachers will be attracted away from disadvantaged schools to teach in more comfortable school environments. The Minister can then perform the most bizarre of political tricks. He can announce allocations of additional resources for hundreds, even thousands, of new positions safe in the knowledge that, given the inadequate payscales for teachers, the vacancies are certain not to be filled and the budget allocation will remain as safe as gold in Fort Knox.</P>
    <P>In the area of child care, again we are disappointed with the Government ignoring the enormous need for community based crèches by confining its allocation of funds to Civil Service workplaces. Obviously any improvement is welcome but, on the other hand, work mobility is a reality and is being encouraged, so focusing solely <Col N="976" /> on workplace crèche facilities is a recipe for insecurity for children as well as their parents.</P>
    <P>Many of those parents will be sadly disappointed, especially the majority of the public sector and those in &ldquo;yellow pack&rdquo; jobs in the private sector, when they see a missed opportunity to take those on minimum wages out of the tax net. The cost of decreasing the top rate of tax by 2%, if used instead to increase personal allowances, would have removed practically all minimum wage earners from the tax net.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has, in reality, again widened the gap between two income families and stay at home parents. He has increased the standard rate band for two income married families by £6,000, yet he only increased it for one income married families by £1,000 and did nothing for stay at home parents. He has widened the gap considerably for parents who wish to care for their children at home. The child benefit increases are of no benefit as all families will receive the same increase.</P>
    <P>On social welfare, although old age pensions and social welfare payments are increased by 10%, the cumulative effect over the past three years means that, because of extremely high inflation figures, social welfare recipients have not had the proportionate increase given to wage earners. In the wake of the failed Hague conference on greenhouse gases and the floods and storms and the threat of their continuing devastation, the reduction in excise duty on fuel sends out the wrong message because it will increase greenhouse gas emissions and gridlock and has not been matched by proportionate supports for public transport.</P>
    <P>Is the Government aware that buses and trains are not stopping at bus stops and in towns due to overcrowding and that towns like mine are growing from 11,000 to 40,000 in population? Where are the incentives to take up and create local employment? The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has made little or no use of economic instruments to address pollution and transport issues. The Government refuses to introduce the necessary fiscal measures to rescue our deteriorating environment and health.</P>
    <P>Overall, good economic growth should not impoverish one, yet the Government's policies have increased our dependence on energy consumption and have created gridlock. We have created a waste management crisis and a crisis in our health and education systems. The Green Party calls for a system of economic measurement which provides quality of life and health indicators. Sadly, the Government has squandered its largesse, like a drug addict, addicted to fossil fuel consumption and growth for the sake of growth in a finite system. The Government has hitched the country to the chariot of globalisation, but this cannot be sustained. I appeal for a change in a sustainable direction based on regional self-reliance. This and future generations will depend upon such a change.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>(1) THAT in this resolution&ndash;</P>
      <P>Act of 1997 means the Finance Act, 1997 (No. 22 of 1997);</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Act of 1999&rdquo; means the Finance Act, 1999 (No. 2 of 1999);</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Act of 2000&rdquo; means the Finance Act, 2000 (No. 3 of 2000).</P>
      <P>(2) THAT the rebate of duty on mineral hydrocarbon light oil provided for in section 56(3) of the Finance Act, 1988 (No. 12 of 1988) shall, as respects mineral hydrocarbon light oil on which it is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that duty at the rate specified in section 89 (2) of the Finance Act, 1998 (No. 3 of 1998) has been paid on or after 7 December 2000, be calculated at the rate of £86.92 per 1,000 litres and Schedule 2 to the Act of 1999, as inserted by the Act of 2000, is amended by the substitution of &ldquo;£274.44 per 1,000 litres&rdquo; for &ldquo;£294.44 per 1,000 litres&rdquo; opposite the reference to Light Oil: Unleaded petrol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3) THAT the duty of excise on hydrocarbon oil imposed by paragraph 12(1) of the Imposition of Duties (No. 221) (Excise Duties) Order, 1975 (S.I. No. 307 of 1975), shall, in lieu of the rate specified in section 82(5) of the Act of 1997, be charged, levied and paid, as on and from 7 December 2000 at the rate of £196.14 per 1,000 litres and Schedule 2 to the Act of 1999, as inserted by the Act of 2000, is amended by the substitution of &ldquo;£196.14 per 1,000 litres&rdquo; for &ldquo;£256.14 per 1,000 litres&rdquo;<Col N="979" /> opposite the reference to Heavy Oil: Used as a propellant.</P>
    <P>(4) THAT the duty of excise on substitute motor fuel imposed by section 116(2) of the Finance Act, 1995 (No. 8 of 1995), shall, in lieu of the rate specified in section 82(6) of the Act of 1997, be charged, levied and paid, as on and from 7 December 2000 at the rate of £196.14 per 1,000 litres and Schedule 2 to the Act of 1999, as inserted by the Act of 2000, is amended by the substitution of &ldquo;£196.14 per 1,000 litres&rdquo; for &ldquo;£256.14 per 1,000 litres&rdquo; opposite the reference to Substitute Fuel: Used as a propellant.</P>
    <P>(5) IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>This resolution provides for a reduction in the excise duty rate of 2p per litre on unleaded petrol which, when VAT is included, amounts to 2.42p per litre with effect from midnight and a reduction in the excise duty rate of 6p per litre on auto diesel which, when VAT is included, amounts to 7.26p per litre with effect from midnight. There is also an excise duty reduction on substitute motor fuel which, when VAT is included, amounts to 7.26p per litre with effect from midnight.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made to reflect these reductions in the consolidated mineral oil tax legislation in the Finance Act, 1999. That legislation is not yet in operation. It will be commenced by ministerial order when the necessary secondary legislation and Revenue staff instructions are finalised.</P>
    <P>It is expected that both these reduction measures will cost the Exchequer £8.4 million in 2000 and £162.3 million in a full year. The combined effect on the consumer price index &ndash; CPI &ndash; of these two measures will be a reduction of 0.2%.</P>
    <P>An EU Council directive obliges member states to apply minimum rates of excise duty on mineral oils. The reduction in the auto diesel rate, which will bring the revised rate down to almost the agreed EU minimum level, will be of significant benefit to the road haulage sector as well as to other users of diesel such as coach tour operators.</P>
    <P>The total tax take from these two commodities will reduce further on 1 January 2001 as a result of the proposed reduction in VAT from 21% to 20%. The overall tax reduction in the price of a litre of unleaded petrol will be 3.02p and in a litre of auto diesel it will be 7.81p per litre.</P>
    <P>As stated in the Budget Statement by the Minister for Finance, the Government is anxious to encourage the use of low sulphur diesel for <Col N="980" /> environmental reasons. While the proposed excise duty rate reduction of 6p per litre will apply to all diesel for the present, it is proposed that in the future this lower rate will apply to low sulphur diesel only. Such a differentiation in excise duty rates requires EU approval which will be sought in the very near future. The intervening period should allow oil companies to make provision for nationwide availability of this fuel and to allow transport operators sufficient time to make the switch to the cleaner more environmentally friendly fuel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister decided to tackle this issue as the price of diesel is exerting immense pressure on overhead costs for indigenous industry, particularly road hauliers, many of whom have 12 month contracts. This is causing huge problems for them and has an effect on inflation. The Tánaiste's objective of attracting industries to the regions will be helped by this resolution, which will help to reduce the barrier.</P>
      <P>Why has a reduction in duty on rape seed oil diesel not been considered? Why should the excise duty on renewable energy sources be the same as that for hydrocarbons? This does not encourage the use or development of such technology, although I am aware that Maxol has developed the rape seed oil diesel technology to a certain degree. Why are we not encouraging its development and use by reducing the excise duty on renewable energy sources? The Government should have considered an additional reduction in the resolution to encourage the introduction of low sulphur into this market and the development of engines which are more efficient in using diesel. I had hoped the Minister would address that.</P>
      <P>I welcome in principle the Tánaiste's comments on road hauliers. Perhaps she will address the Brit disc issue because it will have a direct impact on our exports and on road hauliers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party will oppose this motion. It is presented by the Government as a reduction in the prices of diesel and petrol. A few weeks ago, however, the Government published its national climate change strategy to great fanfare. It told us what we already know, that this planet is in danger from the increase in greenhouse gases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country is way ahead of the targets that were agreed in Kyoto. The increase in emissions resulting from the growth in private transport in this country is contributing enormously to the increase in greenhouse gas emissions. We must reduce them. The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, when he announced the strategy, said we would have to change our ways and consider various types of green taxation. There were also undertakings in previous budgets that sometime in the <Col N="981" /> future the Government would introduce some form of eco or green taxes.</P>
    <P>The opportunity to do that was presented in this budget. However, there is no mention of the introduction of green taxation. Second, there is no mention of the climate change strategy in the Budget Statement or the accompanying documents. There was a commitment in the programme for Government that policies would be eco audited but there is no reference to that in the budget. An audit has been done, quite rightly, on the national poverty strategy but there is no eco audit in the budgetary provisions. There is a Government policy and strategy in relation to sustainability but there is no reference to sustainability in the budget.</P>
    <P>This budget forgot the environment. The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, was in The Hague last week to support the European position at the conference in relation to the Kyoto targets. On climate change, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, is beginning to sound a little like Deputy O'Dea on taxis, great at the conference in The Hague but with no impact at the Cabinet table in relation to this motion. This resolution is a step in the wrong direction. The Minister said hard decisions will have to be taken if we are serious about our climate change strategy. This is one such decision but it has not been taken. The Government is taking the softer option by postponing its concern for the environment. It is acting contrary to its published climate change strategy.</P>
    <P>It is a sad irony that the Tánaiste, who claims credit for ridding Dublin of its smog problem, is the proposer of this resolution. She told the House what it will cost. Will she tell us what impact the proposal will have on the targets in the national climate change strategy, particularly the targets for greenhouse gas emissions caused by the private transport sector? What assessment has been made by the Government in relation to those targets?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>I do not support the imposition of indirect taxes on certain items as a mechanism for controlling their use. That is not the way it should be done. Alternative methods must be found so I am not opposing the Government's proposal.</P>
      <P>The imposition of taxation, even on cigarettes which are bad for one's health, is a discrimination against low paid workers in particular. If hydrocarbon taxes were increased today, for example, it would be an imposition on working people who have no alternative in present circumstances but to use their car. That is the sad reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with much of Deputy Gilmore's contribution. The targets for reducing air pollution must be met. I bitterly regret, therefore, that while the Government reduced taxation in this area, there were no complementary measures to <Col N="982" /> reduce the amount of pollution put into the air as a result of the current traffic problem. There was a mention of public transport but in the national plan spending in that area is still hugely inadequate relative to the amount spent on roads. A huge shift to public transport in terms of both goods and passengers is a critical means of reducing the amount of fossil fuel being used and the amount of air pollution being generated.</P>
    <P>I am bitterly disappointed the Government did not propose a substantial investment in research and development of alternatives to diesel and petrol for passenger and haulage vehicles. The oil companies which dominate the market in hydrocarbons have no interest in reducing pollution. The opposite is the case. Their super profits are generated by increased use of these fuels. The State should step in. There are many ideas and possibilities and plenty of talent. A huge investment should have been made today in research and development of alternative fuels. The nod in the direction of the hybrid engine technology is wholly inadequate.</P>
    <P>On a day when the Government had a large surplus to distribute, it missed a major opportunity to strike a blow for environmental conservation. I hope the Minister will think again when formulating the Finance Bill and arrive at a more enlightened and effective strategy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure is an advertising dream for the oil companies. They can continue in their business in the usual frame of mind. They will try to convince people, and succeed to some extent, that they have suddenly become environmentally concerned and are opting for sustainability. That is living in denial. It has similarities with drug addiction and switching from heroin to methadone. Regardless of what analogy one wishes to use, this is simply a way of postponing the radical changes that are needed under the guise of an environmental measure.</P>
      <P>That is a sad and short-sighted way of dealing with the warning signs being given in stark clear terms that unless we curtail the burning of fossil fuels we will regret it in terms of the weather, the vulnerability of an economy that will have to deal with large increases in oil prices or through the fines that will be imposed on us if and when an agreement is reached when The Hague conference next reconvenes. The renewables, such as rape seed oil, are still seen as hydrocarbons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the big failing, that the Minister, even as a minimal measure, could have adopted this in the budget. That has resulted in other countries, fellow member states in the European Union, particularly Germany, France and Italy, developing industries which are very competitive and rewarding from an economic as well as an environmental point of view, in the rapeseed oil type sector. However, in Ireland, people who are pioneering that, such as people in Teagasc and <Col N="983" /> the private sector, are frustrated to the point they are giving up. They do not see the Government as being interested in renewable fuels. In general they feel that we are far too late in developing our options in that area in that only 2% has been given as an EU target for the development of renewable fuels. Some 2% of our vehicular fuel needs are to come from the likes of rape seed oil and those countries are gobbling up the quota as quickly as they can. We could have developed this and we could have done something, very simply, by having less excise &ndash; or none &ndash; on rape seed oil. However, once again we missed the boat, which is a crying shame.</P>
    <P>The global warming predicament, as mentioned by Deputies Gilmore and Higgins, presents us with a crisis that we simply are not capable of comprehending. The Minister for Finance has shown, in a fairly predictable but sad manner, that he is not able to contemplate the changes that are not optional but required. That is the saddest legacy of this flawed budget. This measure does nothing but rub salt in the wounds, indicating there is concern when in fact the concern is so thin that it is meaningless.</P>

      <P>The Road Hauliers' Association, compared with road hauliers' associations across Europe and particularly in Britain, was restrained and entered into dialogue with the Government, there was no confrontation. In this instance it is essential to recognise the facts of life, that there is a very poor network of railways. In Cavan, Donegal and all that area, there is no way of transporting products from Donegal across the mid-west other than by road.</P>
      <P>Similarly my area, south Offaly, has no rail service. There is quite a good rail service from both Tullamore to Dublin and Portlaoise to Dublin but it should be upgraded and improved. With regard to this measure, we must recognise that once imported oil prices go up, the cost of transport of essential items, such as bread, butter and milk, with an increase in the cost of petrol and diesel, will also go up.</P>
      <P>The reduction in VAT is essential. Our party proposed a reduction from 21% to 19%. It should be 18% but 19% would have been a change of some importance. The Minister has brought it down to 20% which is welcome but he should have gone a stage further. With inflation and everything else, it would be of great benefit to have reduced it to 19%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overall with regard to this, we are talking about hydrocarbons and substitute motor fuel. <Col N="984" /> The Minister's speech sadly lacks anything in regard to research into alternative fuels which is a pity. He talked about hybrid engine technology and so on, but more time and money should be devoted to researching alternative fuels. I fully accept the problems of the greenhouse gas emissions and the problem we are facing but regrettably, the Government has done very little research in this important area.</P>
    <P>The Government has set aside £3.6 billion for roads&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Precisely. That is what I am saying. We are talking about goods and items that will be transported by road. We should have been moving on this and there is nothing in this document that will assist it. The transport cost of these items by rail would have been far greater and there is a provision of only £2.25 billion for public transport infrastructure. That is an area where we should be heading and it would mean using far less fuels causing so much emissions.</P>
      <P>All in all, I welcome what the Minister is attempting to do but the rate should have gone down from 21% to 19%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The most effective way to ensure that people are less dependent on their private motor vehicles is to put in place a decent transport system. Unfortunately, in the past we were very negligent in this area and many of our railways were run down. That is why there is such a heavy emphasis, both in the Government's plans and policies and particularly the national development plan, on putting in place, countrywide, a decent transport system and upgrading our road network because, with better roads, there is a more efficient use of public and private vehicles.</P>
      <P>It is not correct to say that the Minister gave no attention to the environment in his address. This measure is being implemented for two reasons. One is because of the unprecedented rise in oil prices internationally and the huge burden and difficulties that is placing on the haulage and tour operator section of our community. It is also being done as an anti-inflationary measure. For example, a truck with a 500 litre tank will save £35 as a result of the measures we are taking here.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the new hybrid engine technology for which he intends to bring incentives forward in the Finance Bill. That reduces emissions and conserves energy. He is proposing that half of vehicle registration tax would be refunded for a two year period for the purchasers of new hybrid engine technology. I strongly support that as it is the appropriate way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As it happens, the growth rate of petrol consumption in Ireland is in decline. In 1998, for <Col N="985" /> example, the growth was about 11.65% over the previous year, in 1999, it was 8.5% and this year it is forecast perhaps to be 7.9%. That is because we have more environmentally friendly vehicles that are using fuel far more efficiently, which I welcome.</P>
    <P>In relation to renewable resources, a number of years ago I understand that incentives, which I do not remember, were included in the Finance Bill for experimental biofuel programmes and they were largely ignored. Only one small programme involving a handful of vehicles was initiated but, in spite of several discussions with potential operators about possible initiatives some years ago, no operator came forward and the sector lapsed in 1995. For technical reasons, we must include &ldquo;substitute motor fuel&rdquo; such as bio-fuels here but, unfortunately, they are not in use in Ireland today.</P>

      <P>The proposed imposition of the UK disc could have a major impact on Irish hauliers and may lead to internal market difficulties. I understand that no indication has yet been received of the rate which will apply. The UK has the highest rate of excise on diesel in the EU, even after the recent reductions there. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions called for these measures, as did members of the Fine Gael Party whom I thank for their consistency. We are not all always consistent in politics.</P>

    <P>This resolution provides for an excise duty increase of 2.6p per packet of 20 cigarettes which, when VAT is included, amounts to 3.1p with pro rata increases on other tobacco products with effect from midnight on 31 December 2000. This increase is to off-set the proposed reduction in the rate of VAT on both products from 21% to 20%.</P>
    <P>The net effect of this compensatory increase measure will be that on average the retail price of these products will remain unchanged. Cigarette prices have increased in recent years by significantly more than the increase in the CPI. The highest ever single increase was imposed last year. Over the past ten years tax inclusive prices increased by approximately 82% while the CPI increased by nearly 26%. Over the same period the average tax content of cigarette prices has been about 76.5%. Therefore, taxes have played a major role in increasing the price of cigarettes and are helping dampen consumption.</P>
    <P>The Government remains very concerned about smoking and its continued adverse effects on health and health spending. In these circumstances it was decided that smokers should not benefit from the proposed reduction in the VAT rate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael will oppose the resolution because the Government has shown it has absolutely no coherent health policy to tackle the problems of tobacco consumption. The Joint Committee on Health and Children published a report in November 1999, which as rapporteur I had the privilege of writing, which was unanimously accepted by all parties represented on the committee. The report, which was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, highlighted the fact that there are approximately 7,000 tobacco related deaths in the country annually and that there was a huge upsurge in smoking by teenagers, particularly teenage girls. In the age cohort 15 and 17 years, the number of girls smoking has practically reached 40%. The figure is approximately 40% in the cohort 18 to 35 years, in the context of the overall average number of people smoking, both men and women, although far more women than men smoke.</P>
      <P>The joint committee recommended that there should be annual price increases imposed on packets of 20 cigarettes. This was recommended as all research in the area has shown that in the context of young people becoming addicted to tobacco, many starting smoking at 12, 13 or 14 years of age, their capacity to purchase cigarettes is price sensitive. Research endorsed by the WHO illustrated quite clearly that there is a need for a continuing annual increase in the price of tobacco products to act as a disincentive in terms of young people and to reduce the impact of tobacco addiction and smoking related disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the Minister for Finance added an additional tax to tobacco products. He did so pri<Col N="991" /> marily because of the publicity arising from the joint committee's report and the public hearings of the committee which illustrated the extent of our problem in terms of tobacco related disease, and the extent of the huge family difficulties and traumas created. In implementing what is proposed the Minister failed, as is often the case with the Government, to take the full proposal of the committee on board. The committee was conscious that tobacco products, and cigarettes in particular, are included in the basket of items which make up the CPI. In recommending annualised increases in cigarette taxes the committee simultaneously recommended that tobacco should be taken out of the CPI basket. The Minister provided for a price increase, which was welcomed by this side of the House, but failed to take cigarettes out of the basket. As a consequence it is estimated he added between 0.8% and 1% to the consumer price index. The only reason there was no increase in the price of tobacco products in the budget is because the Minister for Finance, in the 13 months since the report of the joint committee was published, has failed to address the issue of removing cigarettes from the basket of products which goes to calculate the CPI. The Belgian Government removed cigarettes some considerable time ago to good effect.</P>
    <P>In her speech the Tánaiste recognised that an increase in tobacco prices is designed to dampen the demand for tobacco products. The Minister referred very briefly to health problems. The Irish Cancer Society, the Irish Heart Foundation, Ash and a whole series of other organisations, which do very important work in this area, support the proposition that there should be annualised price increases on packets of cigarettes. The total failure of the Government to address this issue in a comprehensive way and to implement recommendations supported by all the Fianna Fáil members represented on the Joint Committee on Health and Children means that a policy that the Government seemed to start, which was welcomed on this side of the House last year, has been brought to a halt.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance apparently only suddenly realised the importance of the consumer price index issue. He said in his budget speech that he would consider it. If Belgium could address this issue, there is no reason this State should not have addressed it. An increase should have been put on the price of tobacco products in this budget and the next budget and we should not apologise for it because increasing the price of tobacco products acts as a disincentive to young people purchasing cigarettes and, I hope, ensures that in future years we will suffer to a lesser degree from tobacco related disease.</P>
    <P>To date the Government has addressed, in a piecemeal way, some of the problems that need <Col N="992" /> to be addressed in dealing with cigarettes and smoking related disease. It has treated the report of the joint committee as a restaurant menu and taken and implemented two or three of its recommendations. Some of the reports' recommendations were replicated in a report the Minister for Health and Children published three months after the publication of the report of the joint committee.</P>
    <P>The majority of recommendations and proposals to tackle the problem, particularly that of young people addicted to tobacco, have not been implemented. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment can correct me if I am wrong, but I think it is estimated that in excess of £1 billion in taxes were acquired by the State last year from taxes imposed on tobacco products. Despite that level of funding having been acquired, to date not one of the recommendations in that report on joint initiatives by schools and health boards to provide smoking cessation programmes in secondary schools have been implemented. It remains the case that people addicted to tobacco products cannot get products to help them come off that addiction through chemist shops by way of a medical card or under the £42 per month health benefit that can be reclaimed.</P>
    <P>The Government has tinkered with the issue. Tonight a message has gone out that it is not serious about this issue, that much of what the Minister for Health and Children has been saying about the tobacco issue has been a public relations exercise, designed to genuflect in the direction of work the joint committee undertook over a period of 18 months, but it lacks serious and coherent intent.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that it was only three weeks ago he was reported in one of the major weekly medical papers as being in favour of the removal of cigarettes from the consumer price index. He was praised for the approach he articulated. It is clear that what he then said was pre-budget public relations blather and was not part of Government policy. It was assumed by many people that in conducting that interview and stating that as a policy, he was speaking on behalf of the Government. It was expected by Fine Gael that the Minister for Finance would have announced in the budget that tobacco products were to be removed from the basket of items from which the consumer price index is calculated. It was anticipated and expected that an additional minimum 50p tax would be imposed on a packet of 20 cigarettes. It is most regrettable the Government is not doing that. It is sending out the wrong message from this House and it is undermining the work being done by the health community, including organisations such as the Irish Heart Foundation, Ash and the Irish Cancer Society.</P>

      <P>Deputy Shatter has spoken fairly comprehensively on this issue, but actions speak louder than words in this area. This is a serious public health issue. It is clear from all the evidence that young people are becoming more and more addicted to cigarette smoking. It is a particular problem in the case of young women &ndash; the World Health Organisation has recognised this. Enormous amounts of money are invested by international advertisers in this area. In every magazine there are advertisements targeted at young women and we see the results. More and more young women are smoking. It is also very clear from research &ndash; Deputy Shatter also made this point &ndash; that annualised increases on this product should be part and parcel of any Government policy in this area. If we are serious about dealing with the major public health issues involved, the major individual health costs, the major cost to the State and coherence in Government policy, I am sure the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will agree, on reflection, it was a mistake not to have moved forward in the budget on this issue by way of an annualised increase.</P>

      <P>I join my colleagues in their criticism of the Minister for Finance for not removing this item from the basket of goods from which the cost of living index is calculated. When large increases are imposed on the price of tobacco products, the revenue collected should be spent in the area of health care. There has been no evidence during the past year that the additional revenue collected was spent in that area. In every other country where severe measures such as this were taken, there is no indication that the revenue collected was spent in the area of health care or on what areas it was spent. It is ridiculous that the price of tobacco products will be increased while no action will be taken to discourage people from taking up the habit of smoking by way of initiatives in schools and hospitals and by national advertising on the electronic and television media. I am unhappy there is no absolute evidence of a willingness in the Department of Health and Children, to which this additional revenue should be allocated, to do something about cigarette smoking which is so harmful to everyone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their interventions. Ireland has the second highest level of excise duty on cigarettes in the EU, 146.34 per 1,000 cigarettes compared with an EU average of 90.35. Notwithstanding what Deputy Shatter said about the consumer price index &ndash; the Minister referred to it in his budget speech &ndash; the consumer price index is drawn up following the household budget survey which is based on a calculation of what people spend their money on. <Col N="994" /> A total of 4.8% of the spend in Ireland is on cigarettes.</P>
      <P>As constituency representatives, many Members will be aware &ndash; it has frequently been my experience &ndash; that when constituents come to talk about their financial circumstances concerning housing or some other matter, they may have a piece of paper with a list of their outgoings per week or per month and I am often astonished that one of the big spend items for many people on very low incomes is cigarettes. It is not infrequent that people on relatively low incomes spend £40 to £50 a week on cigarettes, which is incredible.</P>
      <P>Last year we introduced a 50p increase on the price of a packet of 20 cigarettes. That was done for health reasons and £132 million collected in revenue went to the health services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">

      <P>The consumption of cigarettes went down last year by 1.66%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>That is because the price of them was increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit we are not doing that this year in order to curb inflation. We had several discussions about breaching confidentiality in this matter in relation to cigarettes. The CPI is compiled by the CSO, which also compiles a figure that excludes cigarettes. That is ignored. The international way of compiling the CPI, both here and in Europe, includes people's expenditure on particular product and cigarettes form a high proportion of what people spend their money on in Ireland, as is the case in other European countries.</P>
      <P>If the Minister excluded it and made a unilateral decision informing the CSO accordingly we would probably be accused of fiddling the figures to get inflation down. I admit we have a number of strategies, including health strategies. Prices alone will not dictate whether people continue to smoke and a number of measures have been taken, such as the banning of advertising and the ten-cigarette pack. The latter is used by younger people in particular as they do not have the money for the larger pack, so that is being done to discourage smoking among the very young and particularly among young women. Many of the latter smoke for weight-related reasons. Instead of having a biscuit, glass of wine or other dessert they have a cigarette. We need to engage in a very active and aggressive health education campaign in relation to cigarette smoking. It is not just about the price, though price has a huge part to play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Government took office, health service spending was £2.75 billion and as a result of today it has gone to £5.29 billion, almost double. <Col N="995" /> There are real issues regarding improvement in service as a result of the increased spending but we have not been found wanting regarding the money we have earmarked and ring fenced for the health services.</P>
    <P>The tax take for cigarettes is more than £1 billion. It is £1.023 billion, a considerable amount of money. The price of cigarettes has risen much faster than the CPI, increasing by 49.9% since 1990, while next year it is envisaged that consumption will be down by another 0.5%. I admit openly that the only reason the price of cigarettes is not going up is the effect it would have on the CPI and the effect it would have on inflation. As Deputy Shatter has acknowledged, it has added almost one percentage point to the rate of inflation in the past year, though that will be out of the equation after next month. From the Government's point of view health must be a priority. Cancer and heart disease are caused by smoking but speakers have mentioned inflation already, and will probably mention it again when debating the next financial motion. There are a number of things we need to do and the Minister gave a commitment to look at how the CPI is compiled. I am not sure if we can move in that direction. They have not been able to do so in Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Tánaiste on her honesty, though I am absolutely appalled by what she just said. She confirmed to the House that the reason there is no additional imposition of taxes on cigarette products is not for health reasons but because the Government is fearful of the impact on the CPI. For the sake of the CPI the Government is prepared to sacrifice the health of our young people. For the sake of the CPI the Government is willing to allow more people suffer serious cancers such as throat cancer or cardiovascular disease. Let us look at the logic of what the Tánaiste said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Tánaiste is concerned with health issues this matter could have been dealt with in a better and more coherent way which would have resulted in praise from this House for a coherent health policy. To tackle part of the problem of the CPI my party proposed some weeks ago that the VAT rate be reduced from 21% to 19%. The Government has chosen to reduce the VAT rate to 20%. In the context of dealing with tobacco <Col N="996" /> products and health issues, if the Government were taking a comprehensive overall policy view and there was genuine concern about averaging our VAT rates to a level that was in synchronisation with other EU countries while also maintaining a dynamic health policy, a choice could have been made. The choice could have been to reduce the VAT rate to 19% and to impose an additional 50p tax on a packet of cigarettes. Cigarettes could have been kept within the basket and a major problem with the CPI would not have been created.</P>
    <P>The other choice arose 13 months ago when an Oireachtas joint committee unanimously recommended that tobacco products be taken out of the CPI. The Tánaiste was concerned that she or the Minister for Finance would have been accused of massaging the figures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures relating to the price of cigarettes&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have been difficult to level that accusation from this side of the House in circumstances where this time last year Fine Gael's health spokesperson called for the removal of tobacco products from the CPI. Clearly that criticism could not have been levied.</P>
      <P>In the context of the overall figures, the average smoking rate among young women in their late teens and early 20s is approximately 40%, while it is somewhat below that for young men. According to the latest figures for the overall population, 34% of people smoke, which is one third of the population in practical terms; however, two thirds do not, so it does not figure in their annual cost of living index problems.</P>
      <P>The Government should have a coherent anti-tobacco health policy which is reflected in its financial policy approach. What this Government has is a piecemeal, hiccup policy where it occasionally dips into the area to take an initiative, though when it sees the consequences in the CPI it panics and draws back. I welcome the figures given to us by the Tánaiste, as they confirm something I have been saying for three years, something the Oireachtas Joint Committee accepted and something the World Health Authority articulated in 1998, which is: if one increases the price of tobacco products the level of consumption goes down. The Tánaiste confirmed that that has happened in the past 12 months but it will not happen in the next 12 months. Why? Because the Government did not get its act together and tackle the problem in a coherent way. That is a disgrace and is something that should have been properly addressed by now. All the public relations hand-wringing the Minister for Health and Children engages in on this issue has now been seen as having no substance or weight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="997" /> Deputy Carey raised the tobacco taxes issue earlier and the Tánaiste admitted the State took in more than £1 billion in tobacco taxes. The £132 million she mentioned derived from the 50p increase imposed on tobacco products last year but even that £132 million was not used to tackle the problem of tobacco consumption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It went into the health budget and the cardiac strategy. That strategy is valuable and important but is not solely tobacco-related. That £132 million was substitute finance going into the general area of health policy and the Tánaiste should inform us how much was used by the Government to engage in the &ldquo;active and aggressive&rdquo; education and advertising campaign she says is needed and which the joint committee called for. The Government has failed to put such a campaign in place in the past 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Tánaiste said is quite contradictory. She said smoking is a major public health issue but it appears from the budget that as soon as she had to make a critical decision she balked at it. The policy is in shreds because an annualised increase is a key component. The last time there was an increase in cost the decrease in the number of smokers was quite substantial. What we are seeing here tonight is a sacrifice of a major public health goal which the Government professes to have but when push comes to shove, it is taking a different policy decision in the budget tonight.</P>

That is a total change from the time I was at school when it was only the fellows who smoked &ndash; young girls did not smoke. That will have a long-term adverse effect on the health of the nation and has resulted in many of the difficulties women experience. The Minister got an extra £150 million in last year's budget to apply to preventing the growth in the use of tobacco by young girls, but nothing happened in that year.

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>(1) THAT in this Resolution&ndash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Principal Act&rdquo; means the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972 (No. 22 of 1972); &ldquo;Act of 2000&rdquo; means the Finance Act, 2000 (No. 3 of 2000).</P>
      <P>(2) THAT&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) the rate of value-added tax on the supply of certain goods and services at present chargeable at the rate of 21 per cent be decreased to 20 per cent of the amount on which tax is chargeable in relation to the supply of such goods and services, and</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) the rate of value-added tax on the supply of livestock and live greyhounds and the hire of horses be increased from 4.2 per cent to 4.3 per cent of the amount on which tax is chargeable in relation to the supply of such goods and services, and</P>
      <P>that, accordingly, subsection (1) (inserted by the Finance Act, 1992 (No. 9 of 1992)) of section 11 of the Principal Act be amended&ndash;</P>
      <P>(i)by the substitution in paragraph (a) of &ldquo;20 per cent&rdquo; for &ldquo;21 per cent&rdquo;, and</P>
      <P>(ii)by the substitution in paragraph (f) of &ldquo;4.3 per cent&rdquo; for &ldquo;4.2 per cent&rdquo; (inserted by the Act of 2000).</P>
      <P>(3)THAT the rate of flat-rate addition to the consideration in respect of the supply of agricultural produce or an agricultural service by a flat-rate farmer be increased from 4.2 per cent to 4.3 per cent, and that, accordingly, section 12A (inserted by the Value-Added Tax (Amendment) Act, 1978 (No. 34 of 1978)) of the Principal Act be amended by the substitution in subsection (1) of &ldquo;4.3 per cent&rdquo; for &ldquo;4.2 per cent&rdquo; (inserted by the Act of 2000).</P>
      <P>(4)THAT this Resolution shall have effect as on and from 1 January 2001.</P>
      <P>(5)IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
      <P>The resolution provides for a decrease to 20% on the supply of all 21%-rated goods and services such as cars, electrical goods, furniture and furnishes and telecommunications with effect from 1 January 2001. The standard rate was last changed in 1991 when it was reduced from 23% to 21%. The resolution also provides for an adjustment of 4.3% in the level of the flat rate farmer's refund together with a similar change in the VAT rate on the supply of livestock, live greyhounds or the hire of horses.</P>
      <P>All goods and services which are currently standard-rated will benefit from this reduction with the exception of tobacco. As already discussed, the excise duty on a packet of 20 cigarettes will be increased by 2.6 pence with <i>pro rata</i> increases for other tobacco products from 1 January 2001. The reduction in the standard rate will cost £159 million in 2001 and £191 million in a full year. The difference in cost is due to the way in which VAT is collected as returns for the fixed VAT period, November to December, will not be received until January 2002.</P>
      <P>It would be difficult to introduce a reduction in the standard rate on budget night because VAT is remitted by traders to the State on a two-monthly basis, January-February, March-April, etc., and the most suitable date on which to introduce it is 1 January 2001. The reduction is part of the Government's anti-inflationary strategy. The effect of a 1% reduction after allowing for the increase in tobacco excise is approximately 0.3%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the 1% reduction in the standard rate from 1 January 2001 there are also reductions of 2 pence per litre, 2.4 pence VAT-inclusive, in the excise duty on petrol and 6 pence per litre, 7.26 pence VAT-inclusive, in the duty <Col N="1003" /> on diesel with effect from midnight. These measures will reduce the CPI by 0.5%.</P>
    <P>With regard to the adjustment to 4.3% in the level of the flat rate farmer's refund, these changes will take effect from 1 January 2001 instead of the usual change on 1 March. This is intended to bring the changes in line with the reductions in the standard rate of VAT. The Revenue Commissioners have calculated, on the basis of macro-economic date for the past three years, that a flat rate of 4.3% is now needed to achieve full compensation. This change will cost £2.35 million in 2001.</P>
    <P>The flat rate scheme is a simplified and practical method of applying VAT to farming. It compensates unregistered farmers on an overall basis for the VAT charged to them on the purchase of goods and services. This is achieved without applying the normal VAT rules on registration, record keeping and returns. Traditionally, the VAT rate on livestock has been maintained at the same level as the flat rate addition. This is administratively more convenient to farmers and their customers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Government has introduced this resolution because it has not gone far enough. Prior to the budget Fine Gael proposed a 2% reduction in the standard rate of VAT from 21% to 19%. Our aim ultimately is to reduce the rate to 15%. We made a strong case for a 2% reduction. The average VAT rate throughout the European Union is 19.5%. The Minister for Finance pointed out in his Budget Statement that there were two reasons for the VAT reduction. The first was to alleviate the pressure on the CPI and the Tánaiste said there would be a 0.5% reduction.</P>
      <P>The second reason was to encourage the development of e-commerce. Ireland has prided itself on the fact that it has been a low tax economy attracting foreign investment and promoting the development of indigenous industry on that basis, yet despite the reduction in VAT, the rate is still above the EU average. That is why Fine Gael is opposed to it. We believe e-commerce should be encouraged, developed and promoted in Ireland and that Ireland should become a European e-commerce hub. We should aim to reduce VAT below the EU average initially and ultimately to reduce to 15% over time. That should have been done in the budget to achieve the aim of becoming the European centre of e-commerce. The Minister was sadly mistaken in stating the reason for the VAT reduction was the development of e-commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Software and digital services are easily traded over the Internet. Unless Ireland has a low VAT rate, VAT payments will not be made to the Exchequer because it is difficult to trace such transactions. If we had a low VAT rate, we could <Col N="1004" /> ensure such payments were made. Another issue is the difference in the VAT rate applied to digital products within the EU and outside it. An Irish company must pay VAT at the Irish rate if it exports digital products for sale in the US, yet VAT is not applied to US products sold over the Internet to Irish and EU customers. Irish and European industry is being discriminated against on those grounds. I hope a level playing pitch is created whereby VAT will not be charged on products exported by the EU but will be charged on US products imported by European countries.</P>
    <P>The 0.1% increase in the flat rate VAT refund is an insult to farmers and the agriculture industry, especially given the current crisis in the industry. Farmers have their backs to the wall. The food industry will have its back to the wall as a result of the crisis in the beef industry, which my colleague, Deputy Noonan, highlighted earlier. It is a gross miscalculation by the Government to have ignored indigenous industry which is the backbone of the economy and of the regions. It is extremely hypocritical of the Government, which speaks of developing the regions, not to come forward with proposals for the indigenous food industry and agricultural production which will be in a severe crisis in coming weeks.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister give a commitment that the reduction of 1% in VAT will be passed on to the consumer given that the Competition Authority is not adequately resourced? The Minister tried to clarify a point made by Deputy Noonan when he referred to the many vacancies in the Competition Authority. As that was the last response I received from the Minister on that, perhaps she could inform us if that has changed. It was not clarified by her colleague representing her yesterday at the joint committee meeting who ignored the issue of the under-resourcing of the authority. The authority can regulate this VAT reduction and can ensure it is passed on to the consumer. The aim of the proposal is to tackle inflation.</P>
    <P>However, the measure has not gone far enough. It should have focused on the issue of electronic commerce to encourage its development and there should have been a minimum reduction of 2%. The refund of 0.1% for the agricultural sector does not go far enough and is discriminatory as far as the industry is concerned. The farming community loses out where another element of PRSI is concerned and we will debate that tomorrow. We should have had a balanced approach to this and examined the issue of agriculture to ensure farm families were supported. That should be an aim of the Government but, sadly, it is not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>It is worthy to acknowledge anything which can be used as a counter-inflationary measure, such as a reduction in VAT. People who charge for services and who are registered for VAT, such as I, will ensure it is passed on. <Col N="1005" /> However, it is an area where more could have been done. From all the leaks, I thought the rate might have been reduced by 2%. However, I acknowledge that 1% is a start.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the tokenism in the budget towards rural people. The Government has shown scant regard for a cohort of people throughout the country, namely, the 140,000 full-time farmers of whom 100,000 are in the dry stock sector and of whom thousands now face oblivion because of a crisis not of their making. It adds insult to injury when people who are innocent victims stand to lose £120 to £140. The budget was an opportunity to show due recognition of the problem, if nothing else.</P>
      <P>I support the move towards an area based system of compensation payments. However, there are winners and losers in that and one group who lose out are mountain sheep farmers who have lost £3.5 million to £4 million. We are overflowing with cash and hardly know into which area to put it, yet we missed another opportunity today to recognise the plight and difficulty of people living in rural areas. I notice even simple things, like transport initiatives for rural people, always seem to be left to one side or for a further report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>That is it when it concerns rural people. They are forgotten. I intend to ensure they are not forgotten.</P>
      <P>A person may have given his or her life to a certain line of business, in whatever sector of the agricultural industry, may have put in his or her best efforts to pursue the most efficient and cost-effective methods of production and may have taken measures over the past four years while others did not, yet he or she is now left to the vagaries of a marketplace over which he or she has no control. We had an opportunity today to make a meaningful contribution.</P>
      <P>The number of farmers registered for VAT is only a few hundred, not thousands. We could have given them a 5% VAT rebate. It is not inconsistent with EU policy or it would have been taken up with us before. It has been in vogue for years with farmers ever since it began at 2% back in the 1980s. That was used as means of compensating unregistered farmers for the VAT charged on their goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This will go down as a black day when a Government awash with cash and spinning out of control as to how to sell the good news forgot the people who are Ireland's green oil, in metaphorical terms, when we do not have any other natural resource and nothing else on which to call. As Des Geraghty said on Monday night on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo;, there might come a time when there will be a slowdown in the boom and we will be dependent again on the food industry which makes a substantial contribution to the <Col N="1006" /> economy and in which the beef sector comprises 35% of gross agricultural output. What will it be like next year and why was the opportunity not taken to help this beleaguered sector at this stage? I do not understand it.</P>
    <P>There are many areas where this could have been done. Within social welfare, we made strong recommendations regarding the recognition of farm women and the role they play in farming. We wanted them recognised in the social welfare and taxation codes.</P>
    <P>There has been a rush to individualisation. The word has been changed in the Budget Statement and I can see why if a single income family is only entitled to a maximum of £29,000 in the standard rate tax band whereas a two income family is entitled to a maximum of £40,000. I would try to conceal it if I were the Government. However, the people will not fall for it hook, line and sinker. It is all right for me because I come from a two income family, but that is not the point. One must be concerned about the broader masses, the people who are less well off. That is where I and, I hope, the Labour Party, distinguish ourselves from the rush to individualisation as opposed to a <i>communautaire</i> and solidarity approach which should underpin policies in a time of plenty.</P>
    <P>Women on farms and in other areas of self-employment were forgotten in the budget and it is something which will come back to haunt the Government. It received a recommendation from the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food that farm family women and self-employed women in shops throughout the country should be recognised for social insurance contributions and in the taxation code, yet not a word was uttered.</P>
    <P>It is a poor day for rural Ireland and for farming communities who are in the throes of a major crisis not of their making. They have tried to comply with best practice. Had the Labour Party motion been accepted this night last week, it would have been another assurance to the markets in which we participate that we are one of the best in terms of compliance in our practices. I cannot understand why a miserable 0.1% was added to 4.2% to make it only 4.3%. It is an insult and will be remembered as such in rural areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am shocked that the rural community has been totally ignored. Crocodile tears have been shed about the difficulties in which farmers find themselves, yet here was an opportunity to do something about it. The 1% reduction in VAT deals with costs outside the farm, but the rate should have been reduced by 2%. Inflation is eroding the incomes of the elderly, the disabled and many others who have not been catered for very well in the budget. When one compares the £8 increase for the disabled <Col N="1007" /> against a £2,500 increase for someone earning £50,000, it raises many questions.</P>
      <P>In case the Tánaiste is unaware of the fact, animals cannot be sold at the present time. The market for culled cows has disintegrated and farmers will not be able to continue in the sector because there is no longer anybody to buy the animals. The value of those cows had fallen to such an extent that the VAT being paid on them is meaningless. If one gets a VAT refund on a cow worth £400 today, but which may fall in value to £100 in a few weeks' time, the 1% reduction means nothing.</P>
      <P>The Government had an opportunity to reduce VAT by at least 5%. The Tánaiste can cite all the figures and reasons she wants for not doing so, but it is being done on the Continent to ease the pressure on the farming community there. Farmers have been penalised more than others by the taxation structures because they do not receive the same tax allowances as the PAYE sector. Farm families are being discriminated against in that manner. The FIS has been improved but nothing is being done about the farm assist programme which has proved to be a farce and a disaster. In spite of all the difficulties, fewer people are working today than before the new scheme was introduced.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance had the greatest budget surplus ever available, yet farming families have been completely ignored. Farming is still one of the biggest industries in the country and, together with food production in general, is the linchpin of my constituency. We saw what happened in Tullyveagh and it is a major news item. The Cavan-Monaghan area has also been hit by the BSE issue. My colleague, Deputy Naughten, has said this matter will continue for a few weeks, but I think its effects will be felt for much longer. We are facing an abyss and unless major improvements are made nothing will save farmers. I know we cannot vote down this financial resolution but the Tánaiste should examine whether there is any other way to use the budget surplus to underpin the livelihoods of many thousands of small farm families so that they will not go out of business. The country will be glad of them in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the way in which value added tax increases costs, it should have been reduced to at least 19% in the budget. We must seriously consider methods of keeping inflation down, and one of the ways is through reducing VAT. In the long term we should be heading for a VAT rate of approximately 15%. It may cost money but, nevertheless, it is of great importance. No matter how one looks at the issue, the higher the rate of VAT, the greater its impact on consumer prices, including a range of important items for families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1008" /> With regard to VAT item B, I am amazed that the change is only 0.1%. The cost of this change in farmers' VAT on agricultural produce and services will be in the region of £2.35 million. The cost of the farmers' stock relief measure will be approximately £1 million in 2001. I am amazed the Government has not recognised the crisis currently facing the farming community. I do not want to be a Job's comforter or say other than positive things, but the VAT issue is so serious that unless considerable financial assistance is provided for farmers, we will be back in the House within six months to provide compensation for losses incurred because of the crisis in agriculture.</P>
    <P>Never before has the beef industry, which is so fundamental to our economy, faced such a threat. The Libyan contract is worth approximately £200 million, which demonstrates how serious is the loss of a market of such magnitude. Over the past week, farmers have contacted me because of the problems that are arising. Agriculture is still a very important industry, yet the farm stock relief measures and VAT changes are too minimal to help farmers who are going through this crisis. Farmers will be very angry with these provisions. Even at this stage, the Government should reassess the situation. Unless it does, more than 100,000 beef farmers will continue to face this threat. If the Government ignores this crisis, it will do so at its peril. It will also place the livelihoods of thousands of farming families across the country in jeopardy. The Government cannot allow that to happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what my colleagues have said, and in particular Deputy Crawford who provided a precise analysis of the current situation in rural areas. There was an expectation in the farming community that today's budget would signal a degree of hope and Government aspirations in relation to turning the crisis around, but it contains virtually nothing to answer the cry in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>If I am correct, the budget makes provision for an allowance for certain farming trainees. There will, unfortunately, be literally no take up of the allowance next year or in future years because, sadly, in recent weeks young people in rural Ireland can see no future in farming. It is important, therefore, that a signal is sent by the Tánaiste and her Government colleagues that the matter is being taken seriously, will be tackled and, I hope, resolved. This VAT rebate is only one small portion of what could be a possible solution. Already there is disappointment not only among the farming organisations, but, more importantly, among the farming community at the unbelievably small amount of finance poured into farming today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we cannot expect the Tánaiste alone to be aware of the full extent of the problems in <Col N="1009" /> rural Ireland, it must be recognised that in recent weeks and days there has not just been an absence of money among the farming community, but a total lack of hope. Some signals must, therefore, be sent by the Government over the next few days as to its intentions in this regard. Rural Ireland is crying out for leadership and a new direction. So far as the farming community is concerned, this has not been shown by today's budget.</P>
    <P>I express my disappointment at what we have heard from the Tánaiste's Government colleagues today. I appeal to her to take on board what she has heard from rural representatives. A response must be forthcoming and it must be significantly better than what we have heard today.</P>
    <P>I concur with my colleagues on the reduction in the rate of VAT from 21% to 20%. While it would be remiss of us not to welcome it as an <Col N="1010" /> improvement, it is neither large enough nor strong enough. I hope the Tánaiste will give us some idea as to whether there will be further reductions in VAT rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41, 45, 48, 51, 52, 59, 64, 73, 80, 112, 113, 114 and 115 together.</P>
      <P>On 20-21 November, my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, attended the capabilities commitment conference held in Brussels. The Minister for Foreign Affairs attended the General Affairs Council embodying security and defence elements and the associated conference meetings with the third countries wishing to contribute to the EU headline goal.</P>
      <P>The delegation otherwise comprised the relevant officials of my own Department, civil and military, led at assistant secretary level, and those of the Department of Foreign Affairs. The conference provided the opportunity for EU countries, including Ireland, to indicate formally the resources they can make available for potential humanitarian or crisis management operations. These contributions were made in the context of the voluntary headline goal agreed at the European Council at Helsinki last year.</P>
      <P>Ireland offered to contribute up to 850 members of the Defence Force to the headline goal from within our existing commitment of 850 personnel to the United Nations Standby Arrangements System. The largest element of the commitment involves a light infantry battalion of up to 750 personnel, along with an Army Ranger Wing platoon of 40, in addition to small numbers in national support, headquarters and observer elements which make up the remainder.</P>
      <P>A declaration by EU member states was issued after the conference which outlined progress to date on the elaboration of the voluntary goal in the lead-up to the Nice European Council. It clearly stated that the Union's contribution to international security would be made in keeping with the principles of the UN charter. Moreover, it reiterated that these steps did not imply the creation of a European Army.</P>
      <P>In summary, Ireland's contribution of up to 850 members of our Defence Forces does not in any way affect our long-standing policy of military neutrality to which the Government remains firmly committed. Nor is any mutual defence arrangement involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Participation by Ireland in any Petersberg mission remains a sovereign decision to be taken by the Government. The Government will decide on a case by case basis whether, when and how to commit either troops or other resources. In our <Col N="1016" /> interventions at the conference, Ireland reiterated these points and specified that in our case, in compliance with the terms of the relevant Irish legislation, we will participate only in missions authorised by the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The commitments made in relation to the EU headline goal must be seen in the context of Ireland's long-standing support for overseas peace support operations authorised by the United Nations. In this regard, the White Paper on Defence, published earlier this year, set out key elements of the Government's approach to overseas peace support operations and I wish to refer to a number of the most important and relevant elements.</P>
    <P>The White Paper sets out a comprehensive strategy for a reshaping and re-equipping of the Defence Forces to ensure that they are geared for the opportunities and challenges of the changing security and defence environment. This strategy embraces organisation, equipment, training and technology aspects. In this context, the White Paper contains the strategy for Defence Forces strength and organisation for the next ten years and concluded that the Defence Forces require a strength of 10,500 personnel, ready to fulfil current tasks at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>Ireland's commitment of up to 850 members of the Defence Forces to the EU headline goal is to be met from within the United Nations standby arrangements system commitment of 850 members on overseas service at any time. This overall UNSAS commitment will be met on an ongoing basis from the current approved strength of the Permanent Defence Force of 10,500 as agreed in the context of the White Paper on Defence.</P>
    <P>The White Paper detailed existing equipment programmes, including that for 40 new armoured personnel carriers. Future equipment requirements are already the subject of examination within my Department by the high level civil-military planning and procurement group established under the White Paper and are being funded from within the existing procurement financial provisions and savings realised from the reduction in Permanent Defence Forces personnel numbers. This programme will ensure that the Defence Forces are in a position to contribute to modern peace support operations.</P>
    <P>In relation to military training, the White Paper recognised that the primary focus of the Defence Forces when not engaged in operations is training and preparation. As a reflection of the defence and security environment, including developments in relation to the headline goal, increased emphasis will be placed on exercises stressing interoperability, procedures and doctrine.</P>
    <P>With regard to the financial position generally, the White Paper acknowledged the trend for many overseas peace support missions to be financed by the participating countries. This will increase the overall net cost of overseas operations in a situation where the proportion of mis<Col N="1017" /> sions with a reimbursement facility declines. The general strategy for the management of the Defence Vote within existing resources will set the context for all defence programmes, including overseas operations.</P>
    <P>On the question of participation by Air Corps and Naval Service elements in the EU Headline Goal, the position has been that the bulk of overseas commitments have in the past been met by the Army and this position is likely to pertain for the future. The precise contribution to be made by the Defence Forces will be considered on a case by case basis having regard to the requirements of the individual mission. Similarly the precise logistical and practical arrangements associated with the deployment of any of the headline goal commitments will depend on the type and nature of the mission in question.</P>
    <P>I would reiterate that Ireland's ongoing participation in the development of European security and defence policy is fully consistent with our policy of neutrality and our commitment to international peace and security. We therefore approach this task in a positive and constructive spirit. The planned contribution to the EU headline goal in no way degrades our commitment to UN peacekeeping. This contribution reinforces in a very conspicuous way our continued intention to support efforts to maximise international peace and stability. At a time when the UN increasingly looks to regional organisations to undertake peace support operations on its behalf, it is critical to support efforts at EU level to give effect to the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam. What is involved in developing the headline goal is no more than giving effect to the Treaty.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the recent Brahimi report on the overhaul of UN peace operations contains many points of similarity with the approach taken by the EU on capabilities, including rapid reaction. EU and UN processes should be mutually reinforcing. EU-UN relations in the military crisis management area &ndash; in relation to the Petersberg tasks &ndash; and the proposed structure for the rapid reaction force will be further developed during the forthcoming Swedish EU Presidency.</P>

      <P>Gormanston Aerodrome is currently used as an army and military aviation installation. While there has been a downgrading of its status for military flying purposes, in line with the recommendations of the PricewaterhouseCoopers review of the Air Corps, there will be a continuing requirement to retain its status as a military aerodrome. The retention of this facility for army purposes will remain and may increase. Proposals to establish a flying training organisation at Gormanston were considered by a steering group representing the Department of Public Enterprise, Department of Defence and the Irish Aviation Authority. A draft report was submitted in late July 2000 and is currently being examined by the Minister for Public Enterprise, myself and the Irish Aviation Authority.</P>
      <P>The steering group in the course of its deliberations did invite proposals from commercial interests for the establishment of an approved flight training organisation at the aerodrome. Four proposals were initially received of which two were subsequently withdrawn.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall strategy for the future development of the Reserve Defence Force will be based on the report of the special steering group, which I established in January 1998. That group reported in September 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I formally launched the steering group report on 25 November at a special southern region briefing in Thurles organised by the military authorities for serving members of the reserve. I attended a similar western region briefing in Athlone on Saturday last, 2 December. A third <Col N="1019" /> briefing will be held in Dublin early in the new year. The various recommendations contained in the steering group report have been accepted as providing a general foundation on which the development of the Reserve Defence Force can proceed in the future. A thorough, comprehensive and in depth study of the reserve was undertaken, involving a very considerable amount of work both by an original military board, established by the then Chief of Staff, and latterly by the steering group itself.</P>
    <P>The steering group met with each of the Permanent Defence Force representative associations and also met on three occasions with the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Defence recognised that a notable and important feature of the existing FCA organisation is a country-wide geographical spread. This particular aspect will, in general terms, be retained in the future. The full organisational and establishment details of the new Reserve Force, as envisaged by the steering group, will have to be determined in the course of a detailed implementation process. That process will comprehend the drafting and development of a Reserve Defence Force review implementation plan, which will be based on the steering group's report. The implementation of the structural and reorganisation changes, on the ground, will require about six years to bring to completion. This process will require the military authorities to bring forward recommendations and detailed proposals for the restructuring of local reserve units within each Army Brigade area.</P>
    <P>Given the dependence of the reserve on voluntary service, I was anxious that there should be an ongoing process of consultation before proposals are finalised. The military authorities have now started upon that process by way of the series of three preliminary regional briefings, and by the launch of the steering group report.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the White Paper, one important change recommended by the study of the reserve is that, in future, members of the reserve should be considered for participation in overseas peace support missions, subject to appropriate qualifications, availability and advance training. Service by comparable reservists on overseas peace support missions is quite common in other countries. However, the general criteria governing selection for overseas service are issues within the scope of representation. Therefore, any matters relating to proposals for future overseas service by members of the reserve, which come within the scope of representation, will be raised with the representative associations at the appropriate forum. In addition, the question of the security of civilian employment, for those members of the reserve who may wish to serve overseas, will have to be considered.</P>
    <P>In order that senior Reserve Defence Force officers can serve and influence reserve activities at the highest level, the steering group recom<Col N="1020" /> mended the creation of four new Lieutenant-Colonel appointments within the reserve, these appointments being part of the integrated element of the reserve.</P>
    <P>In general terms, the blueprint for the new Reserve Defence Force will involve replacing An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil with an Army reserve consisting of two elements. One element will provide personnel who will integrate with Permanent Defence Force units. Personnel who opt for a period of integrated service will be provided with enhanced military training. The larger element will provide the overall Army reserve, organised into three reserve brigades.</P>
    <P>An Slua Mui will be developed to provide a genuine Naval reserve capability based on a revised overall strength of up to 400 personnel. As a rationalisation measure, the two Dublin based companies of An Slua Mui will be amalgamated. The Naval Service, in conjunction with the Director of Reserve Forces, will formulate specific proposals to develop an integrated role for the re-organised An Slua Mui.</P>
    <P>Finally, one should really emphasise that the steering group was particularly mindful of the need to preserve and to retain the very many traditional and well established strengths of the current reserve system, not least the admirable spirit of individual voluntary commitment, close social links with local communities and a good depth and scope as regards nationwide geographical spread.</P>

      <P>The legislation passed by this House in 1990 which established the Defence Forces representative associations took cognisance of the nature of the military organisation with its own special ethos and responsibilities. Accordingly, the Defence Amendment Act, 1990, specifically excludes from the scope of representation any operation and the raising, maintenance, command, constitution, organisation and discipline of the Defence Forces. In the context of that legislation, overseas operations and hence visits to members overseas, do not come within the remit of the associations.</P>
      <P>However, last year I permitted a group comprising all of the parties to the conciliation and arbitration process, including officials from both associations, to visit the UNIFIL area of operations. The main purpose of this visit was related to the review of overseas allowances and the visit also facilitated a less formal working environment for the parties concerned. I am pleased to say that the trip was a success for those involved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>Last October, I accepted the invitation extended to me by PDFORRA's national executive to attend the association's ninth annual delegate conference in Galway. While there, I addressed delegates on a wide range of issues including the stability which the publication of the White Paper brings to the Defence Forces, the participation of the association in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, increased investment in new equipment, the restructuring of the Air Corps and Naval Services and the appointment of an ombudsman for the Defence Forces. The delegates responded positively to my address and were particularly pleased by the announcement that I would proceed with the establishment of a legislative ombudsman for the Defence Forces. I left the PDFORRA conference greatly heartened by the constructive attitude shown by the association, its president, executive and general officers.</P>
      <P>Last month, I was a guest of the RACO national executive at its eighth annual delegate conference in Kilkenny. There too I addressed the delegates on a large number of defence related issues. I stressed the need for partnership between all of us who share the collective goal of creating a world class, modern, defence organisation.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed by the negative tone adopted in the address to conference given by the president of RACO and by his subsequent remarks on television. In the system of representation for the Defence Forces, a careful balance needs to be maintained. In particular, the need to provide the association with sufficient latitude to represent its members effectively must be balanced against the need to reflect the special values and ethos of a military organisation. Nobody could dispute the association's right to disagree publicly with policy in the areas of pay and conditions of service which fall within its remit. However, command over the Defence Forces is exercised through and by the Minister for Defence. It is equally clear that the mounting of an abusive and personalised attack on the Minister for Defence by a serving officer in full uniform is, in all circumstances, wholly and entirely inappropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chief of Staff has informed me that he has already made clear to the association his marked displeasure at the conduct of the association during its ADC and he has dissociated himself from <Col N="1022" /> the negative content and inappropriate manner in which the president's address was delivered. He has also informed me that he will be dealing further with the issue in a forthcoming address to officers. I would like to place on the record my appreciation to the considerable number of individual officers who have approached me personally to express their disapproval of the tone of the president's address to conference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53, 57, 63, 67 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>I would like, once again, to take this opportunity to offer my sincere sympathies to the families of those involved in the tragic accident at Tramore on 2 July 1999. As Deputy Gilmore will be aware, in addition to the Air Accident Investigation Unit Report following the accident a Military Court of Inquiry was convened to inquire into the cause and circumstances of the accident. Its main thrust will be an examination of both the final report of the Air Accident Investigation Unit and the coroner's report. The Military Court of Inquiry, which was awaiting the publication of the final report, assembled at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel on 16 October 2000 and its work is now proceeding following the receipt of the coroner's court findings. I can assure the House that all findings and recommendations of the Court of Inquiry will be fully considered and appropriate action taken as necessary. As this inquiry is still ongoing, it would not be appropriate for me to make any further comment in the matter.</P>
      <P>As I have previously stated in the House, all of the safety recommendations set out in the report which call for action by the Department and the Defence Forces are being considered as a matter of priority with a view to their immediate implementation. In this regard I have put in place arrangements to monitor progress in regard to the implementation of the recommendations.</P>
      <P>The second meeting of the working group charged with overseeing the process was held recently in the Department of Defence, involving representatives from my Department, including the Defence Forces, as well as from the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. Progress reports from the various bodies involved were presented and reviewed and a composite progress report is currently being prepared in the Department, which will be presented to me over the coming days. This group will continue to meet on a regular basis in order to ensure the speedy implementation of the safety recommendations set out in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that progress is being reported by all bodies involved. In regard to the establishment of an Air Safety Office within the Air Corps and the commissioning of an independent Air Operations Safety Audit of the Air Corps the position is that an Air Corps Officer of Lieutenant-<Col N="1024" /> Colonel rank has been appointed by the GOC Air Corps to carry out the duties of Air Safety Officer. The question of the further assignment of personnel in connection with the work of the Air Safety Office is a matter to which the GOC Air Corps is giving urgent attention.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to report that the procedure for the selection of an appropriate agency to undertake an Air Operations Safety Audit of the Air Corps as recommended in the report of the Air Accident Investigation Unit of the Department of Public Enterprise into the accident at Tramore on 2 July 2000 has commenced. The report envisaged that the results of this audit will form the foundation for the new Air Corps Air Safety Office. As I have previously outlined in the House, I have directed that this audit be carried out at the earliest time possible and all support necessary will be provided by my Department and the Defence Forces to the chosen agency to carry out its work.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Finucane's question regarding the provision of a 24 hour search and rescue service at Waterford Airport, the position is that search and rescue cover is currently provided by the Air Corps using an Alouette 111 helicopter in this regard. The Alouette 111 is a single-engined helicopter, restricted to off-shore visual contact flight conditions and daylight only and to operations to a maximum of three nautical miles off-shore. As the House is aware, the Alouette is in replacement of the Dauphin which was involved in the accident at Tramore on 2 July 1999.</P>

      <P>I am aware that, during the course of proceedings at the recent RACO Annual Conference, a number of highly derogatory remarks were made in the public domain in relation to individual civil servants in the Department of Defence. I am satisfied that the content of the allegations made was entirely inaccurate, leaving to one side the separate issue of the abusive and personalised tenor of the remarks.</P>
      <P>The statutory process of representation allows RACO to make public statements concerning issues which fall within the direct and proper scope of representation. However, it might be expected that, in making public statements, the association would act in as professional a manner as other representative bodies and that it would refrain from personal abuse.</P>
      <P>Those who deliberately target individual civil servants know that the latter are unable themselves to reply immediately and publicly to untruthful personalised allegations. Such attacks raise more questions about their authors than about their intended victims.</P>

    <P>I am satisfied that all Air Corps aircraft flying on operational duties are maintained to a high state of air worthiness which enables them to carry out all the tasks assigned to them.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is aware that the Government recognises that there are urgent equipment requirements in the Air Corps. In recognition of these requirements, I announced, in March 2000 the allocation of up to £55 million over the next three years for that purpose. These funds will <Col N="1026" /> initiate vital investment in new aircraft for the Air Corps. The first indicator of this investment is the current project for the acquisition of medium lift helicopters. A further priority is the acquisition of fixed wing training aircraft. I understand that a submission has been sent recently by the Air Corps to the military authorities with their recommendations in this regard. Once the papers are passed to my Department the matter will receive immediate attention.</P>

      <P>The Chief of Staff is currently preparing a plan to restructure the PDF in accordance with the Government's decision on overall numbers. That plan will help us to achieve the following broad goals: to provide a light infantry based force with an appropriate level of all-arms capability; to provide sufficient forces and capabilities to meet needs at home and to make a significant contribution abroad; to put in place a more cohesive and better equipped force than exists at present; and to provide significant additional resources for equipment and infrastructure broadly within the existing level of financial allocation.</P>
      <P>My intention is to have the plan finalised and implemented by end-2001, in accordance with the Government decision. It is important that we put the new organisation in place and move ahead with the modernisation of the Defence Forces. It is equally important that the new organisation offers rewarding and challenging careers to Defence Forces personnel.</P>
      <P>The White Paper recognises the importance of the career dimension and provides for the preparation of an updated and very comprehensive Defence Forces integrated personnel management plan to address this and related issues. The Chief of Staff is currently drafting that plan and the process is well advanced. A key feature of the plan will be a continuation of the policy of regular recruitment which is now in place in order to achieve an improved age profile in the Permanent Defence Force. A campaign to recruit an additional 750 personnel began in April and I relaunched this in September. So far this year we have recruited over 630 personnel.</P>
      <P>I have made my position clear that the representative associations are to be consulted fully in a spirit of partnership before the reorganisation and manpower plans are finalised.</P>
      <P>Arising from the special study on the Air Corps undertaken by PricewaterhouseCoopers Consultants, and reflecting the policy parameters laid down in the White Paper, Air Corps management has submitted a draft implementation plan to me. I have approved in principle the proposed new Air Corps organisation and this will now be put in place while other elements of the plan are being developed.</P>
      <P>As in the case of the Air Corps, the Naval Service prepared a detailed implementation plan which I have approved. Implementation is proceeding, including the putting in place of the new organisation provided for in the plan.</P>
      <P>The White Paper provides that the overall strategy for the development of the Reserve Defence Force will be based on the report of the special steering group which reported to me last year. I believe that the recommendations contained in the report give us a general basis on which to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just over one week ago, I published the report <Col N="1028" /> of the steering group and launched a consultative process to seek the views of members of the reserve in advance of the drawing up of an implementation plan. It is estimated that the implementation of any necessary structural and organisational change will take a period of about six years.</P>
    <P>I was particularly pleased earlier this year to announce an unprecedented additional £250 million investment programme in new equipment and infrastructure. This will be funded from payroll savings and from the sales of property surplus to requirements and will include the following: about £55 million over three years on the purchase of new aircraft for the Air Corps with special priority being given to the procurement of new medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps; over £20 million for a second new state of the art fishery patrol vessel for the Naval Service. This will be delivered in mid-2001; about £25 million over three years for investment in light infantry tactical vehicles, modern effective anti-armour weapons, night vision equipment, engineer equipment and medical field equipment.</P>
    <P>All the foregoing are additional to: £40 million for a new fleet of Armoured Personnel Carriers for the Army. The first of these will be handed over in early 2001; some £22 million for a state of the art offshore patrol vessel, the <i>LE Róisín</i>, which was delivered in 1999; over £10.5 million for new tactical VHF radios; over £6.5 million on specialist transport cargo vehicles, deployed to KFOR, and on new troop carrying vehicles such as 4 x 4s, and ¾ ton trucks.</P>
    <P>Finally, over £100 million &ndash; this includes £50 million from the proceeds of the sale of property &ndash; is being committed to the development of buildings and other infrastructure at military installations.</P>

      <P>Air Traffic Control Services means a service provided for the purpose of: preventing collisions between aircraft in flight and when manoeuvring on the ground; expediting and maintaining an orderly flow of traffic; providing advice and information useful for the safe and efficient conduct of the flight &ndash; flight information service; notifying the appropriate organisation of aircraft in need of search and rescue &ndash; SAR &ndash; assistance, and assisting that organisation as required, i.e. an alerting service.</P>
      <P>Air traffic services normally include flight information service, alerting service, air traffic advisory service, air traffic control service, approach control service and aerodrome control service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All or some of the above services may be provided at an aerodrome, but it is dependent upon the level of use of the airport and the complexity and nature of the flights operating into and from it. At the lowest end of the scale a private operator flying for own use from a non-licensed private airfield will not have ATC on the field. The flight plan will be filed by phone to the nearest ATC authority. At the highest level of the scale is Dublin Airport, for example. Only air<Col N="1030" /> craft carrying certain navigation equipment will be permitted to operate at this airport, day and night. The full range of ATC services is available and compliance is required.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Air Corps operations, I am assured by the military authorities that normal safety procedures are always followed in relation to all operations undertaken by the Air Corps. With regard to specific locations from which the Air Corps operates the position is as follows; 24 hour ATC cover is available at Baldonnel. This cover is necessary due to its proximity to the Dublin Airport flight paths. There is no ATC in Finner Camp, County Donegal, due to it not being within the immediate area of a major airport. However, flight information services are provided on a 24 basis from Finner Camp to the pilots and the ATC and Met Éireann at Shannon are accessed for weather information-traffic control as required. SAR operations from Waterford Airport are daylight hours only and ATC services are available.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 98 together.</P>
      <P>The question of the appointment of an Ombudsman for the Defence Forces is now being dealt with under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force. The terms of the scheme, which have been agreed with the representative associations, provide that discussions at conciliation and arbitration are confidential to the parties involved. Accordingly, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment in detail on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 11 October last, I announced at the Annual Conference of PDFORRA that I had decided the time was now ripe to proceed with the establishment of a legislative Ombudsman for the Defence Forces. In establishing this office, we must ensure that we provide a credible grievance system which is fair to all members of the Forces. However, at the same time, we must safeguard the operational flexibility of the Defence Forces. Discussions with the representative associations are necessary in order to define the powers and scope of a military Ombudsman in terms which will meet the needs of the various parties. Since I made the announcement, a formal meeting has <Col N="1031" /> taken place with one of the representative associations. The discussion process is also likely to result in an updating of the existing internal complaints procedures. As soon as those discussions are completed, I will make the necessary legislative arrangements to give effect to the Ombudsman proposal.</P>
    <P>I would also like to point out to the Deputy that, pursuant to the provisions of the Ombudsman Act, 1980, military personnel already have the right to make complaints against my Department to the Ombudsman appointed under that Act.</P>

      <P>No appointments to the Reserve of Officers have been made pending the completion of the ministerial steering group's report. The formal publication of the group's report and the consultation process in relation to the reorganisation of the Reserve were launched by me on 25 November 2000.

      <P>The question of the number of officers to be appointed to the first line reserve and the duration of such appointments, will be considered in the context of the implementation plan.

      <P>The tables which I propose to circulate in the Official Report indicate the numbers of officers who have left the Defence Forces as at 30 June 2000, the most recent date for which such figures are currently available from the military authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As one might reasonably expect, members of <Col N="1033" /> the Permanent Defence Force, across all ranks, take up offers of civilian employment in times of economic prosperity.</P>
    <P>While this would also apply to some extent to certain other categories of public sector employees, there are two quite distinctive factors which specifically impinge upon the general PDF situation. First, the PDF pension schemes are among the most generous within the Public Service. An officer, such as an Army Captain or Commandant, may retire from the PDF in his or her late thirties and immediately receive a military pension along with a retirement lump sum.</P>
    <P>Second, it is widely recognised, not least by private sector employers, that the programmes of personal development and training available in the Defence Forces are second to none and can stand comparison with the best in the private sector. Many military personnel, in all ranks, are increasingly educated to diploma, degree and indeed to post-graduate degree level in readily marketable specialisms. Obviously, such personnel, already pre-trained and well experienced to the highest levels, are a tempting target to the private sector.</P>
    <P>The military authorities are aware of such individual personnel being actively head-hunted by private sector employers.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the temporary and once off nature of the former voluntary early retirement scheme, under the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan, DFRIP, over the years 1996-98, it should be noted that the demographic age structure within the PDF is such that a considerable number of personnel, whether serving as commissioned officers or as other ranks, are now at a stage in their careers when they can retire and thus avail of the terms of their respective statutory pension and lump sum entitlements, on the basis of accumulated years of past service. The fact that this phenomenon coincides with an unprecedented degree of economic prosperity and employment opportunity in the private labour market will continue to challenge the senior management of the Defence Forces for some years to come.</P>
    <P>The annual cadetship competition continues to attract an excellent field of young people, both school leavers and some graduates. Overall the Defence Forces are attracting sufficient candidates of the calibre required for the demanding and intensive training required of young entrants who aspire to become commissioned officers. There are also internal competitions from time to time which allow enlisted personnel to be commissioned from the ranks. Some particular specialist officers may be sourced by direct entry public competitions.</P>

      <P>The military authorities advise that complaints of bullying or abuse in the Defence Forces arise very rarely. Comprehensive procedures are, however, in place to deal with bullying and abuse in the Defence Forces if such allegations arise. These procedures are outlined in the relevant administrative instructions.

This instruction is also incorporated into cadet, apprentice and recruit courses and career courses for officers and non-commissioned personnel.

      <P>The primary purpose of the community employment programme is to reintegrate long-term unemployed persons into employment in the open labour market. The programme provides two distinct options for participants: an integration option aimed at persons aged 25 years and over, who are more than one year registered as unemployed, participants usually remain on this option for a one year period; and a work option aimed at persons aged 35 years and over, who are more than three years registered as unemployed. Participants may remain on this option for a period up to three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All eligible persons may remain on the programme up to retirement age at 65 years, subject to total participation on the programme of three years. The three years cap on participation was introduced in April 2000 following the restructur<Col N="1036" /> ing of CE. Offshore Island residents are exempt from this change.</P>
    <P>As identified in the PPF and in the review of the operation of the job initiative programme carried out on behalf of my Department in 1999, some people may have difficulties in getting and keeping a job in the open labour market due to age and other personal barriers such as health, literacy and numeracy factors. Appropriate long-term supports are needed for people experiencing employment barriers of this nature.</P>
    <P>My Department is finalising proposals for appropriate supports following discussions with the social partners and receipt of a number of submissions from the statutory, and community and voluntary sectors. Final proposals, which will enhance the range of options available for persons with employment barriers, are expected to be ready for further discussions with the social partners before Christmas.</P>

      <P>I refer to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 41 of 23 November 2000 regarding this matter.</P>
      <P>An environmental impact statement was presented to my Department along with the application to reclaim 21 hectares of Dublin Bay in July 1998. The EIS was examined by independent consultants who reported that it did not meet statutory requirements. In March this year, my Department informed Dublin Port Company that a full new EIS would have to be prepared to allow the application to be considered.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Dublin Port Company intends to submit a new EIS. However, the timing of the publication of a new EIS is entirely within the remit of the company. The application will not be processed further until such time as a new EIS is received.</P>
      <P>In accordance with legislation there will be a one month public consultation period from the time of commencement of the public consultation process, that is the date of publication of a newspaper notice of the availability of the EIS to the public for examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company will have an opportunity to comment on any objections made to the proposals <Col N="1037" /> and the matter will be considered, as will objections and responses to them, by the technical, scientific and administrative staff available to me. When they have completed their deliberations they will make a recommendation to me and I will make a decision on the matter.</P>
    <P>There is no statutory time period within which the process must be completed but I would be most surprised if the process took less than six months to complete.</P>

      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that further measures to build on the potential of Donegal's marine sector are being taken by my Department, including work on the extension to the National Fisheries Training Centre at Greencastle recently completed, which included State investment of £974,000; funding was allocated for investment of over £5 million in harbour developments in County Donegal this year; the development of new berthage facilities at Killybegs is progressing, with investment estimated in the order of £35 million; since March 1999, aquaculture licences have been granted for shellfish operations in North County Donegal, mostly in Lough Swilly, with the prospect of creating about 100 jobs over three to five years. Aquaculture licensing decisions have also been made, currently under appeal to the independent statutory Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board, in relation <Col N="1038" /> to expansion of salmon farming operations in Mulroy Bay, at Glinsk, and in Lough Swilly, at Binnaweelmore and Callagh.</P>
      <P>During 2000, four fishing vessels from County Donegal participated in deepwater fishing trials, receiving total current funding of £196,126 and capital funding of £66,606. Five other fishing vessels received capital funding of £49,765 for gear associated with technical conservation measures work and other gear technology projects. In addition, throughout the year, as a result of BIM funded fishing technology projects, ancillary industries in County Donegal, including the gear manufacturers, ships chandlerys and marine electronics firms, received £345,884.</P>

    <P>Further to the Marine Institute report entitled &ldquo;A Framework for the Development of Tourism and Leisure on the Marine and Inland Waterways of County Donegal&rdquo;, the Donegal County Development Board has decided to set up a marine development leisure forum. It is intended that a co-ordinator for this forum will be employed for a three year period, starting in January 2001. The intention is that this co-ordinator, advised by the forum and operating under the auspices of Donegal County Development Board, will work to implement the measures recommended in the Marine Institute report and to ensure that the sector is developed to its greatest possible potential in County Donegal. This post is being jointly funded by the Northern Regional Fisheries Board, Údarás na Gaeltachta, Donegal County Council and the Marine Institute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92, and 116 to 119 inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The following tabular statements indicate the strength of male and female personnel within the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, as at 30 September 2000, the most recent date for which such figures are currently available from the military authorities. These figures provide a breakdown between officers and various non-commissioned ranks across the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Defence lays down a total strength for the PDF of 10,500, personnel. The recent PricewaterhouseCoopers special studies on the Naval Service and Air Corps set out recommended overall strengths of 1,144 for the Naval Service and 930 for the Air Corps respectively. These will be met from within the overall Permanent Defence Force figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The restructuring of the Permanent Defence Force to secure conformity with the White Paper's total strength of 10,500 and also with the <Col N="1042" /> recommendations of the management consultants on both the Naval Service and the Air Corps will be achieved by way of the very detailed implementation plans for each of the services.</P>
    <P>Women are eligible for service in the Army, Air Corps, Naval Service and in the Reserve Defence Force and to compete for all appointments on an equal basis and under the same general conditions as those which apply to men. All female personnel undergo the same training and receive the same military education as their male counterparts.</P>
    <P>In order to encourage increased participation by women in the Defence Forces I decided in March 1998 to reduce the height requirement for all female recruits to 5 4.</P>
    <P>In previous years the trend for general service recruitment has been that 16% of all applicants have been female and that on average 16% of enlistments have been female. It is obviously not possible to predict what the relevant percentages will be in any future intakes of recruits, but there is no reason to assume that this pattern will change to any great degree.</P>
    <P>The conditions of enlistment for general service recruits assigned to the Air Corps are the same as those for recruits enlisted in the Army except in the case of special categories of intake such as apprentices.</P>

      <P>The only missions for which Ireland is entitled to reimbursement of troop costs by the UN are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, UNFICYP, and the United Nations Transitional Authority in East Timor, UNTAET. Troop costs in respect of these missions are calcu<Col N="1043" /> lated at the rate of $1087.10 US per person per month.</P>
      <P>The total amount of money due to my Department by the United Nations as at 30 November 2000 in respect of contributions towards troop and other costs associated with the participation of Defence Force personnel in UN missions is calculated at IR£8.4 million approximately. Continuous efforts are made to recover from the United Nations the moneys owed. These efforts are strenuously pursued with the United Nations on an ongoing basis by the Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs in conjunction with the Permanent Mission of Ireland to the United Nations in New York. Both my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I take every opportunity to raise with the UN Ireland's concerns regarding arrears. Since 1 January 2000 the UN has repaid arrears of £8 million approximately almost entirely in respect of UNIFIL.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110 and 111 together.</P>
      <P>The sale of six barracks identified as surplus to military requirements is being progressed. The barracks in question are located at Fermoy, Ballincollig, Naas, Kildare, Castleblayney and Clancy Barracks, Dublin. Five of the barracks have been vacated while the sixth &ndash; Clancy Barracks &ndash; will be evacuated next year.</P>
      <P>Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, is in the process of being sold to Cork County Council for economic development of the site in conjunction with the IDA. The agreed price is £767,000 and it is hoped that the formalities of this sale can be completed in the near future. The lands will be developed and marketed as a strategic industrial site to attract inward investment.</P>
      <P>The former Devoy Barracks, Naas, County Kildare, comprises an area of approximately 22 acres. I agreed to cede seven acres free of charge to Naas Urban District Council and to sell one acre to Kildare County Council at a price yet to be agreed, all for local community purposes. I have recently agreed to sell the remaining 14 acres or thereabouts, which are zoned for housing, to Naas UDC for £7 million. The legal formalities to give effect to these agreements have commenced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Castleblayney, that property is in the process of being sold to the North Eastern Health Board for £600,000 and it is anticipated that sale contracts will be signed in the near future. Pending completion of the legal and finan<Col N="1051" /> cial formalities, a caretaker's agreement was completed and the former barracks was handed over to the health board earlier this year on foot of that agreement.</P>
    <P>In relation to the aforementioned properties, where sales have been agreed, the sale formalities are in progress and on completion of those formalities the agreed amounts, totalling £8.367 million, together with an agreed price for the one acre at Naas, will be realised by my Department.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive integrated action area plan was commissioned from independent consultants to provide for the future development of the largest of the barracks concerned &ndash; Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig. That plan provides for a wide range of community, amenity, residential and commercial uses for the property. The development of the Murphy Barracks lands will be critical in the future overall development of the town of Ballincollig. My Department submitted the integrated plan to Cork County Council in April of this year, for consideration in the context of a variation to the existing Cork County development plan, and my officials met with council officials to discuss various aspects of this matter. Further discussions will take place in the near future and the property will be put on the market following adoption of the integrated plan into the Cork County development plan.</P>
    <P>In relation to the need for accommodation for refugees, the vacated Magee Barracks, Kildare, has been used to accommodate Kosovar refugees since May of last year. The barracks is now also providing accommodation for asylum seekers. I have also agreed to provide circa one acre to the local authority for a temporary halting site for 20 persons for a period of one year. In view of those needs, it has not been possible to arrange for the disposal of the property, however, this matter is being kept under review.</P>
    <P>Clancy Barracks, Dublin, will be evacuated in the near future when alternative accommodation becomes available. The disposal of the property should proceed in 2001.</P>
    <P>As indicated, the disposal of barracks is proceeding and it is expected that in excess of £50 million will be realised from the sale of the properties. The moneys raised will be used primarily for re-equipment and refurbishment within the Defence Forces. The cost of the barrack reinvestment programme is estimated at £50 million. The programme commenced in 1999 and will run until 2003. Provision for this expenditure is being made in my Department Estimates.</P>

      <P>REPS participants currently in receipt of payment under supplementary measure 5 may continue to avail of payments under this measure until the end of their existing agreements.</P>
      <P>Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999, under which the new REPS will be implemented, does not make provision for a public access measure as part of the EU co-funded agri-environmental programme.</P>
      <P>In an effort to secure the continued availability of public access as part of REPS, proposals were made to the European Commission for the inclusion of the measure as a State aid, fully funded by the Exchequer. However, the Commission has indicated that a public access measure will not be allowed under the agri-environment title of Regulation (EC) 1257/1999, even as a State aid.</P>
      <P>The national rural development programme will provide for local groups to implement rural tourism measures and it may be possible to provide funding for walking route amenities in this context. The details of the measures have yet to be worked out with the European Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the EU market organisation for sugar each member state has a national sugar quota in respect of manufactured sugar. Ireland's quota is 196,121 tonnes comprising A quota of 178,292 tonnes and B quota of 17,829 tonnes. There is no quota at farm level nor is there a quota for sugar beet.</P>
      <P>Each member state is required to allocate its quota to the sugar manufacturing concerns on its </P>
      <P>territory. In Ireland's case the quota is allocated to Irish Sugar plc., the only manufacturer of sugar in the State. Contracts are agreed between the company and farmers to grow sufficient sugar beet to allow for the production of the sugar quota. I have no function in relation to the placing of these contracts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that under a contract restructuring scheme agreed recently between Irish Sugar plc and the IFA, provision was made for retiring farmers to surrender their sugar beet contracts. This will provide some unused contract tonnage <Col N="1053" /> for existing growers to expand production and for new growers and young farmers to enter the sector. I have no power under EU legislation to interfere with the management of the quota.</P>

The appeals unit set itself a target of processing within three months all but the most complicated and intractable of appeals. This is considered a reasonable delay in providing the service and it is accepted that farmers should not have to wait any longer to have their cases dealt with.</P>

      <P>My Department has <Col N="1054" /> been in constant ongoing contact with the three private organic farming bodies, Demeter Standards Limited, Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association and Organic Trust Ltd, since August about the implementation of new arrangements for regulating the organic sector.</P>
      <P>These three bodies were approved in 1993 to carry out inspections in the organic crop sector on behalf of my Department, which is the competent authority under EU Regulations. The EU Regulation governing organic produce was extended to the livestock sector in August this year and it was necessary to put inspection arrangements in place for that sector. In response to a recommendation in the AgriFood 2010 Report, I had undertaken to streamline the inspection system for organic produce. My Department therefore put proposals to the three private bodies for a unified inspection and certification system. Such a system would have achieved the objective of streamlining the inspection system but it would also have assured the three bodies of a continuing and substantial source of income from carrying out inspections on behalf of my Department. They would in addition have been able to continue to operate their own private arrangements for their own members as heretofore.</P>
      <P>However one of the organic bodies has rejected this proposal and sought a judicial review of my Department's actions.</P>
      <P>My Department is preparing delegated legislation in the form of a statutory instrument to give effect to the EU regulation governing organic produce and to provide for inspection and certification arrangements. In the meantime I have made interim arrangements to provide stability to the organic production sector in respect of compliance with EU requirements.</P>

      <P>The PCW settlements agreed with the five groups mentioned by the Deputy were all negotiated under clause 2(iii)A of Annex 1 to the PCW pay agreement. Settlements under this clause were intended to address claims for improvements in pay and conditions in the context of flexibility, change, savings and quality of service.</P>
      <P>PCW settlements under clause 2(iii)A tended to be very complex and to differ widely in their structure. Among the elements included in various agreements were basic salary adjustments, shortening of salary scales, selective upgradings, promotions and long service increments, and increased allowances. By way of example, the teachers settlement provided for an early retirement scheme, the elimination of one point on the scale, a new allowance for teachers with long service, increases in the allowances for principals, deputy principals, assistant principals and special duties teachers and an increase in the number of posts of responsibility.</P>
      <P>Against this background, a simple comparison of how the maximum of each salary scale changed in percentage terms over a given period would not accurately reflect the nature of the different deals. However, the following summarises the position in relation to the groups concerned. In each case, the addition to the pay bill is the estimated gross additional cost. The PCW terms provided for concessions from staff which would take account of the need for improved efficiencies, flexibility and change and the contribution to be made by employees to such change. Once again, there were significant variations between the different agreements which would have had an impact on the net addition to the pay bill.</P>
      <P>The PCW local bargaining agreement for garda added about 12% to the Garda pay bill. The maximum point on the Garda scale was adjusted and extended by the addition of a long service increment payable after a further five years. This resulted in increases ranging from 9% to 14%, depending on length of service, over the former maximum point.</P>
      <P>The February 1997 PCW settlement for nurses had an estimated cost of about 14.5% in annual terms. The maximum point on the staff nurse scale was adjusted and extended by the addition of a long service increment payable after a further three years. Taken in conjunction with an earlier increase of 1% at all points of the scale, this resulted in increases ranging from 13% to 17%, depending on length of service, over the former maximum point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The PCW local bargaining agreement added about 11.5% to the pay bill of prison officers. The maximum point on the prison officer scale was adjusted and extended by the addition of a long service increment payable after a further three years. This resulted in increases ranging from <Col N="1059" /> 10% to 13%, depending on length of service, over the former maximum point.</P>
    <P>The PCW local bargaining agreement added about 6% to the pay bill for teachers. The maximum point of the scale was not adjusted but a new allowance was introduced for teachers with 35 years' service which involved an increase of 4% over the former maximum point, there was a substantial increase in the number of promotion posts available to teachers and a 28% increase in the allowances paid in respect of such posts.</P>
    <P>The PCW local bargaining agreement added about 6% to the pay bill for executive officers. The maximum of the scale was extended by the addition of two long service increments payable after a further three years and six years respectively, which yielded increases of 3.4% or 6.8%, depending on length of service, over the former maximum point. In addition, 25% of the members of the grade are now paid a higher scale which has a maximum point of 11% over the former maximum.</P>
    <P>Teachers and executive officers have been paid a further 3% under the &ldquo;early settlers&rdquo; agreement between the Government and the Public Services Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. This payment did not apply to the other three groups referred to in the Deputy's question.</P>

      <P>The National Alcohol Policy was published by my Department in September 1996. It is directed at reducing the prevalence of alcohol related problems through an emphasis on moderation in alcohol consumption. Because alcohol problems are multidimensional the policy sets out multisectoral solutions requiring both environmental and individual strategies. Since the publication of the policy, a number of elements of the action plan have been put in place. The most significant of these are: the National Alcohol Surveillance Centre has been established; a national lifestyle survey has been carried out; an advertising campaign emphasising the message of moderation in drinking has been carried out and evaluated; research is currently being carried out in relation to the impact of alcohol advertising on young people, the results of which are expected to be published early next year; a new campaign aimed at young high risk drinkers will be launched in February next; a training course has been developed in association with the drinks industry group and CERT on the responsible serving of alcohol; work is also ongoing on a number of the longer term elements of the action plan, including developing the school curriculum to include a sig<Col N="1060" /> nificant level of health related issues and policies which relate to alcohol abuse.</P>
      <P>It is intended to continue with the elements of the plan already commenced, and to make progress in relation to initiatives involving other Departments. Co-operation with industry groups will continue with a view to encouraging the industry to play its part in encouraging moderation in alcohol consumption and to look at the issue of underage drinking. Actions taken on the basis of the plan are evaluated on an ongoing basis, so that the policy continues to be focused and effective.</P>

      <P>The mobility allowance comes under the aegis of my Department and is administered by the health boards. It was introduced in 1979 by circular 15/79 and is payable under section 61 of the Health Act, 1970. The purpose of the allowance is to provide financial support to severely disabled people who are unable to walk or use public transport in order to finance the occasional taxi journey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To be eligible to receive this allowance applicants must satisfy the following conditions: be over 16 years and under 66 years, however, an allowance, once granted, will be continued after <Col N="1062" /> this age as long as the other criteria for eligibility are met; be living at home or maintained by a health board in any long-term institution; be unable to walk, even with the use of artificial limbs or other suitable aids, or must be in such a condition of health that the exertion required to walk would be dangerous; inability to walk has to be likely to persist for at least one year; moving of the applicant must not have been forbidden for medical reasons; be in a condition to benefit from a change in surroundings.</P>
    <P>The maximum rate of mobility allowance is £45.60 per month. This is currently under review.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the senior area medical officer in the relevant health board to decide whether the medical criteria are satisfied in each case. Applicants must undergo a means test to decide eligibility. The threshold income used in determining eligibility is the disability allowance rate. If the income of the applicant does not exceed the current rate of disability allowance, the applicant will qualify for the full rate of the mobility allowance. Where the applicant's income exceeds the current rate of disability allowance, the rate of mobility allowance paid is reduced accordingly.</P>
    <P>For those applicants on disability allowance, invalidity pension or infectious diseases maintenance allowance, income earned up to a maximum of £75 per week of a therapeutic or rehabilitative nature, can be disregarded for the purpose of assessing mobility allowance.</P>

      <P>However, the health promotion strategy published in July this year calls for a more structured approach to the implementation of the recommendations set out in the national breastfeeding policy and recommends the appointment of a national breastfeeding co-ordinator. The post was recently advertised in the national papers and when appointed, the successful candidate will advise on the effectiveness of current policy actions in Ireland and on measures required to increase breastfeeding rates. The establishment of a national committee on breastfeeding has been considered and arrangements are being made for the appointment of such a committee. This committee will work with the national breastfeeding co-ordinator, in partnership with community workers, in the effective implementation of the national breastfeeding policy for Ireland.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I visited Russia in May this year to meet the Russian Federation Authorities regarding the situation of Irish couples hoping to adopt from there. The Russian Government changed its laws in regard to adoption around the time of the visit issuing three new decrees in relation to intercountry adoption. The key aspects of these decrees which have relevance for Irish couples are as follows: all foreign agencies operating in the territory of the Russian Federation must be accredited by the Interdepartmental Commission on the Adoption of Children Who Are Citizens of the Russian Federation by Foreign Citizens; under the accreditation arrangements, the non-commercial foreign agency must be licensed by a competent state body in its home country; accreditation of non-commercial foreign agencies is restricted to organisations which have been involved in the adoption of children in their home country for not less than five years at the time of applying for accreditation; and candidates who wish to adopt a child must be resident in the country where the foreign agency is located.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1065" /> Following my meeting with the Minister for Education, Mr. Fillipov, I understood that the main impact of the new laws for Irish couples is that they will no longer be able to use third country agencies to assist them in concluding adoptions in the Russian Federation. A native Irish agency could assist such couples. At present the following issues arise: there are no existing Irish adoption agencies providing mediation services to couples wishing to adopt abroad. Adoption societies are registered by the Adoption Board under the Adoption Act, 1952. However, existing legislation does not make any provision for the mediation of intercountry adoption by either the Adoption Board or other bodies. The board processes a small number of applications in relation to China, Thailand and Belarus under bilateral agreements with authorities in those States.</P>
    <P>New agencies which are set up in the future to mediate adoptions would have to be operating within Ireland for five years in order to be eligible for accreditation by the Russian Federation.</P>
    <P>I took the opportunity to explain the Irish situation to my Russian counterparts during my visit and I was informed that it would be possible for individual couples to continue to adopt from the Russian Federation if they act independently and work directly through the federal authorities in the various regions of the federation of the Ministry of Education in Moscow. In my meetings I emphasised to the Russian authorities the strong State role in the assessment of couples; the rigour of our assessment process; the rights of adopted children under Irish law; the State's commitment to the principles of the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption and the intention to introduce legislation to ratify the Convention as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Russian Federation's requirements are intended to protect the best interests of children and to ensure high standards in the intercountry adoption process. Since my meeting with the Russian authorities the Russian Federation has signed the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption and has indicated that it intends to bring forward legislation to ratify the convention. The legislation being prepared in my Department on the ratification of the Hague Convention will include, <i>inter alia</i>, provision for the establishment, accreditation and regulation of bodies providing mediating services for prospective adopters who wish to adopt from abroad.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 149 and 150 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The compensation code for compulsory purchase of land, including land required for road development provides for the payment of com<Col N="1067" /> pensation by local authorities for lands acquired by them on the authorisation of a duly confirmed compulsory purchase order. The amount of compensation payable is a matter for negotiation between the landowner and the local authority concerned, or in the event of dispute, for arbitration. The basic rule applied by the property arbitrator under the relevant legislation is the market value of the land. There is also provision for compensation for disturbance, severance and &ldquo;injurious&rdquo; affection. The time taken to make compensation payments is dependent upon agreement being reached, the pace of negotiations or the necessity to seek arbitration in disputed cases. However, general policy would be to pay as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <P>I accept that in principle it is desirable for statutory procedures, including land acquisition, to be completed as quickly as possible. In this regard, the Planning and Development Act, 2000, tightens the time limits for dealing with CPOs which should lead to earlier completion of procedures in this area. I am also aware that issues regarding acquisition of agricultural land for major road and motorway construction have been raised by the Irish Farmers' Association with the National Roads Authority and that dialogue between these parties is continuing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report from the Environmental Protection Agency entitled &ldquo;Emissions to Air 1990-1998&rdquo;, a copy of which is in the Oireachtas library identifies Ireland as having the highest <i>per capita </i>emissions of methane, CH4, nitrous oxide, N2O, and ammonia, NH3, in the EU. According to the report, this is due to the combination of a relatively small population and a large agricultural sector. In 1998, it is estimated that agricultural activities gave rise to 99% of Ireland's total NH3 emissions, an acidifying gas, 87% of CH4 and 74% of N2O emissions, both greenhouse gases.</P>
      <P>The National Climate Change Strategy which I published recently, a copy of which is also in the Oireachtas Library, sets out a framework for achieving the necessary reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, including CH4 and N2O, required by the Kyoto Protocol. The strategy is designed to achieve the necessary reductions equitably, and with economic and environmental efficiency, while continuing to support economic growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the objectives outlined in the strategy for the agricultural sector, to achieve reductions <Col N="1068" /> in CH4 and N2O emissions, are a reduction in CH4 from the national herd, equivalent to a reduction in livestock numbers by 10% below 2010 projected levels; an appropriate balance will be maintained between direct reductions in stock numbers and intensification of other measures, including a prioritised research programme, including feeding programmes, additives, probiotics, engineering and finishing cattle at a younger age, to identify means of reducing emissions per animal; development of anaerobic digestion of animal wastes for energy generation, CH4 reduction; reduction in the use of nitrogenous fertiliser by 10% below expected 2010 levels, supplemented by other measures, including use of slow release inhibitors, efficient management of slurry and dirty water to reduce N2O emissions from soils; and development of best practice guidelines to encourage changing farming practices.</P>
    <P>Regarding emissions of NH3, on 1 December 1999 Ireland signed the Gothenburg Protocol to the 1979 United Nations Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution to Abate Acidification, Eutrophication and Ground Level Ozone.</P>
    <P>The objective of the protocol is to control and reduce national emissions of a number of pollutants including NH3 by 2010. Under the Protocol Ireland must achieve an 8% reduction on the baseline 1990 emission level of this pollutant by 2010. Emission reductions will be achieved primarily in the agricultural sector through, <i>inter alia</i>, using alternatives to urea-based artificial nitrogenous fertilisers and implementing best slurry spreading practices.</P>

    <P>In addition to weekly payments being made over a four year period, the self-employed strand of the scheme, the back to work enterprise <Col N="1069" /> scheme, has a number of additional supports available to help people start their own business.</P>
    <P>There are two ways of obtaining loans under the back to work enterprise scheme. In 1997, my Department agreed to make the sum of £500,000 available to the Irish League of Credit Unions to </P>
    <P>guarantee loans for back to work participants who are members of credit unions and who may need access to capital to start up or develop their self-employment enterprise.</P>
    <P>My Department also has a joint funding arrangement with the First Step Charity &ndash; a private sector company with approved charitable status &ndash; under which interest-free loans are available to suitable back to work enterprise recipients who require seed capital in order to establish their own business. In some cases loan repayments are made through deductions from their weekly back to work enterprise allowance.</P>
    <P>Many successful and diverse businesses have been set up with the help of loans obtained under the aegis of the back to work enterprise scheme.</P>
    <P>However, a limit of £5,000 applies to loans obtained with the help of the scheme. Therefore, the purchase of a taxi plate for £78,000 as outlined in the Deputy's question, would not be covered by the Department's funding initiatives where the maximum available is £5,000. Funding in such a case would be a matter for the individual concerned.</P>

      <P>All applications received under the various support programmes are assessed by an independent technical group comprised of representatives from my Department, Area Development Management, Combat Poverty Agency, Southern Health Board, Westmeath County Council and projects currently funded under this Department's programmes. The function of this group is to establish the extent to which each project adheres to the selection criteria and to advise me accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The assessment process involves an initial <Col N="1070" /> assessment of the application, which is conducted by the voluntary and community services section of my Department, to identify gaps in information, to address queries, etc. so that the technical group will have as much information as possible available when formally assessing the application. In order to collate the required information, this assessment often involves meeting the group to discuss their focus, management structure, aims-objectives etc.</P>
    <P>As it was not possible to arrange a mutually convenient date for this meeting, some delay in processing this application has occurred. Officers of my Department did, however, meet St. Columba's centre, Kilflynn on 21 November 2000 to discuss the application.</P>
    <P>Following on from this, St. Columba's centre, Kilflynn, was advised to submit additional information pertaining to its ethos and structures, in support of its application.</P>
    <P>The group have been advised that once the additional information has been received, its application will be forwarded to the technical group for assessment.</P>

      <P>When the person concerned applied for one-parent family payment on 30 August 2000, she stated that she was receiving maintenance from the father of her child. However, there is conflicting evidence with regard to the amount of maintenance support involved and further investigations are required to verify the amount and method of maintenance payments. As part of this process, the Department wrote to the person concerned on 5 December 2000, requesting her to forward a statement from the father of her child confirming the weekly amounts of maintenance paid and whether it is still being paid.</P>
      <P>As soon as a response is received from the person concerned, and any other investigations necessary are completed, a decision will be made on her claim and she will be notified of the outcome.</P>

      <P>As indicated in my response to Parliamentary Question No. 313 of <Col N="1071" /> 14 November, the application from Community Technical Aid was referred to the standing operational committee of the community development programme for consideration of additional support structures, including specialist support needs within the Department's programmes. As previously advised, the standing operational committee took the view that before individual proposals to provide technical assistance were considered, a strategic decision was required on whether such technical assistance was an identified need within the programme.</P>
      <P>The committee, having deliberated on whether such technical assistance was deemed warranted, given the extensive support structures already provided for within the community development support programmes, referred the matter to the National Advisory Committee for further consideration.</P>
      <P>The application from Community Technical Aid will be considered when this committee has concluded its deliberations on the matter.</P>
      <P>There are no provisions to provide interim funding to groups who have not formally been approved for inclusion in the community development support programmes.</P>

      <P>Under present arrangements appropriate credits are applied directly to the relevant customer accounts with Eircom, and in respect of land-lines only.</P>

      <P>At present there are five permanent guides and one seasonal guide employed at Kilkenny Castle.</P>
      <P>On 20 July 2000, a notice circulated to all Dúchas sites indicated that there were currently vacancies for permanent guides at Kilkenny Castle, Dún Aonghusa, Kilmainham Gaol, three positions, and Wicklow Mountains National Park, and inviting applications by 4 August. This notice was displayed in two areas within Kilkenny Castle, and the supervisor guide drew the attention of staff to it.</P>
      <P>The number of vacancies to be filled was specified only in the case of Kilmainham Gaol. At the time of advertisement only one vacancy had arisen in Kilkenny Castle. However, it is normal practice within Dúchas to use interviews not only to fill existing vacancies, but also to establish a panel from which vacancies occurring within a specified future period will be filled. To ensure there is no confusion in the future, I have instructed that such notices should in future indicate specifically whether a panel will be formed.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to the relevant interviews, an additional vacancy arose at Kilkenny Castle, and this position was filled from the panel in line with normal procedure. Currently no vacancy exists at this location.</P>
      <P>A copy of the advertisement/notice will be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The selection committee, in inviting persons to apply for appointment to the Human Rights Commission, guaranteed in paragraph 6 of the application form that subject only to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, all applications would be treated in strict confidence. In light of these assurances, the Deputy will appreciate it would neither be fair to the applicants concerned, nor respectful of the work of the selection committee, for me to outline the recommendations of the selection committee to this House. The Deputy will further appreciate that, similar to any other matter considered by Government, it would be inappropriate to make public the detail of the proposals submitted to Government for its consideration for these appointments.</P>
      <P>As already announced, the Government yesterday offered appointments to the eight positions of part-time commissioner on the commission to the following persons from the total of 177 applicants who applied to the selection committee for consideration: Fionnuala  Aoláin, Professor of Law, University of Ulster; William Binchy, Professor of Law, Trinity College Dublin; Olive Braiden, Former Director of the Rape Crisis Centre and currently a member of the Court Service Board; Robert Daly, Chairman of the Department of Psychiatry, UCC and member of the Southern Health Board; Suzanne Egan, Lecturer in Human Rights Law, UCD; Jane Liddy, Former Irish member of the European Commission on Human Rights; Tom O'Higgins, Chairman of Concern Worldwide and previously senior partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers; Meryvn Taylor, Solicitor and former Minister for Equality and Law Reform and currently the Irish member of the European Monitoring Committee on Racism and Xenophobia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government wishes to place on the record its great appreciation and regard for the work of the selection committee. The task undertaken by it was an onerous one given the very high standard and number of the applications it had to consider and the very fine distinctions that had to be drawn between candidates of the highest calibre. In the final analysis and having regard to the recommendations of the selection committee, the Government took some time to ensure that the balance of skills and representation on the commission was, in its view, the best that could be achieved in line with the statutory and inter<Col N="1074" /> national criteria that are relevant in the case of national institutions of this type.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 163 and 169 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the provision of court statistics is a matter for the Courts Service and I no longer have direct responsibility in this regard.</P>
      <P>However, I understand from the Courts Service that delays in hearing family law cases have generally been reduced and in the majority of Circuit Courts any case in which both parties are ready to proceed will be listed for hearing at the next sittings of the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>I also understand that there is generally no delay in provincial District Courts as applications are usually listed for the next family law sitting. There is currently a delay of nine to ten weeks in Dublin Metropolitan District Court for barring order applications. Other matters such as maintenance and custody applications take three months. Of course, emergency applications, interim barring order applications, for example, are dealt with on the day of application.</P>
      <P>I am aware, however, that there are delays of between three and 12 months in some Circuit Court areas in family law matters. I am, of course, conscious of the emotional distress and anxiety family law cases can cause for all the parties concerned. Consequently I recently obtained Government approval for the appointment of an additional judge of the Circuit Court. This appointment will enable the President of the Circuit Court, who is, of course, responsible for the ordering of Court business, to address the problem of delays in so far as they can be attributed to the shortage of judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the establishment of specific family law courts, I am aware that the Courts Service shares my concerns and is committed to reducing, as far as it is within its control, any delays in hearing such cases, and to improving the facilities, information and service available to family law litigants and practitioners. To this end a committee of the Courts Service Board has been established to review the current procedure and manner in which family law cases are dealt with by the courts and to make recommendations for change thereto. As part of this review a pilot project for the reporting of family law cases will begin early next year. This will be the first time that such cases will be reported and it is hoped that this reporting will improve the information available to family law litigants and also assist the Courts <Col N="1076" /> Service in its future planning for the needs of family law cases.</P>
    <P>The duration of a court sitting is entirely a matter for the judge on the day and it would, therefore, be inappropriate for me as Minister, or, indeed, for the Courts Service to comment on that particular matter.</P>

      <P>The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, <Col N="1080" /> 1968 to 1992, provides for means-tested higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education. In order to qualify for grant assistance, a candidate must satisfy the relevant conditions of the scheme in regard to age, residency, means and nationality.</P>
      <P>My Department understands that the student, to whom the Deputy refers, already holds a postgraduate qualification, a higher diploma in business studies, and is currently pursuing a second postgraduate qualification, a higher diploma in guidance counselling at University College Cork. Under the terms of the higher education grants scheme, she is not eligible for grant assistance in respect of the second postgraduate course.</P>
      <P>However, section 21 of the Finance Act, 2000, provides for tax relief for postgraduate fees paid in publicly funded colleges here and in other EU member states, as well as in private colleges in the State. This relief, is available from the current tax year, applies at the standard rate of tax and is available to full-time and part-time post-graduate students. Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from local tax offices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 176 to 178, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I would like to emphasise that Exploring Masculinities is not a new syllabus but is a pack of resource materials, manual and video, which was produced by the equality committee of my Department to assist schools who are providing programmes of personal and social development in transition year and senior cycle. Schools are free to use all, some or none of the materials, having regard to the requirements of pupils and the views of parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The project was co-funded by the European Social Fund, under the equal opportunities actions measure in the human resources development operational programme. Funding was avail<Col N="1081" /> able to produce 1,000 copies of the materials, which is the normal amount of copies of such materials that are required to supply copies to schools, other educational establishments and the education support centres. In common with other similar materials, it is not the practice, for reasons of cost, to make copies available to other than schools or other educational bodies with a direct interest in using the materials. However, since copies are available for inspection in each of the 29 education support centres throughout the country, members of the public who requested a copy were given the name and address of their nearest education support centre. Alternatively, parents can inspect the materials in their son's school, if the school has obtained a copy.</P>
    <P>My Department received notification of the seminar referred to by the Deputy at very short notice. My Department was unable to participate in the seminar for this reason. Officials from my Department have met representatives from Amen and related organisations three times over the past year and have been in communication with them on many occasions.</P>
    <P>As I have already announced, I have asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, which has a statutory function under the Education Act, 1998, to advise me on all aspects of the curriculum, to undertake a review of the programme, including the views of teachers, parents and young persons participating in the programme. In this connection, I would draw the Deputy's attention to a recent letter supporting this initiative, published in <i>The Irish Times,</i> Friday, 24 November 2000, from the heads of the education departments of five Irish universities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Children who are deaf or who have hearing impairment are not a homogenous group either in terms of their hearing loss or of a wide range of other key factors. Therefore, no single response is appropriate or adequate when addressing the communication needs of this particular category of children. Educational provision is made for individual children, in consultation with their parents, on the basis of the assessed needs of each child.</P>
      <P>In this context, and in relation to the choice of communications systems, the fundamental decision is whether the most appropriate first language for the child is Irish sign language or spoken English.</P>
      <P>If the option is spoken English, which it will be in a significant number of cases, then a predominantly oral method of teaching is employed. In this oral approach, signed English is sometimes also used as a teaching device.</P>
      <P>If the option is for Irish sign language, then the child is taught in a linguistic environment that is predominantly or exclusively based on the use of Irish sign language. There is an increasing request for this approach by some parents on behalf of their children. The policy of my Department is to facilitate access to this approach so that the assessed needs of pupils and parental wishes are taken into account. In this regard, I have allocated additional resources to the two special schools in Dublin to allow them to establish a number of classes in which sign language is the medium for communication and teaching. My Department has also provided four special needs assistants, who are themselves deaf, for these schools in order to facilitate the development and use of Irish sign language as required. My Department has also provided support for a number of families with deaf children to allow them to employ tutors of Irish sign language in their homes.</P>
      <P>With regard to further developments in this area, my Department will continue its consultation with representatives of the deaf community and with other relevant bodies and individuals, including parents of deaf children. The increased use of Irish sign language in the education of deaf children has already been acknowledged in the Education Act, 1998.</P>
      <P>I have also decided to establish a representative advisory group which will offer guidance on key future developments in the education of the deaf, including the issue raised by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>My officials are examining the general question of materials costs incurred by students, including those pursuing art and design courses, with a view to identifying the issues and costs involved.</P>
      <P>On 11 November, I announced that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures. The issue of materials costs for students will be considered in this context. The project team is to report to me by the end of March 2001.</P>
      <P>With regard to facilitating greater participation in third level education by students from low income families, I established an action group on access to third level education, in September of this year. This action group will advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote participation at third level by students in three target groups &ndash; students with disabilities, students from disadvantaged backgrounds and mature second chance students. It will, <i>inter alia,</i> advise on the development of targeted interventions and actions at all levels. I have asked the group to provide a report to me within three months.</P>
      <P>The need to target resources at those most in need is well recognised and underpins my approach to tackling disadvantage. In this regard there is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan, aimed at tackling under-representation by the three target groups. The objective of this measure is to facilitate and improve access to the labour market for the beneficiaries while improving their long-term employability through enhancing their educational qualifications.</P>
      <P>As an indication of the Government's support in promoting equity in access and as an initial step, pending the findings of the action group, I announced the introduction of a special maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders, targeted at those most in need. The full rate of the special maintenance grant will increase from £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college; and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tentative indications are that up to 10,000 <Col N="1084" /> students may benefit from this measure. This is, of course, a tentative estimate and the actual number of students to benefit will depend on the outcome to the action group's work. The group's terms of reference specifically require that it advise me, <i>inter alia,</i> on the development of targeted interventions and actions and the identification and tracking of the target groups.</P>

      <P>Certain catering and domestic staff in St. Angela's College are currently on CJLC, Catering Joint Labour Committee, rates of pay. These rates are set by employment regulation orders of the Catering Joint Labour Committee of the Labour Court under section 48 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990. These orders fix statutory minimum rates of remuneration which are inclusive of round increases under the national wage agreements and regulate the statutory conditions of employment of the workers concerned. The current employment regulation order is dated August 2000 and, therefore, excludes 5.5% due under the first round of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness in October. My Department expects this increase to be included in the next order, which should be issued sometime next year.</P>
      <P>It would be usual for claims to be submitted to my Department following local discussions. My Department has not received any formal claims from St. Angela's College concerning the household and catering staff in the college.

      <P>Safety on school buses is of paramount importance to my Department and to Bus Éireann, which operates the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department. Bus Éireann has a very good safety record in the operation of school transport and an ongoing commitment to highlight safety in this regard.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 2,450 vehicles used in the school transport fleet. Around 1,800 of these are provided by private contractors and the balance by Bus Éireann.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann vehicles are serviced every six weeks under specified maintenance procedures to ensure that the highest safety standards are achieved. Any faults coming to the notice of Bus Éireann's maintenance staff are dealt with immediately. A large proportion of the existing Bus Éireann school bus fleet was refurbished during summer 1999.</P>
      <P>All vehicles operating under the scheme are required to meet the statutory regulations as laid down by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and are subject to a roadworthiness test. Where vehicles have over eight adult seats and are more than one year old, they are required to pass that Department's annual roadworthiness test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1086" /> Contractors employed by Bus Éireann to provide services under the school transport scheme must satisfy strict criteria and must hold a road passenger operator's licence. Vehicles nominated for use under the scheme must be suitable for the conveyance of school children and must have complete and current documentation in respect of both buses and drivers as required by law. The vehicles have to be kept and maintained in a safe and roadworthy condition and have to comply in all respects with the Road Traffic Acts.</P>
    <P>Contractor's vehicles are subject to inspection/testing by Bus Éireann inspectors from time to time to ensure the safety of pupils travelling on buses.</P>

      <P>National surveys of reading in primary schools were carried out in 1972, 1980, 1988, 1993 and 1998 by Department of Education and Science inspectors in co-operation with the Educational Research Centre &ndash; ERC &ndash; Drumcondra. Significant progress in pupils reading achievement was recorded between 1972 and 1980. The most recent survey of reading achievement of pupils in fifth class in 1998 indicated that there has been no significant change in reading standards over the past 20 years. Teachers esti<Col N="1089" /> mated that 10% of their pupils who participated in this survey functioned at a level that they considered as weak-inadequate.</P>
      <P>In 1990-91 the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement conducted a reading literacy study in 32 educational systems throughout the world. Irish nine year olds and 14-year olds participated in the study. Both Irish populations scored just above their respective international average. Further analysis of the data from this study by the ERC indicated that between 6½% to 8½% of Irish 14-year olds had serious literacy difficulties.</P>
      <P>Irish nine-year olds and 13-year olds participated in the second International Assessment of Educational Progress &ndash; IAEP &ndash; in Mathematics in 1991. While Irish nine year olds scored below the IAEP average, Irish 13 year olds performed at about the IAEP average.</P>
      <P>The 1995 Third International Mathematics and Science Study, TIMMS, involved Irish nine year olds and 13 year olds. The nine year old pupils were in third and fourth classes. The results showed that the mean mathematics scores of Irish pupils in both class grades were higher than the corresponding international mean mathematics scores and better than those of most other European countries participating, including England and Scotland. The mean mathematics scores of Irish 13 year olds, in first and second year grades in second level schools, were in each case higher than the respective international means.</P>
      <P>While it is gratifying to see that Irish pupils generally perform at a level above the international averages in both literacy and mathematics, it still does not allow us to be complacent about standards. Special attention must be given to the significant number of pupils, estimated at about 10%, who perform at a low level in both areas. In addition, in a competitive international environment, overall standards need to improve. The failure to register an increase in mean level of reading achievement in recent years among fifth class pupils is a cause for concern. It points to problems that need to be addressed in policy and in the conditions of learning in schools and homes.</P>
      <P>All teachers have received the revised primary curriculum and they have undergone significant training in the revised English curriculum. There is an increased emphasis in the English curriculum on raising literacy standards through the development of reading skills as part of a whole language process.</P>
      <P>The new leaving certificate English syllabus places particular emphasis on literacy and follows on from the revised junior certificate syllabus. Greater attention is given to comprehension and composition thereby enhancing the development of literacy skills. The mathematics programmes are presented at three levels at both junior certificate and leaving certificate levels. The foundation level programmes at both levels have been designed to develop the competence of low achievers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1090" /> School development planning guidelines have been issued to schools at first and second levels and training for school staff in this area has taken place. This initiative should ensure that there is a whole-school approach to the development and extension of literacy and mathematical skills, and a whole-school responsibility for raising standards in these areas. An important focus of this whole-school planning will be to prevent reading and mathematics difficulties and to identify and address the needs of pupils with difficulties at the earliest possible time.</P>
    <P>The remedial teaching service has been increased and now comprises 1480 remedial teachers to cover all primary schools. There are over 500 whole-time equivalent remedial teachers in second level schools. The allocation of these teachers should have an impact in reducing the number of those with serious literacy and mathematics difficulties. Revised guidelines on remedial education/learning support have been issued to primary schools and training for teachers in this regard is being planned at present. The general improvements in the staffing of primary schools, coupled with the £6.5 million allocated to schools for the purchase of library books and the many activities which have been taking place under the national reading initiative will be of major benefit in raising reading standards and in reducing literary difficulties.</P>
    <P>A range of schemes is already in place in disadvantaged areas and these consist of the early start pre-school project, the breaking the cycle pilot project, the home-school community liaison scheme, the eight to 15 year old early school leavers initiative and stay in school retention initiative at second level. All of these should have a positive effect on raising standards of literacy and mathematics in these schools. It is planned to provide psychological services to all schools through the expansion of the national educational psychological service and to extend the provision of resource teaching services to schools where a need for such has been diagnosed.</P>
