      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of related notices under Standing Order 31 from Deputies Howlin and Jim Higgins. I propose to call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the terms of Standing Order 31, I wish to give notice of my intention to seek the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent attention: the comments made by the Taoiseach in a radio interview in which he stated that Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty should explain his role in the Philip Sheedy affair; the need for the Government to withdraw the nomination of Mr. O'Flaherty as vice-president of the European Investment Bank pending the issuing of such a statement by Mr. O'Flaherty and an examination of that statement by an appropriate Oireachtas committee; and the implications for the Government's ability to deal with current serious problems facing the country in light of the new divisions which have emerged between the parties in Government, particularly between the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste. I hope this request will be granted.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>I wish to seek the adjournment of the business of Dáil Éireann under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of urgent public importance: the statement made by the Taoiseach yesterday that Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty, the Government nominee to the board of the European Investment Bank, should make a public statement on his involvement in the Philip Sheedy affair and put on record the facts surrounding his involvement in this case which led to his resignation as a judge of the Supreme Court; and that the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, which previously examined this matter, should be <Col N="1098" /> convened at once to seek such a statement and hear evidence from Mr. O'Flaherty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we proceed with the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) (Amendment) Bill, the Taoiseach should provide us with further information on a matter affecting the courts. Will he explain what he was attempting to do in the radio interview yesterday when he spoke about former judge, Hugh O'Flaherty? Was he attempting to get Mr. O'Flaherty to withdraw as the Government's nominee in the same manner in which former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, succeeded in getting Dr. Smurfit to withdraw as chairman of Telecom following a radio interview? Has the Taoiseach put the questions to which he <Col N="1099" /> seeks answers directly to Mr. O'Flaherty and, if not, why not? If the Taoiseach was not seeking Mr. O'Flaherty's withdrawal but rather to have a series of questions answered, will he establish a committee of the House whereby answers could also be provided by Mr. Joe Burke, Mr. Quinlan, former judge Mr. Kelly, Mr. Matthews, the Taoiseach himself and all the other people involved in this affair in order that we can ascertain the truth?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am equally opposed to the proposal. The Labour Party is opposed to taking this legislation before clarity is provided on matters requiring the Taoiseach's explanation.</P>
      <P>On a more fundamental issue, do we have a Government at the moment? No Progressive Democrats Members are present in the Chamber. The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs came to the Chamber for the Order of Business and left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is another conclave taking place or are mediators going between the parties in Government? Has the Taoiseach had discussions this morning with the Tánaiste? Do we have a Government? Will the Taoiseach act on his remarks of yesterday and ensure a full and adequate explanation of the Sheedy affair and of Mr. O'Flaherty's role in it is given before he proceeds with the nomination of Mr. O'Flaherty to <Col N="1100" /> the vice-presidency of the European Investment Bank?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure Deputy Bruton that I had no such motives yesterday. Deputy Howlin has asked that I make my position clear. The Government is collectively responsible for the nomination of Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty to the European Investment Bank. As leader of the Government I fully stand over that decision. With all my colleagues we made the decision. The Government had no reason to believe anything untoward needed to be added by way of explanation with regard to the controversy surrounding the Sheedy affair. So that there will be no doubt about the subject of Deputy Howlin's question, I wish Mr. O'Flaherty well. I have no doubt he will do an excellent job in the bank and I hope he serves a long and full period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach require an explanation from Mr. O'Flaherty in advance of the decision to appoint him to the European Investment Bank or will he resile yet again from the position he enunciated on radio last night?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I made it absolutely clear in last night's interview that there is no question of that. Mr. O'Flaherty has been nominated to the post. I hope he gets on with the job, I wish him well in it and I hope he serves a full and healthy term of office. That is the end of the story.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, has the Chair had an opportunity to consider the point I made before the suspension? I want to be orderly but a number of basic facts must be established, the most pertinent of which is if there is still a Government. It is important that the precedent of the spokespersons of the Opposition parties being afforded an opportunity to raise topical issues is maintained. The survival of the Government is certainly a matter for the House and that issue should be accommodated on this occasion. Perhaps the Ceann Comhairle has had an opportunity to reflect on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat what I said earlier. The Chair has discretion regarding the number of questions that may be raised on the Order of Business . The relevant Standing Order 26.3 states, <i>inter alia</i>, the Ceann Comhairle may, at his or her discretion, permit questions to be raised about business. There is no doubt about the Chair's power in this regard. If Members wish to change that Standing Order, it is in their hands to do so.</P>
      <P>The decision I took this morning was not unprecedented. On a number of occasions on which there has been disorder, in spite of many attempts by the Chair to correct it, the Chair has called the next business and will do so again when there is disorder. There was gross disorder when the Chair appealed repeatedly for Deputy Bruton to resume his seat and allow the business to continue. He refused to do so and admitted that he was disorderly. The Chair was left with no option but to move to the next business as I have done on many occasions previously. There are other ways during the course of the day in which matters can be raised, for example, on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle's explanation. However, it is grossly unfair that my party was disenfranchised by disorderly behaviour by any other Member. It is most important that the Opposition parties are given a chance to put questions to the Taoiseach. When the stability of the Government is in question, it is important that the Taoiseach immediately addresses the issue. Has there been any request from the Taoiseach under Standing Order 42 to make a statement to the House later today to <Col N="1108" /> clarify his comments last night and the position of the Government?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is certainly a matter relevant to the House.

    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;(3) Where a student has had problems relating to school attendance in a previous school, the school to which the application is made may request that the Board carry out an assessment of any special resources needed by that student and the capacity of the school to provide those resources.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Deputy Richard Bruton was replying to the debate on amendment No. 59.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an appropriate amendment in that it deals with certain people's non-attendance to their duties. Unfortunately, it does not relate to the non-attendance of Ministers or the Taoiseach to their duties.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the problem of school attendance. Where a student is identified as having serious attendance problems in a school and has, for one reason or another, been suspended or expelled and has decided to go to an alternative school to continue his or her education, there should be an opportunity for the school accepting the pupil to assess the additional resources required to ensure it has the capacity to deal successfully with the young person's education. The Minister suggested this amendment might be used as a way of excluding low performing pupils. However, schools will be more willing to accept their responsibilities towards pupils with behavioural or other problems if they have the confidence of knowing they can go to the Department and have an assessment carried out on the child in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is a need for special backup, whether psychological or counselling, the school should have an opportunity, with the help of the Department, to identify whatever measures are appropriate to the child's needs and ensure that an edu<Col N="1114" /> cation plan is put in place for that pupil. It is ironic that we are happy to put in place education plans for pupils after they have dropped out of school, but the Minister is unprepared to give a commitment when a child exhibits behavioural problems or difficulties in school or before they leave the education system.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to change the Bill as drafted. I hope the Minister will accept such a measure is needed if we want to deal successfully with pupils with persistent non-attendance problems, which often leads to long-term suspension or expulsion. Many pupils often find they cannot continue in a school and have to change to another school.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Briscoe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will now discuss amendment No. 60. Amendment No. 61 is an alternative. Amendments Nos. 60 and 61 may be discussed together by agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 60:</P>
      <P>In page 18, to delete lines 3 to 8 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) The principal of a recognised school shall, on receiving a notification under <i>subsection (3)</i> in relation to a child, notify the principal of the school first-mentioned in that subsection of&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) any problems relating to school attendance that the child concerned had while attending the second-mentioned school referred to therein, and</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) such other matters relating to the child's educational progress as he or she considers appropriate.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 60 arises out of discussions during Committee Stage. Its purpose is to ensure that school principals are enabled to pass on both information relating to specific problems with school attendance and any other information relating to the child's educational development, which the principal considers relevant. I do not agree that information relating to illness, especially illness which amounts to a school attendance problem, should be ignored in reporting between schools. Illness, particularly recurring illness or long bouts of illness, can be a significant factor in a child's education and in his or her welfare. A school should know about that if it is affecting the child's education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of illness as an excuse for non-attendance could mask more serious underlying problems. In this context, a recent study into non-attendance carried out in a Dublin area indicated that more than 70% of all cases where a child fails to attend school are excused on the basis that the child concerned had a stomach upset or a headache. While accepting that the majority of these excuses were valid, the report raised ques<Col N="1115" /> tions as to whether families which attach a low priority to education are using illness as a convenient means to detract attention away from non-attendance. The report stated that the ease and frequency with which parents write notes to excuse their children may denote an underlying belief on the part of parents, and indeed the children, that the education system has very little to offer them. I made this amendment following our discussions on Committee Stage, but I do not propose to accept amendment No. 61.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is inexplicable that the Minister will refuse, as he did in regard to the previous amendment, to provide any assessment of a child who has exhibited problems such as persistent illness and any necessary resources to allow that child successfully complete his or her education while insisting, in the next amendment, that illness is an important issue that is relevant to a school assessing the intake of a pupil and that this is something that may be used as a subterfuge. I accept that illness is an important issue and that information about it is passed on but if a child has illnesses that result in persistent non-attendance and perhaps the need for home tuition to support his or her activities in the school, I do not understand why the Minister is not agreeable to an assessment of that child's position or to the provision of home tuition or whatever else we deem necessary. This goes to the core of what is wrong with the Bill and the Minister has consistently put his head in the sand on this issue.</P>
      <P>There is no point having elaborate notification procedures, notes and messages streaming from principal to principal and maintaining long attendance records if there is not a willingness to say that a child who needs extra resources as a result of our early warning provisions will have those assessed in detail, that the school will not be left alone to cope and that there will be a proper assessment procedure with a proper statutory base in place to ensure that something is done for that child. The Minister has failed this House in providing a Bill that does not commit to that sort of approach to children who have difficulties. When the child has abandoned school and there is no chance of him or her continuing in education, the Minister is quite happy to put in place a plan to try to help their training and further education, but while the child is still within the system, when the case is still retrievable, there is not the same commitment. While I do not have any profound objection to this amendment, it only highlights the hypocrisy of not accepting my earlier amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton is talking mainly about the previous amendment and the provision of resources. I assure the Deputy that the intention of the Bill and of the Education Welfare Board is to ensure that the resources are directed in a realistic and timely way and that the problems are identified at the earliest time so that this <Col N="1116" /> can be done. I intend to follow through on that because I believe it is particularly important. Fortunately we live in a much more enlightened age when we are providing, for the first time, substantial resources to support children in need or disadvantaged in school in any way through the provision of resource and remedial teachers and all of that system. Assistance of various kinds is being built up rapidly and that will continue. The same applies to the measures under this legislation. The intention is to give support to children so that they can receive the education. We must ensure they are identified as early as possible and that they get the necessary back-up either at home from the parents if the children are ill or from the support which is frequently provided when parents notify the Department and the school authorities in relation to serious illness. On the other hand, we want to make sure that mild illness is not used as an excuse for not giving a child a basic education and for that reason it is important to include this amendment. I understand the general point the Deputy is making in his amendment which refers to &ldquo;other than for reasons of illness&rdquo;, but this amendment is necessary because if we are to give the support&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is separate legislation relating to confidentiality. The main reason for this amendment is that when a pupil is to be moved from one school to another, the principals will exchange information on the problems to be <Col N="1117" /> overcome. If people do not want to disclose the details of an illness, they do not have to do so. If it is a question of illness or serious illness, the study carried out indicated that 70% of the cases involved headaches, tummy aches and so on but they often indicate something quite different, in other words, unease, unhappiness or, unfortunately, abuse.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The requirement that principals inform an educational welfare officer when a child has been absent from school for 15 days in a school year has provoked considerable debate. On the one hand, it is argued it is overly prescriptive, bureaucratic and could damage relations between schools and parents, but on the other hand, the interests of the children must be protected and any significant absence from school during a school year potentially threatens a child's education. To set a reasonable balance between the <Col N="1118" /> rights of children and the needs of the schools, it is considered the threshold after which a report must be made should be increased to 20 days.</P>
    <P>Having raised the threshold, I do not propose to accept Deputy Bruton's amendment. As I stated earlier, illness, especially illness that amounts to a school attendance problem or a recurring or long bout of illness, can be a significant factor in a child's education and welfare. Schools should be, therefore, required to report that to an educational welfare officer.</P>
    <P>I accept the points made by the Deputies on Committee Stage. I am prepared to increase the number of days from 15 to 20, as I consider that is reasonable.</P>

      <P>On the balance of the argument presented, I will accept the Minister's amendment, given that under section 20(4)(<i>d</i>) a principal, who believes a child is not attending school regularly, has an opportunity to notify the educational welfare officer of that child's absence. There is a need for a long stop measure where such an obligation to notify applies. I am happy a reasonable balance has been struck by the Minister's amendment, which provides for increasing the number of days from 15 to 20. On the basis that the Minister will reconsider the handling of the issue of illness, I will withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Michael Higgins said on Committee Stage, there appears to be a contradiction between section 20(4)(<i>d</i>) and section 19(6), which limits acceptable reasons for absence from school. For that reason, I ask the Minister to reconsider the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage there was some confusion about how this section relates to section 19(6), which provides only two instances where a child might leave the register. Deputy Higgins tabled a similar amendment on Committee Stage to eliminate any inconsistency. There is, however, no inconsistency between the two sections. Section 19(6) refers to a child, that is, a student who is below school leaving age while this section includes all students, those who are above and below school leaving age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Students who are above school leaving age may leave the register for a number of reasons, primarily because they have finished school. In those situations it is right that the local educational welfare officer should be informed to enable him or her provide support and assistance, where appro<Col N="1119" /> priate, such as to assist in the provision of further education and training.</P>
    <P>The confusion arises as a result of a technical difference between the definition of a child and the definition of a pupil. The legal school leaving age has been 15 until now and it will be increased to 16. The intention is to provide plans and supports for children aged between 16 and 18 who enter the workplace to ensure employers will be required to give them time off to complete short courses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>I move amendment No. 64<i>a</i>:</P>
      <P>In page 18, between lines 41 and 42, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) On receiving a notice under <i>subsection (4)</i>, an educational welfare officer shall&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) consult with the student concerned, his or her parents, the principal and such other persons as he or she considers appropriate, and</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) make all reasonable efforts to ensure that provision is made for the continued education of the child and his or her full participation in school.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton's amendment seeks to set out precisely what action an educational welfare officer should take in particular circumstances. I agree with the thrust of the Deputy's amendment relating to section 22(1). I am pleased to bring forward by way of amendment No. 64<i>a </i>a provision that will place an onus on an educational welfare officer, who receives a notification from the principal of a school that a child is not attending regularly, to liaise with the child, his or her parents, the principal and anybody else deemed appropriate by the officer. The officer must also try to ensure that provision is made for the child's continued education.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's amendment relating to section 22(2) appears to envisage that an educational welfare officer will act to provide an alternative means of education for any students who experience difficulties in school. I intend that the officer's role should be somewhat different. Initially the officer's task will be to assist pupils and schools where a pupil is experiencing difficulties in order to resolve any difficulties within the school. Should that prove impossible and the school expels the student, the role of the officer will be to employ his or her liaison skills and links with other schools to facilitate the enrolment of the pupil in another school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1120" /> The main focus, therefore, is to provide for the educational needs of all pupils within recognised schools. That may not be possible in a small number of cases. As Deputy Bruton suggested, in such situations the National Educational Welfare Board will need to directly intervene to ensure that the child concerned continues to receive an education.</P>
    <P>I have provided for that situation in section 26, which provides that the board must take appropriate action to ensure the continuance of a student's education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have significantly watered down my proposal in light of the Committee Stage debate. The Minister has come a small distance to meet my proposal, but the distance he has come is disappointing. This issue is at the core of the Bill. We are talking about what happens when the early warning system is triggered and what we will do to help children who exhibit persistent problems. As the Minister said, there may be some cases where the issues can be quickly and easily resolved, but there will be others where serious problems will be unearthed. It is important that we, as legislators, set out a framework within which those cases can be dealt with.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment provides that in such cases an educational welfare officer should consult different people and then make all reasonable efforts to ensure provision is made for the continued education of the child concerned. There is nothing offensive about that, but my amendment is more in tune with what the Minister seeks to provide for later in the Bill, where he proposes that a plan would be prepared to assist young people who have left school to avail of educational opportunities, that the board should give all such other assistance to young persons &ndash; alternative education if that arises &ndash; or other persons it considers appropriate.</P>
      <P>For the purpose of carrying out such a plan, it is proposed that the board will mediate with the other services to deliver appropriate supports to the student in the context of the plan, for example, speech therapy, psychological support, work experience, Youthreach etc. or anything that constitutes a package and works for that child and monitor the progress of the student in the context of the plan.</P>
      <P>The Minister has already been thumbing the pages of his 1971 book on management and will say this is not an issue for the Oireachtas but one for the educational welfare officer. I beg to differ, because the weight of experience in the education system is that where these things are not made explicit they do not happen. If you go back through our history we have failed children who have special needs. The Minister has almost admitted that. Children with special needs are forgotten at the back of the class, they drop out or are troublesome and people are happy to see them suspended and they fade into the woodwork to join the long-term unemployed or worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is about drawing a line in the sand for <Col N="1121" /> such children. We want to see a structured way back for those children and we want more than vague references to making reasonable efforts. We all know people would say they did what was reasonable. There will have to be a structure within which the reasonable efforts occur and where a parent, guardian or whoever takes an interest in the child, can ask the board if it has been mediating with others or monitoring that child's progress. We are fooling ourselves if this structure is put in place and the Minister claps himself on the back and says, &ldquo;We now have a modern Education (Welfare) Act&rdquo;. At the end of the day, we must be able to say there are rights that are capable of being exercised on behalf of children who head into educational disadvantage of all sorts. This is the core of the Bill. This is what we want. I have listened to many Deputies on both sides and they recognise we have failed children at the back of the class.</P>
    <P>The drop out rate is one in five or 20%. Among 17 year olds, the drop out rate is 17%. One in six cannot read the side of an aspirin package. There are serious problems in the educational system among children who are weak. We are aware from surveys that those weaknesses are exhibited early on in poor attendance problems. The only time one can catch them is through a process such as this. We are setting up a bureaucratic system of early warning but we are not equally specific and prescriptive about what happens when the red light shines, when the children are persistently non&ndash;attendant. What will happen to those children? We know from surveys in your constituency, Acting Chairman, that in some disadvantaged schools 12.5%, one in eight children are absent for more than half the year &ndash;  75 to 80 days. A structured response is needed. While I am pleased the Minister has moved some distance I am not happy that his amendment is sufficiently explicit. I hope he will accept my alternative approach.</P>
    <P>The Minister said this presupposes that we will go for alternative educational provision. It does not do any such thing. I propose that the educational welfare officer will consult the young person, the principal and so on in an effort to secure satisfactory attendance and participation at that registered school, if it is in the student's best interest. That is the first port of call, to make every effort to ensure that the child can successfully continue in that school. Where the educational welfare officer is unable to secure that, the board will trigger this response, after consultation with the young person. This is the second line of defence after the first effort has failed.</P>
    <P>I am not prescribing that every single notification of 20 days absence should result in a plan because that is not reasonable. There are probably 10,000 children who have serious attendance problems who could be notified to the board. It would not be reasonable or practical to do that. Where the educational welfare officer cannot succeed with the normal approaches and needs the support of psychologists, extra interventions, <Col N="1122" /> alternative settings, safe havens for the child who could participate sometimes in the school and sometimes in other settings, we cannot say it will be all right on the night and that it will happen because we know it will not be all right on the night. This amendment goes to the heart of the proper structure.</P>
    <P>Conscious of what the Minister said on Committee Stage I have attempted to make my amendment more reasonable from an administrative point of view and I hope he will accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support Deputy Bruton's amendment No. 68. The Minister's amendment is much too loose and vague. Presumably everybody working in the system makes reasonable efforts and yet the system is failing many children. We need to be specific about what is required where there is consistent non-attendance at school. I can think of a number of categories of children who have difficulties with school attendance, for example, those houses where nobody gets up in the morning at 7.30 a.m. or 8 a.m. Sadly this is an increasingly common occurrence where there is only night time activity in the home. In this environment a child has little chance of getting out to school not to mention being on time.</P>
      <P>I was struck recently by a project in my constituency where a group works with children at risk. Its first act to assist children with school attendance is to buy them an alarm clock in recognition of the fact that nobody gets up in the morning to wake the children or to get breakfast. Often the needs are that basic. In that situation there is a need to draw up a plan for that child, for family supports to be put in place to help the family function normally, and to provide the support and care to which that child is entitled. In those circumstances it would be easy to argue that reasonable efforts were made to get that child out to school whereas what is actually needed for that child is that serious interventions are made into that family's life and that proper supports are put in place. That is the kind of action that is required if adequate numbers of children are to be kept in the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A common reason for non-attendance is that students have to look after younger siblings. Speaking to a youth club recently in my constituency I was struck that the issue of child care came up. I was surprised that 13 and 14 year olds were interested in the issue of child care. It transpired that they saw child care as offering them the opportunity to have their own younger brother or sister cared for which would free them up to live a normal life of a teenager. That is a serious indictment of society. There is a problem where parents are forced to go out to work for economic reasons and where teenagers or even ten or 11 year olds are required to stay at home to look after the baby or the toddler. Clearly in that situation it is not a question of requiring reasonable efforts to be made but of ensuring that a serious intervention is made in that family and that the <Col N="1123" /> family supports necessary for the family to function normally are made available. A plan must be drawn up and there must be careful mediation with the appropriate health and welfare services to intervene in that family to help them provide the normal care and support which their children need.</P>
    <P>What the Minister is proposing is wholly inadequate given the scale of the problem of non-attendance at school. I am happy to support Deputy Bruton's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the greatest problems afflicting Irish society but there does not appear to be recognition of its extent. Perhaps the Minister will say how many education welfare officers he intends to employ.</P>
      <P>This problem has been growing for 20 years. I am a school teacher by profession although I have not taught for many years. The type of problems I encounter at my constituency clinics did not exist when I was teaching or, if they did, it was to a minute degree. The establishment has not taken account of the changes that have occurred over the last 20 years. The breakdown in the social fabric has meant there are thousands, probably tens of thousands, of children who do not go to school or who go there on an irregular basis. They are illiterate leaving school and have virtually no chance of getting meaningful employment.</P>
      <P>It took an OECD report last week to make people realise the extent of the problem. The report pointed out that 25% of adults and adolescents are, for all practical purposes, illiterate. The Minister issued a statement saying that the amount of money allocated to the problem has increased from £600,000 to approximately £16 million. That is not the point. The depth of the problem has not been understood or tackled. Throwing money at it and saying there are remedial teachers to help children in this category is not the solution. Remedial teachers are teachers who have simply completed courses to help them deal with the problems of these children.</P>
      <P>The teachers in a primary school in an urban area of my constituency, which is not even classified as disadvantaged, tell me their job is not education but containment. The children arrive at school hungry, with no homework done and ill equipped to be educated. It takes all the teachers' time just to manage them. Education becomes a secondary concern. The children run wild. This is due to the breakdown of the social fabric, broken homes and unmarried mothers. We have seen this in relation to housing. We are probably more immediately concerned with housing because it is usually the first problem with which these people come to us. However, the breakdown in the education system is mammoth and is not being dealt with. The admission that it exists is not even made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must recognise there is a problem if we are to attempt to solve it. Massive resources will be <Col N="1124" /> required to solve it. Fully qualified remedial teachers are required, not just teachers who have completed a course. The remedial teachers are doing a tremendous job but we are only skimming the surface. We are not dealing with the problem in depth. Some of these children should be in classes as small as three or four pupils. That is the long and the short of it. Massive resources and will power will be required to deal with the problem confronting us.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to special needs. When I was teaching I did not encounter special needs. Difficulties such as dsylexia and the need for speech therapy obviously existed but we put them down to pupils being slow learners or pupils with difficulties. They were not identified. Now they are being identified but I am not convinced that the difficulties are being addressed as they should be. I do not blame the Minister or the Government for that. We are all to blame. We have not recognised what is happening before our eyes. Parents come to me about children with difficulties like cerebral palsy. That is a real problem where doing examinations or even homework is concerned. These are huge problems and they are virtually swept under the carpet.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Shortall mentioned, many children come to school hungry. The school to which I referred in my constituency provides breakfasts. The children arrive there hungry with no homework done. Many of the parents are illiterate as well so the children get no help with their homework. They have no chance of succeeding within the education system or within society. This House is failing those children.</P>
    <P>I am not seeking a defensive attitude from the Minister but an admission that this is the true situation. There are huge numbers of children for whom the education system means little or nothing. Huge numbers of people are, for all practical purposes, illiterate. I believe the level of illiteracy has grown in the past ten or 15 years, even though we claim to have a super education system. We did have such a system and it was probably due to the religious orders, a tremendous body of dedicated men and women, running our national schools over the last century. That is slipping away from us and the children are suffering.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that the Minister would start a revolution to confront and rectify the situation. He should start a movement and not simply dot the i's and insert commas and semi colons. He should admit there is a massive problem and set about dealing with it. I know many of these youngsters. They are unemployable. All they are fit for is manual work where no reading skill is involved.</P>
    <P>Youngsters of 18 and 19 years of age come to my clinics to ask me to fill out forms for them. They are well dressed and pleasant but they are not literate. That is a shocking indictment in this millennial year and the problem is increasing by <Col N="1125" /> the day and the year. We owe it to the children to look after them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment and I agree with much of what Deputy Deasy said. I have a great deal of contact with the national schools in my constituency and I do not believe that the extent of the problem of educational disadvantage is appreciated. Greater resources are and have been provided over the last few years. Unfortunately, however, in some areas the social problems, particularly those related to drug abuse, are even greater now than they were in the past. While additional resources have been put into these schools, in many instances they are totally inadequate. The end result is that many of the children who could be saved if the resources were put in at an early stage inevitably become victims of heroin and various other social problems.</P>
      <P>Recently I received a copy of a letter from the principal of one such school to Deputy Eoin Ryan, Minister of State with responsibility for drugs. I was appalled by the letter and I hope the Minister will take on board some of the points made in it. The principal said he came to the school as acting principal in March 1999. He had come from a school in Rathfarnham, was utterly shocked at the level of need of the children in this school and was equally shocked at the inadequacy of the statutory services to meet the needs of these children. He said it was a poorly equipped school with insufficient psychological services and a lack of co-ordination of services, etc. The morale of the teaching staff had become so low that all of them left the school in the first year while this principal was trying to cope with the difficulties. He set about recruiting a whole new staff and was extremely lucky. He said that the school now has a fine staff of eight teachers who are in the process of turning the school around. They are working extremely hard and are just about getting their heads above water. He pointed out that 28 of the 83 pupils in the school at present have been psychologically assessed and all require placement in a special school or special class. They have children from the Travelling community, children of refugees and children from a residential home. Many of the pupils have acute emotional, behavioural and social problems but the school is doing its best for all of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems the school is trying to cope. However, the reason the school principal wrote to the Minister of State, Deputy Eoin Ryan, is that the school, St. Michael's CBS national school, serves the community in St. Michael's Estate, Inchicore, a community which is probably the most devastated by heroin in Dublin. Because the school dropped two children in September 1999, all the efforts the principal and staff have been making are now being undermined by the Department of Education and Science telling the school that it must lose a teacher. The school principal stated, &ldquo;We find it appalling that if, in spite of all the work we have put in and the huge level of need <Col N="1126" /> that all are now acknowledging is in the area &ndash; because our numbers on roll were down just two pupils last September 30th we must now lose a teacher&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is not the only school to which this type of thing is happening. The Department of Education and Science has no policy which is specific to the designated drugs task force areas in Dublin. The Government designated these areas with the objective of providing greater resources, yet the Department of Education and Science which can help with the drugs problem and reach vulnerable children at an age when they might be identified and helped, has no policy or flexibility in relation to these schools. If these schools drop one or two children below the departmental number they lose a teacher and it does not matter a damn what effort the school has made to help these children.</P>
    <P>I have raised this issue in various questions and received the usual departmental answer which I felt was quite insulting to the school and the efforts it is making. If teachers and principals in the front line, who are trying to help children in the most devastated communities, get a response from the Department of Education and Science that they must lose a teacher, we are wasting our time talking in the context of Education (Welfare) Bills. I ask the Minister to consider the particular needs of this school to ensure it does not lose a teacher and that it is given greater resources to carry out its work rather than undermined by the loss of a vital member of its staff.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the points raised by the Deputies but we are discussing specifically the operation of the new national educational welfare board and the welfare officers. Deputy Shortall highlighted some of the more immediate problems which in some instances could be solved by the use of an alarm clock. This is a local community approach. The alarm clock is indicative of the need for practical solutions such as local and parental support. This was highlighted further in Deputy Deasy's contribution. I recognised this problem when I first took up my post as Minister for Education and Science and I will be working on the issue with great intent and providing additional funds.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about attendance officers. A figure of 50 or 60 has been mentioned and £4.25 million is being provided immediately in this regard. The Government intends to make this work and whatever resources are needed will be considered. It was mentioned that a study on adult literacy had been carried out. The ratio of unemployed to employed people scoring in the lowest levels was 2:1. There are issues to be dealt with right through to adult literacy. Problems in this regard arise as a result of what has happened in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced about the value of meals in schools but how it is operated is important. There must not be a public system of meals in schools without recognising what Deputy Shortall was saying. I will be giving great consideration to the <Col N="1127" /> development of this aspect. I will return later to Deputy Gregory's point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is missing the point. The amendment seeks to set up a structured way of dealing with children who exhibit serious problems whether they come from a community which has a serious drugs problem or they have other behavioural problems. If the educational welfare officer working with the school cannot resolve the problem, the resources to help that child succeed must be available.</P>
      <P>We recently conducted a survey which showed that 35% of children receiving speech therapy receive it for ten minutes or less per week. Speech therapy needs cannot be addressed on that basis. The evidence proves that the resources these children need are not being delivered. If we are to set up this elaborate early warning system, there must be a mechanism to identify a child's problems, the solutions to them and a method to monitor progress. That is what we are looking for &ndash; a commitment that something real will be put in place rather than salving our consciences by saying we passed the Education (Welfare) Bill, 2000, so everything is fine. Unless we put in place such a step by step approach, where a child and his or her parents or guardians have certain rights which they can exercise when these problems occur, we will not deliver the change we want. This is where the Bill falls down.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Bruton's amendment and agree with the procedure it outlines. The Minister talks about goodwill but this legislation will be in place long after we have left this House. There is no guarantee the Minister will be around to ensure certain steps are taken. Deputy Bruton's amendment attempts to co-ordinate the skills necessary to resolve the problem of a child who sees no point in attending school.</P>
      <P>There are areas in all of our constituencies where such things happen and, in many instances, it would be honest for parents to say they have done their best and can do no more. Those parents could be the victims of circumstance themselves and may not be capable of dealing with the problem. They need the support of not only a welfare officer but of people in the community to help the child or children to see that education has a meaning.</P>
      <P>During the by-election campaign when I was canvassing in a town in south Tipperary I asked two 17 year old lads who were sitting outside a house what they were doing. They told me they had finished school. I then asked them what they were going to do with themselves. They replied that there was nothing for them to do and that there were no jobs in the area. Those two lads had spent 13 years in school but education meant nothing to them. I asked if they would do a further course and they did not have a clue what they would do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1128" /> Governments of all sides have no difficulty finding money to build prisons or to deal with crime on the streets but unless we get it right when children are young, Governments are bound to need more prison places in the future. The circumstances in which some children live, the lack of proper housing, no proper meals and no encouragement to study are the major problems on the ground. It is meaningless to say, as the Minister did, that the welfare officer will consult with the student concerned, his or her parents, the school principal and other persons considered appropriate, and make all reasonable efforts to ensure provision is made for the continued education of the child and his or her participation in school.</P>
    <P>Those appointed as welfare officers will be committed to their jobs but the £4.25 million quoted by the Minister is over a three year period. If a welfare officer costs £25,000 per year, we will be lucky if there will be 100 in the State. We will be asking 100 people to do the best they can across the entire State. At least Deputy Bruton is attempting to establish structures where the welfare officer would be obliged to do certain things and consult with certain people in the community to solve the problem. If there are 100 welfare officers for the entire State&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, and the system is a shambles. There is no point in saying there will be £4.25 million available over three years. We spend £100 million on building prisons and millions more trying to deal with a drug problem which is already endemic when we should be trying to prevent the illness before it happens.</P>
      <P>There is consensus in the House that there is a need for massive investment in this area. When we have an opportunity to introduce legislation like this, we should make certain that an amendment from the Opposition side of the House, if it is a good idea, is included in the Bill. It would not be a defeat for the Government, it would represent the combined efforts of all parties because we all see this on the ground every day of the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The example of the school in Inchicore given by Deputy Gregory could apply anywhere in the city. If we are putting so much effort into solving this problem, why do we have to explain to parents and teachers at public meetings why they are losing teachers? We look like fools and that is why people are losing confidence in the political system; they see we cannot do anything. If we cannot do anything, and if the Minister will not accept reasonable amendments that will force <Col N="1129" /> future Governments to do certain things, we are not doing our jobs.</P>
    <P>I would support this amendment no matter who tabled it because it is a good idea. We should make it loud and clear that all TDs demand adequate resources to deal with problems before they become insurmountable. We must ask why we spend such huge sums of money on the drugs problem and on prison places. Despite the success of the Celtic tiger and the number of vacancies in the labour market, over 160,000 people continue to sign on for unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance. These people continue to sign on because the system has failed to provide them with a meaningful education and they see no place for themselves in the workforce.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider the his amendment and that tabled in Deputy Bruton's name. As far as I am concerned, Deputy Bruton's amendment is far more comprehensive because it imposes an obligation in law for certain action to be taken where children are in need of help.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a wide ranging debate on this and a number of other issues that are highly relevant to the general situation. The powers to which Deputy Barrett referred in his concluding remarks are already contained in various sections of the Bill. As stated earlier, section 26 provides that the national educational welfare board may intervene directly in order to ensure that a child continues to receive an education. The section to which the amendment refers contains a similar provision.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, Deputies stated that I should include a provision whereby, in the case of early interventions, welfare officers would be required to discuss matters with a child's parents and other interested parties. That is the purpose of amendment No. 64<i>a</i>, which I have tabled despite the fact that powers and duties relating to this area are already contained in the Bill. However, on Committee Stage, Members requested that it should be clearly stated that education welfare officers shall &ldquo;consult with the student concerned, his or her parents, the principal and such other persons as he or she considers appropriate&rdquo; and &ldquo;make all reasonable efforts to ensure that provision is made for the continued education of the child and his or her full participation in school.&rdquo;  By introducing the amendment, I have gone part of the way towards complying with Members' requests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Gregory and Barrett referred to the number of teachers employed in our schools. The school system operates on the basis of the pupil-teacher ratio, which is agreed by parents, boards of management, the INTO &ndash; in the case of primary education &ndash; teachers and the Department and depends on the circumstances which obtain in individual schools. If the number of children attending a school which is in the process of growing and developing drops below the agreed limit, teachers who are considered excess to requirements are transferred to schools where their ser<Col N="1130" /> vices are badly required. This unforeseen dividend is reinvested in the education system and it is the way that reinvestment is made which was the subject of negotiation.</P>
    <P>If the board of management of a developing school can show that its needs will grow in the coming year and that the drop in pupil numbers was merely an aberration, it may make an appeal to have a teacher retained. If the school in question is situated in a particularly disadvantaged area, there would also be grounds to appeal against the transfer of a teacher. I will consider the case of the school to which Deputy Gregory referred in that context. Members who represent Dublin constituencies appreciate the difficulties experienced in an area of the kind to which he referred. A number of appeals have already been made and are being dealt with. If the Deputy forwards the relevant details to me, I will pursue this matter on his behalf.</P>
    <P>I accept that there is a need to provide greater assistance and support. Deputy Bruton is aware that the Government, in view of the level of resources at its disposal, has increased the number of child care assistants from 275 to 1,095. In addition, the number of resource teachers has risen from 190 to 500. The number of people employed by the psychological service is currently being increased.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to speech therapy services. A number of special difficulties obtain in this area and I agree with Members that there is a need to take action. However, the provision of speech therapy services is the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children and the health boards. I recognise the needs that exist in this area and I will do everything possible to ensure that speech therapy services are provided.</P>
    <P>I commend amendment No. 64<i>a</i> to the House. In my opinion it covers the situation to which amendment No. 68 in Deputy Bruton's name refers.</P>

In the first part of the study, when the group looked at the economic and budgetary aspects of the introduction of a basic income, it looked at the costs and distribution impacts.

As Deputy Bruton will recall from previous questions I have answered on this, the reports on this were to be part of a paper published on the matter. However, we will have to see the fallout. The studies have been done now and the concepts have been examined. We have been in touch several times with CORI, the people who did good work on this.

      <P>Am I correct in my understanding that the working group did not have a remit to make recommendations but just to analyse the workings of the optimum guaranteed basic income system? Perhaps the Taoiseach could clarify that, because that was my understanding. Second, does he agree that the guaranteed basic income concept may result in less growth but more equity in society and given his stated commitment to equity and social inclusion, would that be the aspect he would support as well, since less growth seems to help in reducing inflation too?</P>
      <P>The commitment given in the programme for government was that there would be a Green Paper on guaranteed basic income. That is my understanding. Is the Taoiseach able to say that when this report is finalised, there will then be a Green Paper from the Government based on what information is received by Government, and when could that Green Paper be expected?</P>

      <P>The terms of reference were that a study would be required and the question of a basic income would be examined having regard to our open borders, free movement of people and capital within the EU, but the group went into various aspects of that in great detail afterwards. It examined the social solidarity fund and issues of migration and labour markets and so on. Whether their conclusions are termed recommendations or conclusions, it will be the same thing. It has returned to CORI and other organisations and to the social partners on these things. It has been trying to reach a position in which it will be clear what is good and what is not workable.</P>
      <P>On the second question, as I indicated previously, the report of the working group incorporating the two phases of the consultancy will be forwarded to the Government and then will be used in the preparation of the Green Paper. That is still the intention.</P>

      <P>I am not in that position because the working group report is still being finalised, but from what I have seen &ndash; there are measures on social welfare, arrangements for pay and suggestions targeting low incomes &ndash; there are some very good measures in it, some of which will be workable and others which will not. The introduction of the statutory minimum wage is very useful and will solve many of the issues the group has raised on foot of the first report. The tax provision which targets low and taxable incomes is among some very good initiatives. There are helpful measures, but I do not want to say whether the whole report could be taken and implemented until I see it.</P>

      <P>Even prior to that, when Professor Charles Clark was examining this in the first place a long time ago and before the ESRI and St. John's University started with the group, it was indicated that it was a long-term matter. In three years, it has done a very good job to complete its studies and its work. It raises many issue and many questions. It is not a simple thing to examine the whole welfare and pensions systems and try to redesign the entire system.</P>
      <P>The reason the group has spent so much time going back and forward is that this has not been done anywhere else. It was suggested to me two years ago, not in the House, that we should look at the New Zealand model and that would give all the answers. It did not. It did not cover 10% of the issues. That is a nonsense. They did certain things but they did not go into all these details.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>Preparations for ratification by Ireland of the Statute of the International Criminal Court are in the hands of the Department of Foreign Affairs. A constitutional amendment is required to enable ratification of this Statute to proceed. The Bill is being drafted and will be circulated after the summer.</P>
      <P>I am considering the options for holding referenda at the same time to address more of the recommendations of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution on constitutional reform generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that it is very unsatisfactory that the only mechanism for testing the constitutionality of a Government decision is for an individual such as Denis Riordan to put his own home and resources at risk to take the Government to court? Would the Taoiseach agree that we need some form of constitutional council such as the one in France or a constitutional ombudsman which would be able to receive complaints and look at the constitutionality of practices or actions of Government in such a fashion as to provide an alternative <Col N="1138" /> mechanism to citizens having to go all the way to the Supreme Court to raise issues of public concern?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would never rule out any ideas that help the public. However, the President performs that function in regard to legislation because he or she can ask for a Bill's constitutionality to be tested when we finish our work here. Perhaps if there are other alternatives elsewhere, the All-Party Committee on the Constitution should examine them. I would not object to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree there was no possibility of the President referring the Government's appointment of Hugh O'Flaherty to the European Investment Bank to any court because that was an administrative and political decision and not a legislative decision? Does he further agree that an ongoing oversight of the constitutionality of governance in this State is needed so that the Constitution is a living document which inspires the actions of Government and is not used by lawyers to beat other lawyers in contests on behalf of clients? I ask the Taoiseach to consider my suggestion carefully.</P>
      <P>How many countries have ratified the Statute of the International Criminal Court to date? What degree of urgency does the Government attach to it? Does the Government agree this is an urgent matter given that the only war criminals who are tried are those on the losing side and the international criminal court needs to be established so that there is a universal standard in regard to war crimes and individuals, no matter which side they are on in a war, are capable of being brought to trial if they have committed war crimes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We clearly need an international criminal court and the timeframe set down is that all countries should ratify it before the 31 December. The legislation is being drafted and, hopefully, it will be ready following the summer recess. The memorandum has already been agreed by Government. It is a quite complex but important area. Constitutional change is required but I cannot give a precise date. Other than war crimes, the court will cover an enormous number of issues which have been spelt out by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his predecessor and that underlines why its ratification is required as early as possible. I would like to adhere to the date which has been set. I do not think too many other countries have ratified it but they have all been asked to do so over the next six months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of recent developments, including an interview which former Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty is giving to Eamon Dunphy and Ursula Halligan as I speak, has the Government considered implementing the recommendation of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution to hold a referendum which would provide the <Col N="1139" /> means to discipline senior members of the Judiciary for misconduct in the exercise of their duties? The Taoiseach will be aware that this report was published on 14 November 1999. Does the Government in light of the controversy that has surrounded this sad affair intend to bring forward proposals for a referendum to enable the Oireachtas or some other body to undertake the task recommended in the report?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated previously, the recommendations in the committee's report are being examined by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It has completed its preliminary examinations and is awaiting the report on the judicial ethics committee, which is to be concluded by the summer. It did not want to proceed until it received that report. It is a priority which needs to be addressed, as I have stated in replies to Deputy Jim O'Keeffe on a number of occasions. The matter is being addressed by the Department. It requires proper evaluation but it is necessary and as soon as the judicial ethics committee is established we will be able to proceed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from Deputy Quinn's good question, does the Taoiseach agree that there is a need, if judges are to take a solemn oath of office which binds them to act in accordance with certain principles contained in it, for some mechanism other than a private citizen suing to check whether judges at all times act fully in accordance with the provision of their oath? Does he further agree there is a lacuna in our arrangements in the sense that there is no means of judging their compliance&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that a constitutional amendment would be required to deal with this because clearly under separation of powers the Oireachtas has difficulty dealing with it? Does he further agree that we need to examine some form of constitutional arrangement to oversee and test the compliance of judges with the terms of their oaths of office?</P>

      <P>These matters were examined and outlined by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution in its fine report on the judicial council to review judicial conduct and it has made recommendations in its fourth report. When the issue of impeachment was raised, a Cheann Comhairle, you stated there were gaps and I and others agreed with you that we should immediately examine it and give it priority. That is what we are doing. We are examining whether it requires the judicial ethics committee's work, which will be a help in this area, which emanates from Ms Justice Denham's earlier report on what was required. It is a priority area which will be addressed as soon as we receive the preliminary report of the All-Party Committee's which is complete. As soon as we get the judicial report we will move on it in the autumn.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>In accordance with arrangements generally for former Taoisigh, my Department meets the costs of a car mobile phone installed in the State car provided for former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey. The cost of calls on this phone is also met from my Department's Vote.</P>
      <P>The estimated average annual cost for the use of this facility in respect of Mr. Haughey over the period 1997 to 1999 is £978.75. The estimated average annual cost for the same period in respect of the former Taoisigh, who have held office since the facility was first introduced in 1987, is £7,039.36. In addition, there was a once-off cost of £417.45 in 1999 to upgrade the phone and car installation for Mr. Haughey.</P>
      <P>No other facilities are provided by my Department to Mr. Haughey. There are no proposals for review of the arrangements for the provision of State cars for former Taoisigh with which the car mobile phone facility is linked.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to the role of the Government press secretariat and the Government Information Services as outlined in the strategy statement of the Department of the Taoiseach &ndash; to disseminate Government policy and information to the media and the public; to promote a comprehensive information service to the national and international media and to the public on behalf of the Government, the Taoiseach and his Department and to promote a co-ordinated approach to all media matters across Government Departments.</P>
      <P>Over the past number of years, staffing levels in the Government press service have diminished, despite the fact that there has been a dramatic increase in its workload due to the huge expansion of domestic and international media in Ireland and the ever increasing use of the Internet. In order to allow the Government press service fulfil its role as outlined in the Department's strategy statement, it is necessary to restore the staffing complement to the levels of previous Administrations and to reorganise the office to ensure a more efficient and effective operation. This will involve an increase of two in the personnel working in the area following the completion of the reorganisation which is envisaged towards the end of July.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that successive Governments, including his own, have clearly had a division in terms of function between the Government Information Services, which gives out factual information in respect of requests or any other way in which that information must be given to the public, and the press office of the Government of the day that gave a political interpretation or briefing on behalf of the political actions of the Government of the day?

    </P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 to 17, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Following on from a meeting between Government officials and representatives of ICTU on 13 June, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and I will be meeting with ICTU this afternoon to discuss further steps to reduce inflationary pressures. With regard to IBEC, I addressed its biennial conference on Thursday last, in the course of which I set out Government policy on inflation and other issues affecting competitiveness. I will be meeting with representatives of IBEC, hopefully, on Friday to discuss the inflation issue.</P>
      <P>The Government fully shares the concern of ICTU, IBEC and the other social partners at the implications of continuing high inflation for achieving the objectives set out in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Working closely with the social partners, we are determined to overcome this challenge. Last Thursday, the Government announced a package of measures on housing. These measures will help to ease pressures in housing which is contributing significantly to the current inflation figures. They will also stimulate further increases in supply while at the same time giving full recognition to the needs of the first time buyer.</P>
      <P>There are, of course, many other factors which are contributing to inflation. Some of these, such as oil prices and the relative weakness of the euro, are outside our direct control. Other factors, however, can be tackled domestically. For example, there are indications of excessive profit taking with regard to prices in certain services, including the food and drink sectors. The Government, therefore, has made clear that we will vigorously implement competition policy and, to that end, new resources have been committed to the Competition Authority.</P>
      <P>The Government is also considering options for further measures to reduce the rate of inflation and, in this regard, careful consideration is being given to the proposals put forward by the Congress of Trade Unions and to the views expressed by other social partners.</P>
      <P>The next plenary meeting on monitoring implementation of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness will take place on 27 July. The main purpose of the meeting, which I will attend together with the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance, will be to review progress across the operational frameworks in the PPF.</P>
      <P>I understand that the National Economic and Social Council finalised its work programme at its meeting on 16 June. As I outlined in the Dáil last week, the work programme involves two broad research categories. The first will address the provision of &ldquo;Information for Policy&rdquo; and the second will examine medium-term strategic policy options in key policy areas. I have no plans to commission any further specific reports from the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have three questions to ask the Taoiseach. In light of what has transpired, does <Col N="1147" /> he now think that the last budget was inflationary? Does he now accept that the criticism that emanated at that time, both at home and abroad, was validly based, and that his response to it and that of his Minister for Finance was over the top and prejudiced? Can he confirm that the Government intends to introduce a price control order that would have the effect of reducing the price of a pint of beer by 40p?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the Deputy's last question concerning price control, we are examining some of those issues and will be discussing them today. We are examining the legal implications and the best way of proceeding. All those matters have been under discussion in recent days. The one area in the last budget where there was an increase was in relation to the health package, including the cancer package. That added approximately 0.88% to the latest calculation of the inflation rate. Most of the other issues had no bearing.</P>
      <P>The breakdown done by analysts, including independent analysts, shows that the price of crude oil increased from $11 to $30. This produced an enormous increase in inflation. The increase with regard to housing was approximately 2% while the increase in the drinks area was approximately 1.3%. The increase in the food area was approximately 1.1% or 1.2%. Most of those areas come within the grocery order ambit so they cannot be related. The overall position is due to the weakness of the euro and the fact that there is a higher level of exports to countries outside the 11 states &ndash; soon to be 12 states &ndash; involved in the euro. This also has a bearing on inflation.</P>
      <P>These matters must be challenged and addressed. All the indications are that if some of those matters are no longer issues at the end of the year, the rate of inflation will fall, although not sufficiently. This is why there is a need for more competition and increased controls. More support must be given to the competitiveness council, as the Government has done, and some of the measures it is considering in terms of how inflation can be driven down. This is what the Government is determined to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding Question No. 12, does the Taoiseach agree, since the NESC was appointed by the Government and published its recent document on 16 June, that it is probably a good time to ask it to take note of current inflationary risks to the economy? Does he agree it would be a good idea for the Government to make such a request? Will he reconsider his response on that issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Question No. 17, in which I ask about recent meetings and current developments with regard to the social partners, does the Taoiseach accept that areas outside the immediate remit of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness are also seriously affected by the current <Col N="1148" /> inflation figures in terms of business plans? It also has an impact with regard to farm goods, services and machinery and the size of the gap in society between rich and poor. This is part of the impact of inflation. Has this aspect been discussed in the talks with the social partners in addition to their particular needs?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said the NESC already has a full work programme. The NESC comprises representatives of the social partners. There are other mechanisms through which the inflation figures can be considered so we are not losing out on that front. Many accounts of independent economists, reports and indications are available to facilitate the examination of the inflation figures. There is no mystery about it. We know the position and we know what must happen.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy regarding the agriculture area. Inflation affects every area. Inflation in any economy is never good. It is always correct to try to bring price stability down to its lowest level. The economy is growing at a rate of 10%, but it is not entirely surprising that there are difficulties in some areas. The challenge facing the Government is to try to control those as much as possible and to ensure competition. This is identified throughout the world as the best way of dealing with this area. However, it is not always simple to do it in some areas of the economy. More can be done in certain areas and that has been highlighted independently. Change is usually resisted but it can be done in some areas.</P>
      <P>However, it is clear in some areas that people are increasing prices because there are no complaints from the public. In the main, the vast majority of the public has more disposable income. When they are not complaining too much, there is less identification of the issues involved. There could be efforts with regard to an active campaign of highlighting price increases through the Competition Authority, which was done successfully in the past. However, some areas of the economy have not listened and continue to increase prices although no extra taxation has been imposed. There must be specific action in some of those areas and that is what we intend to do.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach explain why there is a higher rate of inflation of over 5% in Ireland given that we have the same crude oil import costs as other countries in the euro zone? They suffer the same inflationary effect of a currency falling relative to the dollar as Ireland. Why does Ireland have a much higher rate of inflation?</P>
      <P>Is it the case that the Government has been stoking inflation to gain cheap political popularity and that this was celebrated recently by the Minister for Finance, Deputy &ldquo;Champagne Charlie&rdquo; McCreevy? Two months ago he celebrated the precise factors that are contributing to the high rate of inflation. The Taoiseach is now trying to blame everybody else, as is usual in other areas, for things that are created by him and his Minister for Finance, as Deputy Quinn pointed out on Eamon Dunphy's show yesterday.</P>

      <P>There are some price increases in items outside the grocery order, such as meat and potatoes, which have been high. The weakness of the euro relative to sterling and the dollar and the significant rise in oil prices had a direct bearing on inflation figures. The price of tobacco, which I mentioned, was a once-off factor. It has also been clearly identified in other areas, such as professional services. Prices have decreased in areas where there is competition, such as clothing and footwear. An aggressive policy targeted at certain areas can make an enormous difference.</P>
      <P>I listened to my colleagues at the European Council in recent days who are looking at similar issues. They would gladly transfer inflationary pressures for a 9% growth rate, a 6% labour market rate, buoyancy in the economy, good employment, immigration, investments, such as the £2 billion investment in Intel which was announced recently, good cattle prices and the other things which make a good economy. There is one downside to inflation but we will handle that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the Israeli Government had declared its intention to withdraw its forces from Lebanon not later than July 2000. United Nations Security Council Resolution 425 of 1978 required Israel to end its presence in South Lebanon. UNIFIL was established in 1978 to confirm the withdrawal of Israeli forces, to restore international peace and security and to assist the Government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area.</P>
      <P>The Israeli withdrawal commenced with a certain degree of suddenness on the weekend of 20 and 21 May 2000. In the preceding days the Israeli defence force withdrew from some positions in south Lebanon and handed them over to the surrogate South Lebanese Army De Facto Forces, SLA/DFF. An influx of former inhabitants to the area ignited the total collapse of the SLA/DFF and resulted in the Israeli withdrawal from practically all its positions. Fortunately, these developments were marked by a relatively low level of violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1152" /> Members of the Defence Forces have been deployed for service with UNIFIL since 1978. On 4 April 2000 the Government approved the provision of a replacement contingent to UNIFIL, comprising approximately 620 personnel of all ranks for a six month period beginning on 19 April 2000. The Government decision also allowed for preparations to be made for the selection, training and equipping of a further contingent of approximately 620 personnel of all ranks to provide for the possibility of Ireland's continued participation in the UNIFIL peacekeeping force beyond July 2000 in the event of the further extension of the UNIFIL mandate beyond that date. The UNIFIL mandate is reviewed by the UN Security Council every six months. In January 2000 the Security Council extended the mandate for a period of six months to 31 July 2000.</P>
    <P>The UN has been engaged for some time past in ongoing contingency planning for the post withdrawal situation. The UN Secretary General reported to the UN Security Council on 22 May 2000 after a visit by his special envoy, Mr. Roed-Larsen, to the region. The special envoy was despatched again to the region on 24 May 2000 to ensure that the requirements put forward by the Secretary General to enable UNIFIL to discharge its mandate were met and that all parties concerned were committed to co-operating fully with the UN in the complete implementation of Security Council Resolution 425 of 1978. In terms of UNIFIL troop strength, the Secretary General had indicated that developments attendant on the withdrawal may require an increase in strength of the force.</P>
    <P>In this regard formal requests were received by Ireland from United Nations headquarters for an increase in the number of AML 90s, armoured vehicles, as well as an increase in the number of personnel deployed to the mission. Four Panhard AML 90s were despatched to the IRISHBATT area of operations early this month in response to the UN request. In addition, UNIFIL has supplied IRISHBATT with an additional five armoured personnel carriers to meet the additional patrol tasks which have arisen as a result of the Israeli withdrawal. IRISHBATT is now required to patrol an area almost double the size of that previously patrolled.</P>
    <P>The military authorities estimated that the increased patrolling utilising the extra equipment would result in the need for an additional 50 personnel and the Government on 30 May 2000 authorised the deployment of an additional 50 Defence Forces personnel with the 87th Infantry Battalion in UNIFIL until the end of its present tour of duty in October 2000. IRISHBATT may be required to deploy to four or five new positions in the former Israeli controlled area and this would require a Defence Forces engineer party, comprising of 60 personnel, to be sent to the area to construct these new positions. The Government also agreed to assign an engineer party to undertake essential construction work in the IRISHBATT area of operations should the exig<Col N="1153" /> encies of the operational situation so require. Should this requirement arise, it would be proposed to undertake the necessary works during the months of July and August.</P>
    <P>On foot of the Government decision, 50 Defence Forces personnel departed yesterday for Lebanon. The military authorities have advised that the present security situation is calm. On 16 June 2000 the UN Secretary General advised the Security Council that the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanese territory was complete, thus complying with the terms of Security Council Resolution 425 of 1978.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The White Paper on Defence assumed a withdrawal from Lebanon. Does the Minister believe that will be the case in the short or long-term? If that is not the case because circumstances change, how does he envisage us meeting our commitments to the EU rapid reaction force? Given that he will have to make commitments on this at the conference in October, how does he see the situation developing? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, we have record numbers engaged in peacekeeping activities and humanitarian tasks in a variety of missions throughout the world. I said from the first day I went to south Lebanon that I wanted to reach the day when Security Council Resolution 425 was met, the Israeli forces were back at the border and we could have a peace settlement to the long-standing difficulty there. We have reached that stage and the Security Council is satisfied with it. Assuming the security situation remains calm, we should be able within a couple of years to end our commitment to south Lebanon. That enormous commitment by a small country is 22 years old. We are glad we can see the day coming when we will be able to release the number of personnel engaged in those activities to alternative missions in other parts of the world or in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Minister said &ldquo;a couple of years&rdquo;. As regards the expectations of our EU partners that we will be involved in the rapid reaction force, how will we be able to make and sustain the level of contribution expected of us, given the reduction in the size of the Defence Forces, if our troops are still engaged in Lebanon? Has the Minister had discussions with the UN about the withdrawal of troops? Safety and security are major issues for members of the Defence Forces serving in Lebanon and particularly for their families. Is the Minister satisfied about the safety and security of Irish troops serving in Lebanon? I know the Minister for Foreign Affairs has had several meetings. With whom has the Minister for Defence had contact and what reassurances has he received on that issue? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like a response on another issue. The Minister has just referred to seven more years in Lebanon, and I appreciate the timetable is probably a little unpredictable and will depend on the <Col N="1154" /> way the peace process evolves there, but is he not facing a serious issue in terms of our commitments at EU level if we have to maintain that major commitment in south Lebanon?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>All the decisions relating to the EU commitments that may arise in the context of a rapid deployment force have yet to be made but we would need to be in a position to indicate Ireland's ability to meet whatever is required of us by 2003. I am giving the Deputy a fairly long timescale for Lebanon because I want to be sure I have covered the ambit as well as possible. The timespan may be much shorter. We would be infinitely happier if that were the position because that would mean there would be peace in the region and people would have an opportunity to live normal lives.</P>
      <P>As far as the security of the personnel is concerned, obviously this is a priority for me as Minister for Defence. It is a priority for the Government. Rigorous training is carried out before the contingent travels; there is the question of using armoured personnel carriers in the area previously occupied by the Israelis; there are the reinforced concrete provisions that are made so that our soldiers can withstand, in these bunkers, direct and indirect firing; and my engagement in the acquisition of armoured personnel carriers and other sophisticated equipment on an ongoing basis to make sure the security of the forces and the concerns of the families are addressed. Having said that, I am not in a position to give absolute guarantees. We have to do everything possible within our control to make sure our personnel are safe, and we are doing that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have previously stated in the House, following the accident at Tramore, County Waterford, on 2 July 1999 in which four members of the Air Corps were tragically killed, my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, and I jointly directed that the accident be investigated under Statutory Instrument No. 205 of 1997, Air Navigation (Notification and Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Regulations 1997. Pursuant to this direction the investigation is being conducted by the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise. A senior Air Corps officer with appropriate training is acting as investigator-in-<Col N="1155" /> charge. He is being assisted by inspectors from the AAIU, Air Corps personnel and two experts from overseas, namely, a principal inspector from the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch and the head of military psychology of the Swedish armed forces.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this investigation, which is wide-ranging and complex, is to determine the circumstances and cause or causes of the accident to prevent future such accidents. All issues, including those raised by relatives concerning safety, are being encompassed by the investigation.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned statutory instrument, I received, together with other relevant parties, including the families, a copy of the draft final report on 10 May 2000. The regulations prescribe that the contents of the draft report are to be treated as confidential pending completion of the final report after which it will be made public. Any safety measures proposed by the investigating team will be implemented as a matter of priority.</P>
      <P>In the course of the air accident investigation unit's investigation, many meetings took place with interested parties, including at least three with the helicopter manufacturers, Eurocopter. These meetings were followed up by a considerable amount of correspondence.</P>
      <P>In addition to the aforementioned investigation, a military court of inquiry has been convened to inquire into the circumstances of the accident. Its main thrust will be an examination of both the final report of the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise and the coroner's report. The work of the military court of inquiry, therefore, will proceed following publication of the final report of the air accident investigation unit. The court of inquiry must also await the coroner's court findings. I am informed that the coroner's court is adjourned until mid-July.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the Minister's views on an article that appeared in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on 4 June giving a detailed breakdown of the draft report which raises major questions about this unfortunate and sad accident in Tramore? As the draft report was given to the families of the deceased, what contact has the Minister's Department had with those families in terms of the traumatic experience of receiving the report if, as quoted in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> article, so many things were wrong on the night of that tragic event?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very limited in what I can say about any of these matters until such time as we have the final report, which will be published. We have a draft report which, as I indicated, has been given to the families only and has to be treated as confidential. It would be fair to say, and Deputy Wall knows, that the Air Corps gives the utmost attention to regular maintenance and <Col N="1156" /> to making sure all the aircraft undergo the strictest certification to meet the requirement of the aviation industry. In terms of my own travels with the Air Corps, and my experience of them, I have to say, with some frustration at times, that they go to unearthly rounds to make sure everything is safe. I can say no more on that at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the highly sensitive information that was obviously leaked or obtained by Andrea Burke of the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, why can the Minister not comment on the draft report in the House, yet I can get a detailed breakdown of it in the <i>Sunday </i>Independent of 4 June? What is the position of the families as a result of this draft report? Were they given assistance to get over the traumatic experience of reading the report if, as determined in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, it highlighted all those issues? How is it possible for this report to appear in detail in a newspaper, yet the Minister cannot come into the House and state there was a follow on by the PR section of his Department denying what appeared in the paper? What happened in relation to that? As I see it, what appeared in the paper was an accepted fact of the draft report, otherwise the Department would have contradicted what appeared in the paper.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>If I, as Minister, were to engage in contradicting media reports which I know are off the wall, I could be at it every day. We are dealing with a very serious matter where I do not have the power, legally or otherwise, to debate a draft report, on which the families and others have an opportunity to make comments before we have a final report in our hands. These are extremely serious and sensitive matters. Many issues have to be considered and I am legally advised of the limits to which I can go at present. I can only assure the Deputy that when I have the final report, any action that is appropriate for me to take in any area will be taken.</P>

      <P>The &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on 16 May 2000 relating to the tragic deaths of Private Thomas Barrett and Private Patrick Smallhorne while serving with UNIFIL in April 1980, and the wounding of Private John O'Mahoney, evoked many sad memories for the families of the victims, the Defence Forces and the public in general. I would like to avail of this opportunity to express my sympathy to both families for their sad and tragic losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1157" /> The killing of the two members of the Defence Forces in question while serving as United Nations peacekeepers was a particularly abhorrent act. I met members of the families of both the late Private Barrett and the late Private Smallhorne on 18 May 2000. I am examining the appropriate options, if any, that are open to me following that meeting. The deaths of Private Barrett and Private Smallhorne and the wounding of Private O'Mahony was the subject of a UNIFIL Board of Inquiry and a Defence Forces Court of Inquiry at that time.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice (Safety of United Nations Workers) Bill, 1999 [<i>Seanad</i>] is to enable Ireland to accede to the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel, which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in December 1994. The adoption of the convention reflected the widespread concern felt at the growing number of deaths and injuries following deliberate attacks on United Nations and associated personnel. Ireland was a co-sponsor of the resolution establishing the convention, which entered into force on 15 January 1999, that is, 30 days after 22 States became party to it.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the convention is to secure the better protection of personnel engaged in United Nations efforts in the field of preventative diplomacy, peace keeping, peace making, peace building and humanitarian and other operations. The necessary steps will now be taken to enable Ireland's instruments of accession to be lodged with the United Nations.</P>
    <P>This convention was inspired by the need to improve the level of protection of people, such as the late Privates Barrett and Smallhorne, serving on UN missions and to ensure the punishment of individuals who do not respect the mandate of UN peace keepers The convention, however, does not apply retrospectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the sentiments expressed by the Minister on the loss experienced by the families concerned. This case has been revisited following the recent publicity and I do not want to add to the grief suffered by the families concerned.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister sought legal advice on following up this case? If so, does it suggest that action can be taken against the personnel concerned? Has the Minister had discussions with representatives of the American Embassy on any further moves the Irish Government can take against the named personnel in this case? Are there any legal options open to the Government to take action?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in the reply, we cannot take action on foot of the convention, as Second Stage of the relevant Bill was passed only yesterday, although it was completed in the Seanad in December. The convention cannot be operated retrospectively for the purpose of extraditing people from other countries to stand trial for actions they committed against our personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1158" /> I have had discussions with the Attorney General to ascertain the extent to which we can make moves to help us to deal with the people who, from my knowledge of the circumstances, are known to have committed that awful, horrible crime, and these are being followed at present. I have not had discussions with the American Embassy to date, but now that the Deputy has made that suggestion, I will undertake to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an extraordinary situation. We live in an era where legal action is taken across borders and internationally to deal with a range of issues, including world-wide terrorism and drug smuggling. The Minister said the names of the individuals concerned are available. In the event that the terms of the convention cannot be applied, one would expect that ordinary legal processes between countries could be used to see that justice is seen to be done in this instance, especially given the details and interviews reported in that &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;  programme. I would like the Minister to comment on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>

I do not want to say any more on that issue, other than I will not limit my work to ascertaining in what way I can help both families on that aspect alone. I will take a fairly broad look at the whole picture and I may be in a position at a later date to indicate some action that may be possible.</P>
      <P>I have every sympathy for the families concerned, as have other Members of the House. This is a very horrible tale. If it is possible to administer the law on an international basis to bring the culprits to justice, that would also have the beneficial effect that people who commit such crimes in the future would know that such crimes would be followed up.</P>

      <P>Officials of my Department met the FAI on 7 June 2000 and presented it with the report prepared by the Air Corps relating to the adverse impact of the proposed Eircom Park on Casement Aerodrome. The FAI's comments and observations on this report are just to hand and will be considered by my Department in the coming days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same meeting the FAI presented the Department with its response to the South Dublin County Council's request for additional infor<Col N="1159" /> mation. That report is currently being examined by my Department.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to make all the reports available when the deliberations on the matter have been concluded.</P>

There have been discussions around the House on various matters, but that is the only discussion I had with the Taoiseach on this matter.</P>

      <P>It is important that is on the record. Having regard to the detailed replies the Minister got from the FAI and the report of the Air Corps, will the Air Corps have to change its obstacle clearance altitude because of Eircom Park? Does the Minister accept that the report of the Air Corps states that the risk calculations carried out recommend that its obstacle clearance altitude will not be affected by such a development? Does he accept that if Eircom Park was lit and marked for aviation purposes, that would satisfy the Air Corps, that the central issues are dealt with in its reply to the Minister and it has been able to answer the various concerns raised by the Minister? Will he accept that a series of points that have been put to the Air Corps are spurious, as there is a political imperative on the part of the Minister and his officials to ensure this stadium does not go ahead?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely not. I have no wish to prevent the FAI from doing what it wishes. I have only one concern, the safety of the training operations of the Air Corps in Baldonnell. When Air Corps personnel told me this development would constitute a significant infringement on their ability to guarantee the safety of their training operations &ndash; we must bear in mind that such training involves young pilots who are not so experienced in aviation &ndash;  I assure the Deputy <Col N="1160" /> that until such time as I am assured by the people responsible for advising me on this area that such a development would not constitute an infringement on the safety of such training operations, I will not lift my hand from this matter.</P>
      <P>I dispute, in as ferocious a way as I can, the notion that there is some underhand dealing, some question of my wanting to block this stadium from going ahead. Those who are interested in promoting this project would do well to stick to the truth in their contacts with the media and representatives in this House, as I do not stand in their way, but I stand four square behind my personnel who tell me that, according to international aviation safety standards, such a development would constitute a significant infringement to the safety of training operations in Baldonnel. It is about that matter alone that I have a concern.</P>
      <P>No twisting of that matter by anybody, and particularly by those in the FAI in their presentation to the media, will have the slightest effect on my decision which will be based on safety alone. It will be clear from my record in other Departments that I have put safety first regardless of the political consequences for myself and I will do so again here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone agrees, including the FAI, that it is critical that safety issues are met. I put it to the Minister that he has delayed meeting the FAI and delayed making the reports public. Has he given a copy of the Frederick Snow report to the Department of the Taoiseach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I have not. This is all the hearsay twisted stories which are emerging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving the Minister an opportunity to put on the record the truth of the position. There have been long delays in meeting the FAI and in making the reports public. It was extremely difficult for people to get information from the Department for whatever reason. The Minister has just said the Air Corps report says there were dangers. The most significant question is whether the Air Corps will have to change its obstacle clearance altitudes because of Eircom Park. The answer given in the report according to the risk calculations that were done by the Air Corps is that the obstacle clearance altitudes will not be affected by the development. Does the Minister accept that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister's concern is for safety why is he trying to apply civil aviation rules? If he were to do this the Garda helicopter could not function in Dublin city in the evenings? If he tried to apply Article 3 of the Chicago convention, which states, &ldquo;This convention does not apply to State aircraft&rdquo;, to Baldonnel the reality is that the Garda helicopter could not fly over Dublin and that there would have to be a range of other changes in the area? For example he would have close down Gormanston aerodrome, change a <Col N="1161" /> housing estate which is to the south of Eircom Park&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is the Minister moving the goalposts in relation to the rules of air safety that apply at this time when the discussion is going on about Eircom Park? Yet he was able to agree to a request from the Tánaiste in relation to the change of height of a factory that she wants.</P>

      <P>The first meeting between my Department and the FAI took place on 13 April. Further meetings were held on 20 July, 16 March, 30 March. I also met them on 30 September. That was all in a 12 month period. For Deputy Fitzgerald to suggest they could not have had meetings or for the FAI to indicate to the Deputy that they could not have meetings, if that is the position, is far from the truthful position. The record will show it is far from the truthful position. To compare where the Garda helicopter might go in the city to a building already provided in an emergency service or in the follow-up of those who are doing wrong in the city to something that has not yet been built in the precincts of where my trainees in the Air Corps are training is a totally separate and distinct matter.</P>

      <P>Ireland underlined its commitment to UN peacekeeping in 1998 when, on behalf of the Government, I signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the UN committing up to 850 Defence Forces personnel to UN peacekeeping under the UN Standby Arrangements System &ndash; UNSAS. This initiative is designed to increase the UN's capacity to respond to emergency situations. I understand that some 88 countries to-date have indicated their willingness to participate in UNSAS, and 32 countries have signed a memorandum of understanding formalising their commitment. Most of the personnel committed by Ireland are already on ser<Col N="1162" /> vice with UN, and UN authorised peace support missions at present.</P>
      <P>As my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, indicated to the House on 15 June 2000, the UN Secretary-General has appointed a high level panel to review all aspects of UN peacekeeping and to report back before the millennium summit later this year. A new generation of complex peacekeeping operations, with political, humanitarian and military dimensions, has made it essential that the various departments and agencies of the UN involved work together in a coherent and co-ordinated manner. This and the need to improve the UN's rapid deployment capability are among the issues which the review panel will address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that of the 850 Defence Forces personnel involved a number are already serving with the UN? Therefore, the emergency response unit is not in preparation but is already in the field irrespective of which part of the world it is in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is yes. We have an example in terms of the UN's request for an additional 50 troops to go to UNIFIL because of developments there and the work that has to be undertaken in the previously occupied Israeli area. Our ability to do this work will be enhanced more given the facilities of Partnership for Peace. Where to go will be decided on a case by case basis. The chief of staff has done an excellent job in upgrading the training to more centralised training, including the international experience and also more sophisticated equipment. There are many components to all of this. It is gearing up continually for faster deployment, bearing in mind our total resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the emergency response unit and building up an experienced team which would respond to the UN, does the Minister envisage working with other groups to ensure their skills can be used, for example, the Irish Medical Organisation, the various voluntary organisations involved in search and rescue, as well as the professionals? I am thinking about the logistical support that would be needed if another team was to be sent, such as that recently sent to South America after the hurricane. Has he had discussions with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government or Aer Lingus on this matter. There are a variety of people who have skills to offer to the work of the UN as well as the Defence Forces. Does the Minister see himself in the role of co-ordinating those people to build up a unit that consists not only of the Defence Forces but the many people who have served overseas and who would have the experience the UN is seeking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree more with the Deputy on the question of having a multi-faceted approach to meeting some of these problems. <Col N="1163" /> While the Defence Forces are quite experienced in humanitarian and military tasks and in a variety of home-making and other helpful tasks, we have to expand that fora to meet the great needs out there. I had the experience a couple of months ago of meeting virtually all those involved in Honduras, which was a wide collection of individuals, medics, military and civilian personnel. I had an indication of interest from one individual who is well over the age to join the FCA as a result of his experience with the Defence Forces, based on their training, discipline and methods of doing things. I will open up the possibility of seeing to what extent I can co-ordinate work of that kind both in discussions at Government level and outside. As sure as night follows day we will be called on again for emergency work of that kind.</P>

      <P>The overall strategy for the development of the Reserve Defence Force is based on the report of a special steering group established by me in January 1998. The group produced its report in September 1999 and the recommendations contained in it have been accepted as a general basis on which the development of the Reserve Defence Force can proceed. I plan to publish the steering group report in due course. I am satisfied that an in-depth study of the Reserve has now been undertaken involving a considerable amount of work by both a military board which was set up by the Chief of Staff and the steering group.</P>
      <P>The steering group met with each of the Permanent Defence Forces representative associations, who made presentations to the group regarding their areas of concern, and it met on three occasions with the Reserve Defence Force representative association which also made presentations to the group.</P>
      <P>The recent White Paper on defence, which was approved by Government on 20 February, recognised that a feature of the existing FCA organisation is that it has a countrywide geographical spread which will in general be retained. The full organisational and establishment details of the new Reserve Force will be determined in the implementation process which will consist of the development of a Reserve Defence Force review implementation plan based on the steering group's report. The implementation of the structural and reorganisation changes will take place over a period of six years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be a requirement for the military authorities to consider and recommend detailed proposals for the restructuring of Reserve units within each brigade area and I am advised by the <Col N="1164" /> military authorities that such proposals are being drawn up at present. Pending completion of the Reserve Defence Force review implementation plan, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the future role of the 21st Infantry Battalion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 110 together.</P>
      <P>The total cost to date of security at the vacated military barracks is as follows: Ballincollig &ndash; £288,776.73; Castleblayney &ndash; £103,398.15; Fermoy &ndash; £152,927.35; Naas &ndash; £193,344.54; Kildare &ndash; £88,920.48. Other costs relating to maintenance and so forth incurred to date in respect of Devoy Barracks, Naas, total £7,226.02.</P>
      <P>The costs for security at Magee Barracks have been borne by the Eastern Health Board since that property was handed over to accommodate Kosovar refugees on 12 May 1999. Castleblayney Military Barracks was transferred to the North Eastern Health Board on a caretaker basis on 9 February 2000 and no further security costs will fall to be met by my Department in relation to that property.</P>
      <P>Significant savings have arisen since the evacuation of the five barracks placed under private security arrangements. On military security duty allowances alone, it is estimated that savings to date amount to almost £570,000. In addition, there have been significant savings on utility costs such as telephone, gas and electricity charges at each of the evacuated barracks which, for example, would have amounted to approximately £93,000 in the case of Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Is maintenance to ensure the buildings are kept up to standard being carried out by the Department or put out to tender or is it being carried out by local maintenance companies? How far advanced is the sale of each barracks? There appears to be a question with regard to <Col N="1165" /> whether the sale of Devoy Barracks in Naas is by public or private tender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We have spent a little more than £7,000 on general maintenance of the type mentioned by the Deputy since the evacuation of the barracks. We have continued to carry out essential work of that nature. The main priority is to dispose of the barracks as quickly as possible and we must ensure they are kept in good condition in the meantime.</P>
      <P>Naas is being sold by public tender. We expect to sell that barracks quite soon. The Deputy will have seen the advertisement in the newspapers recently. Castleblayney has gone on a caretaker basis and we hope to move quickly with regard to Ballincollig. It is often dangerous to offer a timescale for matters such as these but I expect that at least three barracks will be legally disposed of by the end of this year and that at least two more will be disposed of by the end of 2001. It is possible that one might not be completed until 2002. We are in negotiation with the Department of the Environment and Local Government and a certain local authority and, if that is successful, it could be completed faster. That is the projected timescale for completion of the sale of the barracks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister received any requests from the Minister with responsibility for housing or from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to review the sale of these barracks given the huge accommodation needs which have emerged in a most dramatic manner in relation to asylum seekers, refugees and people on the housing lists? Has there been a review of the decision to sell the barracks so the land can be used for voluntary housing, local authority accommodation or as ongoing emergency accommodation for the variety of people who need it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly there were requests from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I have tried to accommodate his requests as far as possible. A decision has been taken with regard to a parcel of land in Magee Barracks in Kildare and land in Tralee. In a number of other cases the land is practically at the point of sale.</P>
      <P>We have also had discussions with the local authorities. In the case of Naas, the local authority has already taken approximately seven and a half acres for its purposes. In another case we are having discussions with the Department of the Environment and Local Government and a local authority which relate primarily to social housing. There is no significant change in policy. We are trying to ensure that we meet emergency demands for social housing, commercial development, private housing and various other needs in a good action plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the pressures which emerged were unexpected. In the case of Magee Barracks, I appreciate the support of local representatives in <Col N="1166" /> how the matter was handled. However, that does not preclude me from going ahead with an action plan for the balance of the lands which are quite substantial. We could win on all fronts, as it were.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not a need to review that given the need for more land for local authority housing? Has this not been discussed with the Department and is the Minister willing to do that? Obviously, the Minister has a commitment to fund the Defence Forces from the sale of the lands but is the decision regarding the sale of what is left definitive at this stage?</P>

      <P>On 10 October 1999, the search and rescue crew in Waterford, using an Alouette helicopter, was tasked with the recovery of an injured woman who had fallen down a cliff at Ardmore Head. The casualty was located on a ledge at the base of a 150 foot high cliff. Around ten people were with the casualty. She had been transferred to a spinal board and was receiving treatment.</P>
      <P>The location of the casualty meant that a lift using the hoist on the helicopter would be required. The winchman was winched out and as the helicopter approached the overhead position a foil thermal blanket which was covering the casualty lifted into the air. The aircraft commander observed this but owing to the critical phase of the approach with the winchman on the cable, avoiding action was not possible. The aircraft commander then lost sight of the blanket. It appears that the blanket became enmeshed in the main rotor for a short period of time and subsequently tore away. The aircraft was moved away from the cliff face and the winch operator commenced winching in the winchman. Once the winchman was aboard, the aircraft was landed and inspected. No significant damage was found.</P>
      <P>The helicopter crew then went on foot to access the casualty. The winchman abseiled down the cliff face and confirmed the urgent need to transfer the casualty to hospital. It was decided to restart the helicopter and, provided that it performed satisfactorily, complete the lift of the casualty and transfer to hospital. This was carried out successfully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the incident a report was completed by Air Corps personnel as part of an internal Air <Col N="1167" /> Corps investigation. This report has been published in the air accident investigation unit's Aircraft Accidents-Incidents Reports, Series Two of 1999, with the permission of the Air Corps so as to bring the safety recommendations to the attention of organisations that work with the Air Corps in search and rescue operations and because similar hazards could also confront other search and rescue operators.</P>
    <P>The safety recommendations contained in the Air Corps report state that the Irish Marine Search and Rescue Committee should review the syllabus and frequency of training of ground personnel engaged in helicopter rescue operations, such as Irish Coast Guard rescue teams, the Garda Síochána, mountain rescue teams, etc., to ensure such personnel are aware of the hazards posed to search and rescue helicopters by unsecured lightweight items and the Irish Marine Search and Rescue Committee should review the command and control procedures at rescue sites, to ensure non-essential personnel do not impede the helicopter's operation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(Additional information)</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>These recommendations have been discussed at meetings of the Irish Marine Search and Rescue Committee and are being addressed further in consultation with all the relevant parties with a view to their refinement and finalisation. A marine notice will be drafted on the need to keep areas where helicopters will operate clear of unsecured light weight items.</P>
    <P>The Air Corps will also write to the various other agencies, not represented in the Irish Marine Search and Rescue Committee, with whom they work in search and rescue, for example, mountain rescue and ambulance personnel, to re-emphasise the need for ground based personnel to be aware that lightweight items, such as foil &ndash; thermal &ndash; blankets, must be removed from the helicopter's working area or, if necessary, be strongly secured and to offer familiarisation training to specific individuals and crews in this area.</P>

      <P>It is a pity the Minister did not have the time to complete his reply because the first part is identical to the reply I received in October when I asked a question about the same incident. The latter part of the reply seems to indicate that there were deficiencies in the way the helicopter was operated in that it is not suitable for that type of work. Is that correct?</P>

      <P>I do not agree the helicopter was not suitable for that type of work. However, issues emerged from which lessons must be learned by everyone engaged in the process. Perhaps at times there is too much emphasis on what helicopters can and cannot do. Search and rescue on a cliff face is very difficult, dangerous and a lot of experience is necessary, and accidents can happen. Thankfully no one was hurt in this incident but it is important that the experience gained is transferred to other operations. There is no indication from the information available to me that there was a problem with the helicopter.</P>

      <P>Have the recommendations for all search and rescue teams been implemented? Is the incident which caused the problem now included in the syllabus and training of search and rescue personnel?</P>

      <P>It is a feature of how we improve safety in all walks of life, including farm safety, which came to the fore in the last week. A number of issues need to be considered, which was not the case heretofore, because of a fatal accident which arose and which no one thought could happen. We must take on board these issues and put in place procedures to ensure they are not repeated.</P>

      <P>Since we are discussing search and rescue by the Air Corps, will the Minister indicate the timescale for the replacement of Air Corps helicopters?</P>

      <P>A high level civil and military procurement group is considering that issue. The funds are in place and I hope we will be in a position to place orders before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>A number of issues must be resolved. We are carrying out a very strict review of all the assignments engaged in during approximately 15 different missions. We may be in a position to scale down on some of these but we expect to be coming out of South Lebanon within a short time. We are well above the UNSAS commitment of 850. This is approximately the figure we would expect to be in a position to provide on a general basis. Another contingent of 1,700 or 1,800 is being trained at home. There are preliminary preparations for a third contingent making some preparatory move. Therefore, one is talking <Col N="1170" /> about a continual few thousand between those engaged in training to go on the next contingent and those who will follow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take all the questions together. I dealt extensively with this matter in the course of the debate in the House on 23 May 2000. At that time I made it clear that the decision to nominate Mr. O'Flaherty was made on the basis of the qualities of the person who would be able to do a good job for the European Investment Bank over the next four years and that it was his outstanding qualifications and wide legal experience which were decisive in his nomination.</P>
      <P>I emphasised that the controversy that surrounded Mr. O'Flaherty's departure from public office last year should not be allowed to obscure a record of long and distinguished service to his profession &ndash; 30 years practice at the bar and almost a decade sitting in the highest court of this State. At European level, let alone at national level, there are few people who could bring such experience and talent to bear on the position in the bank. It will bring credit to Ireland that we can provide a European institution with yet another personage of such intellect, qualifications and experience.</P>
      <P>I will now set out the position regarding Mr. O'Flaherty's nomination as it is at the moment. I have already formally submitted Mr. O'Flaherty's name to the bank. This was done on 18 May 2000. Deputies will be aware that the nomination was the subject of High Court proceedings in the interim. The EIB is aware of the position in regard to court action, through contacts with my Department at official level.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach and I have made clear on a number of occasions, it is our intention to maintain the nomination of Mr. O'Flaherty. It is now a matter for the bank to carry through the written procedures and I will speak to the president of the EIB to ask him to expedite this.</P>

        <b>:</b> Was the Minister for Finance at the Cabinet meeting on Friday 16 April 1999 when a collective decision was made by him and other members of the Cabinet to write to Mr. O'Flaherty to inform him that the Government had decided to forward the report of the Chief Justice to the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights, and to advise him that the Government would consider at its meeting the following Tuesday proposing resolutions for the consideration of the two Houses of the Oireachtas, pursuant to Article 35.4.1º of the Constitution, for his removal on the grounds that the facts admitted to the Chief Justice, or established by him in his report, amounted to misbehaviour? Was the Minister at that Cabinet meeting? Why did he write to Mr. O'Flaherty in those terms?

He sat in Cabinet and booted this man from office on the basis that we was not fit to continue serving as a Supreme Court judge but is now of the opinion that Mr. O'Flaherty has manifest qualities which deem him suitable for one of the highest banking positions in Europe.</P>

      <P>This amendment arises from a Committee Stage amendment proposed by Deputy Richard Bruton. Inclusion of this provision will ensure that as well as the educational welfare officer who has been assigned to each school, the parents association of the school is also informed of the levels of attendance in the school during the school year.

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 67:</P>
      <P>In page 19, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;22.&ndash;The Board, in pursuit of its functions, shall&ndash;</P>
      <P>(a) undertake initiatives involving networks of schools and outside agencies to develop supports to assist schools in the retention of students at risk in education,</P>
      <P>(b) participate in and promote the participation of schools in integrated service initiatives in support of families with difficulties across the full range of supports needed,</P>
      <P>(c) develop models of financial and other support for students that will encourage continued participation in education, and</P>
      <P>(d) develop and run training programmes for staff, particularly for schools which have asubstantial problem with attendance and early leaving.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1185" /> If the board is to be a success it must do much more than simply react to individual cases which come to its attention. It must undertake initiatives within schools and groups of schools to promote a different approach to children with difficulties. It must take a lead in developing integrated responses from across the range of service providers, such as the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the health boards, to respond to the needs of individual children. It must develop models, including financial models, which encourage people to stay on at school and it must be given the resources to do this. The board must also look at the training needs of some teachers in developing new methods and techniques to respond to the problems presented by early leavers and non-attenders. Very often the culture of the school is not sufficiently welcoming or supportive of these students.</P>
    <P>The Bill would be significantly improved if it made explicit reference to certain things we would like to see. This amendment requests the board to encourage networks of schools to work with the community to develop integrated service initiatives and new models and ways of encouraging retention, and become involved in the training of teachers who could be supportive of this process.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept this amendment which can only enhance the Bill. It will give the board guidance as to what the Oireachtas expects of it. I accept that the board's general functions do not preclude it from doing some of these things. However, this is the last occasion on which the Oireachtas can express a view on how we would like to see it conduct its work and this view should be reflected in the text of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton has proposed three specific actions for the board to combat non-attendance. These are networks of schools, integrated service initiatives and models of support. These are all important actions but they are not the only means by which the board might prevent non-attendance, nor do I think these ideas will be effective for all time.</P>
      <P>If the problem of non-attendance lent itself to easy solutions the OECD would not now be reporting that every country it surveyed has some degree of difficulty with non-attendance at school. Therefore, I propose a general obligation on the board to investigate any and all means to reduce non-attendance and encourage participation in school. The Deputy's suggestions will be tested by the board. If they are successful, of course they will be developed and used. If not, the duty remains on the board to search for new strategies to reduce non-attendance at school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the fourth point of the Deputy's amendment, there is already a specific duty on the board to carry out reviews of the training and guidance given to teachers in the area of school attendance and conduct. It is intended that the board would liaise with teacher educators, such as the colleges of education and the universities, <Col N="1186" /> to inform and advise them as to the training needs of teachers in this area. In addition, two working groups are currently considering the pre-service education programmes undertaken by both primary and post-primary teachers. Both of these working groups have been asked to consider the particular training needs of teachers to help them to treat children coming from disadvantaged backgrounds. These reports are expected shortly.</P>
    <P>While I agree with the Deputy with regard to the three measures he proposes, I put an onus on the board to investigate any and all means to reduce non-attendance and encourage participation in school. The amendment would create a danger of a concentration on these three measures to the neglect of others. For that reason I do not accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister admit that he is trying to leave this section as loose as possible because to prescribe specific actions for the board would be to commit to financial expenditure, which he is not prepared to do? </P>
      <P>The debate on the Bill has demonstrated the mistake made by the Government in abandoning the idea of local education boards. As time goes on we see the increasing demand at community level for a local response to educational disadvantage and general educational issues. Difficulty is being caused by individual schools having to deal with the bureaucratic centre in Marlborough Street or Tullamore.</P>
      <P>The Minister must accept that giving a legislative basis to the specific tasks proposed for the board by Deputy Bruton would ensure they are carried out. The obligation to take any and all means allows the board to take any of the measures proposed in the amendment or not. The board should be required to take particular actions.</P>
      <P>Particular local factors, such as high levels of drug dependency among parents and siblings, poor housing conditions or poor rural transport making access to schooling difficult, can contribute to severe educational disadvantage. The absence of child care can place demands on older children in a family and prevent them attending school. Many such issues require an area-based response and the co-operation of the education partners with other agencies. One cannot tackle problems in a school in isolation. A school is part of a community in which there are usually other schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Issues affecting communities impact negatively on the students in those schools. There is a very strong basis for the proposal that there would be an area based response to non-attendance. The board should be required to take that kind of approach. Also, the development of models to provide financial and other supports for students to encourage them to participate in education has been raised often at community level. Various organisations have an interest in this area, <Col N="1187" /> whether through area partnerships or local drugs task forces, where proposals are now emerging on the specific issues that inhibit full participation in school. Some of those proposals include providing some kind of educational or financial supports to individual students. Again, it should be the responsibility of the board to propose models such as this, to examine best practice and pilot areas and make proposals for areas suffering from these problems.</P>
    <P>This amendment, a little like the one we debated at length this morning, is prescriptive, which is what is needed. Very serious problems are now being shown up in our education service and we need to be very specific in the response to them. I support this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Once again, the Minister's approach is revealed in this. Essentially, an educational welfare board is a sort of jumped up research body. They are going to monitor and assess the effectiveness of strategies, carry out reviews of training and co-operate with persons. We really need someone to go out, roll up their sleeves, get into the community and examine which initiatives can be taken across networks of schools. They need to examine which models might work and to be working with the community in a hands-on way, with budgets to back them to take the initiatives necessary for this sort of action.</P>
      <P>The Minister wants a hands-off, distant research group who will not be involved with the community in this intimate way. He has cut out any local bodies in this structure. He has not made any provision for the recognition of the many partnerships and community groups who are already working in this sphere. He has been unwilling to do that.</P>
      <P>His only initiative is this huge, high level integration body he has created, with 68 members who will have the occasional meeting of high level integration. That is useless for disadvantaged communities who are grappling on the ground with real problems. To suggest that initiatives across networks of schools, new models of supporting pupils or the notion of integrating the different service providers at a local level would in some way fade with the passage of time and be no longer relevant, shows how little the Minister appreciates the nature of the response to non-attendance and early school leaving.</P>
      <P>The Minister is just rabbiting out the sort of response drawn up by the Department. He is not really thinking about how he can make this agency one that grabs this issue, which has been the huge Achilles heel of our education system, by the scruff of the neck and tries to take some action in the communities where it matters. I am disappointed by the way, on every occasion, the Minister returns to the bureaucratic answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to avoid bureaucratic developments and answers. As Deputy Shortall <Col N="1188" /> talked about another huge bureaucratic arrangement which was proposed by the previous Government to set up boards countrywide. We want to give the people concerned the broad remit which will enable them to do the job effectively and let them get on with the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Department's centralised officials do not understand the problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I advise the Deputy that the later amendment No. 70f2&gt;a gives discretion to schools to consult with whatever local community groups they may consider appropriate. That was done in response to the request put forward on Committee Stage. There is no question of what our thinking is on that matter. I agree with Deputies on the other side of the House in that regard. We will proceed along those lines. The danger in this is that, as I have said, if one puts down one, two or three measures which sound like good ideas in themselves, the focus tends to be on them to the neglect of other areas. That is the danger. By giving a broad remit, we can work very effectively in a hands-on way. I agree with Deputy Bruton on that. That is what we want. If we do not achieve that here we will not go anywhere with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be brutally honest about this because we are coming to the end of this debate. The Minister is referring to a budget of £2.5 million when this is fully up and running, with £4.2 million over three years. The Minister for Education and Science spends £3,000 million on education, very little of which reaches early school leavers. If a person goes on to complete third level education, £30,000 more is invested in their education than if they drop out at the age of 15. That is what is happening in our education system. Who is dropping out at the age of 15 and missing out on this investment of £30,000 &ndash; predominantly the children of the unemployed, the low skilled and disadvantaged groups and communities.</P>
      <P>We have institutionalised disadvantage in the education system. It discriminates against people who are less well off. The education system does not equalise opportunity, it cements advantage for those who are already well off. The lack of provision for resourced plans to help those children, to make provision financially and to take action at local level with money available to help people is the failure of this Bill. The Minister just wants to write on his CV that he did something about educational welfare and non-attendance but he is not interested in putting in resources that can make a difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us be honest. We heard this morning from the Deputies who participated. Money in schools and communities is needed, not 100 welfare officers who will be as poorly resourced as those we now have. That will not address this issue, nor will a research body contribute anything that will make a difference, no matter how well they <Col N="1189" /> review strategies. It involves saying that these children cannot be allowed to drift in the way they have for so long. We cannot have one in five people leaving our education system with poor skills, dropping out early and ending up as those most likely to become long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be willing at some point to accept some of these amendments that force his successors and those in the Department of Finance, who frame education estimates as much as he does, to acknowledge they have a legal obligation to answer some of the measures in this Bill. Instead the Minister is willing to acquiesce in legislation that is soft, fluffy and cannot be pinned down. There are no hard and fast rights in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Once again we will have failed the children whose voices are least heard and whose parents will not be knocking on the doors of principals and complaining about what they are receiving because that is all they expect from education from their own experience. This is a sad disappointment again. Here again, as on amendment No. 68, the Minister is not willing to put the teeth into this legislation that would make a difference. That is the difference between us on this. It is not about words; it is about being willing to make a difference with the resources and the legal obligations. That is where I part company and say that despite the hours of effort we put in on the fundamental points encapsulated in these two amendments, the Government has not given any ground.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 69:</P>
      <P>In page 19, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) The board of management shall make the successful integration of pupils at risk of poor attendance or early school leaving central to the objectives, strategies and actions developed in their school plan.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>While the conception of the Bill has been very good, I am disappointed that we have not been able to put in place a Bill which would provide serious legal rights for early school leavers and a properly resourced planning approach to children with difficulties. I know that the Bill will now pass all Stages but we have missed an opportunity. Having said that, I wish those on the board well in their work which will be very important. We look forward with interest to their reports.</P>

      <P>The Bill is a welcome development, although opportunities have been missed to tie down the kind of intervention that would make a difference in children's lives and by which we could measure the outcome of the approaches that will be taken. It is a pity that those opportunities have not been taken. Like much legislation, the Bill is aspirational and will only be effective in making a difference if the appropriate level of funding is provided. I urge the Minister to do so in the coming years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment. I have difficulty with it, not in terms of its approach to non-attendance but rather in its approach to school planning. The role of the school plan is to act as a means to provide for increased school effectiveness. The question of school attendance is, of course, an important part of school effectiveness, but not the only part. The school plan will also consider such issues as maintaining the school ethos, improving attainment levels, staff development and parental involvement.</P>
      <P>The effect of Deputy Bruton's amendment would be to reduce the school plan from a broad school effectiveness issue to a much narrower attendance issue. While attendance will be a large part of any school plan, it will not be the only part.</P>
      <P>Regarding Deputy Shortall's query, the number of full-time attendance officers is 36.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill sets out the Government's proposals to combat bribery and corruption. To this end, the primary aims of the Bill are to update our anti-corruption legislation, to expand it to cover areas which are currently outside its scope and to make the law more responsive to modern conditions. The Bill contains measures which will ensure that corrupt behaviour is dealt with swiftly, effectively and severely by the rule of law. I wish to make it clear, without equivocation or ambiguity, that the Government, on whose behalf I am bringing forward this tough new legislation, will not tolerate corrupt behaviour or practices from wherever they emanate. The message is clear. Under this Bill persons found guilty of corrupt practices will face unlimited fines or up to ten years in prison or both. These could be described as swingeing penalties, but I make no apologies for that.</P>
      <P>Deputies do not need me to remind them of the need to have in place effective laws to tackle corruption. It is timely that we are debating this measure at this time. Charges of corruption levied against the few have the capacity in the public mind to taint everyone engaged in public life. Allegations and rumours of corrupt practices have a corrosive effect on public life with the result that public confidence in the entire system in undermined. Members of this House have a right to be concerned at the possible erosion of confidence in politics and politicians and to demand that the law is stringent enough to deter corrupt practices in the first instance and to severely punish such conduct when it is uncovered. My responsibilities as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform place me to the fore in ensuring that our criminal law is responsive to the needs of society in fighting corruption involving public representatives or officials. My Bill will do that.</P>
      <P>I will not comment on allegations made during hearings of the tribunals whose task it is to investigate payments to politicians or corruption in the planning process. Those tribunals will report in due course on their findings and nothing we say in this House should interfere with that process. However, we must be concerned at the reports that have emerged and we must be prepared to take action to ensure that confidence in the political system and in us as politicians is not lost. The Government has already taken action in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before the House today is one such measure. Others include the recently published Local Government Bill which includes a comprehensive ethics framework for local authorities <Col N="1195" /> which will apply to elected members and employees alike. Legislation is being prepared to deal with standards in public office to include a public offices commission to investigate complaints against office holders and members of the Oireachtas as well as procedures for dealing with breaches of the legislation. The Government is also committed to examining the need for regulation of lobbyists.</P>
    <P>At present, the law relating to corruption is governed mainly by the Prevention of Corruption Acts, 1889 to 1916. There was some updating to these made by the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995. Under these Acts various activities are criminalised as corrupt practices. For example, the 1889 Act, as amended by the 1995 Act, makes it an offence for a person holding a public office, a special adviser or a director of or occupier of a position of employment in a public body to corruptly solicit or receive any reward as an inducement for acting or refraining from acting in accordance with the individual's duty. It is also an offence for a person to offer to such an individual any reward for acting or refraining from acting in accordance with his or her duty. The current penalty for conviction on indictment for this offence is a fine of £50,000 or imprisonment for up to seven years or both.</P>
    <P>The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1906, used the concept of &ldquo;agent&rdquo; to define a wide range of persons who might conveniently be described for present purposes as office holders or employees whether in the public or private sectors. It provided that any agent who corruptly accepts or obtains from any person, either for himself or herself or for any other person, any gift or consideration as an inducement for acting or refraining from acting in relation to an employer's affairs will be guilty of an offence. Corruptly giving or agreeing to give to an agent a gift or consideration for the like purpose is also an offence.</P>
    <P>The term agent was defined firstly as including any person employed by or acting for another. It was, however, then further defined and given an extended meaning by providing that persons holding an office remunerated out of the central fund or out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas as well as other public office holders were also agents. The Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, amended this extended meaning to provide that agent includes an office holder or a director of, and a person occupying a position of employment in, a public body and a special adviser.</P>
    <P>The amendment effected by the 1995 Act had the effect of removing from the definition of agent in the 1906 Act some categories of person previously covered by virtue of holding an office remunerated out of the central fund or moneys provided by the Oireachtas. Thus, while the new definition covered certain specific national office holders, such as Ministers, as well as civil and public servants, it excluded a number of others, such as members of the Dáil and Seanad, as dis<Col N="1196" /> tinct from Ministers and judges. I have no doubt that Deputies would agree that the categories of persons who should be covered by anti-corruption legislation should be as broad and comprehensive as possible.</P>
    <P>The effect of the 1995 Act, which was marketed by the rainbow Government as its flagship legislation to root out corruption in public life, considerably weakened the pre-existing legislative provisions to deal with this. It was most regrettable that that Government balked at taking the tough decisions which were required in this area. My Bill will correct this deficiency. I will return to this matter again when dealing with the detail of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The 1916 Act was aimed at a particular form of corruption, namely, the awarding of public contracts and provided for there to be a presumption of corruption where it is proved that money was given to a public official by a person seeking to obtain or to retain a Government contract. This Bill will build on these earlier Acts and will considerably strengthen our laws against bribery and corruption. The Bill will enable Ireland to ratify a number of conventions dealing with corruption which have been drawn up by the European Union, the Council of Europe and the OECD. I will outline briefly for the House what these conventions contain.</P>
    <P>The EU convention on the fight against corruption involving officials of the European Communities or officials of member states of the European Union aims to complement national measures to combat fraud and corruption of public officials. It was thought desirable in circumstances where the European Union was tightening links between its member states and in the context of protecting the EU's institutions and staff that bribery and corrupt conduct aimed at officials of other member states should be criminalised in the same way that bribery and corruption of national officials are dealt with by states.</P>
    <P>The convention deals with corruption by an official who requests or receives advantage in return for acting or refraining from acting in accordance with his or her duty, which it terms passive corruption, and corruption of an official by others who promise or give advantage in return for that official acting or refraining from acting in accordance with his or her duty, which it terms active corruption. Corruption of or by members of the European Commission, the European Parliament, the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors are also covered by the convention. It requires member states to take the necessary measures to criminalise such activities.</P>
    <P>The OECD convention deals with situations where a person commits an offence by promising to give or by giving a bribe. It seeks to ensure as far as possible that parties to the convention adopt equivalent measures to penalise bribery of foreign public officials. The primary objective of the convention is set out in article 1 which provides that it should be a criminal offence for any person to bribe a foreign public official, that is, <Col N="1197" /> to offer, promise or give any undue pecuniary or other advantage to obtain or to retain business or other improper advantage in the conduct of international business. For the purposes of the convention, a foreign public official is defined as meaning any person who holds a legislative, administrative or judicial office of a foreign country, a person who exercises a public function for a foreign country and any official or agent of a public international organisation.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Law Convention on Corruption, a Council of Europe convention, also seeks to put in place a common response to the problem of corruption. It deals with corruption of or by domestic and foreign public officials and members of domestic and foreign parliaments or other assemblies, officials of international organisations, members of international parliamentary assemblies and judges and officials of international courts. It also deals with corruption in the private sector.</P>
    <P>I have set out briefly for the benefit of Deputies the law relating to corruption and the broad provisions of the conventions which the Government intends to ratify. I hope this will provide a good background and understanding of the contents of the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out a range of persons covered by its provisions and amends the definition of agent in the 1906 Act to include a wide range of office holders and employees of public bodies, including members of the Oireachtas, judges, members of foreign governments or foreign parliaments, members of the European Parliament and Commission and persons employed on behalf of a foreign public administration. It also provides that the offence of corruption will cover not only direct corruption of or by an agent but also indirect corruption, such as where the spouse of an agent receives a benefit with the intention of influencing that agent.</P>
    <P>Other provisions cover such matters as granting jurisdiction to the Irish courts in cases where any element of the offence of corruption occurred in the State or where an Irish office holder or official is involved. There will be a new offence of corruption in office which will criminalise activity aimed at obtaining personal advantage. It also establishes the liability of officers of bodies corporate for offences of corruption. The Bill will increase the maximum penalties for those convicted of the offence of corruption to an unlimited fine or ten years imprisonment or both. I will outline the contents of the Bill in greater detail later in my address.</P>
    <P>The need to update our corruption legislation is accepted by the main Opposition parties. Each of them has brought forward their own proposals to deal with the matter. Last year the House voted against a Fine Gael Private Member's Bill on Second Stage. Recently the Labour Party published its proposals in this regard. That Bill purports to be a consolidation measure by repealing earlier anti-corruption legislation and enacting in its place a single Act. It is nothing of the sort. In <Col N="1198" /> repealing earlier provisions without replacement or explanation, I am not sure that the matter has been fully thought out. For example, the earlier legislation provides for the possibility of forfeiture of pension rights of persons in the employment of any public body found guilty of an offence of corruption. There is no mention of such provision in the Bill. Was it really intended that this important sanction should be dropped?</P>
    <P>An initial examination of the Labour Party Bill leads me to the conclusion that it has little to recommend it beyond those sections which are taken from my Bill. There are, however, significant differences and for present purposes I would like to offer some brief comments on them.</P>
    <P>In specifying the categories of persons who are &ldquo;agents&rdquo; for the purpose of the Bill it mentions, among others, the President, the Ombudsman, and members of the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána. Reference to the President raises a profound constitutional position in relation to the position of the President and the exercise of the functions of the President. Under Article 13.8 of the Constitution, the President is not answerable to any court for the exercise and performance of the powers and functions of the office or for any act done or purporting to be done in the exercise and performance of these powers and functions. The question of including the President, therefore, would need detailed examination and I have sought the opinion of the Attorney General on the matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Ombudsman and members of the Defence Forces and the Garda, these are already covered by the definition of &ldquo;agent&rdquo; contained in my Bill and there would appear to be no advantage in making specific mention of these categories. To include them begs the question: why stop there? Why not include teachers or nurses and so on? The list could be endless.</P>
    <P>Section 4 seeks to extend the presumption, which applies to Government contracts under the 1916 Act, to all proceedings for corruption. Under this section there would be a presumption that money and so on has been corruptly received where it has been proved that the office holder received money and the donor was a person who had an interest in the office holder's performance of his or her functions.</P>
    <P>A similar provision was contained in the earlier Fine Gael Private Members' Bill and was opposed, following advice from the Attorney General, because the proposal was too broad. The problem is that there may not be a clear connection, as there will be with regard to the awarding of a contract, between the giving of the money and the performance or failure to perform official functions. In addition, a wide presumption as suggested, involving a general reversal of the presumption of innocence, raises constitutional and European Convention on Human Rights implications. Indeed, on one interpretation of this type of provision it amounts to a presumption of guilt in the circumstances outlined. In fact, a recent UK law commission report on corruption recom<Col N="1199" /> mended that the existing presumption in relation to contracts, which also exists in the UK, should be dropped. The report raised concerns about its compatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Labour Party Bill provides for the issue of search warrants. I am not sure why search warrants under the Labour Party proposal should have to be issued by the High Court. Other Acts providing for the issue of search warrants give this jurisdiction to the District Court. At any rate, the Government has already approved the drafting of a criminal justice Bill which will contain a general provision for the issue of search warrants in connection with the investigation of certain serious offences, which will include those created by my Bill. However, given that those proposals are at an early stage I am prepared to consider the inclusion of a search warrant provision in the Bill and suggest that the matter can be considered on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the Labour Party Bill, the guide issued with it states that a comprehensive consolidation measure is required in this area. That guide may be right, but consolidation requires lengthy and detailed examination. In this regard, I point to the Statute Law (Restatement ) Bill, 2000, which will provide a simpler method whereby current legislation can be set out in a consolidated form for ease of reference. In relation to corruption, when the restatement Bill and my Bill have been enacted a restatement of the law on corruption can be prepared at an early stage.</P>
      <P>Section 1 of the Bill before us is a standard provision. Section 2 may be considered the central provision of the Bill. It substitutes a new section for section 1 of the 1906 Act. As I mentioned earlier, this Act introduced the concept of agent for the purpose of criminalising corruption by or of a wide range of office holders and employees, public sector as well as private sector. I also mentioned that the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, had amended the definition of agent in such a way that a number of persons previously covered were now outside its scope. Consequently, I take the opportunity to make the definition as comprehensive as possible as well as providing for suitable penalties for any breach. The best way to achieve this is to substitute an entirely new section for the old one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 provides that an agent includes any person employed by or acting for another. With regard to public bodies, &ldquo;agent&rdquo; is defined by reference to the 1889 Act and includes an office holder or director of, or person occupying a position of employment in, a public body, and a special adviser. A director in this context includes members of local authorities, health boards and <Col N="1200" /> other bodies financed out of Exchequer funds. The section then sets out further specific categories of persons also covered. These are members of the Oireachtas, the Attorney General, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Director of Public Prosecutions, judges and any other person employed in or acting on behalf of the public administration of the State. That is a fairly full list of office holders at all levels, local and national.</P>
    <P>Corruption does not, however, respect national boundaries and in the context of efforts to combat corruption by or of foreign office holders and officials, it is important that our laws should, excusing the pun, capture such activities. In any event, to enable Ireland to ratify the three conventions to which I have referred, we will have to make provision for criminalising corruption of foreign office holders and officials. Accordingly, the definition of agent in section 2 will also extend to members of the Government and national or regional parliaments of any other State, a member of the European Parliament, European Court of Auditors and European Commission, foreign public prosecutors and judges and judges of any international court established by agreement to which Ireland is a party. It includes employees of international bodies and foreign administrations.</P>
    <P>Regarding the offence of corruption, the section states that it will be an offence for an agent, or any other person, to corruptly accept or obtain, or agree to accept or attempt to obtain, whether for personal benefit or for someone else's benefit, any gift, consideration or advantage as an inducement or reward for acting or refraining from acting in accordance with his or her position. It will also be an offence for any person to corruptly give, agree to give or offer any gift or consideration to the agent or any other person as an inducement or reward for the agent acting or refraining from acting in accordance with his or her position. Deputies will appreciate that the offence covers not only the office holder or employee but any other person who might have influence over the former, such as a spouse.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated that there can be no tolerance of corrupt practices within our political system. With regard to the law against corruption, it should be equally clear that such activities will be subject to severe sanctions. That is why the Bill provides that the penalty to be imposed following conviction on indictment will be increased from the current penalty of a fine of up to £50,000 or imprisonment for up to seven years or both to an unlimited fine or up to ten years imprisonment or both.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 4 relate to aspects of jurisdiction. Normally Irish criminal law is territorial in its jurisdiction. In other words, it applies only to acts done in Ireland. There are some exceptions to this, such as certain sexual offences and murder. It would be naive to think corruption takes place only within national boundaries, requiring a purely domestic response. The increasing complexity of international business <Col N="1201" /> and the opening up of national economies increases the danger that some will seek to exploit this by trying to influence decisions in their favour through the offer of corrupt payments. This has been recognised and is the reason the EU, the OECD and the Council of Europe has each thought it desirable to formulate conventions to criminalise such practices involving foreign office holders and officials. It follows that as the offence, or elements of it, can be committed across frontiers, there should be legislative sanctions to enable the taking of prosecutions where any aspect of the offence occurs within this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Section 3 meets this requirement by providing that a person may be tried in Ireland for the offence of corruption once any element of the offence took place within the State. As a corollary, section 4 criminalises corrupt acts by Irish office holders or officials that are committed abroad, for example, by accepting a bribe while outside Ireland.</P>
    <P>I said that section 2 was the central element of the Bill. I am sure, however, Deputies will agree that section 5 represents a significant contribution to the Government's determination to combat all forms of corruption in public life. Section 5 creates a new offence of corruption in office.</P>
    <P>Current anti-corruption legislation does not deal adequately with a situation where an office holder or official may act corruptly on his or her initiative to secure some personal benefit or advantage for another person. In such circumstances, there is no question of a corrupt payment or favour being sought from, or offered by, any person. This might arise where an individual's actions are designed to benefit one's own family. The new offence created by section 5 will criminalise any act or omission by an office holder or official done with the intention of corruptly obtaining a gift, consideration or other advantage for himself or herself, or for any other person. As an indication of how seriously this type of corruption is viewed by the Government, the penalty provided will be on a par with that for other offences of corruption under the Bill, an unlimited fine or up to ten years imprisonment or both.</P>
    <P>During the Second Stage debate on the Fine Gael Prevention of Corruption Bill I indicated that a section of that Bill dealing with abuse of public office was deserving of attention and undertook to study the matter further. The outcome of that examination is contained in section 5, which meets the point raised by the Deputy Jim Higgins.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of corruption carried out by or on behalf of bodies corporate, corporate bodies as well as individuals may become involved in offences of corruption. Equally, there are instances when individuals within a body corporate can contribute to such offences, whether directly by consenting to or conniving with the commission of an offence, or simply by wilful neglect of their responsibilities. For this reason, section 6 provides that responsibility for an <Col N="1202" /> offence of corruption by a body corporate can be attributed, where appropriate, to certain of its officers and-or members. In this way, individuals as well as the body corporate can be held liable for the offence. Section 7 states the Short Title of the Bill.</P>
    <P>While this is a short Bill, it contains a range of measures that will copperfasten and considerably improve existing legislation on the prevention of corruption. It will also meet our international obligations. It is clear that the elimination of corrupt practices is an objective to which all parties in the House are committed. My Bill represents the best option for achieving that objective. Nevertheless, I will consider sympathetically any amendment the Deputies opposite table and if I am convinced such amendments will improve on the measures contained in the Bill, I will not be slow to accept them. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

        <b>: </b>I should like to quote the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I staunchly supported Mr. Haughey . . . I admired Mr. Haughey greatly and few men of this century were more committed to this country and its people than Charlie Haughey.</P>
      <P>There is a song which says &lsquo;follow the fellow who follows a dream' and Mr. Haughey had a vision of this country with which I could identify. A lot of people at grassroots Fianna Fáil could identify with it. It was a vision of a republic, of a just society, of a society which made up its own rules and did not ape and copy the rules of any other country for the sake of doing so&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister recognise the text or the context or the author of those comments? Does he recall that the author was none other than the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, giving an interview to <i>Voices of Kerry</i> when Deputy for South Kerry solely. I wonder, on reflection what the Minister now thinks of his comments. He is certainly right as regards making up our own rules and not following any other country. No other self-respecting country would have tolerated the low standards in high political office and the low standards of public officials in certain key posts that the Republic has tolerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious this Bill would not be before the House today had it not been for the fact that the Opposition has continually highlighted the Government's tardiness in bringing forward anti-corruption legislation. It is equally obvious that the legislation before the House is not the Government's creation but has been effectively handed to it on a plate in that it ratifies three international conventions, two of which were drawn up in 1997 and the other almost 18 months ago. It is patently obvious that the Bill deals only with one sphere of corruption &ndash; that involving public officials, public servants and public officeholders. While the Minister refers to the fact that <Col N="1203" /> the criminal law convention on corruption deals with corruption in the private sector this Bill does not. It is confined solely to the public sector. It does not pry into the semi-State sector or the former State companies which have been privatised and it does not deal with the banks, other financial institutions or the murky areas of business or tax evasion.</P>
    <P>Two years ago the Government told us in banner headlines that it was about to overhaul the law to tackle the escalation in fraud. This was to be the Government's sledge hammer to tackle fraud and corruption. We were told by the Minister two years ago that the Fraud Offences Bill would be a comprehensive overhaul of the law in this area &ldquo;on a scale not previously witnessed in the State&rdquo;. What has happened to the Fraud Offences Bill in the meantime? A perusal of the Government's list of promised legislation and one will see that it is stuck firmly at the bottom of the Government's list of priorities.</P>
    <P>In April 1999, Deputy Charles Flanagan published a Private Members' Bill &ndash; the same title as this Bill. The Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill, 1999, was drafted to bring about far reaching changes to the corruption laws which have remained unaltered for almost 100 years. The Bill was comprehensive and detailed. It dealt with the public and private sectors. It dealt with bribery and defined bribery for the first time. It dealt with the new offence of offering or receiving a secret commission where an agent takes a payment from another as an inducement or reward for doing any act in relation to the business of a principal. For example, a banker who corruptly receives money from a customer as an inducement for giving the customer preferential treatment when approving a certain financial accommodation or a loan or settling an account would be guilty of receiving such an illegal commission. Likewise the customer would be guilty of an offence. This part of the Bill would also cover many in the financial services sector advertising and offering to arrange loans for people at high and totally unfair rates of commission. The Bill dealt with the area of &ldquo;payola&rdquo; for the first time. A public official who gains an unfair benefit from information at his or her disposal would be guilty of an offence if the information is used in a dishonest manner. The Bill also had a specific section dealing with the circumstances under which a defence may be offered. Effectively, the burden of proof was to be placed on the shoulders of the person charged with the corruption. The Minister rejected the Bill on the basis that he would introduce his own Bill in due course. He assured the House that his Bill would be far reaching and would cover categories of persons not covered at present. The clear impression given was that when the Minister's Bill was enacted it would go at least as far if not beyond the provisions of Deputy Flanagan's Bill. Unfortunately, the Minister's Bill is &ldquo;hand-me-down&rdquo;<Col N="1204" /> legislation from Europe and falls far short of the provisions contained in Deputy Flanagan's Bill.</P>
    <P>When the history of the 20th century is being written, the period 1987-1992 will be seen as the area of capitalist sharp practice. Many of those involved would like to dismiss or downplay it as &ldquo;it was the culture of our time&rdquo;. We recall that the chief executive of AIB at the DIRT Inquiry tried to talk down the scale of tax evasion by his bank by trying to explain it away, that it was an &ldquo;industry wide&rdquo; practice and so it was &ndash; even the State owned banks were not paying deposit interest retention tax. The culture of the time developed a convenient excuse or cover by giving it an air of respectability &ndash;&ldquo;everyone is at it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>While the foundations for the current economic success were laid in the development of social partnership in the 1987-92 period, it was also the era when the avarice of the entrepreneurial classes colluded with a small clique of those in high political office to wrongly and ruthlessly manipulate the leaders of power to line their own pockets. An alliance of politicians and business leaders used their insider knowledge and privileged positions to piggy-back on the rising economic tide and did so most often at the expense of the State. It was the era of a small but elite golden circle.</P>
    <P>A State-owned company, Telecom Éireann, chaired by a wealthy businessman, Dr. Michael Smurfit bought a site for a new company headquarters at an inflated price without supposedly knowing he, as chairman, had owned a share of the land. A State-owned company, Greencore, bought another smaller company without knowing that its chief executive, Mr. Chris Comerford, was secretly a shareholder in that company. The issue only came to light when he sued his partners for a share of the profits.</P>
    <P>Confidential commercial documents concerning a State-owned company, Irish Helicopters, were sent to a rival company Celtic Helicopters &ndash; coincidentally owned by a son of a former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey. The State offered tens of millions of pounds in loans, grants and export credit insurance to Fianna Fáil's favourite son, Larry Goodman's, Goodman International which spent the money on disastrous overseas investments totally unrelated to the Irish food industry and which lost millions of pounds. The same Mr. Goodman's company was responsible for a massive fraud on the European taxpayer which led to the beef tribunal. Not alone did nothing come of the beef tribunal but the Irish taxpayer ended up being saddled by the Government with a fine of £70 million imposed by the EU. Surely, such a fine should have been passed on to the Goodmans and the other beef barons who abused their positions.</P>
    <P>The reality is that nobody goes to jail in Ireland for white collar crime. Nobody was jailed for the Telecom Éireann-Ballsbridge scandal, the Greencore scandal or for the missing millions at Aer Lingus Holidays. Nobody in the entire Goodman empire was jailed for the fraud the company per<Col N="1205" /> petrated except for two low key operatives at the Rathkeale plant.</P>

        <b>:</b> Take, for example, the Carysfort College saga. It was bought by Mr. Haughey's friend, Mr. Pino Harris, for £6.5 million. Mr. Harris decided to offload his purchase; he did not know what to do with it. University College Dublin, which could not afford and did not want the property, was called in. Eight high powered meetings were arranged, some of them chaired by Mr. Haughey and a mere seven months after Mr. Harris bought the property, the Irish taxpayer paid £8 million to enable UCD to buy the property.</P>
      <P>Instead of penalising people who evade taxes, in 1988 the State offered an amnesty to tax dodgers on the basis that it was their last chance to regularise their affairs. Five years later, in 1993, it offered tax offenders yet another opportunity to settle for a mere 15% of what they owed. This was also the time when the State was selling Irish passports, in some cases to fraudsters like the Mafouz family, for millions of pounds.</P>
      <P>Will this so-called far reaching legislation, introduced by the Minister today, do anything to thwart or curb white collar crime? Had it been in force during the heyday of the golden circle, would it have tackled any of the financial scandals? It would not and will not. This legislation, for example, does not deal with the corruptive practices of the banks. AIB. deliberately contrived an illegal tax avoidance scheme to enable at least 53,000 deposit holders to avoid paying tax. Up to £600 million was lodged in bogus offshore accounts. The biggest banker in the country deliberately defrauded the taxpayer of over £84 million in tax.</P>
      <P>Is it any wonder that the ordinary compliant PAYE worker is left reeling in anger when the NIB, another pillar of the financial world, is ruthlessly exposed by RTE's George Lee and Charlie Bird as having contrived yet another illegal and ingenious but fraudulent scheme? The arrogance of NIB is well illustrated in its determination to bring its case to the Supreme Court to try to halt publication of the fraud it perpetrated. It was a chilling reminder of just how arrogant, untouchable and strident is the elite of the white collar criminals. Will any of the executives of AIB or NIB end up in jail as a result of the fraudulent schemes they devised and sold to their customers? I doubt it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It continues. The latest research on the level of tax evasion in Ireland has found that the black economy now accounts for 16.6% of the national income. That puts a value of £8.7 billion on the black economy. It is costing the Exchequer an <Col N="1206" /> estimated £2 billion a year in lost taxes and bogus social welfare payments, considerably more than we received in each of the last five years from the EU Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>In spite of Government warnings and sabre rattling, tax evasion is widespread. All one need do is look at the figures which came into the public domain after the Minister, Deputy McCreevy's, attempt to deal with the housing crisis. It has emerged that only 10% of landlords are registered with local authorities as they are obliged to do. One can, therefore, assume that the remaining 90% are unregistered because they are not declaring rental income from their properties for tax purposes. The black economy has grown since the birth of the Celtic tiger.</P>
    <P>The Government recently announced the building of 700 new prison spaces. One can bet safely that not one of these prison spaces will be filled by a white collar criminal. Comparisons are rightly made between the &ldquo;softly softly&rdquo; approach to dealing with crimes committed by the establishment and the judicial treatment of those who come from less privileged social and economic backgrounds. Sabrina Walsh a drug addict and bag snatcher gets nine years reduced to six years but, on the other hand, judicial mountains are moved and the judicial system is abused and circumvented by a Supreme Court judge, a High Court judge and a County Registrar in order to arrange for the early release from prison of Philip Sheedy who was responsible for the death of a young mother. This man was released because of his connections, his breeding and his professional standing.</P>
    <P>Jail in this country is for helpless drug addicts, shoplifters, bag snatchers and sex offenders. Their misdemeanours are classified as crimes but the scams perpetrated by those with white collars and silk ties are classified not as crimes but as mere offences.</P>
    <P>Large scale tax evasion is not a victimless crime. Tax evaders are able to use their illegal income for additional investment and projects in order to further enrich themselves. This vicious circle leads to the widening of the gap between the rich and the poor or, at another level, between those who cheat and those who behave honestly. A society that tolerates tax evasion is unlikely to take seriously its obligations in coming to terms with social deprivation.</P>
    <P>The distribution of income is never likely to be equal. The gap grows continually wider and greater as the inequalities in society expand. The more obvious that gap becomes between the haves and the have nots, the more likely it is that there will be more violent crime. There is a huge and growing groundswell of frustration among the vast majority of ordinary decent people at what white collar criminals have been let away with and the ongoing failure to tackle white collar crime. Unless white collar criminals are taken seriously, treated as common criminals and jailed for their crimes, there is no guarantee where this public discontent will end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to extend the existing statute law relating to corruption. As such it is an important measure to be welcomed, which I did on its publication. This Bill is not and was never intended to be a comprehensive response on the part of the Government to the current wave of scandal washing over the Irish body politic and which my party strongly argues demands a collective and effective response from all of us.</P>
      <P>For the past two months we have argued our position that several urgent steps need to be taken by the Oireachtas in order to collectively attempt to restore a measure of confidence in the integrity and impartiality of public administration in this State. Profound damage has already been done to the political process and to people's confidence in the way the State administers itself. Any hint of prevarication or vacillation in our response now would serve only to intensify that damage and further alienate the people from those elected to serve them and from those charged with the administration of public affairs.</P>
      <P>Those of us who have had the opportunity to have direct contact with the public in the past number of weeks in the constituency of Tipperary South will be aware of the alienation, particularly among the young, from administration and politics in particular. Therefore, it is incumbent on all of us to seek to address this issue collectively for the good of the overwhelming majority involved in political life and administration who have no hand, act or part in any corrupt practices.</P>
      <P>When the Labour Party Bill on donations to parties and candidates recently came before this House it was not voted down by the Government side. In fact, a recent amendment was tabled that simply passed the measure with a delaying mechanism to ensure it would not have the effect of passing Second Stage until the end of this year. Indeed, Committee Stage was postponed until the end of this year or early next year. Meanwhile, the Government proposed to us and to the Fine Gael Party, and announced to the public at large, that the mechanism to deal with this issue was to establish an all-party committee to consider the Bill together with a range of other measures and other proposed legislation.</P>
      <P>We suspect the only thing these various matters had in common to justify them being grouped together in the way proposed by the Government was that the Government was not anxious to proceed with any of them. Correspondence between the leader of the Labour Party and the Taoiseach confirmed beyond doubt our view that, although the Government supported the Bill ostensibly to end corporate donations, it is fundamentally opposed to doing just that. It sounds bizarre that the Government would vote in favour, although including a delaying mechanism, of a measure to which we now believe it is fundamentally opposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the subsequent utterances from the Taoiseach that the proposal was, in fact, unconstitutional and that his advice from the Attorney <Col N="1208" /> General was to that effect indicates that he has no intention of proceeding with this measure. It also indicates that the effect of the proposal to have an all-party committee to address these matters was to send a group of people on a fool's errand to search for a consensus when none was possible, given that the Government has indicated it believes the very principle which it says should be considered by this committee is unconstitutional and that the advice available from the Attorney general confirms that view. Despite my requests to the Taoiseach to provide Opposition parties with such advice &ndash; there is ample precedent for the advice of the Attorney General to be made public &ndash; that invitation was not forthcoming. Consequently, my party declined to participate in such a committee which was clearly designed to put action on the long finger.</P>
    <P>In the interim the Government has decided to proceed with this measure and even that has some interesting developments along the way. When I asked originally when the measure would come before this House, I was informed by the Taoiseach that it would be the autumn. Within a matter of days I was told it would be introduced before the end of this term. I appreciate the alacrity with which that timetable was amended but I think it had more to do with public pressure that demanded action from the Government rather than a self-motivated Government timetable. It is a stand-alone measure which does not pretend to be a response to events which have threatened to subvert public administration in Ireland. As the Minister outlined in his speech, the Bill does not even have its origins in Ireland. As its Long Title makes clear, the Bill is designed to incorporate into Irish law several conventions drawn up at European level, which had as their central purpose the safeguarding of the finances of the European institutions and which the State is now obliged to implement. The Bill therefore extends existing law to cover members and officials of the European institutions. The opportunity has also been taken to include for the first time Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, in their capacity as such, and judges within the framework of the existing law.</P>
    <P>Compared, however, with the Labour Party Bill published last month, there are at least three aspects of the Minister's proposals which I believe could be improved. This is an amending Bill which leaves on the Statute Book four other enactments, dating back to 1889, which have only a dozen or so relevant sections between them. A comprehensive consolidation measure is required now rather than adding to the legislative clutter.</P>
    <P>The original 1889 Bill applied only to public bodies outside central government. A 1906 Act introduced a comprehensive measure to deal with corrupt transactions with an &ldquo;agent&rdquo; in relation to the affairs or business of his principal. Those holding office under the Crown were deemed to be agents of the Crown. Members of Parliament, however, as opposed to Ministers, were not considered to hold office under the Crown and so <Col N="1209" /> were not covered in that capacity. In 1916, a presumption of corrupt payment was introduced to cover situations where it was proven that a payment was made by a person holding or seeking a Government contract.</P>
    <P>In 1995, the Rainbow Government took the opportunity in the Ethics in Public Office Act to update the language of the Prevention of Corruption Acts and to introduce a comprehensive definition of &ldquo;public body&rdquo; to which the Acts would apply. I was interested to hear the Ministers comments about the Ethics in Public Office Act. He talked about the failure of the Rainbow Government in this regard. That borders on the comical because I had the honour of negotiating with the Minister's party about the matter prior to the formation of the 1992 Government. The argument coming from Fianna Fáil then was not for comprehensive ethics legislation, it was to delay it as far as possible so the indebtedness of the party could be addressed. I will let history lie at that point but it is amusing that the Minister now feels that the measure which was resisted for so long was an inadequate measure when it finally reached the Statute Book. It was hard to secure the agreement to get it on to the Statute Book in the first place.</P>
    <P>The last thing needed now is another piecemeal amending Bill. The central and workable elements of the legislation on the Statute Book should be identified and reproduced is a single and comprehensive measure. The Minister should present such a consolidating Bill to the House at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>There is nothing inherently ineffective or inadequate in the central provisions of the present anti-corruption code. Many of us believe that the response to every situation is to introduce new legislation. Sometimes we forget to examine existing legislation which is often not properly used. These anti-corruption measures operate effectively in other jurisdictions and prosecutions are brought to a successful conclusion. My proposals would assist in the investigative and prosecutorial process rather than attempting to rewrite the substantive law. There is a body of law which defines corrupt action; the difficulty is establishing the case and properly prosecuting the facts to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>Powers for the Garda, under judicial supervision, of search and seizure are needed if corrupt practices are to be effectively investigated and prosecuted. The Criminal Assets Bureau has exercised such powers since its establishment under the Rainbow Government. It could not have operated effectively without them. I welcome the Minister saying that he will examine giving effective search powers to the Garda on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is in the present code a provision which creates a presumption of corruption where payment is made to a public official by a person seeking a contract from a public body. The statutory presumption reverses the burden of proof so that the parties have to prove, on the balance of <Col N="1210" /> probabilities, an innocent explanation for such a payment. This presumption has to be extended beyond its present application to the awarding of contracts. It should apply in any circumstances where payment is made to a public official by a person who has a significant material interest in the outcome of a decision to be made by that official.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take this opportunity to consolidate existing law and repeal the four existing Acts, which are no longer relevant, provide for Garda power of search and seizure and create an improved and expanded presumption of corrupt payment. If our roles are still the same in the autumn, I will table amendments on Committee Stage to achieve these purposes. I will outline in greater detail my proposals in relation to the presumption of corruption and search warrants.</P>
    <P>On the presumption of corruption, I will propose that where, in any proceedings against a person for an offence, it is proved that any money, gift or other consideration has been given to or received by a public official from a person with a material interest in the performance by that public official of a function of his or her office or position, the money, gift or consideration shall be presumed to have been given and received corruptly until the contrary is proved.</P>
    <P>My amendment will provide that a person will have a material interest in the performance by a public official of a function of his or her office or position, if the consequence or effect of the performance of that function may be to confer on or withhold from the person a significant benefit, without also conferring it on or withholding it from a general category or class of persons in general. In other words, a decision by a public official which would be of general application, for example, a reduction in the basic rate of income tax, would not be something in which a person who made a gift to that official would have a material interest. However, a gift by a person who owned land in a particular area which was subsequently designated for a particular purpose, thereby conferring certain benefits on the person in question, would be of material interest and might, in those circumstances, give rise to a presumption of corrupt payment.</P>
    <P>I understand the Government may have been warned of constitutional difficulties in such an approach. I am interested in hearing the views of the Minister in this regard. He must be aware that a presumption of criminal intent is often provided for in the criminal law where a <i>prima facie</i> case has been made and where the exculpatory facts, if they exist, are within the particular or peculiar knowledge of the defendant. The onus on a defendant in such circumstances is to rebut the presumption by providing proof that, on the balance of probabilities, there is an innocent explanation.</P>
    <P>Let use consider three examples which relate to this area. First, there is the presumption of corrupt payment already provided for in the case of those holding or seeking Government contracts. <Col N="1211" /> Second, section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, deals with possession of controlled drugs for unlawful sale or supply. The section provides that, where it is proven that a person was in possession of a controlled drug and the court, having regard to the quantity of the controlled drug which the person possessed or to such other matter as the court considers relevant, is satisfied that it is reasonable to assume that the controlled drug was not intended for the immediate personal use of the person, he shall be presumed, until the court is satisfied to the contrary, to have been in possession of the controlled drug for the purpose of selling or otherwise supplying it to another. The onus, therefore, is on the holder of the drugs to prove that they were not intended for sale.</P>
    <P>The third example relating to this area is section 8 of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, which deals with possession of firearms or ammunition in suspicious circumstances. That section again imposes an evidential burden on an accused by providing that a person who has a firearm or ammunition in his possession or under his control, in such circumstances as to give rise to a reasonable inference that he has not got it in his possession or under his control for a lawful purpose, shall, until it is proven that he has it in his possession or under his control for a lawful purpose, be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>These examples are sufficient to demonstrate that constitutional difficulties should not arise from extending the operation of the presumption of corruption as I have outlined. However, I am interested in hearing the views of the Minister and, if they are available, those of the Attorney General in that regard.</P>
    <P>With regard to search warrants, the Minister correctly stated that the Bill published by the Labour Party proposes that a judge of the High Court, on hearing evidence on oath given by a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent, may, if he or she is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that evidence of or relating to an offence under the Act is to be found in any place, issue a warrant for the search of that place and any person found at that place. The Minister believes that it is too onerous to require the High Court to issue such. If he wishes to have matters of this nature dealt with in the District Court, I am sure we can accommodate him in that regard. I welcome his statement that this is a desirable objective and I am anxious to see what he intends to propose on Committee Stage. I intend to table amendments in respect of this matter at that point.</P>
    <P>A warrant would authorise a named member of the Garda Síochána, accompanied by such other persons as he or she thinks necessary, to enter, within one week of the date of issuing of the warrant, the place named in the warrant and to search it and any person found at that place. It would require any person so found to produce any books, documents or records which are in <Col N="1212" /> that person's control and to give such information as may reasonably be required in regard to any entries in such books, documents and records. It would also require them to inspect and copy or take extracts from any such books, documents and records.</P>
    <P>These requirements are necessary if we are to achieve the objective outlined by the Minister and Deputy Jim Higgins, who correctly pointed out that those accused of white collar crime are rarely prosecuted. While I agree that the definition of corruption contained in law requires strengthening, there is already on the Statute Book a reasonable body of law which defines crime. The prosecutorial system may need strengthening to aid the Garda Síochána units involved in investigating corporate, white collar or financial crime or criminal activities relating to public administration. We must also make it an offence to obstruct a member of the Garda Síochána in carrying out his or her duties under the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill needs to be strengthened, consolidated and placed in the context of a body of broader, over-arching legislation. The Government has indicated its belief that this should be the case. I understand that before the conclusion of the current session the Government will publish legislation dealing with matters such as corporate donations, the funding of political parties and public administration. I hope we can advance these matters in a speedy manner to allow the public to regain confidence in the administration of public life, public business and politics.</P>
    <P>The Bill will improve and strengthen the existing law. The amendments I propose to table will strengthen that objective and purpose, create an effective deterrent which will discourage people from engaging in corrupt practices and assist the prosecutorial authorities in the difficult and daunting task they face in dealing with corruption in the corporate and financial sectors, in the sphere of public administration and in the area of administration in general.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of the Bill. I hope we will have an early and constructive debate on it in order to ensure that it is placed on the Statute Book as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this motion tabled by the Fine Gael Party. I will focus on decentralisation which is an important issue in County Westmeath. I welcome the commitment made by the Government this week to relocate up to 2,000 civil servants outside Dublin. The success of the decentralisation programme will depend on the Government's will to ensure that the recipient towns are provided with the necessary infrastructure and supports to capitalise on an increasing population. This is not a simple matter of locating civil servants in towns throughout Ireland or about rewarding towns in which there is a sitting Minister, regardless of the towns' employment or economic needs. The process is far more complex than that.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, I contributed to the debate on the Town Renewal Bill. I stated that local authorities should be given greater autonomy for planning the social, physical and economic infrastructure of their towns and villages. Local autonomy and the devolution of central Government is a central ingredient in the success of the decentralisation process. Ireland is sufficiently small to ensure that a decentralised form of government can work successfully. Devolved government is not the only ingredient in successful decentralisation. The provision of telecommunications infrastructure, adequate transport and housing is also crucial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1216" /> I refer to the case which has been well made for Mullingar by Westmeath County Council in co-operation with Mullingar Town Commission, the Westmeath County Enterprise Board, the Mullingar Chamber of Commerce, the Mullingar District Trades Council and the Westmeath Community Development Association. These groups made a presentation to the Minister for Finance in March on the reasons Mullingar would be an ideal centre for decentralisation. The most recent quarterly national household survey clearly showed that the midland and Border regions have benefited least from employment growth where the jobless rate still hovers at around 7%. That statistic should be borne in mind when decisions on decentralisation are made.</P>
    <P>Mullingar has been bypassed on a number of previous occasions. We are not into the politics of begrudgery in Westmeath as they do not achieve anything. However, many towns around Mullingar have benefited from the transfer of Government Departments and jobs. I am delighted by the success of the decentralisation process which is important for the reinvigoration of rural Ireland and the reduction of congestion in and around Dublin. Many civil servants from Mullingar and the surrounding towns and villages in north-west Meath travel to Dublin or elsewhere on a daily or weekly basis and they would welcome the opportunity to transfer back to their homes or an area near their homes. They would also welcome the opportunity to apply for transfers to other decentralised Departments or agencies which may be located in Mullingar. If they were presented with the opportunity to move back home, they could avail of a cheaper standard of living and more affordable property prices. Some commuters travel daily on a rail service which can prove problematic and they would welcome the opportunity to work in a decentralised Department in Mullingar.</P>
    <P>I will outline some of Mullingar's virtues with which the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Wallace, will be familiar. Mullingar, which is located only one hour from Dublin, is the county town of County Westmeath. With its rural hinterland, the town displays the best rural and urban aspects of contemporary Irish life. The town offers a quality lifestyle, having first class schools, excellent health care services and an enjoyable social atmosphere. Mullingar is a friendly, outward looking town which combines modern facilities with a co-operative, supportive and welcoming environment. Those are important attributes for any town wishing to attract a decentralised Department.</P>
    <P>Mullingar has traditionally served as the market and service centre for a large agricultural hinterland which itself has attractive villages, towns and rural areas. Today, Mullingar has a strong industrial infrastructure comprising a healthy mix of indigenous and inward investment firms. The service sector is an important player in its own right in addition to being a support to industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1217" /> Mullingar, known as &ldquo;the capital of the lakelands&rdquo;, is an ideal location for leisure and recreation. It is located close to Loughs Owel, Derravaragh, Ennell and Lene, the latter two boasting Ireland's only inland blue flag bathing locations. Mullingar's 18 hole championship golf course is one of the best in Ireland. Horse riding enthusiasts can avail of a choice of equestrian centres while the town's swimming pool offers top class facilities.</P>
    <P>Mullingar Arts Centre is a hive of activity for the performing of visual arts and Belvedere House park and gardens, the gem of the midlands, is now open to the public and is set to become one of Ireland's premier tourist attractions. These attractions will be augmented by the opening of a national transport museum which is being planned for Mullingar.</P>
    <P>Mullingar is an ideal centre for Government decentralisation from an administrative, professional and personal standpoint. While it is obviously for the Government to decide on this matter and while we would welcome any Department or agency in the town, local and regional circumstances might suggest that particular consideration should be given to the relocation of the Central Fisheries Board, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of the Environment and Local Government. I have made a strong case for Mullingar's ideal location, 50 miles from Dublin, as a centre for decentralisation.</P>
    <P>It is essential that new development patterns are shaped in such a way as to minimise the need for people to travel. Under developed parts of rural Ireland must be revitalised and we must ensure that their redevelopment meets the needs of existing communities, rather than excluding or isolating them. Counties such as Westmeath, Cavan and others in the midlands and north-west region must be promoted and utilised as regional and national centres of trade, business and tourism. There must be positive discrimination in regard to housing development in rural areas in which there is demonstrable population decline. I urge the Minister of State to convey that message to the higher echelons of the Department. The Department must be made aware that rural people want to live in their own environment.</P>
    <P>The lack of sewerage infrastructural development is a major problem in rural areas. I cannot understand why the Minister has failed to address this. I welcome the increased grant of £5,100 for group water schemes, based on a maximum allowable cost of £6,000, announced at the end of March. Similar action is required for group sewerage schemes in order that rural areas can be kept alive. People living in places such as Rathowen, Castletown-Geoghan and Ballymore in County Westmeath badly need such grants. Many people, including old age pensioners and recipients of social welfare benefits, in County Westmeath and <Col N="1218" /> other counties are attached to group water and sewerage schemes but are being denied services because they do not have the wherewithal to pay for them. That matter should be immediately rectified by the Minister. The level of grants available for group sewerage schemes should be increased to the same level as those available for group water schemes.</P>
    <P>Sustainable development must embrace quality of life issues in addition to concerns about the physical quality of the urban environment. We must provide adequate recreational open space to meet our population's needs, together with adequate educational facilities to cater for the educational requirements of our young people. It is vital that adequate child care facilities are provided, at least at the rate of 20 places for every 75 dwellings as outlined in Westmeath County Council's draft development plan. I would like to have commented on the issue of transport but time constraints do not permit me to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Haughey, McGuinness, Martin Brady and Brendan Smith.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that the tone of this motion is less condemnatory than is usually the case with Opposition motions. It appears merely to raise some of the very serious issues presented by our unparalleled economic success and the implications of that success for our economy and society.</P>
      <P>Some British based economists argue that the economy is overheating and there is much evidence for this. Central Bank officials have suggested that inflation could be 9% rather than 6%. These are issues which may be resolved at a later date. However, the main point of the Opposition motion is to point up the infrastructural overload in our economy and the huge pressure on resources such as roads, railways and child care facilities. These problems indicate an economy which is running ahead of even the wildest expectations.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach cited an interesting statistic recently which will be welcomed by women. Until approximately two years ago the level of female participation in the work-force was well below the European average. As a result of the Government's wise policies on taxation and other matters, female participation in the work-force is now above the European average. More women participate in the work-force than did before Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats came to office. This startling fact reveals the great achievements of the Government, particularly in personal taxation. The last budget provided a great benefit to women who wished to return to work. The Minister was not trying to force women to go out to work. He was simply providing them with a realistic option. Before the budget I frequently heard women in my constituency clinics complaining that it was not worth their while going out to work. The position of women who wish to work outside the home has been greatly enhanced by the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1219" /> The issue of child care provision requires further study and commitment by the Government. The Government has made progress in this regard in the budget provision and the 100% capital allowance for employers and commercial operators who wish to provide crèche facilities. However, we must go further. There is anecdotal and real evidence that women are leaving the work-force because they cannot access affordable and viable child care.</P>
    <P>We have enacted equality legislation but the child care issue impinges on equality for everyone who wishes to participate in the work force. The cost of child care and the lack of facilities for parents who wish to go out to work is inhibiting female participation in the work force and encouraging people to opt out of it. Many people choose to opt out of paid employment to devote themselves to looking after their children in the home. However, the lack of child care affects people who do not wish to make that choice.</P>
    <P>I urge Ministers who are involved in this area, particularly the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Finance to allow the cost of child care to be tax deductable. This is the norm in the United States and in many other countries and I hope this measure will be part of the next budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinBrady" hpid="Mr. M. Brady Mr. M. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is redundant because it calls on the Government to undertake a wide range of actions on a broad range of issues which are already either planned or implemented.</P>
      <P>The national development plan sets out a comprehensive and practical philosophy and a huge range of detailed measures and programmes to address the various issues arising from the unprecedented economic and social development which Irish society has undergone in the past five or six years. It also provides a framework for the development of our economy and society in a balanced and caring way for the next decade or so. The national spatial strategy which complements the national development plan, but which will go far beyond it, will address the issues of rebalancing development away from the existing urban areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford and provide an opportunity to create and foster new centres of growth in medium sized towns and cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regional development is particularly important in this regard. The plan is the first one to address the regionalisation concept, with regional development operational programmes for the Border, Midland and Western region as well as the Southern and Eastern region. The plan proposes that £2 billion be spent in the BMW region and £3 billion in the other region. The Government is concentrating on gateways in promoting regional development through ease of access to domestic and foreign markets and modern telecommunications. I compliment Deputy Albert Reynolds who, as Minister with responsibility for telecommunications, began the modernisation of <Col N="1220" /> our telecommunications network. He upgraded the infrastructure and installed 80,000 connections in a very short time. I was a member of the trade union which dealt with the Minister at that time and I compliment him on his achievements.</P>
    <P>Good education facilities are very important and we have a skilled and educated work-force. New regional gateways in a number of strategically placed centres which are already showing good development potential will be given special attention, both for themselves and their zones of influence. The existing major gateways will continue to grow but the encouragement of new and alternative modes of development will bring prosperity to relatively neglected areas and will take developmental and infrastructural pressures off the major conurbations. Towns such as Sligo, Athlone, Clonmel and Dundalk, for instance, could become thriving development centres in their own right providing new and enhanced work and lifestyle opportunities for the people in their hinterlands.</P>
    <P>This development which will be achieved through the national spatial strategy will be grounded in continuing sustainable economic and employment growth. The national spatial strategy will respect the sustainable development concept and ensure the economy and society can develop to their full potential within a well protected environment without compromising the quality of that environment and with responsibility to future generations and the wider international community.</P>
    <P>The national sustainable development strategy will require constructive and co-ordinated responses to a number of significant challenges. I have a personal interest in some of these, such as arresting the decline in water quality in our rivers, lakes and waterways and better waste management. I compliment the Minister and his Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, who has made tremendous inroads into this area by, for example, allocating significant finances to schools and so on, to create a litter awareness campaign, which has been well received and proven to be very successful.</P>
    <P>The national plan also commits significant capital sums totalling £20 billion for infrastructural development on roads, public transport, water and waste water services, environmental protection, telecommunications, to which I referred earlier, particularly e-commerce, energy, housing and health. Approximately £4.7 billion is allocated for national roads to eliminate bottlenecks and capacity deficiencies and give better access to ports and airports. Water and waste services will receive an investment of some £3 billion for improving rural water supplies, opening up serviced land for commercial and residential use and for the implementation of the EU Waste Water Treatment Directive.</P>
    <P>On housing, the policy responds to the third Bacon report, focusing on curbing pressure on house prices and strengthening the position of first time buyers, which is very important. There <Col N="1221" /> are not any financial cuts in the health services. I am a member of the board of management of Beaumont Hospital and I asked a question on this at a board meeting. There are not any financial constraints on the health services.</P>
    <P>I fully support the Government's amendment to the motion as should the Opposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to make a short contribution on this important debate and as Deputy Martin Brady said, I am very glad to support the substantial amendment moved last night by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey. In his wide ranging and comprehensive speech, the Minister dealt with Government investment policies, its balanced regional development policy and its drive to create job opportunities throughout the regions, particularly in the less-developed regions. The Minister also spoke at length about the need to attract economic growth to the less-developed areas and to provide housing faster and more housing units per annum.</P>
      <P>Listening to the debate last night, I was very surprised that Deputy Gilmore of the Labour Party was so negative in his comments about the Government's national development plan and about regionalisation. Deputy Gilmore spoke about vision. He did not speak about action. This Government has a vision for the future economic and social development of this country but it is also putting that vision into effect. It is acting and investing in human resources and infrastructure.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Penrose speak tonight in a very positive manner about the need for development in rural Ireland and to build up our small towns and villages. I remind the Fine Gael and Labour Parties that when Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats very trenchantly advocated the need to regionalise this country and the need to confer Objective One status on the Border, midlands and western region, those two parties failed to support the Government. Were it not for the fact that the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Parties had the courage and the right vision to regionalise this country, there would be no hope of the necessary economic and regional development in those less developed areas. The Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party would have continued a policy of more development on an east coast that is already strangled with too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President of Deputy Gilmore's party, Deputy De Rossa, trotted out arguments at length in this House and on the national media, that there should not be regionalisation and that there should not be Objective One status conferred on the Border, midlands or western areas. He trotted out figures about the long-term unemployment in the urban areas in the east. He conveniently forgot to mention that the area with the highest level of long-term unemployment has consistently been the Border region. Deputy Crawford and all the public representatives in both our counties have spoken at <Col N="1222" /> length, whether in Opposition or in Government, about the need for economic development in our area. Unfortunately, we had political difficulties on the other side of our province for 30 years, which hindered economic and social development. Take the village of Swanlinbar in County Cavan as an example &ndash; the fact that a small village could have six of the roads leading into it closed for a period in excess of 25 years shows the progress we need to make in the economic sphere in those areas.</P>
    <P>I sound one note of caution on the regional gateways and the spatial strategy plans. I hope the officials in the different agencies, in devising this strategy, will bear in mind that the Border region has to catch up economically with other areas which have gained much more from a regional economic viewpoint. I hope that when we talk about gateways, we are not talking about just a few centres countrywide. I hope that each county town at least and the other major towns in each county will be given particular development priority to ensure that there is a spread of population throughout the rural counties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Penrose quite rightly spoke about the need to have a better spread of housing developments in rural areas but thankfully in County Cavan we have had a policy over the years of building small clusters of houses in our small towns and villages and building rural houses. It is important that we have a proper spread of population. Already in those areas, rural parishes, small towns and villages, there is basic infrastructure such as schools, shops, post offices etc.</P>
    <P> On decentralisation, Deputy Cullen gave a very cogent speech last night on this Government's determination to ensure that we have a very effective and progressive decentralisation policy. In the late 1980s, County Cavan was chosen by the Fianna Fáil Party in Government as a location for decentralisation of a major section of the Department of Agriculture. That decentralisation has been and is very successful. I appeal tonight to the Government, as I have done through parliamentary questions and written representations, to have further decentralisation to County Cavan.</P>
    <P>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows that the towns of Cootehill, Belturbet and Cavan have all put in very strong cases to the Minister for Finance and his Department, showing their need and the merits of those centres for decentralisation. Any of the three towns to which I referred have adequate schools, recreational and sporting facilities and housing at reasonable cost. Also, in Cavan town, there is a college of further studies which provides for further education.</P>
    <P>I hope that it will be possible for this Government to decentralise a major section of a Department to County Cavan and I support the case for decentralisation to County Monaghan put forward by my colleagues from that county as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil minority Government which came into office in 1987 adopted the right economic policies which <Col N="1223" /> resulted in the unprecedented levels of economic growth and prosperity we are currently experiencing. In 1987, the main issues of the day were unemployment, emigration and crime. Today the issues are very different. New difficulties and challenges have emerged. In short, the Government must now manage our economic success and it is responding. The National Development Plan 2000-2006 is now being implemented. This will facilitate massive investment in our roads, public transport, waste management and waste services, environmental protection, telecommunications, energy, housing and health. A national spatial strategy is being prepared which will bring about balanced regional development. Peter Bacon's recommendations in his three reports on housing are being implemented. An overhaul of our public transport structures is commencing. These are just some of the measures the Government is taking in response to the changed situation.</P>
      <P>Some years ago, I spoke out against decentralisation along with many of my Dublin colleagues. At that stage, Dublin had many economic problems and had a higher than average rate of unemployment. In addition there were many economic blackspots within the city with high rates of unemployment, poverty and economic decline generally. Thankfully, that has all now changed. As economic growth and prosperity puts more and more pressure on the greater Dublin area, I am now fully committed to the concept of balanced regional development as outlined in the national development plan and the national development strategy currently being prepared. Overall balanced regional development makes perfect sense from both an economic and a social perspective. Nevertheless, parts of Dublin need special intervention measures. The establishment of the local drugs task forces and the partnerships to tackle long-term unemployment, were necessary and should be continued. Serious consideration should be given by the Minister for Finance to decentralising a Government Department to the Northside Partnership area of Dublin. Such a move would send a powerful message to the people there that at last economic and social exclusion is a thing of the past and would be supported by north Dublin organisations, such as the Northside Partnership, Nordubco, Round Ltd. and Dublin City University.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An increased demand for houses combined with a supply shortage has resulted in urban sprawl in the greater Dublin area. The accommodation supply could be increased by allowing more urban sprawl into Counties Kildare, Meath and Wicklow and beyond or increasing housing density or building on our parks and green spaces. The latter option was the outrageous suggestion of the economist, Colm McCarthy of DKM and it is simply not on. At a time when massive apartment complexes are being constructed, everything should be done to retain our parks and open spaces. Increased density is the <Col N="1224" /> way forward but this policy should be implemented carefully. I have concerns regarding the transformation of traditional neighbourhoods in suburban Dublin whereby lovely old houses are knocked down and replaced by one or two bedroom apartment complexes. In addition, the quality of design of these new buildings is often poor and they do nothing to promote family and community life. Housing density should be increased, but only in selected appropriate areas.</P>
    <P>Increasing economic growth and development threatens our urban environment in another way. Approximately 44 telecommunications operators are licensed by the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. In addition, many statutory utilities and local authorities are undertaking extensive road works in our towns and cities. Local authorities can issue directives to these organisations under the Road Traffic Act, 1961, in regard to such road works. However, their powers are inadequate. The standard of reinstatement works by telecommunications companies, in particular, can be poor. Roads and footpaths are dug up regularly causing widespread inconvenience to local residents and reinstatement works are often not undertaken for several months and when they are the work is of a poor standard. Local authorities need more power and resources to compel these companies to do a proper job and this should be examined as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Many other issues could be raised under this motion. Litter pollution is a major problem in all urban areas and local authorities are still not performing in this area. The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dan Wallace, is doing everything to pressurise local authorities to fulfil their responsibilities in this regard. Aircraft noise and the infill of 52 acres proposed by Dublin Port are big problems which are related to our economic prosperity and affecting our environment. My time has expired but I will resume my deliberations on these issues on another day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I will address one aspect of the motion which seeks an acceleration of the roll out of broadband high capacity telecommunications services to facilitate e-commerce. When the Government took office telecommunications infrastructure demand was not what it is today. As a result of the Government's policies there has been significant investment in this area which offers Ireland an opportunity to develop e-commerce and provides for decentralisation of its economic structure to make sure that every region can play its full part in our economic success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the main players in this industry have set up in Ireland. The IDA annual report outlined flagship projects, such as EMC in Cork, AOL Netscape, Oracle, Novell, and Hewlett Packard, which has established a European data centre here. Dell has sales of between £4 million and £8 million on-line which indicates that regardless of <Col N="1225" /> location e-commerce allows one to access all markets and all regions can benefit. I compliment the Minister for Public Enterprise who liberalised the telecommunications market in 1998, years ahead of schedule. A further step must be taken in this regard which involves the unbundling of the local loop and I hope that objective is also met earlier than the anticipated date. I acknowledge the role played by the Minister in ensuring that the global crossing contract was implemented at an early date and is serving Ireland by linking it to world wide markets at the speed required within the new economy being developed through information communication technologies.</P>
    <P>However, we need to continue to develop ICTs and not be complacent because further progress can be made through the allocation of £120 million in the national development plan and the upcoming initiative to be taken by the Minister for Public Enterprise to ensure that marginalised communities and others play a full role in this area. The Government should make sure, in rolling out the plan for the regions, that it examines education in terms of ICT and projects such as that undertaken in my home city of Kilkenny where there is a third level outreach centre involving NUI Maynooth and Carlow Institute of Technology and, I hope, Queen's University will come on board shortly.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to acknowledge that this is a step forward and the third level sector needs to be involved. ICTs enable this to happen and by doing so hi-tech industry will be attracted to the constituencies which have not benefited from such investment up to now. A small sum of money is required and I call on the Minister for Finance to examine such investment in terms of developing the regions. The other part of that equation is that investment in Carlow Institute of Technology should be increased as a result of its inclusion in a third level project which assists a neighbouring county.</P>
    <P>Advance factories have been built in Counties Carlow and Kilkenny and £4 million has been invested in a digital park in Carlow town. The IDA has invested huge sums of money in Kilkenny to construct two advance factories and a digital park. The Government in rolling out the necessary infrastructure to complement these projects and to enable the investors to focus on IT development should ensure that a policy is put in place for the south east region. A cross-departmental working group is needed to ensure that the IDA can focus on the need to attract hi-tech industry to the advance factories already constructed in Kilkenny. There was 4% employment growth in this industry in 1999 and 61,500 jobs have been created by the IDA in this area since its inception, which represents more than 50% of the jobs it has helped to create. That is an indication that e-commerce is the way forward and is a success story.</P>
    <P>However, it must be ensured that everybody is included and that is why the IDA should focus its attention on the advance factories in Kilkenny <Col N="1226" /> which have been idle for that past 12 months to ensure that some of the main players from Europe and beyond create jobs there. The neighbouring county of Carlow would benefit as a result because of the £4 million investment in its digital park. I welcome the debate in this area but a great deal has been done which should be recognised by the Opposition.</P>

      <P>I am glad of this brief opportunity to deal with some of the issues contained in the substantive Fine Gael motion before the House. It is always good to follow Government speakers. For the past half an hour or so we have had to listen to Lite FM quite regularly. Listening to the Government Deputies one would think that all was well and that the quality of life is wonderful for people. As we all know, however, pressures of modern living and the disparities in economic growth within cities &ndash; and particularly between urban and rural areas &ndash; have grown substantially since the Government took office.</P>
      <P>Working in the run up to by-elections provides one with an opportunity to see such disparities. While working on the forthcoming by-election in Tipperary South, I was quite appalled to see the huge economic disparity between small to medium towns and other towns within a five or ten mile radius of them. In one area unemployment can be as low as 4% or 5%, while in another it could be as high as 35%. The need for economic regeneration in such areas is quite evident.</P>
      <P>The net point behind my party's motion argues for radical decentralisation, not just of public sector employment but of private sector employment also. We will not achieve an increase in living standards unless private and public sector jobs are created for people in the regions, but that has not happened. Listening to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, yesterday, one would have thought they had only come to office in the past few months. The reality, however, is that the Government has been in office for three years. We hear continuous mantras about the national spatial strategy; grand words indeed, but what precisely do they mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three years into the life of this Dáil, the Government still has not selected the new growth centres for the country's economic and housing development for the next ten, 15 or 20 years. It has still not decided where it wants to built the 500,000 new homes over the next ten to 15 years, but our party has. In Fine Gael's plan for the nation, we have spelled out the designated growth centres which are required to address the housing shortage. We want to do it in a co-ordinated way with public infrastructure to ensure that we will <Col N="1227" /> not have a developer-led process as happened in Dublin over the past 15 years.</P>
    <P>We want to ensure that enough housing is in place but the Government does not have any such plan. It has a national spatial strategy and it plans to consult everyone under the sun for the next few months, which should bring it to about a month prior to the next election. The Government is doing this because it does not want to take any hard decisions on the potential growth centres before the election. It does not want to tell Kilkenny that it will not be a designated growth centre compared to Athlone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not want to tell Nenagh that it will not be a designated growth centre compared to Mullingar. Hard decisions have to be made but the Government is completely incompetent when it comes to making them.</P>
      <P>Since taking office the Government has done nothing in respect of the Kyoto protocol on greenhouse gas emissions. The agreement we signed in Kyoto and which was subsequently changed at Buenos Aires at the second conference on climate change, said that by the year 2008 and beyond we must reach a certain level of reduction in COf11&gt;8 gas emissions. However, we are way above the current targets that have been set for 2008 and it will cost huge sums of money to redress the deficit from 2008 and beyond. About one third of COf8&gt;2 gas emissions emanate from the construction industry, a sector in which shoddy building regulations still exist. Elements of the building industry are allowed to erect any kind of development thereby producing poor thermal performances. If the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is really serious about the Kyoto agreement and reducing COf8&gt;2 emissions, why does he not bring forward regulations to improve thermal efficiency? </P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>In the current economic climate many industries are finding it ever more difficult to recruit skilled staff. This is forcing the establishment of new industry in major towns and cities to the detriment of our smaller towns and rural communities, as highlighted in the motion before the House. At the same time, many young couples in cities are fighting their way through the daily traffic chaos while paying astronomical prices for houses and the use of recreational facilities. They do not have the opportunity to work and reside in smaller towns due to the lack of employment. It is a chicken and egg situation: industry will not locate outside urban centres as it fears it will not be able to fill vacancies, and people will not move outside major urban centres unless they have a job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Companies considering locating outside Dublin first look at the age profile of the local community and their educational background before considering anything else. Yet, graduates and <Col N="1228" /> other well educated people from every town in every county are currently living in Dublin. County development officers should establish a skills register for each county with the support of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. This would assist in targeting industry to rural towns and away from the clogged up cities. People could register their skills, qualifications and interests on such a register, as well as indicating their desire to reside in a particular part of the country. This information could then be used to target specific industries to the regions. This would be of benefit to industry which could avail of a workforce residing locally, and it would be less likely to lose workers to other industries. This would provide an improved quality of life for new employees coming from the cities and it would rejuvenate many rural towns. Such a skills register would be inexpensive to establish and would provide an invaluable resource for the development of smaller towns.</P>
    <P>We must examine the issue of encouraging people to move out of Dublin, thus alleviating the capital's traffic and housing chaos. The Government, however, is not committed to decentralisation of industry or Government Departments. Even if it decided to decentralise tomorrow, the infrastructure is not in place and it will not be provided even within the parameters of the national development plan. Take the N5, for example, which is the main arterial road to Westport, County Mayo. Last week that substandard road nearly caused the deaths of 48 people whose lives were put at risk by its poor condition. The passengers in the Bus Éireann vehicle involved could have suffered far more serious consequences. They had a lucky escape. Much of the danger comes down to the fact that the basic roads infrastructure is substandard and, thus, not able to carry current traffic levels.</P>
    <P>Some industries package their products in County Mayo but have to repackage them in Dublin because of damage sustained on the journey along the substandard N5 route. If we are serious about decentralisation and developing the regions, we will have to put the basic infrastructure in place. We will have to take a new approach towards industrial development in the regions. Forcing industry to locate in particular areas by twisting arms will not work. We have seen that method fail. We must ensure that employees are available in rural areas. Skilled staff is the big issue facing industry in the months and years to come. The Government must review the situation and should support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion deals with the housing crisis. The quality of life of each citizen is affected by Government action in respect of this great challenge. The response to the latest Bacon report has been poor. There is a growing realisation that the proposals put forward by Mr. Peter Bacon are inadequate to fully address the problem. Anger against the Government is growing for its failure to take positive ownership of the <Col N="1229" /> situation and make the decisions which would change the future. The nonsense of the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, attempting to deflect the Government's deficiency to local authorities will not work. People are not stupid and they know a red herring when they see one.</P>
      <P>The Government must address the problem nationally. We cannot allow Dublin to expand all the way to Gorey, Athy, Mullingar, Castleblaney and Dundalk. Some eight million people reside within London's ring-road which constitutes a loop of 25 miles, but we are creating a loop some 60 miles long to accommodate a far smaller number of people. In general, cities have developed on the basis that one hour's travel time from home to the place of employment was the maximum journey people were prepared to accept. We are now creating outer suburbs that are 90 minutes from the hub. This time, amalgamated with the travel time from home to the main transport corridor and from the arrival point through to the place of employment, is in some instances up to two and a half or three hours, a loss of approximately five hours a day. This time could be much better used. This is why I support the motion, which seeks action by the Government to address these problems.</P>
      <P>Too many cars are causing traffic mayhem in our towns and cities, with all the consequent pollution. The build up of health costs which are created by citizens having to cope with noise and air pollution, along with the added stress of travel and negotiating their way within cities and towns, will be a real problem in the years ahead. Radical solutions are required.</P>
      <P>Modern technology affords an opportunity to establish employment centres away from the capital. This would rejuvenate country towns and villages and bring people back, which would improve the quality of life for all. We must stop the unnecessary pollution of our atmosphere and find ways of containing the amount of emissions of green house gases by reducing the need for long journeys.</P>
      <P>The issue of the social complexity of communities must be considered. The good use of resources is most important. Time is people's most valuable resource. It is very limited and every effort should be made to maximise every minute. Time spent travelling is, in essence, wasted. There is always something better to do with one's time. Spending quality time with family and friends, developing the neighbourhood or promoting the welfare of youth is much better than travelling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Through radical measures, it is possible to segment communities outside the main cities. Every effort must be made to maximise space and conserve our resources. The Government must focus on areas outside the greater Dublin commuter belt and invest in facilities for towns around the country which are stagnating. It should fund programmes to enhance water services and power supply and address the issue of upgrading sani<Col N="1230" /> tation services while investing in the physical facilities for sport and community use.</P>
    <P>The Government must ensure that technology is available by upgrading the telecommunications network, enabling e-commerce to relocate in these attractive places. It must ensure that critical mass is available to sustain communities. The Government must consider a sensible approach to relocating Departments and State agencies in targeted sites. These locations should be chosen because of their strategic value and not for political advantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this broad ranging motion. In his budget speech on 1 December 1999, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, said the next round of decentralisation would be &ldquo;more radical than those to date&rdquo;. He stated the Government's intention to transfer the maximum possible number of public service jobs from Dublin and to move almost complete Departments of State and other public bodies to provincial centres. We have yet to see significant progress on that pledge.</P>
      <P>For too long the people of Counties Cavan and Monaghan, whom I am proud to represent, have been keenly interested, but almost always disappointed observers, of the decentralisation process. Decades of disadvantage as a result of partition have been compounded by neglect on the part of successive Governments. The record of inward investment and job creation in the two counties by State agencies ranks among the worst in the country. The decentralisation record, particularly for County Monaghan, is equally abysmal. This has been a cause of great disappointment.</P>
      <P>Peripherality, poor infrastructure or proximity to the conflict in the Six Counties have frequently been used to excuse the absence of inward industrial and commercial investment and job creation. While not conceding validity to these excuses now or in the past, they could not be used in the case of the decentralisation of the offices of the State. My argument is that decentralisation should have been deployed long ago in the case of County Monaghan to compensate for the absence of other inward economic support.</P>
      <P>It is time to put these omissions of the past to right. County Monaghan should be placed at the top of the priority list for the decentralisation of major Departments of State and other public bodies. The Breffni county and the towns of Cavan and Cootehill in particular must also feature in Government decentralisation plans. The motion calls for the accelerated roll-out of broad band, high capacity telecommunications services to facilitate e-commerce business development. The need for this is keenly felt in the Border region. There is a need for early progress there and elsewhere. I support the motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion but there is a need to distinguish between economic development and economic growth. Development is sus<Col N="1231" /> tainable while economic growth is unsustainable. I hope all Deputies will agree that there cannot be infinite economic growth on a finite planet.</P>
      <P>The problems with our environment and the deterioration in our quality of life are directly linked to accelerated economic growth. There has been phenomenal growth of 11% but what does this mean? The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, said it is wonderful that there are so many new cars on our roads. However, she must realise that this has resulted in a huge amount of extra air pollution in cities. There are now volatile organic compounds, benzene and PM10s in the air. Perhaps Deputies do not realise that more people die each year from car emissions than as a result of car accidents. This is a phenomenal statistic and I ask the Minister to address that problem.</P>
      <P>There are also problems with regard to waste. The amount of waste has doubled over a five year period. It is the Achilles heel of our consumerist society, yet the Government offers a quick fix, end of pipe solution. This will not deal with the problem. If our environmental problems are to be seriously addressed, there is a need to go back to the root causes &ndash;&ldquo;radical&rdquo; means going back to the root cause of problems &ndash; and also to have some form of understanding of interconnectedness. Departments are doing things which are leading to environmental problems with which another Department is trying to deal.</P>
      <P>This type of schizophrenia is most evident in the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The Minister is opening dual carriageways and motorways but he then talks about the Kyoto protocol. He should realise that there is a link between opening up new motorways and the rise in carbon dioxide levels. There has been controversy about the road through the Glen of the Downs. This new motorway will increase commuter times by approximately 40 seconds. The road was first built in 1970 and it is being expanded now. However, if traffic growth continues, it will be necessary to expand that road again in 15 years. This does not make sense.</P>
      <P>If we are serious about dealing with this matter, environmental NGOs must be part of the social partnership process. The environment has been forgotten. The talk is all about economic growth and GDP, but people's quality of life and the environment are going down the tubes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the principal ways in which the environment could be looked after is if our dreadful habit of littering the countryside, towns and cities stopped. As I said many times previously, as a nation, we only react to punishment and the sooner larger fines are introduced for littering, <Col N="1232" /> the better. It is the only way anything will ever be done about it.</P>
    <P>A positive lead should be given by the provision of a sufficient number of refuse bins. There is no point expecting a careless individual to carry a piece of paper in his or her hand for a couple of hundred yards. Sufficient bins should be provided, and they should be emptied regularly. There is no point having overflowing bins. It should be possible to increase the amount of recycling. People in other countries can separate their bottles, plastic and paper, but we appear to have great difficulty getting the process under way. There has been talk about it for long enough; there should be action.</P>
    <P>Our rivers should be protected. Silage is being made at present and farmers have made tremendous efforts in recent years to prevent pollution from silage effluent. Accidents happen but we must highlight the importance of preventing the pollution of our rivers because the damage caused in terms of fish kills takes a long time to rectify.</P>
    <P>I had the pleasure of seeing and hearing the Minister of State outlining in detail last night why Carlow should be a priority town for decentralisation. His criteria included the availability of housing and schools. Planning approval has been given for 800 houses and there are applications for a further 600 houses so Carlow is in a strong position to provide housing. It also has top class schools. Another criterion is proximity to third level education. Carlow has an institute of technology and also St. Patrick's College, which has been in existence for more than 200 years and which provides degree courses. Another criterion is the population of the centre in relation to the numbers being relocated. The balance in Carlow in that regard is perfect. A balance has been struck between the population of the centre and the numbers being relocated. We must also look at the capacity of local infrastructure, particularly water, sewerage and telecommunications. We will be to the fore when we get our motorway. At present, we are perfectly positioned because there is a train service for the 50 mile journey to Dublin, Rosslare or Waterford. I am sure the Minister will be sent these details to back up the submission already made. There is also the question of the availability of suitable sites or office premises with a £4 million investment in a business park.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker mentioned the number of women at work compared to previous years. It would be good to think that women went to work on a voluntary basis. However, anyone who got married in the past five years has no choice because of the price of housing. That is one of the factors we should take into account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. I welcome the opportunity to highlight the fact that one of our greatest problems is waste management. The Minister must take responsibility for this because <Col N="1233" /> he has failed to introduce a national waste management policy. He has abdicated his responsibilities by giving the power to local authorities to provide for waste management in their areas. This is true in Connacht, County Galway and Galway city.</P>
      <P>There are not any constructive ideas on this issue. Communities are in disarray and are set against each other as a result of the reports published by M. J. O'Sullivan and Mr. Rudden. There are not any winners in the area of waste management except the consultants who have been employed throughout the country. The same waste management policy has been introduced for the entire country by these consultants. They believe they can solve the national problem by slightly varying this policy at local level. That is a disaster. If the Minister had the courage of his convictions to implement a national policy, the waste management problem would be solved.</P>
      <P>We have options for incinerators, gasifications, landfills or recycling and we are encouraging people to choose some of them. It is a disgrace that only 5% to 6% of waste is recycled at national level. Incentives are not being given by the Department to local authorities to change their ways. People are responsible for creating waste and they should be made to pay for that. It is the Minister's fault we do not have a coherent policy.</P>
      <P>When will the Minister for the Environment and Local Government take responsibility for the rehabilitation of derelict mining sites? I live near one in Tynagh, County Galway, which served this nation well in terms of the resources it provided through the mining industry's taxes. This mine has been abandoned by the company which took the wealth from the land since its gates were closed in 1982 and the caverns beneath the earth were flooded. There is an onus on the Minister to take responsibility for it and to ensure that those companies which are still operating in the country rehabilitate it.</P>

      <P>The Border, midlands and western regions have been granted Objective One status not because the Government wanted to do it but because the EU insisted it should. The Government wanted to add Kerry and Clare for political purposes. We should have more benefits than we have in the area.</P>
      <P>The national development plan does not refer to roads running from the east to the west. I am thinking of the Belfast to Galway road which runs through Monaghan, Clones and Cavan. There are many accidents on this cross-Border road, particularly between Clones and Cavan. Yet that road is not included in the next six year plan. Is it fair not to improve the infrastructure of the Border region?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Decentralisation was mentioned by many Members. County Monaghan is one of the few counties which was not included for decentralisation in the past. The only offices decentralised to Monaghan during this party's short period in <Col N="1234" /> Government were the INTERREG office and the peace and reconciliation office. One cross-Border office which should have been located in Monaghan was located in Cork as a result of representations made by politicians north of the Border, and Cork-based Deputies.  Three towns in County Monaghan need to be bypassed, but the Government has not provided one penny to buy the land or to put one stone on it. This is causing traffic chaos.</P>
    <P>There is no sewerage infrastructure in Monaghan town. One house was sold there four years ago for £85,000. It was resold two years ago for £142,000 and last week it was sold for £260,000. This is driving young people from setting up home in the region. Something must be done about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend my colleagues for tabling this motion. I draw the attention of the House to the difference between this motion and the Government's amendment. The Fine Gael motion is about people but the amendment is about an economy. That is the basic difference between the Government and the Opposition. The Government is focused on an economy and it has done a major U-turn on its election slogan, &ldquo;People Before Politics&rdquo;; it is now &ldquo;Politics Before People&rdquo;. We must focus on people's quality of life. The Government introduced the national development plan but it has neglected to introduce a spatial plan. It has put the cart before the horse.</P>
      <P>Some of my colleagues spoke about waste management, which is a major issue. However, I do not see any evidence of leadership by the Government in terms of recycling material or reducing the amount of waste produced. It has abdicated responsibility by telling local authorities to look after it. Pontius Pilate Dempsey has washed his hands off it. It is evident he does not want to know about this issue which is causing major problems. There is a proposal in Cork for a 250 acre super dump which would be 70 feet high with baled waste. That is a legacy for our children. Instead or recycling or reducing waste, we are dumping it on future generations. Consultants are proposing to put these dumps in natural aquifers. That is totally wrong. The blame lies with the Government.</P>
      <P>There is also a problem with traffic congestion throughout the country. People's quality of life is being sorely depleted. New rail tracks have not been laid on the rail link to Midleton since the Government took office. The Government has commissioned one consultants report after another. It is long-fingering the issue instead of making a political decision to open it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Child care is a huge issue in our society but the Government's amendment does not refer to it or to children. Does the Government realise the type of pressure, stress and costs families face because of child care? The Government has not made provision to help mothers, fathers and families who must go to work to get someone to look after their children. Inflation is another issue. The <Col N="1235" /> people's quality of life has plummeted since the Government came to office.</P>

      <P>I could go on with this response but unfortunately we do not have the time.</P>
      <P>The motion put down by the Opposition calls to mind our economic success and prosperity. Let us remember that the benefits of economic growth are real and tangible, especially in terms of jobs and living standards. When we speak of the difficulties posed by the rapid and sustained expansion of our economy, we should not forget the benefits which have accrued to our society. I accept that this level of economic growth poses challenges. Capacity constraints, whether these occur in the labour market, the construction industry or our physical infrastructure, can slow down economic growth and impact on our quality of life. As Minister of State with responsibility for environmental awareness, I am especially conscious of the environmental pressures which can accompany economic growth.</P>
      <P>Clearly, all these trends are creating a need and demand for improved levels of service across a range of sectors. The Government has been proactive in responding to those needs. We have put in place, through the national development plan, the policies and investment programmes to support continuing growth and development, to improve our quality of life, to protect and enhance our environment and to secure more balanced regional development.</P>
      <P>Previous national development plans focused on issues of genuine national concern such as fiscal discipline and employment creation. Inevitably, the resources available for infrastructure had to take second place but we now have the resources to address comprehensively the infrastructural deficits which have been identified. The national development plan provides both the strategic framework and resources to ensure that our infrastructure is upgraded to a standard that will match the country's status as a dynamic and buoyant economy.</P>
      <P>Over the period to 2006 we will see, with the implementation of the plan, a renewal and transformation of Ireland's physical capital. All sectors will share in this investment. The road network, water services, private and social housing, public transport, waste management, telecommunications, energy and health all stand to benefit from the £20 billion set aside to enhance these capital services under the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Implementation of these programmes will be informed by the national spatial strategy, which <Col N="1236" /> will have a 20 year time perspective on social and economic development. The strategy, which is well under way in my Department and which is due to be completed by the end of next year, will provide a framework within which investment in infrastructure will be used to achieve development objectives both nationally and at regional level. It will pay particular regard to the objective in the national development plan of more balanced regional development both between and within regions.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise that Ireland's environment has been subject to fewer pressures than the environment of other EU countries and consequently is of a relatively high standard, but our environment is now under increasing threat due largely to the pace of economic growth. To meet the challenge we need a strong environmental policy, integration of the environment into sectoral economic policies and greater environmental awareness.</P>
    <P>It is not possible for me to list all aspects of the Government's environmental policies but I will mention a few &ndash; the planned investment under the national development plan in water services, waste management and public transport, the work under way on the national spatial strategy, the waste management strategies being developed by local authorities; the planned national greenhouse gas abatement strategy; the action we are taking to tackle the litter problem, the phase out of leaded petrol and the extension of the coal ban to more towns. This Government has an excellent record on the environment and more is to come, but others have to play their part also. Respect for, and protection of, the environment is a shared responsibility.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with Deputy Penrose's point about sewerage systems. There are £290 million for water and waste water treatment services in the Estimates for this year. The national development plan allocates £3,000 million over the 2000-6 period, an increase of 150% on the previous 1994-9 period. The Minister will announce a three year programme for waste water and water treatment next month.</P>
    <P>The Government welcomes our unprecedented economic growth and we accept that it brings challenges which must be responded to, but we are addressing these challenges through investment in infrastructure, spatial planning, regional development, decentralisation and action to protect our environment. I wish I had more time to respond to some of the points made by the Opposition Members which were way off target. I commend the Government's amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleagues for sharing their time with me. I welcome the opportunity to support the motion. The Minister mentioned <Col N="1237" /> regional development, decentralisation and action to protect the environment, which are nice phrases, but I have continually asked the Tánaiste to provide an IDA regional office in Longford to reduce the jobs crisis there and I have been ignored at all stages.</P>
      <P>On decentralisation, the midlands have the lowest level of job creation by the IDA in the country. The midlands is an ideal area for decentralisation and I hope that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, will see fit to transfer Government jobs to the midlands.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the state of our roads and one particular road which is a hazard to traffic, that is, the Ballymahon-Lanesborough road. Traffic, including heavy vehicles, continually goes off that road and I would like the Government to make a note of that because a request for special funding will be made by Longford County Council for this particular road.</P>
      <P>Sewerage development is most important because the planners are very strict in this regard. There is a lot of resentment throughout the country because people cannot get planning permission in rural areas. I realise local authorities have to monitor this but if people want to live in rural areas &ndash; and we are talking about attracting people back to live in rural areas &ndash; services such as sewerage and water have to be put in place. I ask the Government to deal with those matters as well. It is a good idea for elderly people to live in villages and that is where housing for the elderly comes in. It is important to stress that people like to live in the area where they were born, near their own families and neighbours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose with a major threat to its own sustainability hanging over its head, it is not surprising that the Government is not paying much attention to sustainable development. It is not surprising but it is deplorable at the same time.</P>
      <P>Last night, when he was responding to our motion, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, devoted one-sixth of his speaking time &ndash; ten seconds out of every minute &ndash; to environmental questions. That is a measure of how this Government sees environmental issues. The Minister introduced what he said about the environment in the following way: &ldquo;I would like to deal briefly with some environmental issues in the context of the motion before the House&rdquo;. How is that for a concern with sustainable development? It is an accurate reflection of the Minister's approach to these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it comes to setting out expenditure plans for flagship projects, the environment is only an afterthought as far as this Government is concerned. The Minister identified eutrophication last night as one of Ireland's most serious environmental problems, and what is the Government doing about it? The Minister mentioned last night the phosphorous regulations made in 1998, the development of catchment management stra<Col N="1238" /> tegies throughout the country, nutrient management planning, the phase-out of phosphate based domestic detergents, and the implementation of REPS. Are the resources in place to make sure that the phosphorous regulations are properly applied? The answer is no. Are there resources in place to implement catchment management strategies? The answer is that the Government has not even begun to think about that.</P>
    <P>What is nutrient management planning? The Minister did not say and there is not a programme in place for carrying it out. I would like Members of this House to ask him if REPS is an environmental strategy? It is in part, but much more than that, it is a recognition not by the Government but by the European Union that it is impossible to make a decent living on a small farm and there is a need to give income aids to small farmers in ways that do not increase production. That is what REPs is all about. For the Minister to include a reference to REPS as part of the Government's environmental policy is another reflection that the Government does not know what an environment policy should be about.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government said last night and the Minister of State at that Department said tonight that there will be record levels of investment in water services under the national development plan, but despite repeated questioning the Minister is unable to say when we will stop discharging raw sewage into our water courses. He has made no correlation whatever between levels of expected residential growth and the level of investment in water services. Even with all the money that will be spent on water services and in other areas under the national development plan over the next six years, I predict there will not be a net improvement in our quality of life because given the policies in place, the amount of money that will be spent will not be sufficient to maintain the current quality of our environment.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke last night of regional waste management plans and of the recognised hierarchy of prevention, minimisation, re-use, recycling and disposal. We have heard him say that umpteen times, but what resources are being made available to promote re-use and recycling? From where will funding be made available to make recycling possible where it is not now economic? The Minister said nothing about that.</P>
    <P>What measures are being put in place to deal with the large volumes of waste currently being produced by excessive and unnecessary use of packaging materials? My colleague, Deputy Clune, and I made inquiries about this last year and found that many local authorities did not seem to be aware of their obligations under the packaging waste directive and many more of them do not appear to have done anything about it. The Minister is not driving our waste management policy or the implementation of directives in this area. He is leaving that all to the local <Col N="1239" /> authorities, but he has not given them they resources they need to make things happen.</P>
    <P>Local authorities and regional authorities throughout the country are considering waste management plans. What will emerge from that? Will we see an end to the blight of super dumps? Not on your life.  If the Minister of State cared to do it, he could give us a list as long as my two arms of sites for super dumps. In the year 2000 when we are supposed to have such a strategy in place for the past four years, what has the Minister done about it? He has done nothing. He is exhorting people to consider different ways of managing waste but has turned a blind eye to super dumps in Counties Cork and Dublin and proposals for them in Counties Galway and Tipperary. Super dumps are proposed almost everywhere one looks. The Minister is hoping people might change their views about thermal treatment. That is not a directive policy, although I am not surprised because a Minister for the Environment and Local Government who refuses to include the concept of sustainable development in a planning and development Bill, but includes it in a small town renewal Bill, under which he has goodies to give away, is not taking the environment seriously.</P>

      <P>The intent of this motion is to highlight the pressures our rapid rate of economic growth and development is putting on our citizens, our quality of life and our environment. The motion, tabled by the Opposition, calls to mind our economic success and prosperity, but it also focuses on the effect that is having on our environment. It highlights that despite our rapid urbanisation and our rapid rate of economic development in one of the strongest economies in Europe, we do not pay attention to our environment. We do not recognise that our environment is finite and cannot continuously absorb the pressure and assimilate the residuals of our economic achievements that are demanded of our environment.</P>
      <P>A recently published EPA report, to which the Minister referred last night, highlights a range of issues, which shows substantial signs of how our environment is beginning to experience the strain and the pressures of our economic success.</P>
      <P>Eutrophication of our inland waterways is widespread. Recent reviews indicate their standard is continuing to deteriorate. There has been a pattern of continuous deterioration of our waterways since the 1970s. I accept there has been a mild to moderate deterioration of our waterways, but it is a pattern that is continuing to increase and has not been reversed by the Government.</P>
      <P>The number of cars and vehicles on our roads has continued to rise and the emissions from them are the greatest threat to air quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1240" /> The target level for greenhouse gas emissions is 13% over the 1990 levels and already we have exceeded that figure. We are likely to reach three times our target level if we continue on this basis.</P>
    <P>Levels of waste produced is continuing to increase. A total of 91% of our municipal waste is disposed of in landfill sites. We have witnessed a major exploitation of our natural resources. Damage to our landscape from insensitive development is leading to a loss of habitat and threatens certain species of flora and fauna. All this has been highlighted by the EPA recently. We need to develop a change of policy towards our environment.</P>
    <P>I, like my colleague, Deputy Dukes, was disappointed by the Minister's contribution last night. He spoke at length of development across the State, but devoted only a small part of his contribution to the environment. He acknowledged there was room for improvement, but that development is proceeding and we will continue to develop our urban areas and to put pressure on our environment. That is all very well, but the development we are experiencing should not be at the expense of our environment.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not mention the word &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; once in his speech, despite our having a national sustainable development strategy in place since 1997. I remind him that the concept of sustainability is to ensure that the economy and society can develop to their full potential within a well protected environment and with responsibility towards present and future generations and to the wider international community. Where is there evidence of that commitment when there has been a deterioration in the standard of our waterways? Where is there evidence of our international commitment to the agreement we signed up to in Kyoto in 1997? We are committed to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, yet we are still awaiting the Government's strategy on that issue.</P>

Media reports yesterday highlight that people from outside Dublin have to spend one and half to two hours commuting to work. Where is there evidence of sustainability in such long commuting times? Does the Minister not realise the pressure that puts on people in terms of car spaces, adding three hours to a day's work, trying to gain access to one's place of work and the cost of accommodation in the city and of child care facilities?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill may be stated briefly. It is to provide that a judge of the High Court, Judge Feargus Flood, who was appointed to the Bench on 1 October 1991, will qualify for a full pension of one-half of salary when he reaches the retirement age on 9 July next, notwithstanding the fact that he will not have the full 15 years service which is required for full pension entitlements.</P>
      <P>The new provision applies only to the High Court and to only one judge of that court. The question of extending this new provision to the other serving judges of the High Court does not arise.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that Judge Flood has been engaged on a whole-time basis since November 1997 as chairman and sole member of the tribunal of inquiry into certain planning matters, the Flood tribunal. Judge Flood has agreed, in the public interest, to remain in this position after his retirement as a judge at age 72. It is impossible to say at this stage how long this tribunal will last but it is anticipated that his services will be required for a considerable time.</P>
      <P>All sides of the House will agree that the tribunal has carried out its work in an exemplary manner and that its contribution has been invaluable in trying to arrive at the truth concerning the matters set out in the terms of reference. The chairman's role has been particularly onerous. Since the tribunal began its work almost three years ago, it has sifted through an enormous amount of written material and spent many days hearing evidence from witnesses. To date, over 200 people have been interviewed by the tribunal in this regard and hundreds more have been spoken to or communicated with by members of the legal team. The tribunal has received a huge number of documents and files from various planning authorities, Departments and financial institutions within the State.</P>
      <P>All this has been carried out under the stewardship of the Honourable Mr. Justice Feargus Flood, for which he deserves our thanks. However, sometimes it behoves the State to recognise in a more practical way the efforts that individuals have made and continue to make in public affairs. I believe that this is one such case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a more general level, I am sure it is widely accepted that in considering appointments to the <Col N="1243" /><Col N="1244" /> Judiciary, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and the Government should have open to it the widest possible field of selection. In many instances, acceptance of such appointments, and I must be blunt here, means that the people involved accept large reductions in current income. This has not deterred distinguished legal practitioners from accepting judicial appointments and they have served the State well. In the area of pensions, because they have taken up duty on the Bench relatively late in their careers, some of these judges have not accrued the necessary years service required to receive the maximum pension entitlements.</P>
    <P>In the case which is the subject of this legislation, the judge in question is just over six years short of the necessary 15 years' service which would entitle him to a full pension. He has, in the interests of completing the work of the tribunal efficiently and effectively, agreed, at the request of the Government, to continue on as chairman until the work is completed. A commitment such as this should be acknowledged in a tangible way.</P>
    <P>In money terms, the Bill provides that Judge Flood's current pension entitlement will increase by more than £20,000 per annum, up to £45,715. His retirement lump sum will increase by a little more than £64,000, up to £317,145, all based on current salary. These payments will be made immediately on the judge's retirement on 9 July next. His total remuneration, that is, pension and salary will continue at the level of that of a High Court judge for the duration of his chairmanship of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the Bill has been brought before the House to deal with an individual case and other judges are not involved. This adjustment is well deserved and as such I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important Bill which highlights something about tribunals. It is unlikely that the aim of the Bill, which illustrates a vulnerable aspect of the current tribunal process, will be opposed by anyone in the House.</P>
      <P>On the Flood tribunal and its sole member, it is fair to say that over the past three years the tribunal has not always attracted positive public statements. For a time many critics suggested that the tribunal was lost and should be brought to an end. Thankfully, the critical attitudes are far less prevalent nowadays. The value of this and other tribunals and the very significant service they are doing for the State has recently become clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Bill illustrates a vulnerable aspect of the tribunal process as Mr. Justice Flood was due to retire next month. If he were to step down at that stage before the tribunal has completed its work, the work of the tribunal would be brought to an end. God forbid, if he were to be incapacitated, the tribunal would collapse. The word &ldquo;tribunal&rdquo; suggests more than one member. The point I wish to put to the Minister and the House is whether setting up tribunals which have <Col N="1245" /> a sole member is wise. Most of the tribunals which have been set up in the recent past were anticipated to have a relatively short span. However, tribunals can drag on and it is a little bit like a computer programme, that is, one can go behind something but one does not know where it stops. Henceforth, it would be wise to consider multiple membership of tribunals. In fact, I would go a step further. As some Members of the House will be aware, I have long been of the view that we need some type of fully formed standing ethics commission to handle much of the work currently being handled by the tribunals.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill and wish to put on the record my admiration as a citizen of this State for the work the tribunal is doing. Painful though it may be, in the medium and longer term the entire machinery of State will be greatly serviced by the wrong doings being highlighted and effective action ultimately being taken. It would not be possible to make such progress without a good and effective tribunal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>I welcome and support the granting of a full pension entitlement to Mr. Justice Fergus Flood. The Flood tribunal deserves to be commended for its diligent handling of its affairs, including the manner in which it has overcome the determined court challenges to its powers, the calculated attempts by vested and frightened interests to derail it, the scepticism of certain sections of the general public and the media, the manner in which it has stuck doggedly to its task of digging deep into the murky world of payments in respect of planning and rezoning and for bringing to the surface facts more frightening than we expected even in our worst nightmares.  </P>
      <P>At a glance the increase of £21,360 in the judge's pension, coupled with the lump sum increase of £64,081, seems generous. However, in the context of the public service that Mr. Justice Flood and his team are rendering, it represents extremely good value for money. Generous as the amounts provided for in the legislation may seem, they pale into insignificance by comparison with the financial killings made by the property speculators and their political accomplices now under investigation. It is obvious that tribunals of inquiry are destined to remain part of the political landscape for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a public mood of disaffection in the wake of the inane, inconclusive and hugely costly Hamilton beef tribunal. Thankfully, the tribunal of inquiry process was salvaged and rehabilitated by the report of the McCracken tribunal into payments to Charles Haughey and Deputy Michael Lowry. The report was brief, delivered in straightforward unadorned language and its recommendations were clear and to the point. Both the Moriarty tribunal and the Flood tribunal are instruments of the Oireachtas, established by the Oireachtas and commissioned to report back to us. We wish Mr. Justice Flood and his team continued success in their work and we await <Col N="1246" /> anxiously the fruits of their deliberations. I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Members, I will contribute briefly to this debate. On behalf of the Labour Party, I welcome the Bill and indicate to the Minister and the House that we will support it. It is important that we take this opportunity to pay tribute to the work of the tribunals in doing a painful and difficult task for this country. It is painful because it has consequences for public confidence in the administration of public systems and in politics and public affairs generally. Like many of the revealing investigations in recent years, it is a necessary cathartic event that will allow people in the longer term to renew their confidence and know that anyone who holds public office or has authority will have it at the behest of the people, in the name of the people, for the good of the people and not for personal gain.</P>
      <P>As other Members have said, there was a degree of scepticism, concern and a concerted attempt by many to undermine the work of this tribunal and to disparage the work of Mr. Justice Flood in particular. That went on for a very long time. I, together with others, issued statements of support that it was important that the painstaking work of gathering evidence be allowed to take place without interference. That has finally proven to be a worthy and appropriate path to follow. Mr. Justice Flood has recently won very broad approval from across the media and community generally.</P>
      <P>He is about to reach the normal retirement age of 72 years for High Court judges. To take on the job of correlating vast volumes of data and information, to put in order a tribunal of inquiry that by its very terms of reference is broad, far-reaching and complicated is a daunting task. However, for it to be done in a way that is obviously bearing fruit and for him to get behind what we believe to be impenetrable positions of some of the witnesses who have come before it, is a great testament to the painstaking research engaged in by the sole member of the tribunal and his legal team to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures mentioned in the Bill in relation to remuneration sound large but, when put in context, if Mr. Justice Flood was not the presiding officer and sole member of the tribunal but was instead a representative lawyer at the tribunal, the sums of money he would earn would be many times the amounts of money now being provided to pay him. There is an anomaly that those who argue for their clients will be paid substantially more than the person responsible for sifting the evidence, ordering the tribunal and steering a course to a conclusion that gets to the truth. I have no reluctance in supporting the remuneration package but, notwithstanding legal independence, we need to re-examine the costs accrued to the taxpayer from legal fees. Whatever cap we have put on them, they are still out of kilter with <Col N="1247" /> people's expectation of remuneration for work done.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain the remuneration available to him? He said that these payments will be made immediately on the judge's retirement on 9 July and that his total remuneration &ndash; pension and salary &ndash; will continue at the level of a High Court judge for the duration of his chairmanship of the tribunal. Does that mean that he will be paid a reduced salary and brought up by virtue of the pension to which he is entitled? The Bill only provides for pension and not for salary. What salary will be paid and how will it be paid when he will not be a High Court judge having reached retirement age? How is it proposed that the total sum will reach the level of a High Court judge for the duration of his stewardship of the tribunal? </P>
    <P>I support the Bill and I wish the tribunal well. I hope it will not take as long as the Minister envisages when he talks about the broad terms of reference, and that a conclusion can be reached more swiftly. Whatever time is required, however, must be granted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roche touched upon issues which have been the subject of debate in the Committee on Members' Interests. While many of us had a similar outlook on standing ethics committees, most of us, having investigated a standing ethics committee in another jurisdiction, changed our views. We visited New South Wales and examined the Independent Commission Against Corruption &ndash; ICAC &ndash; a permanent standing committee. The results of that committee were anything but startling. The degree of corruption uncovered was limited and the suspicion its existence caused was disproportionate. It had an enormous budget and a huge permanent staff and to justify those it had to uncover corruption. It was involved in all sorts of investigations of dubious public value.</P>
    <P>The Starr committee in the USA proved that bodies with an open chequebook, open investigative powers and no set remit do not prove to be as valuable as we would like. We need a structure which can be called into being when there is work to be done rather than setting up an elaborate, well resourced structure which sets out like a witch finder.</P>
    <P>The Deputy made a valuable suggestion about multiple member tribunals. The Tribunal of Inquiries Act did not envision sole member tribunals but they have been the norm to date. We have not suffered from that approach but it would be worth considering multiple members when a tribunal is being given a very broad remit, although I hope we will not need any more tribunals. The initiative taken by the Committee on Public Accounts in taking an investigative role upon itself, and the granting of compellability powers to committees, will change the dynamic of this House and it will no longer be dependent on external agencies to investigate matters of difficulty. If we change our own procedures to bring about more openness and accountability, the <Col N="1248" /> need for external tribunals will be abated. The responses given by the Minister for Finance in the House today, however, were the antithesis of the transparency one would hope to achieve and I regret that was the case.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party supports this Bill and wishes the judge well. I hope we can have a conclusion to his deliberations that will put a framework in place to renew public confidence in the administration of this State.</P>

      <P>This Bill is essential as Mr. Justice Flood approaches retirement age. Introducing it to regularise the situation is important and the Fine Gael Party supports it. Everyone agrees that the work of Mr. Justice Flood has been vital and he has helped uncover serious corruption in planning in Dublin and further afield. The tribunal has taken a long time because the work required a great deal of research and investigation. The achievements so far and those still to come are something for which Mr. Justice Flood and the entire team attached to the tribunal deserve our congratulations.</P>
      <P>Tribunals will be part and parcel of life and, although they might take different forms, human nature dictates they will continue. On page 241 of &ldquo;Meanwhile Back at the Ranch&rdquo; by Fintan O'Toole, in a chapter entitled &ldquo;Democracy&rdquo;, there is a quotation of a statement made by Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton during the beef tribunal.</P>
      <P>He stated:</P>
      <P>I think that if the questions that were asked in the Dáil were answered in the way they are answered here, there would be no necessity for this inquiry and an awful lot of money and time would have been saved.</P>
      <P>I refer to Mr. Justice Hamilton's comments, because during the period in question Mr. Barry Desmond, Mr. Pat O'Malley and Deputies Des O'Malley, Dukes, John Bruton and others tabled questions but they were not furnished with sufficient information or encountered difficulties in obtaining replies.

      <P>I appreciate that. My point is that the Bill relates to Mr. Justice Fergus Flood and similar Bills may be introduced in the House on foot of the appointment of other judges. The inquiries to which I refer are essential and the sooner the House examines ways to amend Standing Orders to allow questions to be asked and answered accurately, the better. By high<Col N="1249" /> lighting this issue, I am seeking to ensure that the Ceann Comhairle and his staff are authorised and given the requisite powers under Standing Orders to compel Ministers to provide true and accurate answers to parliamentary questions. If Ministers are obliged to prove that the replies they give are accurate, we will ensure that further tribunals will not be necessary.</P>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me a degree of latitude in respect of the comments I made on this important matter. I regret that the point made by Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton has not yet been addressed by the House. I hope we will have the courage to ensure that it is addressed because it will save us the trouble of establishing further tribunals and committees.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Mr. Justice Flood on the job he is doing at the tribunal. It is important that he be allowed to remain in his position after his retirement as a judge and that he receives proper recompense. It is appropriate that we are debating this Bill this evening, particularly given that a great deal of the business of the House today was devoted to discussing judges.</P>
      <P>Mr. Justice Flood will receive a large sum of money on foot of the enactment of the Bill. This House does great work in catering for the interests of people in every section of society, with the exception of Deputies, Ministers and Senators. We are afraid to make provision for ourselves. I earn between £38,000 and £39,000 per year but Mr. Justice Flood will receive a pension of £45,715 per year. As Deputies, we rely on the people to pay our salaries. If matters had come to a head earlier today and a general election had been called, we might have been facing an interview board of our peers in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Enright, the Committee of Public Accounts should deal with matters such as those currently under investigation at the tribunals. The House should give the necessary powers to that committee and to the Ceann Comhairle's office, which also has a part to play in this area. We should not be too eager to relinquish our powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts, which was responsible for carrying out the inquiry into DIRT, must be given additional resources. If that committee had access to the resources Mr. Justice Flood had at his disposal, the necessary staff, etc., and was given legal powers to compel witnesses to appear, results would be forthcoming. People believed that the Flood tribunal would be nothing more than a talking shop, that it would incur major costs and that it would not achieve results. <Col N="1250" /> Those people have been proved wrong and I compliment Mr. Justice Flood and his staff on the wonderful job they are doing.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Flood tribunal will be obliged to remain in place for much longer because the people who were trying to hinder and belittle it by refusing to give evidence are now aware that Mr. Justice Flood will not allow further delays. Anyone who tries to hinder the tribunal can be brought before the courts. In my opinion the tribunal's work will proceed apace because those who come before it will be aware that if they are asked a question they must provide an answer. If it is discovered that they are telling lies, they will be dealt with by the courts and they could be imprisoned.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Flood has done a good job on behalf of the State and its people. I welcome the fact that his pension will be increased and that he will be allowed to remain in his position after his retirement as a judge because it is important that the tribunal be allowed to conclude its work. It is also important that taxpayers can see that the system works, in the form of this tribunal. When the current inquiries reach their conclusions, I hope there will not be a need to establish further tribunals.</P>
    <P>Those involved with the inquiry process, particularly politicians, have learned lessons from it because they might be obliged to answer in 20 years time for something which might happen now. A number of politicians who appeared before the Flood tribunal believed that because they had left public life they would not be called to account for their actions. However, these people will be obliged to pay the penalty. I do not know what will be the nature of the penalties they will incur, that is for the law to decide.</P>
    <P>I compliment Mr. Justice Flood on the job he has done. However, it is time we gave the Committee of Public Accounts the resources, funding and staff it requires to allow it to carry out future inquiries. There is no doubt that there will be a need to hold inquiries in the future into bribery, the planning process, decisions taken by Ministers and other matters.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that Mr. Justice Flood will be paid a pension of £45,715. It is not popular to say so but if, in the past, politicians had been paid proper wages and adequately reimbursed in respect of the expenses they incurred, there would probably have been no need to establish the tribunals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their constructive contributions. The Bill is short and contains only two sections, the intent of which is specific. We should focus our attention solely on that intent. We are discussing a unique situation where a judge, instead of retiring in the normal way, has agreed in the public interest, to continue to chair a very important tribunal of inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions apply only to one judge of the High Court and there is no question of their applying to any other serving judges of that court. <Col N="1251" /> It is also important to point out that it is impossible to say at this stage how long the tribunal's deliberations will last. No one seems to know, but I estimate that the tribunal could be in place for a number of years. However, It can certainly be stated that it is likely to remain in operation for a considerable period.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, Mr. Justice Flood has demonstrated great commitment in agreeing to oversee the completion of this work in the interests of continuity. The tribunal team has carried out its core work in a very effective way. While being involved in various types of litigation, it has assiduously followed the main lines of inquiry, in modular form, aimed at moving the process forward as efficiently as possible.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will agree that the chairman's role has been crucial. Since the tribunal began its work almost three years ago, it has sifted through an enormous amount of written material and spent many days hearing evidence from witnesses. This work has been carried out under the stewardship of the honourable Mr. Justice Flood and his team and they deserve our thanks. The Bill before the House is the Government's practical response to an individual effort and a personal commitment on the part of Mr. Justice Flood in respect of an important area of public affairs. The State can be justly proud of the contribution the Judiciary has made and continues to make in terms of its day to day work on the Bench and in the inquiries and tribunals which, regrettably, are now part of the process of trying to arrive at the truth in certain matters of public concern.</P>
    <P>On the specific issue of pensions, the reality is that many judges take up duty on the Bench relatively late in their careers with the result that some of them do not accrue the number of years' service required to receive the maximum pension entitlements under the judicial pensions scheme. It is sometimes forgotten that people who serve on the Bench would have been much wealthier had they remained at the Bar. Their income at the Bar when they reach the stage of eminence at which they would be entitled to be appointed as High Court or Supreme Court judges would be far higher than what they would receive as High Court or Supreme Court judges. This fact is often overlooked and should be acknowledged.</P>
    <P>In the particular case which is the subject of this legislation, the judge in question is just over six years short of the necessary 15 years' service which would entitle him to a full pension. He has agreed, at the request of the Government, to continue as chairman of the tribunal until its work is completed and this should be responded to in a realistic manner. This Bill is being introduced to deal with an individual case and does not affect other judges. The arrangements provided for in the Bill are well deserved and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Howlin's query on how the income will be made up while Mr. Justice Flood <Col N="1252" /> is chairman of the tribunal, Mr. Justice Flood will receive his pension of £45,715 for each year he continues to serve as chairman of the tribunal, in addition to which he will receive a top-up income of £45,750 to bring his income up to the equivalent level of a High Court judge. His total annual income, therefore, will be £91,430 for his tenure as chairman of the tribunal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Bill only deals with pensions, the legal position following the date on which the judge reaches his 72nd birthday is that he will simply be entitled to the pension of £45,715. I was somewhat concerned about where the balance of the money would come from. The Minister explained that it was a top-up payment and I was curious about the legal basis on which his Department could issue such a payment given that the original appointment of the sole member of the tribunal and his salary derived from his position as a High Court judge, a position he will no longer hold when he reaches the statutory retirement age. I now understand that the top-up payment will be paid by way of a consultative payment from the Department of the Environment and Local Government. I am concerned that there is not any statutory basis for that arrangement.</P>
      <P>Has Mr. Justice Flood agreed a contractual arrangement for the duration of his tenure? If so, will that contract be adjusted as changes in pension entitlements accrue or will automatic adjustments in the remuneration payable on a consultancy basis be made if there is a change in the remuneration paid to High Court judges? Will this issue be dealt with by means of an amendable contract; has a contract been signed and will that be provided for in the Vote for the Department of the Environment and Local Government? </P>

      <P>The pension provisions are quite clear but there is a failure to specify in the Bill the means by which the pension will be topped-up to the level of a serving High Court judge. That matter is not clarified in either section of the Bill. Does the Minister propose to enshrine this in legislation and, if so, how, or is this an entirely separate matter? It would be preferable to provide for the payment of the pension and the necessary top-up payment to the salary level of a High Court judge in the legislation.</P>

      <P>This legislation deals with the pension payable by the State to a specific judge from 9 July. The amount of that pension will be the amount the judge would receive had he the full 15 years' service. Mr. Justice Flood is just over six and a half years short of that service. <Col N="1254" /> This legislation provides that Mr. Justice Flood will be deemed to have full service in order that, from 9 July, he will be entitled to a pension of £45,715 for the rest of his life when he retires.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation only deals with the pension, not with the other matter raised by Deputies Howlin and Enright. To my knowledge, no contract exists between the Department of the Environment and Local Government and Mr. Justice Flood, nor is there a contract between Mr. Justice Flood and the Department of Finance. Obviously, the money which will be paid by way of a top-up to Mr. Justice Flood will be paid from the central fund to the Departments of Finance and the Environment and Local Government which, in turn, will pay Mr. Justice Flood.</P>
      <P>Deputy Howlin asked if a contract exists. Deputy Enright expressed the view that there should be one. I do not believe there is a contract or a need for one. The Department of the Environment and Local Government will be in a position to make the necessary top-up payment to Mr. Justice Flood on a consultancy basis. I understand separate legislation or a contract are not needed because this will occur in the normal way. I do not know how to make that a cast iron certainty. I can only act in good faith and assure the House that this is my understanding of the matter. I have no reason to believe the Minister for the Environment and Local Government or any of his successors would behave differently. Members of this and, I am sure, any subsequent Government would like to see the work of the tribunal continue and be brought to a conclusion. The public expects the Government to ensure the tribunal can continue its work unhindered and would not countenance an attempt by a Minister to prevent it completing its work or place obstacles in its way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's good faith. He has said the pension, with a top-up to bring the total remuneration up to that of a High Court Judge, will be paid in the normal way. However, this is a unique situation requiring special legislation so there cannot be a normal way. For safety sake and to avoid ambiguity a short amendment is desirable. The Opposition will co-operate with the Minister in drafting such an amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill deals with pensions. When Mr. Justice Flood reaches his 72nd birthday next month his income will be halved. I accept the Minister's assurance that this will be addressed by an arrangement whereby the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will pay a consultancy fee sufficient to bring Mr. Justice Flood's salary up to the level of a High Court judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contractual nature of this arrangement should be addressed. When a person is paid a <Col N="1255" /> consultancy fee by a Department, this is done on a contractual basis as normal accounting mechanisms require. When consultants are appointed by committees of the House, for example, the terms of their appointment are clearly defined for clarity and the avoidance of doubt. How will the adjustment in pension affect the top-up payment and will the adjustment in the actual rate of payment to judges automatically be reflected in the adjusted top-up payment? Would it not be better for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which is the paying Department of the sole member of the tribunal until the date of his retirement and half the paying Department after that date, to carry that contractual arrangement? Could this not be expressed by a measure stating that for the duration of the tribunal, a sum of money sufficient to bring the remuneration of the sole member to the level of a serving High Court judge will be payable from public funds?</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Flood would require clarity on this issue. Because it would probably be distasteful for him to negotiate these matters we bear a responsibility to look after his interests, particularly having regard to the praise we have heaped upon him. Has the sole member of the tribunal been spoken to and is the Minister assured that he is happy with the proposed arrangements?</P>

The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is sponsoring the Bill but the payment of pensions to members of the Judiciary is done through the Central Fund. This is because we jealously maintain the independence of the Judiciary from the Executive.</P>

      <P>The Garda would be conscious of security on a regular basis with regard to people such as Mr. Justice Flood. I am absolutely certain they would take the necessary steps if his personal security or any other aspect of his security was threatened. A High Court judge is not entitled to a State car. To the best of my knowledge, only the Chief Justice, among the judiciary, is entitled to this. A judge such as Mr. Justice Flood would, in the normal course of events, be driven by the court usher in his own car. That is the way in which it normally works and it has been working fairly well and to the best of my knowledge now &ndash; so has the car.</P>

I accept what the <Col N="1257" /> Minister has stated, that a matter of that nature is monitored by the Garda Síochána. In this instance, the Minister's Department should consult the Garda Síochána as to transport for the judge, not just to and from the tribunal, but on a regular basis.

The Garda have a considerable amount of experience in dealing with issues of security for judges, in particular, the members of the Special Criminal Court, who were monitored on a regular basis. I do not like to draw comparisons like that, because to be fair to everybody concerned, I have no information that Mr. Justice Fergus Flood's security is threatened.</P>

      <P>I did not think I would regain possession this evening with the way things were shaping up. I was making the point that I hoped Roscommon town, the only town from my constituency eligible under this town renewal scheme, would receive approval when it came before the Minister for the Environment and Local Government after the enactment of this Bill. I hope this Bill will pass through the House very swiftly.</P>
      <P>The people of Roscommon town were very disappointed that their town was not included in the rural renewal scheme or in the previous urban renewal scheme. Roscommon town was considered for the original urban renewal scheme, although it did not the meet the criteria of having a population of 5,000. Its exclusion had a detrimental effect on Roscommon town because within four miles of the town, the rural renewal scheme covers three quarters of my constituency, all of County Longford, and all of North Roscommon to within a couple of miles of Roscommon town. The previous urban renewal schemes had been a huge success in Roscommon town, but there is a disadvantage in the urban renewal scheme in Athlone as many financial resources have been moving out of Roscommon town and the southern half of County Roscommon into either the urban renewal scheme in Athlone or the rural renewal scheme in Longford and North Roscommon. I hope the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will ensure that Roscommon town will be included in this because it has been a success in the past.</P>
      <P>The idea behind this Bill is very welcome. While the previous speakers have voiced some criticism, I wholeheartedly welcome it because there had been a huge disadvantage for towns with a population under 5,000. They were being starved of resources because the large towns were receiving urban renewal designation and money that may have been invested in the smaller towns and villages was being moved to the larger population centres, thus making the smaller towns reduce in size and lose further population. Many of these towns which we are discussing which fit these criteria are in the less developed parts of rural Ireland. This is a huge hindrance to them in attracting industrial investment or in trying to rejuvenate the population and the local economy. Consequently, this is very positive and vitally important legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 1 defines the eligibility criteria for this scheme. When the Department of the Environment and Local Government originally published the list of eligible towns, it must have mis<Col N="1259" /> sed its geography lesson at school because they included Ballyleague-Lanesboro which was already designated under the rural renewal scheme, as it crossed the river Shannon. However, Monksland, a town in my constituency, which was eligible, was omitted. Its population met the criterion laid down in this regard. Investment is needed there because there has been a dramatic increase in residential development in the area but the infrastructure to complement it has never been put in place. The local authority was the big offender because it sold large tracts of land and built housing without even providing enough space for a soccer pitch. The town's population is approximately 2,000 and yet it does not have such a basic facility. Although it is a relatively young town if it were designated under the scheme, the recreational infrastructure, which is vitally important to such communities, could be provided and the area could be rejuvenated. However, parts of it already need these incentives. I hope when the Department reviews the scheme it will seriously examine the merits of Monksland and include it together with the other 102 towns designated under the current scheme.</P>
    <P>One of the main objectives of the scheme is to increase the number of housing units in small towns. It is a positive development but there will be a move away from the rented sector because of the new initiatives announced last week by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. This sector will be covered by the scheme but those who provide accommodation units will still charge young couples or students through the nose because the going rate will be sought for other residential units which are not covered under the scheme and this will increase dramatically following the enactment of this legislation. I do not envisage a net benefit for the consumer at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>The developer is only one who will benefit. He will not be liable under the provisions of the financial resolution agreed by the House last week or new proposals from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government but he will be able to charge increased prices for accommodation. Capping the cost of rented accommodation and the introduction of legislation regarding security of tenure should be examined seriously. These issues are fundamentally important in terms of this legislation because new residential units are its backbone.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers felt it was positive that the urban renewal scheme provided a facelift to many towns and villages which had been in a dilapidated state for years and it was great that unsightly ESB cables were placed underground, streets and footpaths were resurfaced and communities were given a lift. Community involvement of a financial nature was necessary for the scheme to succeed because it afforded the locals an opportunity to make an input and have a commitment to its development. However, it is fundamentally wrong that every town and village which <Col N="1260" /> qualified under this scheme and carried out works looks the same. They have become clones of each other. Similar public lighting and street furniture was used and the unique character of many of these communities has changed. Driving through a village in County Roscommon is similar to driving through any one throughout Ireland. That is a huge disappointment. The local authorities did not use any imagination when they drew up these schemes to provide a unique character to the towns and villages which were designated.</P>
    <P>Section 3(3) provides for what the Minister must have regard to in deciding the towns which will be designated. It refers to sustainable patterns and the enhancement of amenities. It was a missed opportunity on the part of the Department not to include Monksland because there is a great need for the provision of amenities. I ask the Department, even at this late stage, to review the criteria it laid down and the towns it designated under the scheme. Two towns in County Roscommon were deemed eligible originally by the Department and then after it realised one had already been designated under the rural renewal scheme, only one town was considered eligible. It is a pity that Monksland, which is located on the periphery of Athlone, was not considered.</P>
    <P>Section 3(7) outlines a range of objectives which should be included in the town renewal plans. This is a positive development because over the years the local authorities used county development plans to prepare schemes for various localities and all they ever did was draw lines on a map to decide which area should be designated industrial, commercial or residential but they never implemented a structured plan for towns on a street by street basis. This scheme forces local authorities to point out exactly where the town centres will be and how towns will be planned in terms of traffic management and so on. Local authorities should be obliged to do something similar under county development plans. They should outline how they see towns developing on a street by street basis and what provisions they propose to make towards this work.</P>
    <P>The town renewal plans also refer to the density of the development. This infuriates me because local authorities in many rural counties are using the densities laid down in the Bacon report as the criteria for development. The report specifically refers to towns and cities where there is great demand for accommodation, such as Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick, yet other local authorities appear to adopt similar density criteria for rural areas, which is completely ludicrous. For example, if one leaves Galway and drives through villages along the Tuam Road one will see apartment buildings which are completely out of sync with the rest of the architecture. It is ludicrous that three and four storey apartment buildings are erected on the edge of a village thus destroying the character that has been there for generations. Under the criteria of the new scheme, housing units must be built, but local <Col N="1261" /> authorities fail to examine the visual and environmental impact on communities. This also relates to sustainable development which must be addressed in the proposals submitted. Both matters are linked. It is an education to look at some of the high density developments on the outskirts of Dublin. Please God I will be proved wrong, but I have no doubt that some day a tragedy will be caused by some of these high density developments. Blanchardstown is an area of the city I know quite well. Over the past couple of years new housing estates have been constructed there thereby increasing the population density dramatically.</P>
    <P>Developers have not made adequate provision for parking and, consequently, narrow streets at the back of estates are lined on both sides with private and commercial vehicles. This occurs also because much of the accommodation is rented out and, thus, there could be four people in a house, each with a car, but only one vehicle can fit in the driveway so the rest have to be parked in the street. If, God forbid, there was a fire in such an estate, it would be extremely difficult for any fire engine to gain access to the blaze. One can imagine the consternation if the fire crew had to knock on every door to get the occupants to move their cars so the fire engine could approach a burning house. Such issues are not considered in the debate on housing density, yet there is a need to increase density in Dublin.</P>
    <P>We must examine the issue in a feasible way and discover how to increase density while improving the layout of new estates. We will have to devise new types of layout for such estates so that we will not end up creating ghettos. We must provide the recreational facilities mentioned in section 3(3), which are of fundamental importance to the debate on the Bill. Housing density is becoming a hugely controversial topic in many rural counties where local authorities are increasing parts of estates which were completed years ago and the new developments can be completely out of character with the earlier buildings.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will ensure that EU approval is obtained for the commercial incentives relating to the legislation before the Bill is enacted, instead of leaving it on the long finger as was done with the western development fund and the rural renewal scheme which was dragged out for ages. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I support the main thrust of the Bill. Over the last 15 years we have seen the successes of many urban and rural renewal schemes which have been in place across the length and breadth of the country. Urban renewal has played an important role in revitalising our main cities, and rural renewal programmes have assisted in <Col N="1262" /> developing many rural areas. In the broader context we have witnessed the country's economic success in recent years. The annual growth rate is close to 10% and unemployment is falling. In Limerick, since June 1997, unemployment has fallen by over 4,000.</P>
      <P>However, balanced regional development is a core political objective of the Government. Renewing our larger cities, while serving an important valuable economic function, should not be the sole focus for the Government's physical renewal programmes. The purpose of the Bill is to provide a framework for a new town renewal scheme aimed at the physical renewal of smaller towns with a population ranging from 500 and 6,000. The scheme, which will be tax incentive based, is aimed at revitalising smaller towns, promoting sustainable development and fostering rural development programmes. It has at its core the need to combat dereliction and deprivation in such areas.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State responsible for housing, Deputy Molloy, said on 8 June, our smaller towns have had to cope with and adapt to much economic and technological change. Fairs and traditional markets have been consigned to history and the result of all this has been a decline in the core areas of our towns. People have found it more attractive to move to the surrounding countryside. Many rural town centres should not function as service centres alone. That is why it is the Government's intention to follow the success of urban renewal schemes which have already been put in place.</P>
      <P>The new town renewal scheme is tax incentive based and will seek to stimulate private investment in the revitalisation of areas which would not otherwise have attracted such investment. There will be a particularly strong emphasis on refurbishment and tackling key infill sites. The new conservation measures which have been introduced by the Government will also help to complement and underpin the efforts of county councils in meeting the objectives of their own town renewal plans.</P>
      <P>The new scheme must also be viewed in the broader context of spatial planning policy, housing and infrastructural development. The National Development Plan, 2000-2006, has mandated the Department of the Environment and Local Government to prepare such a national spatial strategy which must be finalised by next year. The scheme will also dovetail with other initiatives, such as the rural towns and villages initiative which, over the next three years, will provide substantial investment in essential public water and sewerage facilities for smaller urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government recognises that it is time to look at the unique features of our smaller towns and to preserve and conserve our older buildings. It is important to realise the potential of these places as vibrant living and working communities. <Col N="1263" /> These plans will provide a quality framework for the conservation and rejuvenation of these towns.</P>
    <P>The tax incentive approach which has been so successfully implemented in many urban renewal programmes over the past 15 years must now be employed in smaller towns. A total of 102 town renewal plans have been received by the Department of the Environment and Local Government for its consideration. As a TD representing the constituency of Limerick West, I will be supporting the applications for town renewal status that have already been forwarded to the Department by Abbeyfeale, Kilmallock, Croom, Rathkeale and Castleconnell. The 102 town renewal plans are currently being analysed by an established expert advisory panel and an announcement of the special tax designations will be made in early July.</P>
    <P>Section 1 indicates the requirements determining eligibility under the scheme. A town must have a population of between 500 and 6,000 as contained in the most recently published census as well as meeting some other conditions. Towns in areas designated under the 1999 urban renewal scheme, the seaside resort scheme, the rural renewal scheme and towns in certain administered counties are now eligible to participate in this new scheme. That is only right and proper and this provision will be supported by most parties in the House.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that county councils, when selecting towns for the purposes of preparing a town renewal plan, must have regard to such criteria specified in writing by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. In specifying these criteria, they must have regard to the need for the promotion of physical renewal and revitalisation of towns, the promotion of towns as cultural, commercial, social and residential centres, the promotion of sustainable development patterns and the enhancement of the towns' amenities, heritage and environment.</P>
    <P>Section 8(3) provides that a county council may consult with interested parties when forwarding such town renewal plans to the Government. I congratulate Limerick County Council for the widespread consultation which it has had with many interested parties in Limerick on these matters.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that a town renewal plan may contain or be accompanied by recommendations that a part or parts of the area to which the plan relates shall be a qualifying area for the purposes of town renewal relief. These latter reliefs relate to expenditure on the conversion of existing buildings for use as rented residential accommodation, expenditure on the refurbishment of a house for use as rented residential accommodation and allowances to owner occupiers in respect of certain expenditure on the construction or refurbishment of residential accommodation.</P>
    <P>The county council must have regard to certain criteria in making any recommendations con<Col N="1264" /> tained in or accompanying a town renewal plan. These criteria are consistency between the types of development likely to be carried out in the areas to which the recommendations relate and relevant objectives of the plan; significance of the recommendations for obtaining the objectives of the plan; market conditions in the area or areas concerned in relation to the supply of and anticipated demand for the relevant types of development and the nature and extent of any impediments to the carrying out of the relevant types of development.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the monitoring of the implementation of town renewal plans and the reporting of the results of such monitoring to the Minister. County councils will be required to put in place appropriate arrangements for monitoring the implementation of any town renewal plan in accordance with any guidelines that the Minister may issue from time to time for the purposes of this section.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that it is not possible at this stage to estimate the cost to the Exchequer of the tax reliefs that will apply under this new scheme. This cannot be done until decisions are taken on the extent of the areas to be designated, the mix of incentives to be applied in each case and the take up of the scheme in the various towns selected. However, the Government is committed to the town renewal programme. It will not be lacking in forwarding the necessary financial resources to ensure that this nationwide town renewal programme is a true and real success. The new scheme will boost the construction industry and long-term employment opportunities in the areas that benefit.</P>
    <P>Moreover, from my perspective in Limerick, such schemes will also boost tourism in the region and complement the substantial provisions in the Government's national development plan to improve the economic infrastructure of the county over the next seven years. I commend the Bill in its entirety to the House.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford)</i>
        <b>:</b> I thank Deputy Collins for sharing time. I particularly welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate because the concept of the small town renewal scheme originated in Wexford County Council three years ago when a former councillor, Rory Murphy, put forward a proposal which was unanimously passed by the council. Following this, there were a number of consultations with the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, where he and the council group discussed how the scheme could become operational. I express my compliments and thanks to former councillor, Rory Murphy, who was always thinking of similar ideas. He had a great interest in small rural towns in County Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The urban renewal scheme has been a success story in Wexford and Enniscorthy. New Ross was recently received an allocation and the scheme has revitalised larger towns which were dormant. There is dereliction and decay in many smaller <Col N="1265" /> towns throughout the country. Without tax incentives, many people would not be in a position to renovate properties. The scheme will give an opportunity to business people and others living in smaller towns to restore former glories. These towns are mainly small market towns which were successful in the past. However, for various economic reasons, they fell into decay. Undoubtedly, towns with populations between 500 and 6,000 will experience the same success as a result of tax incentives under the town renewal scheme. People want to undertake developments and ensure their towns grow.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is due to the Celtic tiger, but if one travels around the country now, one will see new shops in many small villages where enterprises closed down ten or 15 years ago. A number of small supermarkets have opened in my area. There are also three new pubs in three villages close to my area which never had pubs in the past. This is a sign of the economic growth taking place and the confidence in the country. Perhaps it is also a sign of the large amount of money that publicans make, but it is good to see new facilities in villages.</P>
    <P>A number of towns in County Wexford were put forward at a county council meeting. The National Building Agency, in conjunction with the senior executive planning officer, prepared the groundwork and identified the priority towns for inclusion in the scheme by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. While the county manager had an executive function in this matter, he was not foolish enough to make the decision on his own. He involved the NBA, the senior executive planning officer and all 21 councillors.</P>
    <P>They had an opportunity to debate at council level the recommendations of the planning officer. When the NBA report was completed, they examined the four towns which were eventually selected, Taghmon, Ferns, Bunclody and Gorey. The elected members met the NBA and had an opportunity to adjust and include areas. We had a say in how a village or town should be developed under the town renewal scheme.</P>
    <P>There was full consultation and occasionally the discussions with the National Building Agency were heated and frank. The agency's experts prepared the minute detail, but the elected members had much more experience of what was needed in the different towns. The selection of Bunclody, Gorey, Taghmon and Ferns was eventually submitted to the Department. They are now being evaluated and it is a good mix because Gorey is one the larger towns in the county while Taghmon is smaller. The towns of Ferns and Bunclody are historic. Ferns is one of the most historic towns in Ireland and there is tremendous scope for development there under the town renewal scheme.</P>
    <P>Representatives of community committees in the four towns have been in regular contact with me and other Wexford Deputies. They want to <Col N="1266" /> know when the scheme will come on stream because they have plans and ambitions. While the Celtic tiger is roaring they want their towns to be developed. We do not want a situation where larger towns, such as Enniscorthy, New Ross and Wexford, develop quickly &ndash; they are probably being overdeveloped at present &ndash; but smaller towns are left behind.</P>
    <P>It is most important that decisions are made as quickly as possible with regard to the town renewal scheme. I am not familiar with towns in other counties but the 102 towns in respect of which proposals have been submitted to the Department may be on a par with the proposals from County Wexford. The Minister should approve the nomination of the towns as quickly as possible and allow local authorities, community groups and business people to get on with the job.</P>
    <P>We cannot afford to delay any longer at a time when we talk about rural development and keeping people in rural Ireland. People are moving out of smaller towns and rural areas and into larger towns where there are house building programmes. That is a pity because it is important to keep the rural parts of our counties vibrant and alive. This town renewal scheme will do that because once the tax incentives are put in place in towns such as Bunclody, Ferns and Taghmon, many house building programmes will start and local builders and developers will avail of the tax incentives to build houses on derelict and obsolete sites and to develop over the shop accommodation and commercial enterprises. That can only be good for a community.</P>
    <P>Wexford County Council has marked out the towns it believes should be selected based on the criteria the Minister has laid down, such as the attractiveness of a village or town, its tourism potential or the commercial life needed. A number of other areas were interested, such as Rosslare Harbour, Rosslare Strand, Kilmore and Castlebridge, all of which have a population of more than 500. However, the council was only allowed to submit a certain number of towns. Perhaps they will be given a similar opportunity in the future. I hope that when this scheme is successful it will be extended to other smaller towns around the country.</P>
    <P>Under the urban renewal scheme an area of a town is selected and developed but when representations are made about another area of the town which needs to be developed, the Minister is inclined to say it has had its share and it is time to move to another town. That is a pity because the larger towns of Wexford and Enniscorthy could benefit from another urban renewal scheme to complete the job started a number of years ago. We must be thankful for the fact the urban renewal scheme rejuvenated these towns which lay dormant for many years.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on taking this initiative which was talked about for a long time. The <Col N="1267" /> Minister and the two Ministers of State had the courage to take a stand in the interests of rural people. I am sure they will be well rewarded when this scheme is a total success in three years' time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. It is important to devise a scheme which will give many towns which have suffered over the years an opportunity of renewal. We were lucky that four towns, Portumna, Loughrea, Ballygar and Headford, were designated in County Galway, particularly in east Galway. These towns suffered as a result of the growth in places such as Galway city and its environs.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that under this scheme work will not be completed. If a person drives through a town designated under the urban renewal scheme, he or she should be able to see the impact of that renewal on the town. I am familiar with Loughrea. The problem is that many of the criteria for the major urban centres applies to this scheme. Smaller towns will not have the same number of derelict buildings or be in the same need of refurbishment as the larger urban areas. For that reason, I had hoped there would be a greater degree of flexibility in terms of the criteria for this scheme. I know the Minister will probably be more flexible as time passes when he sees the need for a continuation plan to carry on the work started.</P>
      <P>Many of us have seen old pictures and photographs of towns with which we are familiar and we remember the names of businesses or shops which always provided residential accommodation. These cannot be compared to the picture of modern towns. It is unfortunate that many towns have plastic hoardings, flashing signs and streetscapes which are not environmentally friendly. We should be thankful for some planners in many county councils. I compliment the planners in Galway County Council who, without schemes or legislation, often suggested to developers when applications were submitted to change the use of premises that they needed to move away from plastic hoardings and signs. They told them to be more conservative and to remember the streetscapes that were in towns in the past. We must appreciate the work done by many planners throughout the country who were forward thinking and imaginative.</P>
      <P>It is of little benefit to designate a small fragmented area of a town. Many town centres are dead because people have moved out and this creates problems, such as violence, litter and other social ills. It is important to give incentives to people to develop residential areas, as the Bill proposes to do, as distinct from commercial rented areas. The availability of money means there will be an incentive to change to commercial enterprises. We know the cost of office space per unit area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this issue. I know you have a personal interest in it following a parliamentary visit to the United States over the past few weeks when this issue was raised.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise this disturbing issue because a number of my parliamentary colleagues who were in the US a few weeks ago were informed by the Irish community of the major crisis being experienced by young Irish emigrants who had applied for Walsh visas. My party colleague, Deputy Creed, was told that a number of young Irish people who were recipients of a Walsh visa found themselves in a pitiful position after a few short weeks in the US. A number of articles have appeared in the <i>Irish Voice</i> outlining the problems experienced by people on a Walsh visa and it is clear from those articles that a number of Irish people have been exploited by US companies which have paid poor wages and provided appalling accommodation.</P>
      <P>This situation is made even more serious when one takes into account that Walsh visa recipients, who come from the Border region in the South and Northern Ireland, are also the unemployed, weaker and more vulnerable in our society. It is outrageous that we continue to highlight the major labour shortages here while allowing our people to participate in a scheme that sends some of them and their families to another jurisdiction to be exploited or paid slave wages.</P>
      <P>An article in the <i>Irish Voice</i>, written by Garry O'Sullivan, stated</P>
      <P>An official at the Emerald Isle Immigration Center (EIIC) in New York has claimed that the number of people leaving the Walsh visa program is now of &ldquo;crisis proportions&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Ann Marie Scanlon, Director of Development for the EIIC, said that the center is taking the unprecedented step of setting up a fund for the &ldquo;refugees&rdquo; from the program and that it would be asking for donations from the public to help those in need.</P>
      <P>Her comments came in a week when two Walsh Visas recipients slept rough in Central Park after a 40 hour trip from Colorado where they claim they were unfairly fired from the program.</P>
      <P>A third Walsh visa recipient also in Colorado alleges police were called to arrest him by his employers after a dispute over a pay check. His story has been backed up by a local journalist. All three men were employed by a five star hotel in Colorado Springs.</P>
      <P>The EIIC has been a critic of the implementation of Walsh Visa scheme since a Virginia company, Logicon, was appointed earlier this year by the State Department as the program co-ordinator . . .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently, Colorado is the second hub after <Col N="1268" /><Col N="1269" /> Washington for Walsh Visa applicants. The Walsh Visa program is part of the Irish Peace Process Cultural Training Program. The program, sanctioned by the federal government in 1998, hopes to bring 12,000 visiting Irish workers to the United States over the next three years.</P>
    <P>The jobs they participate in are intended to &ldquo;help participants develop a business and cultural skill base which can attract international and private investments to their local economies and help promote the economic regeneration of Northern Ireland and the Border counties of the Republic of Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>HOWEVER, there have been many problems, those in Colorado just the latest. Declan Keenan from Newry and Gerard Toland from Derry fled Colorado after their employment was terminated and were told that they would be flown home to Ireland. They hired a car to Denver and then took a 40-hour bus ride to New York. When their meager funds ran out, they took to sleeping in Central Park before seeking help from the Irish community.</P>
    <P>They are just some of the problems that the people who are participating in this scheme have experienced. The scheme was set up to help people who are vulnerable in our society go to the United States to gain experience which will enable them to return home and help progress the economies in their own areas, but that is not happening.</P>
    <P>I want to put three questions to the Government. I hope that an immediate investigation into these claims will be established. The Government should provide funding to all those participating in the visa programme who have and are encountering major difficulties in the US. Will the Government and the Department of Foreign Affairs investigate the reason this scheme allows a company called Logicon, which receives $3 million a year for the administration of the scheme&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Reynolds for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I will make some brief comments on the background to it.</P>
      <P>President Clinton signed into effect the Irish Peace Process Cultural and Training Programme Act of 1998 in October of that year. The key provisions of the measure, popularly known as the Walsh Visas Act because it was conceived and progressed by Congressman Walsh, can be summarised as follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1270" /> The Walsh visa programme is intended to contribute to the economic regeneration of Northern Ireland and the six Border counties of the Republic and, thereby, help to support peace and reconciliation. The programme targets mainly the long-term &ndash; at least three months &ndash; unemployed from both traditions as well as those who have been made redundant or received termination notices. Participants are directed towards career opportunities in industries that have been identified as having growth potential. The idea is that participants will return home having acquired skills which enable them to contribute towards economic regeneration and the peace process. The programme also entails assistance to participants in finding jobs on their return.</P>
    <P>The Act provides for admission to the US for a period of up to 36 months of a maximum of 4,000 persons per annum under the age of 35, inclusive of designated family members, from &ldquo;designated counties&rdquo;&ndash; these are, for this jurisdiction, Donegal, Sligo, Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim and Louth &ndash; for the purpose of receiving practical training, employment and the experience of co-existence and conflict resolution. The operating premise has been that the 4,000 might be divided in a ratio of 3:1 as between the North and the South.  As already stated, the programme is directed towards disadvantaged persons who are at a remove from the labour market. Three consecutive programme years are provided for.</P>
    <P>Arrangements in relation to the operation of the programme have been the subject of discussions between the US State Department and officials in Northern Ireland and this jurisdiction. It was agreed to commence in early 2000 with a pilot phase, which would test the feasibility and workability of the programme. In order to assess this, it was decided that there should be a review process at the end of the pilot phase.</P>
    <P>FÁS was designated to administer the programme in the Southern Border counties, while for the Northern counties the Training and Employment Agency of Northern Ireland discharges a similar role. FÁS involvement entails imparting some six weeks pre-departure training and assistance in relation to transit to the US and initial settling in costs for eligible participants. Incidentally, for those who are in normal employment separate arrangements, not involving FÁS or its Northern Ireland equivalents, apply.</P>
    <P>The US authorities have funded and put in place an administrator for the programme which, along with the State Department, has the remit of identifying job opportunities in the US, providing for linkage between participants and prospective employers, giving orientation and training pre-departure and on arrival in the US, and providing mentoring of participants in the US.</P>
    <P>Under the pilot phase, FÁS has imparted pre-departure training to 115 participants while the Training and Education Authority in Northern Ireland is understood to have given similar training to some 400 of its participants. The first group of participants arrived in the US at the end of <Col N="1271" /> March 2000. It comprised of 310 persons of whom 95 were from the Southern Border counties. Slightly more than half of the participants are located in the Washington DC area, while the rest are based in Colorado Springs. It is intended that the balance of those participants who have been given pre-departure training will leave for the US over the coming months.</P>
    <P>The <i>raison d'être</i> for having a pilot programme is to test the water as to the workability of a fully fledged programme. Teething difficulties can always be expected where an undertaking involves training, relocation to a new social-cultural environment, with logistical and other difficulties. There are initial indications that such may be the case in this instance and obviously, from what Deputy Gerry Reynolds has said, that is the case.</P>
    <P>FÁS, the Northern Ireland agencies and the US State Department will embark, over the coming days, on an extensive review of the operation of the pilot phase of the Walsh visa programme as has been agreed at the outset. This will cover all aspects of the pilot phase and will also take account of the experience of participants in the US. Only when this has been completed will it be possible to make a thorough and reasoned assessment of the programme.</P>
    <P>It will be seen from the foregoing that the US State Department is centrally involved in the process of reviewing the pilot phase of the Walsh visa programme. In light of what the Deputy said, I will ask my officials to investigate the details of the case he made and I will communicate with him.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Farm Development Services Scheme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for selecting this matter for the Adjournment and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development for coming into the House to reply.</P>
      <P>It was with a degree of regret and reluctance that I tabled this item for the Adjournment, but I did so out of a sense of frustration that I and many farmers in County Galway have experienced concerning matters I will relate to the Minister, to which I referred during a short conversation I had with him recently.</P>
      <P>I draw his attention to the fact that a litany of serious activities carried out in what appears to be an organised manner by the senior officer of the Galway FDS office is causing serious hardship to many farmers in County Galway. These matters date back a number of years. I will indicate my experience of matters brought to my attention by constituents and colleagues during the past three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first issue relates to a case in County Galway where the Department's regional inspector took it upon himself to investigate a REPS application which complied fully with the terms, conditions and criteria of the scheme, on the basis of an issue not related to the Department. The <Col N="1272" /> regional inspector decided that the applicant should be excluded from the scheme on tenuous grounds. The applicant took the Department to court and as a result the Department was ordered immediately to pay in full the grants due to the applicant.  Does the Minister consider that an efficient use of staff resources and taxpayers' money?</P>
    <P>There are also two cases, with which I am familiar, where the official intimidated and bullied REPS applicants out of the scheme by reducing payments in one case and by expulsion from the scheme in the other. These two applicants had complied fully with the terms and conditions of the scheme existing at that time.</P>
    <P>There are several similar cases well know to that official that were approved by him. In one such approved case pertinent information that would have resulted in a different outcome was conveniently ignored and he used his rules to put through and issue a payment on foot of the claim of an applicant who was ineligible to participate in the scheme under the rules the apply to it.  I am prepared to supply the Minister with the names and references of all cases I mentioned.</P>
    <P>Among the tactics employed in the cases to which I referred are changing the goal posts, when one condition would not stick, another new problem was found to deny the applicants concerned their entitlements; inordinate delays in responding to queries; the removal of material from files requested under the Freedom of Information Act; gross distortion of information on files from third parties in defence of the Department's position on applicants' claims, which was also brought to light as a result of information secured under the FOI Act; and the interrogation of third parties under false pretences.</P>
    <P>It has also come to my notice that a possible case involving discrimination on religious grounds has surfaced in the same office. Following representations by several elected representatives and by departmental officials, it was decided to pay the outstanding grant payments due immediately to the applicant concerned. The judgment of that official in that case does not befit the Civil Service of this State.</P>
    <P>With regard to staff morale in the Galway office, several staff members, who are farmers or whose family members are involved in farming, are currently or have recently been subject to the most vindictive and personalised investigation of their farming activities. In some cases, these investigations have carried on for years without conclusion. The people concerned consider the investigations are purely an exercise in control and subordination. &ldquo;Bullying&rdquo; and &ldquo;a power trip&rdquo; are among the terms that were used to describe them to me. It does not require a great imagination to understand what working in the Galway offices of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is like.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a few points on my dealings with the Department generally. I will preface my remarks by saying it is not surprising that the <Col N="1273" /> Department regularly features near the top of the Ombudsman's league table.</P>
    <P>I have been involved in a case appealed to the Department's appeal unit. I was invited by the principal officer to make an oral submission to the appeal unit on behalf of a constituent. It later transpired that a final decision of the appeal had been made some weeks previous to the oral hearing. In the same case an assistant principal who had made 12 separate comments on the file considered himself suitable to sit on that appeals board.</P>
    <P>I stress my raising this matter is not motivated by a personal grudge or party politics. I raise it purely in the interest of fair play and the good name of the Department. I call on the Minister to set up immediately an independent investigation into these matters and particularly the official concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the utmost confidence in my Department's ability to meet its obligation to deliver the various schemes in an efficient and fair manner consistent with the regulations set down by the European Commission and consistent with national rules.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy and the House that the everyday approach in my Department is to do everything possible to ensure that each and every farmer can obtain the maximum benefit from the schemes. I requested the Department to carry out a nationwide information campaign and meetings that were well attended were held some months ago to ensure farmers were apprised of the details of the various schemes so that they could obtain optimum payments under them.</P>
      <P>Payment under the variety of schemes available is central to securing on-farm viability and to the protection of farm incomes. It is also critical to maintaining rural populations as envisaged in the White Paper on Rural Development.</P>
      <P>In regard to the specific administrative procedures for the processing of payments, a number of mechanisms are built in to ensure uniform interpretation and application. The careful and considered approach taken is consistent and is common to all schemes and all counties. By way of illustration I will refer to some of the schemes. Applications for the rural environment protection scheme are examined by professional and technical staff in the FDS offices to ensure that they comply with the terms and conditions of the scheme. The examination includes relevant on-farm inspection in accordance with the regulations. In the case of the scheme for early retirement from farming, all new applications are examined by FDS professional staff and the requisite inspections are effected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme of installation aid for young farmers is administered in accordance with the procedures in place on a national basis. Under the scheme, an application and accompanying document is lodged in the local office of the farm development service. The file is then passed on to <Col N="1274" /> an inspector for detailed checking. At that stage if the application and accompanying documentation are found to be in order, a positive recommendation is made. If problems are identified or documents are omitted, the inspector contacts the applicant or the agricultural consultant involved to seek to address and resolve the matter. When and if a recommendation for payment is forwarded to the regional inspector, these are agreed and a sample is subjected to a supervisory check. The appropriate documents are then forwarded to the division where payment is authorised and issued to the applicant. This is the standard procedure countrywide.</P>
    <P>Applications under the on-farm investment schemes are also processed in all counties in accordance with standard practice. The scheme documents, which include the terms and conditions of the scheme, are available to each applicant. Detailed guidelines for processing applications are issued to all staff. When an application and accompanying documents are lodged in the local farm development services office of the Department, detailed checks are carried out by administrative and technical staff. If an application is deemed valid, an initial inspection is carried out and a scheme of work is prepared. Standard costings are used in the calculation of grants. The on-farm scheme of work is checked by supervising officers prior to issuing approval to applicants to commence work.</P>
    <P>When the Department has been notified that investments have been completed, a pre-payment inspection is carried out. If the investments are completed to the required specification, a calculation of the grant aid payment is prepared. Final checks by two supervising technical officers are then carried out before the project is recommended for payment. Further checks and on-site visits on a random sample of these processed applications are carried out by supervisory officers.</P>
    <P>The operation of my Department's schemes is always transparent and open and there is a cohesive and clear checking protocol in place. My officials consult regularly to ensure the uniform application of procedures nationally.</P>
    <P>While the various controls and inspections may sometimes be perceived as irksome, they are a fundamental component required by the European Commission and are vital in assuring the Commission and in meeting its stringent audit requirements. My Department's success record in this regard is evident in that the Commission by and large has approved the annual accounts of the schemes without correction.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department has always operated an open door walk in policy for all its clients, customers and farmers especially. Farmers can attend at their local FDS office to discuss any difficulty in regard to the schemes with a view to resolution in accordance with the procedures. In addition, there are a number of appeals arrangements in place and farmers who, following consultation with officials, still <Col N="1275" /> have difficulty, are advised of the appropriate appeals mechanisms available.</P>
    <P>In the scenario of processing payment to farmers of £1 billion annually, it is inevitable that there will be a number of difficult cases requiring effort with a view to resolution. It is the aim of my Department that the level of such cases will be low. I can assure the Deputy that procedures are being appraised on a continuing basis. Considerable emphasis has been placed on an improved customer service in recent years and, while the situation is not perfect, very considerable progress has been made. A uniform application of the regulations is a critical part of that customer service. If Deputy Burke passes on the specific complaints he mentioned, and the references, I will undertake to have them comprehensively examined and checked and to get back to him.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Disability Allowance.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs is not present. I am sure he has compelling engagements elsewhere and I appreciate and understand the calls that fall on a Minister at all times. However, is it coincidental that the Minister seems to be reluctant to come into the House to address Adjournment debates? I am disappointed. At this time, in the life of this parliament, Ministers would do well to address the subject matter of their respective Departments. I hope that will be taken on board by the Ministers who do not wish to address Adjournment debates.</P>
      <P>On the subject matter of this Adjournment debate, a practice has existed in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for some years, where a person who has qualified for a payment and is in receipt of that payment over a period of years, on reaching pension age transfers to old age pension. A different qualification process in terms of income and means might result in a lower rate of payment than that which they had enjoyed previously. In such cases the payment has always been given at the higher rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The practice at the moment in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is that a person who has been in receipt of the old-fashioned disabled person's maintenance allowance, which became disability allowance in recent years, and who wishes to transfer to old age pension on reaching pension age will find that he or she may be assessed under a means test that will give him or her a much lower rate of pension. There is one serious anomaly in this of which the Department and the Minister do not seem to be aware. It is that the undertaking given by the previous Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Minister of State at that Department to the effect that the changeover in respect of disabled person's maintenance allowance to the Department of Social, Community and Fam<Col N="1276" /> ily Affairs would not militate against the interests of those concerned, is not happening.</P>
    <P>I have cases in my constituency where a new means of assessment is being carried out on such applicants. If they are found to qualify for lower amounts on reaching pension age, having spent considerable time in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance, now disability allowance, it is deemed that they should receive the lower payment. That is an absolute disgrace. The Minister who is responsible should be ashamed of himself. I have spoken to him about this and he informed me he cannot do anything, that it is the deciding officer's decision. It is the Minister's responsibility. If he has not the guts to take that decision he should resign from his office. The reality is that all deciding officers' decisions are subject to check and cross-check. Everything is subject to the natural course of justice and every decision is subject to the practice established over the years in the Department. All decisions in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, as in many other Departments, are subject to social welfare law. What I suggest is in accordance with social welfare practice and established practice over several years. It is an absolute scandal that at a time when the Celtic tiger is roaring ahead at an unprecedented rate there should be such a begrudging attitude towards those who have serious disabilities, and who qualify for a payment on the basis of that disability, that they are treated in such a shabby fashion.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be personal about this. It has nothing to do with politics as a previous speaker said in relation to something else, but it is an insult to the House that the Minister is not present to reply to the debate. He should be here. That is his job and that is what he is extremely well paid for. Without disrespect to the Minister present who is doing a job and standing in, it is the responsibility of another Minister. I sincerely hope the indications of arrogance now appearing in this Administration are not sustained for too long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs called many things but I have not heard him called arrogant. I do not think the Deputy means it.</P>
      <P>The matters which are the subject of this debate are, as the Deputy is aware, related to the transfer of the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the transitional provisions which applied at the time of this transfer. Responsibility for the administration of the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme transferred from the health boards to the Department on 2 October 1996 when the allowance was renamed disability allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be fully aware that the operation of the former disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme was the subject of much <Col N="1277" /> criticism. The variation in the application process was one of a number of problems with the scheme which were highlighted by many Deputies, representative groups and by the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. The commission recommended that all disability payments should be provided for in legislation which makes it clear that there is a legal right to payment.</P>
    <P>The transfer of the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs meant the scheme was brought within the scope of social welfare legislation. Accordingly, national standards apply so as to provide a legal entitlement to payment where the claimant fulfils the relevant conditions. There is also a right of appeal to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office. In addition, since taking office, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has introduced a range of improvements in the eligibility and means test criteria under the disability allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>With the improved eligibility criteria and the improved administration there has been a significant increase in the numbers in receipt of the allowance from 40,463 in June 1997 to 51,500 at the end of May 2000. This is clear evidence of the improvements which have been brought about in the provision for those at whom this scheme is directed.</P>
    <P>There has not been any departure from commitments given by the Minister for Social Welfare at that time or the regulations that applied since the transfer of disabled person's maintenance allowance occurred. When the scheme was introduced, the transitional arrangements provided,<i> inter alia</i>, that the rate of disability allowance would be no less favourable than the rate of disabled person's maintenance allowance at the date of transfer. These arrangements facilitated the transfer of beneficiaries from one scheme to the other without having to apply under the new scheme and without interruption of payment. In practice this meant that no person who transferred from disabled person's maintenance allowance to disability allowance could be worse off by the application of the regulations on the date of the transfer.</P>
    <P>The transitional arrangements did not, however, confer ongoing rights in cases where the medical condition of the applicant would not justify ongoing entitlement or where there was a material change in the recipient's means or circumstances. These provisions are limited to the duration of the claimant's entitlement under the disability allowance scheme. They do not extend to subsequent entitlements arising under other social welfare schemes, such as old age (non-contributory) pension, where the normal eligibility criteria, as provided for in the relevant social welfare legislation, would apply.</P>
    <P>In all the Department's schemes there is a review mechanism to ensure that entitlement conditions continue to be satisfied. Continuing <Col N="1278" /> entitlement under the disability allowance scheme is dependent on the person satisfying both a means test and the medical eligibility criteria and this is assessed through a process of selective and periodic review of appropriate cases. In all such review cases the persons concerned are informed of the decision and the reasons for it. They are also advised of their right of appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has asked me to apologise to Deputy Durkan and to the House for his inability to be here this evening.</P>

      <P>The decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions to withdraw almost 160 summonses against a Donegal publican and members of his family, staff and clients is the latest development in a bizarre series of events involving a number of members of An Garda Síochána in County Donegal. Allegations of serious wrongdoing, probably unprecedented in the history of the State, have been made against a number of gardaí based in the county, allegations which require a full response at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>Apart from what appears to have been a systematic campaign of harassment against the publican, Mr. Frank McBrearty, resulting in this huge number of summonses which were withdrawn by the DPP today, even more serious allegations have been made which suggest attempts to frame some of the McBrearty family on a murder charge. Last year the High Court heard that a Garda sergeant had given a statement claiming to have seen a detective practising a signature of one of Mr. McBrearty's sons while he was in custody being questioned about the murder.</P>
      <P>Equally serious are a number of allegations that arms and explosives were hidden by gardaí in a number of phoney dumps in County Donegal in order to boost the apparent recovery record of the gardaí and, perhaps, boost some promotional prospects. One allegation suggests that some of these explosives were actually planted in Strabane and that information was passed to the RUC in order to improve the intelligence record of the gardaí. Another allegation involved the planting of cannabis in a pub.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be stressed that these are allegations which have yet to be authoritatively established. However, there was clearly sufficient <i>prima facie</i> evidence to cause very serious concern. At least one member of the Garda has been suspended from duty. A Garda superintendent has moved voluntarily from one area to another. In May 1999 the Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Don<Col N="1279" /> oghue, told the House that the Garda Commissioner had appointed an Assistant Garda Commissioner, Kevin Carty, to investigate all aspects of these allegations. On 7 March this year, the Minister told the Dáil that he anticipated that the investigation should be &ldquo;completed in the next six to eight weeks, following which matters will be dealt with as appropriate&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>More than three months later we have yet to hear of completion of the report, not to mention the appropriate dealing with the matter which the Minister promised. There is now serious concern in Donegal at the failure to complete the investigation and to publish the findings, as well as the apparent reluctance of the Minister to pursue the matter with sufficient vigour. I ask the Minister for an unequivocal commitment that, no matter how unpalatable the findings may be, this report will be speedily concluded and its findings published. Public confidence in the Garda requires that this be done. It is in the interest of the overwhelming majority of decent, honest, hard working members of An Garda Síochána, on whom this community depends that this be done.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister outline what steps will be taken to compensate the McBrearty family for the injustice that has been done to them? They have been subjected to a court ordeal that has gone on for two and half years. This has involved 40 days in court. Will the State compensate the McBrearty family for their financial losses and legal costs? This is the very least that is required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I already answered a parliamentary question on this matter this afternoon but I will again set out the current and up to date position on the investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that this is a complex investigation which is being led by an Assistant Commissioner and refers to a number of separate allegations that may or may <Col N="1280" /> not be related. I have been advised that new issues arose in the course of the inquiries being carried out by the investigation team which have delayed completion of the inquiry.</P>
    <P>I have been assured that every effort is being made to bring the investigation to a speedy conclusion and, while it is not possible to say precisely when it will be completed, I am informed that it is expected to be completed within weeks. Following completion, it is anticipated that the investigation file will be forwarded for the directions of the Director of Public Prosecutions. I will not, therefore, say anything that might pre-empt possible criminal proceedings.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot add any more to the response I gave this afternoon. The position remains unchanged. I apologise that I cannot give him a more comprehensive response. I would like to do so even as a matter of courtesy but I cannot owing to the constraints I have outlined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 53, 55 and 113 together.</P>
      <P>The recently published White Paper on Defence provided for the drafting of an integrated personnel management plan as a matter of priority. Of necessity this will require that a number of diverse issues be examined fully by the military authorities and my Department. Therefore, it would not be practical to put a specific time frame on the finalisation of the plan. Preliminary work has already begun. I envisage that the production of the plan will require a major effort by the civil and military branches of my Department in consultation, where appropriate, with the representative associations.</P>
      <P>The requirement for specialist personnel in the Defence Forces is met through a combination of the training and education of newly recruited and serving Defence Force personnel and the induction of suitably qualified personnel through direct entry competitions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, a number of suitably qualified non-commissioned personnel have been commissioned as air traffic control officers, as naval service electrical engineer officers and as officers <Col N="1282" /> working in the information technology area of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The White Paper sets out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force. In addition, the Chief of Staff has discretion to have 250 recruits in training at any given time, over and above this figure of 10,500. The White Paper provides for manpower levels of 930 for the Air Corps, 1,144 for the Naval Service and 8,426 for the Army. It is my intention to maintain the now established Government policy of continuous recruitment to fill vacancies as required. I am satisfied that a vigorous continuance of this policy will ensure the maintenance of proper strengths at agreed levels in the Defence Forces.  The general service recruitment campaign for the year 2000 was launched in early April and is now well under way. It is proposed to enlist 750 personnel in the Permanent Defence Force from the campaign this year. The annual cadetship competition was advertised at the start of the year and it is proposed to offer 60 cadetships in the current year.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces review implementation plan provided for special studies to be carried out on the Naval Service and the Air Corps and Price Waterhouse management consultants were engaged to conduct such a review.</P>
    <P>The Government has now considered the final report from Price Waterhouse and have agreed in principle to the proposal that the State's future sea and air support requirements be discharged by the Naval Service and the Air Corps, on the basis of an appropriate mix of multi-tasking or multi-capabilities and dedicated services, and that Government decision-making on equipping and staffing of the Naval Service and the Air Corps should be made accordingly. The manpower levels of the Air Corps and Naval Service as provided for in the White Paper are in accordance with the report's recommendations.</P>
    <P>The implementation plans for both services, which will give effect to the recommendations of the consultants' report, have now been completed and the process of implementation will commence in consultation with the representative associations.</P>

      <P>My Department lodged an objection with South Dublin County Council in connection with an application by the FAI to erect a new stadium at Gibbons townland as the proposal may impact on the Department's policy in relation to the safety of aviation operations and the future development of Casement Aerodrome. In this regard, my officials have met with representatives of the FAI to discuss the matter and the Department has clarified its position in relation to the FAI application.</P>
      <P>The most recent meeting between the Department and the FAI took place on 7 June. At this meeting a report prepared by the Air Corps in relation to the adverse impact of the proposed stadium on Air Corps operations from an operational and safety viewpoint was given to the FAI representatives. Their comments and observations on the report are just to hand and will be considered by my Department in the coming days. At the same meeting the FAI presented the Department with its response to South Dublin County Council's request for additional information. This report is currently being examined by my Department.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to make all reports available when the deliberations in the matter have been concluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47, 104, 105, 106, 107 and 108 together.</P>
      <P>I regularly attend meetings of the ministerial council of the Western European Union which take place twice a year, most recently in Oporto. I also attended with my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, at the General Affairs Council meeting on 20 March 2000. I have had no other discussions with my fellow EU Ministers regarding future participation by the Defence Forces in European defence and security structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will recall, the Helsinki European Council in December, 1999 agreed on a voluntary target for establishing capabilities for Pet<Col N="1285" /> ersberg tasks . This target, known as a &ldquo;Headline Goal&rdquo;, which member states aim to meet by the year 2003, involves the ability to deploy 50,000 to 60,000 personnel within sixty days and to sustain that deployment for one year. This would roughly equate to a mission of a scale comparable to that of KFOR in Kosovo.</P>
    <P>At Helsinki last December, the European Council called for the creation of new Brussels-based bodies and structures to enhance the EU's ability to take informed and effective decisions in the area of Petersberg tasks.</P>
    <P>The principal such body is the interim political and security committee. Ireland is represented on that committee by a senior official from the Department of Foreign Affairs. An interim military body, which has been established to provide military advice as required, to the political and security committee, is also meeting. Ireland is represented by a Defence Forces officer with the rank of colonel, who works under the guidance of the Department of Foreign Affairs, in close consultation with my Department.</P>
    <P>The General Affairs Council, with participation as appropriate by Defence Ministers, was tasked to progress the elaboration of this target and to develop a method of consultation through which the target could be met and maintained and progress reviewed. This process is under way.</P>
    <P>The General Affairs Council identified the process for further elaborating the headline and capability goals in the perspective of a capabilities pledging conference to be convened by the end of 2000.</P>
    <P>The question of what contribution Ireland can make will be considered in the context of this process, taking account of the voluntary and case by case nature of Petersberg tasks, current overseas commitments and security requirements at home.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, Ireland joined Partnership for Peace on 1 December 1999. The areas of interest to Ireland in Partnership for Peace are set out in the presentation document which was approved by Dáil Éireann on 9 November 1999 and which was presented to the NATO secretariat upon signature by Ireland of the PfP Framework Document on 1 December 1999.</P>
    <P>On the basis of its presentation document, Ireland will develop, in consultation with the NATO secretariat, an individual partnership programme which will cover a two year period initially and which will set out the level and extent of proposed participation in such areas as co-operation in peacekeeping principles, doctrine, training and exercises and inter-operability in peacekeeping operations. At present preparatory work in relation to the individual partnership programme is ongoing.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that participation in PfP is entirely voluntary and is based on the principle of self-differentation, that is, a state selects for itself the nature and scope of its participation in PfP activities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1286" /> This two year programme will be developed having regard to the State's own requirements in relation to the roles of the Defence Forces as set out in the White Paper on Defence and taking account of resource implications.</P>
    <P>The White Paper sets out a comprehensive strategy for the management and development of defence over the next ten years. The White Paper also sets out the broad development programmes for the Air Corps and the Naval Service, focusing on the implementation of the decisions on new equipment and the effectiveness and efficiency measures under the Review Implementation Plans.</P>
    <P>The White Paper includes an investment programme for the Defence Forces involving an additional £250 million in new equipment and infrastructure.</P>
    <P>It is the policy of the Government to ensure that the Defence Forces are adequately trained, equipped and resourced to undertake whatever activities with which they may tasked from time to time. In this regard participation in PfP does not involve the imposition of any changes in Defence Forces training procedures and equipment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50, 62 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>I have already dealt in detail with the present situation in Lebanon in my reply to earlier priority questions on the matter. As the House will be aware Ireland signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the United Nations in relation to the United Nations Stand-by Arrangements System, UNSAS. Ireland has committed up to 850 military personnel for UN service at any one time under UNSAS. There would, however, be no obligation to participate in any particular mission and Dáil approval would be required for the dispatch of a contingent to a specific operation. The decision to participate in UNSAS is a tangible expression of Ireland's continuing commitment to involvement in peacekeeping operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter of Defence Forces participation in overseas missions is kept under regular review. There exists a standing interdepartmental committee on peacekeeping, under the chairmanship of the Department of Foreign Affairs whose function,<i> inter alia</i>, is to provide a forum for the exchange of views on policy issues relating to Ireland's participation in international peacekeeping with a view to increasing the effectiveness and coherence of policy in this area and to ensure that policy and its implementation can keep pace in a co-ordinated way with development in international peacekeeping. In addition, I propose to bring the results of a completed review of the commitments of the Defence Forces to overseas tasks, as provided for in the White paper on Defence, to Government at an early date. This review will take account, <i>inter alia</i>, of the developing situation in UNIFIL in the post Israeli withdrawal situation. UNIFIL has been Ireland's longest and largest peace support contribution spanning a period of over 20 years. While the prospects for long-term peace seem more hopeful now that Israel has withdrawn from <Col N="1288" /> Lebanese territory, the UN is likely to maintain a continuing role in Lebanon for some time.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that UNIFIL was established in 1978 to confirm the withdrawal of Israeli forces; to restore international peace and security and to assist the Government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area. Even with the confirmation of Israeli withdrawal there is, as can be seen, still unfinished business in relation to the mandate of UNIFIL. After advising the UN Security Council that Israeli withdrawal is now complete the Secretary-General departed immediately for the region to meet the leaders there in order to see what the UN can do to consolidate and build on that historic development. The Secretary-General is still in the region. The Government is monitoring the situation.</P>

      <P>Women are eligible for service in the Army, Air Corps, Naval Service and in the Reserve Defence Force and to compete for all appointments on an equal basis and under the same general conditions as those which apply to men. All female personnel undergo the same training and receive the same military education as their male counterparts.</P>
      <P>To encourage increased participation by women in the Defence Forces, I decided in March 1998 to reduce the height requirement for all female recruits to 5'4&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The military authorities advise that in previous years the trend for general service recruitment has been that 16% of all applicants have been female and that on average 16% of enlistments have been female. It is obviously not possible to predict what the relevant percentages will be in any future intakes of recruits, but there is no reason to assume that this pattern will change to any great degree.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54, 59, 111, and 112 together.</P>
      <P>The Government, on 15 July 1998, approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which are considered surplus to military requirements. The barracks in question are located at Fermoy, Ballincollig, Naas, Kildare, Castleblayney and Clancy Barracks, Dublin. Five of the barracks have been vacated while the sixth &ndash; Clancy Barracks &ndash; will be evacuated this year.</P>
      <P>I have decided to dispose of Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, to Cork County Council for economic development of the site in conjunction with the IDA. The agreed price is £767,000. The lands will be developed and marketed as a strategic industrial site to attract inward investment. This development will greatly assist in the continuing revitalisation of Fermoy and will enhance its potential for future industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Ballincollig, the independent consultants appointed to draw up an integrated action area plan for the former barracks undertook a rigorous process of public consultation as part of their commission. The integrated plan for the property has been completed and presented to my Department. The plan provides for a wide range of community, amenity, residential and commercial uses in the future development of this substantial property. My Department has submitted the integrated plan to Cork County Council for consideration in the context of a variation to <Col N="1290" /> the existing Cork county development plan. The property will be put on the market following its adoption into the Cork county development plan.</P>
    <P>As regards Devoy Barracks, agreement has been reached between my Department and Naas Urban District Council on the transfer of part of the property to the council for local purposes. The balance of the property has been rezoned for housing in line with the development plan for Naas UDC, which was adopted on 29 May 1999. Following a tender competition a selling agent has been appointed to undertake the sale of the rezoned property. The sale will be by public tender and in this connection the property has been advertised in the national press and local weekly publications during the past three weeks. Tenders are due to be returned to the Department on 12 July 2000. Following the evaluation of these tenders the sale will proceed as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In relation to the urgent need for accommodation for refugees, the vacated Magee Barracks, Kildare, has been used to accommodate Kosovar refugees since May of last year. In the interim, a tender competition was arranged for the appointment of independent consultants to prepare an area action plan in respect of the former barrack lands. A number of the proposals received were shortlisted and those consultants placed on the shortlist made presentations before a selection committee on 16 February 2000. However, in view of the urgent requirement for accommodation for asylum seekers, the Government decided on 28 March 2000 that mobile home accommodation should be made available for asylum seekers at Magee Barracks and arrangements to accommodate approximately 200 people there are now nearing completion. I cannot state for certain that we will revert to the Integrated Area Plan. I would like to hope that that would be the case, however, I cannot be sure.</P>
    <P>In relation to Castleblayney, I decided to sell the site to the North Eastern Health Board for £600,000. Pending completion of the legal and financial formalities, a caretaker's agreement has been completed between the North Eastern Health Board and my Department and the former barracks was handed over to the board on 9 February 2000 on foot of this agreement. It is envisaged that the child care project proposed by the health board for the site will provide for 45 permanent appointments and a sum in excess of £1 million will be invested on the provision of the necessary facilities. In addition, the annual revenue to the town is estimated to be in the region of £1.2 million.</P>
    <P>Clancy Barracks, Dublin, will be evacuated later this year when alternative accommodation becomes available. I expect the sale of the property will proceed in 2001.</P>
    <P>As indicated, the disposal of barracks is proceeding and it is expected that in excess of £50 million will be realised from the sale of the properties. The moneys raised will be used primarily for re-equipment and refurbishment within the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1291" /> I do not intend to close any further barracks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56, 67 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>A total of 15, 012 claims have been lodged to date. Some 5,704 have been disposed of and 9,308 are still outstanding. Almost £114.0 million has been paid in damages including legal costs so far of £31.77 million.</P>
      <P>Administrative costs are currently estimated at approximately £750,000 per year for staff and overheads in the Department of Defence; £1.1 million per year for staff and overheads in respect of the Defence Forces; and £795,000 per year for staff and overheads in the Chief State Solicitor's office. A total estimate for administrative costs is, therefore, £2.7 million per year.</P>
      <P>Following the decision in the Hanley case on 7 December 1999, I moved to establish a mechanism whereby Army hearing loss claims could be removed from the courts. In this regard, I believe the Hanley judgment can be used as a basis whereby the majority of claims can be settled by negotiation rather than litigation. Furthermore, the level of quantum at which claims have been settling since the Hanley judgment, an average of less than £8,000 per claim, is substantially reduced from that at which claims were settling in 1996 when the average exceeded £30,000 per claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date a series of four meetings have taken place between officials of the Department of Defence, the Chief State Solicitor's office and a representative group of plaintiffs' solicitors, under the auspices of the Law Society. On 14 April 2000, the High Court agreed to adjourn all Army hearing loss claims which were due to be heard in the Dublin High Court during the Easter <Col N="1292" /> court term. Further adjournments were also granted in Kilkenny, Limerick and Dundalk.</P>
    <P>The purpose of these adjournments was to free up resources to facilitate the establishment of the mechanism of early settlement by negotiation of outstanding claims. In the period since the adjournment was granted, some 282 claims have been settled under this mechanism with considerable savings in legal costs to the Exchequer. In addition, offers of settlement are being processed or are under negotiation in a further 977 claims.</P>
    <P>This process has been kept under review and the series of meetings have been continuing. The most recent meeting took place on Friday 16 June, 2000 at the offices of the Law Society in Blackhall Place. In addition, there has been ongoing communication between the Chief State Solicitor's office and plaintiffs' solicitors.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that this process can continue and a further application is to be made to the High Court in Dublin today, for an extension of the adjournments until 11 July. Thereafter, it is proposed that those claims which do not settle under the early settlement scheme can be listed for hearing by the court during the final three weeks of the Trinity term. I am also hopeful that the early settlement process can continue during the period of the summer vacation in the context of the proposed adjournment.</P>
    <P>In view of the foregoing developments, I do not consider that the establishment of a formal compensation tribunal, which would be considerably more costly and slower than direct settlement negotiations, is necessary or warranted at this time.</P>

      <P>The future utilisation of Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, for civil aviation purposes is a matter for consideration by the Minister for Public Enterprise in consultation with myself, in the context of overall airport policy generally.

      <P>This report which was carried out by Warburg Dillon Read-AIB on Aer Rianta's future strategic direction assessed the merits of a second airport in Dublin particularly in the context of the possible development by commercial interests of Baldonnel Aerodrome.</P>
      <P>Their recommendations will help in assessing the position of Baldonnel against that wider policy backdrop.

      <P>The 1998 Price Waterhouse report on the Air Corps and the Naval Service set out a range of recommendations for more effective and efficient air and sea services. It was accepted at that time that some of these recommendations could be proceeded with fairly quickly while others would take longer to implement. It was accepted also that the recommendations had to be implemented in a structured and coherent way that would contribute to the overall development of the Defence Forces, particularly within the context of the then proposed White Paper on Defence.</P>
      <P>In October 1998, I directed the Chief of Staff to arrange for the general officer commanding the Air Corps and the flag officer commanding the Naval Service to submit implementation plans that would give effect to the effectiveness and efficiency recommendations in the Price Waterhouse report. Draft implementation plans for both services were submitted to me late last year and, after careful consideration of both plans, I decided that additional work needed to be done to augment the draft implementation plan for the Naval Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chief of Staff recently submitted a revised Naval Service draft plan for my consideration and earlier this month I asked that the necessary detailed implementation process be now put in place to make the plan a reality. I have also written to the Chief of Staff about the Air Corps plan which, subject to some revisions necessary in the <Col N="1295" /> light of decisions contained in the White Paper on Defence, can now be implemented.</P>
    <P>While the Price Waterhouse process has been very important, the broader development of both services has been addressed also in the context of the White Paper. This can be seen particularly on the infrastructure and equipment side where investment in both services continued during the White Paper process with considerable sums expended on weapons, ammunition, transport, communications and equipment for the Air Corps and Naval Service.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, the House will be aware of the major new equipment programmes which I have announced for the Air Corps and the Naval Service as a key element of White Paper's implementation.</P>
    <P>Air Corps capabilities will be augmented through a special £55 million investment programme over the next three years, with procurement of new helicopters being given a special priority.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service vessel replacement programme has already commenced with the planned acquisition of a second new state of the art offshore patrol vessel similar to the <i>LE Roísín </i>at a cost of some £20 million. This will be a replacement for the<i> LE Deirdre</i> which has been in service for nearly 30 years and is approaching the end of its economic service life.</P>
    <P>Finally, the manpower needs of both services are being addressed both within the implementation plans processes and as part of the development of an updated Defence Forces' personnel management plan which is being prepared as a matter of priority. This plan will include a continuation of the policy of regular recruitment which has been in place in recent years.</P>
    <P>My overall objective, as Minister for Defence, is to ensure that the country has the Defence Forces, including a Naval Service and Air Corps, that it needs and that the defence organisation continues to be one in which people are proud to serve. The changes we are making in the Air Corps and the Naval Service are consistent with that positive objective.</P>

      <P>Currently there are two cadet classes in training in the Air Corps &ndash; one class of 13 in the Cadet School, Military College, Defence Forces Training Centre on basic military training and the second class of 11 in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, on flight training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1296" /> Air Corps cadets undergo six months basic military orientation in the Cadet School before reporting to the Air Corps to commence flying training and complete officer training. The duration of the flying training course is approximately 18 months and successful cadets are conferred with &ldquo;wings&rdquo; and commissioned as second-lieutenants in the Air Corps.</P>
    <P>The flying training course is divided into three phases: elementary, basic and advanced. The aircraft used on the elementary and basic phases is the Marchetti. Training for the advanced phase is carried out on both the Gazelle helicopter and the Beechcraft.</P>
    <P>All flying training is conducted at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel.</P>

    <P>A service commitment scheme was introduced in 1997 for pilot officers of the Air Corps with a view to assisting in the retention in service of senior pilots in key appointments in areas such as search and rescue, maritime surveillance and ministerial air transport. From the outset the scheme applied primarily to experienced personnel who were rated on and flying the Gulfstream IV, Beechcraft, CASA and Dauphin aircraft which are the principal operational aircraft in the Air Corps.</P>
    <P>The gratuities available under the scheme were designed to strike a fair and reasonable balance between the demands of the external commercial environment and the need to exercise responsibility in relation to public service pay. Such financial incentives are not uncommon in Defence Forces in other countries where similar difficulties exist in retaining highly qualified and readily marketable personnel. The scheme, moreover, was perceived to offer a more acceptable avenue of approach for all concerned than the imposition of any compulsory retention.</P>
    <P>The service commitment scheme was open to applications from appropriate personnel over a two year trial period, from August 1997 to July 1999, inclusive. I am satisfied that, as a significant and innovative incentive scheme, it has helped both to stabilise the loss of key pilots from the Air Corps and to create an environment of some predictable manpower certainty for the medium term future in that regard.</P>
    <P>A total of 18 pilots had opted to participate under the terms of the service commitment scheme by the time of closure of the scheme, at the end of July 1999. Application for entry to the scheme was, of course, entirely voluntary in nature.</P>
    <P>The Air Corps has submitted proposals to reintroduce a new service commitment scheme <Col N="1297" /> and these proposals are under active consideration.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>The Government recognises that there are urgent equipment modernisation requirements in the Air Corps. In recognition of these requirements, I was pleased to announce on 1 March 2000 the allocation of a total of up to £55 million over the next three years for this purpose. These funds will initiate vital investment in new aircraft for the Air Corps.</P>
      <P>Tender documents for the acquisition of a helicopter for training Air Corps pilots working with the Garda air support unit were issued recently.</P>
      <P>The technical specifications and other documentation required for the commencement of the procurement process in relation to new medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps are being prepared. A joint civil-military project team has been set up to organise and oversee the tender competition and eventual evaluation and selection of the most suitable helicopter. I expect that a request for proposals from prospective suppliers will be issued before the end of this month.</P>
      <P>The Air Corps fleet comprises 18 fixed wing aircraft and 14 helicopters, including one fixed wing aircraft and one helicopter operated by the Air Corps on behalf of the Garda Síochána. All these aircraft are operational and undergo regular maintenance and scheduled overhauls to ensure that they are fully airworthy and meet the certification standards laid down by the relevant aviation authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last month I took the opportunity to pay a short visit to East Timor where I met with the personnel of No. 2 Irish contingent serving with the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor &ndash; UNTAET. I was accompanied by the Secretary General of the Department and the Defence Forces' director of operations as well as by a staff officer of the directorate who served with the No. 1 contingent and my private secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary purpose of my visit was to see at first hand the work of Defence Forces personnel <Col N="1298" /> serving there and to convey to them, on behalf of the Government and the people of Ireland, the deep appreciation felt regarding the outstanding manner in which they perform their duties in this challenging mission which is the one furthest from home. I found the situation on the ground to be calm with little evidence of the militia activity which had bedevilled the mission of late. The main security threat appeared to emanate from criminal youth gangs operating in the main centres of Dili and Bacau. The absence of a fully functional judiciary, a proper police force and correctional system make this a particularly difficult issue with which to deal. All the Irish military personnel were safe and well and morale was good.</P>
    <P>While in East Timor I met with Lieutenant General Jaime de los Santos, Force Commander, UNTAET peacekeeping force. General de los Santos spoke very highly of the contribution being made by the Irish contingent. He was fulsome in his praise of the excellent job being done by it despite being stationed in one of the most inhospitable regions of the island from the point of view of terrain and climate.</P>
    <P>While in Dili I also met with the Deputy Special Representative of the UN Secretary General and Head of UNTAET, Mr. Jean Christian Cady. He explained the problems relating to law and order and also those relating to the poor state of infrastructure. In this latter regard, heavy rains had exacerbated existing problems caused by poor maintenance and damage from heavy armoured vehicles. Almost the entire road network in East Timor had disintegrated with most roads completely impassable. Law and order problems were exacerbated by high levels of unemployment and tackling this aspect was a priority for UNTAET. He outlined a number of community employment schemes which were being undertaken in this context and which were producing encouraging results. UNTAET has so far produced an estimated 24,000 jobs and it was hoped that this stimulus would go some way to priming the economic pump of the fledgling state.</P>
    <P>A police academy is now in operation to train local Timorese in policing and the first batch of recruits are due to emerge within three months. A civil service academy is also being established. Health and education are also pressing problems and these are being addressed. In relation to health, malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases and tuberculosis continue to be major problems. While in East Timor I met with the Australian Consul General in Dili, with the brigade &ndash; Australian &ndash; and battalion &ndash; New Zealand &ndash; commanders of the western sector of the peacekeeping force as well as representatives of UN Agencies, for example, UNHCR and of Irish and other NGOs. During my visit to Fatalucic, near the West Timor border, I was happy to indicate that, on my return, I would arrange for a special donation of humanitarian supplies through the Irish contingent and this is now in train.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1299" /> A particular highlight of my visit was a meeting with National Council of Timorese Resistance &ndash; CNRT &ndash;  President Xanana Gusmao, who has come to symbolise the struggle in East Timor. He expressed his heartfelt thanks for Ireland's commitment to the cause of peace and stability in his country as demonstrated in many ways, including humanitarian support as well as participation by both military personnel and gardaí in the pre-election UNAMET &ndash; UN Mission in East Timor &ndash;  in INTERFET &ndash; International Force in East Timor &ndash; and now in UNTAET. Mr. Gusmao recalled with warmth the visit of the Taoiseach earlier this year as well as the support from the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews. He said that the process of nation building was now entering a crucial phase but he is hopeful for the future. In addition to the meetings already mentioned, I also had meetings with the Australian Northern Territory Minister for Defence Support, Mr. Tim Baldwin, in Darwin.</P>
    <P>The focus of UNTAET's activities will shortly be directed towards preparations for elections in August 2001. It is likely that there will be a gradual downsizing of the UNTAET peacekeeping force with a build-up of the UN civilian police component.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, No. 3 Irish Contingent, UNTAET, comprising 40 personnel departed for East Timor on 14 June 2000. This will be the final contingent to be deployed to that particular mission. It gives me great satisfaction as Minister for Defence, that Ireland took up the challenge and responded when that particular call came to serve in East Timor. Once again personnel of the Defence Forces met the call and the challenge and did this country proud.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have previously stated in the House, following the accident at Tramore, County Waterford, on 2 July 1999 in which four members of the Air Corps were tragically killed, my colleague the Minister for Public Enterprise and I jointly directed that the accident be investigated under S.I. 205/97 &ndash; Air Navigation (Notification and Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Regulations, 1997. Pursuant to this direction the investigation is being conducted by the Air Accident Investigation Unit &ndash; AAIU &ndash; of the Department of Public Enterprise. A senior Air Corps officer with appropriate training is acting as investigator-in-charge. He is being assisted by Inspectors from the AAIU, by Air Corps personnel and two experts from overseas, that is, a principal inspector from the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch and the head of military psychology of the Swedish Armed Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this investigation, which is wide ranging and complex, is to determine the circum<Col N="1302" /> stances and cause or causes of the accident in order to prevent future such accidents. All issues, including those raised by relatives concerning safety, are being encompassed by the investigation.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned statutory instrument, I, together with other relevant parties, including the families, received on 10 May 2000 a copy of the draft final report. The regulations prescribe that the contents of the draft report are to be treated as confidential pending completion of the final report after which it will be made public. Any safety measures proposed by the investigating team will be implemented as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Air Accident Investigation Unit's investigation many meetings took place with interested parties including at least three meetings with the helicopter manufacturers, Eurocopter. These meetings were followed up by a considerable amount of correspondence.</P>
    <P>In addition to the aforementioned investigation, a military court of inquiry has been convened to inquire into the circumstances of the accident. Its main thrust will be an examination ion of both the final report of the Air Accident Investigation Unit of the Department of Public Enterprise and the coroner's report. Therefore, the work of the military court of inquiry will proceed following publication of the final report of the Air Accident Investigation Unit. The court of inquiry must also await the coroners court findings. I am informed that the coroners court is adjourned until mid-July.</P>

      <P>In the context of the reorganisation of the Defence Forces, I approved a proposal from the military authorities that the military band at the Curragh should be amalgamated with the band of the Eastern Brigade, the Army No. 1 Band. The amalgamation of these two bands does not involve any reduction in the overall numbers of musicians within the school of music as already provided for within the Defence Forces review implementation plan approved by the previous Government. Under the previous organisation of the Defence Forces, each Army command, of which there were four, namely the Eastern, Curragh, Southern and Western Commands, had a military band. In the new organisational structure, these four commands were replaced by three brigades. Each of these three brigades, Eastern, Southern and Western, has a band as part of its organisation, with the band of the former Curragh Command being now amalgamated with the band of the Eastern Brigade.</P>
      <P>The military authorities are of the opinion that this new organisation of the school of music will allow all of the Army bands to function to their full potential.</P>
      <P>The eventual deployment of personnel of the Army School of Music as envisaged under the revised structure will be as follows:</P>

    <P>The Government recognises that there are urgent equipment modernisation requirements in the Air Corps. In recognition of these urgent requirements, I was pleased to announce on 1 March 2000 the allocation of a total of up to £55 million over the next three years for this purpose. These funds will initiate vital investment in new aircraft for the Air Corps under the direction of the high level civil-military planning and procurement group. This substantial funding for the Air Corps in the short-term will ensure that the Air Corps is ready and equipped to carry out different taskings as required.</P>
    <P>The future development of the Air Corps will be determined within a range of policy parameters which were set down in the White Paper and include: full time helicopter capability for military and non-military for example, Garda support tasks; fishery protection and search and rescue, SAR, services as agreed with the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and air ambulance and ministerial air transport services.</P>
    <P>The extent and nature of these services will, of necessity, be a determinant of the type of aircraft to be provided for the Air Corps. In that regard, the Government has decided that Air Corps equipment resources will not be committed to any overseas operations. The work of the high level group will take all these matters into account when devising a balanced investment strategy for the Air Corps for the next five years.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the technical specifications and other documentation required for the commencement of the procurement process in relation to new medium range helicopters for search and rescue are being prepared. A joint civil-military project team has been set up to organise and oversee the tender competition and eventual evaluation and selection of the most <Col N="1306" /> suitable aircraft. Arrangements for the acquisition of a helicopter for training Air Corps pilots working with the Garda air support unit are also in train.</P>
    <P>The acquisition of appropriate fixed wing aircraft for the Air Corps will also be considered by the high level planning and procurement group. In the meantime, the recommendations of the general officer commanding the Air Corps as regards essential training needs of cadets and pilots have been considered by the civil and military authorities in the Department and have been generally agreed.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the concern expressed by the Maritime Institute of Ireland regarding the proposals on the future of the Naval Service contained in the White Paper on Defence which, the institute suggested, would downgrade the service to the level of a fishery protection service; his response to the criticism made in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the comments attributed to the Maritime Institute of Ireland.</P>
      <P>My overall objective as Minister for Defence is to ensure that the country has the Defence Forces that it needs and that the Defence Forces, including the Naval Service, continues to be an organisation in which people are proud to serve. That too, is the overall objective of the White Paper and I assure the House that, far from downgrading the Naval Service, the White Paper represents a major developmental opportunity for the Naval Service.</P>
      <P>As the White Paper points out, the Naval Service has a general responsibility to meet Ireland's contingent and actual maritime defence requirements and the flotilla, which is larger now than at any time in the history of the State, provides these broad maritime capabilities. Within this context, the White Paper recognises the importance of the fact that Naval Service vessels carry with them unique characteristics as an expression of State sovereignty and political will at sea and in furthering policy objectives in the international maritime domain. Recognising the importance of the Naval Service and the need to ensure that it continues to provide these broad maritime capabilities, the White Paper confirms that the Naval Service will be developed around the provision of a modern eight ship flotilla and that there will be a process of continuous investment and vessel replacement. My decision to acquire a second state of the art offshore patrol vessel similar to the <i>LE Róisín</i> is evidence of my commitment in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper recognises, however, that fishery protection has been the major role of the Naval Service since the 1970s and the adoption of <Col N="1307" /> the EU Common Fisheries policy. In recognition of the scale and importance of this work, the EU has provided substantial funding for five of the eight vessels in the flotilla and funding for vessel upgrading and to meet some operational costs.</P>
    <P>Fishery protection will continue to be a major tasking but this and other capabilities will be maximised through the investment programme which I mentioned earlier and through the effectiveness and efficiency measures identified by Price Waterhouse and in the recent Naval Service Implementation Plan.</P>

    <P>In accordance with the ten year time frame for the White Paper, the draft plan will address the broad goals set out in paragraph 4.3.19 of the White Paper, namely, to provide a light infantry based force with an appropriate level of all-arms capability; to provide sufficient forces and capabilities to meet needs at home and to make a sig<Col N="1309" /> nificant contribution abroad; to put in place a more cohesive and better equipped force than exists at present, and to provide significant additional resources for equipment and infrastructure broadly within the existing level of financial allocation.</P>
    <P>An important element of the White Paper is the reallocation of resources to improved equipment and infrastructure. I have already announced decisions in relation to major new equipment programmes which are a key element of White Paper implementation.</P>
    <P>Air Corps capabilities will be augmented through a special £55 million investment programme over the next three years, with the procurement of new helicopters being given special priority.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service vessel replacement programme has already commenced with the planned acquisition of a second new state of the art offshore patrol vessel similar to the <i>LE Roísín</i> at a cost of some £20 million.</P>
    <P>In addition, I announced a multi-million pound investment programme for the Army, worth an estimated £25 million over the next three years. The package includes the purchase of light infantry tactical vehicles, modern effective anti-armour weapons, night vision equipment, engineer equipment and medical field equipment. This equipment will be of considerable benefit to the Army in carrying out its roles at home and overseas.</P>
    <P>This means that I have announced investment in new equipment totalling at least £100 million over the next three years, in addition to the £40 million already set aside for the purchase of 40 armoured personnel carriers. Investment of this scale confirms that the White Paper represents a serious response by the Government to develop the Defence Forces into a world-class military organisation.</P>

      <P>Strict quality assurance procedures are in place to ensure that munitions held by the Defence Forces are safe to use. Stock items which may be no longer required are set aside for disposal by specialist contractors where the quantities are large or by destruction in the case of small items. Any munitions fired at military range practices which have not been destroyed by use are disposed of <i>in situ</i>, usually by demolition.</P>
      <P>From time to time the discovery of non-service munitions is reported by members of the public, usually to the Garda Síochána. Following the receipt of such reports, the standard procedure is for the Garda Síochána to call in an explosive ordnance disposal, EOD, team from the Defence Forces. The team examines the find and decides on appropriate action to render it harmless or to destroy it, in the light of the circumstances of the particular case.</P>

      <P>The Trade and Business Development Body is one of six implementation bodies established under the British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999. The focus of the body is on enhancing co-operation on business development opportunities North and South.</P>
      <P>At the first meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, trade and business development sector, held in Newry on 24 January 2000, the council agreed an indicative timetable for a number of key issues which would be brought to the council this year by the management board of the body. These issues included a year 2000 action plan, a code of conduct for board members, a proposed staffing structure, including terms and conditions of service, and a statement of accounts and annual report.</P>
      <P>Following the suspension of the Northern Executive and Assembly in February of this year and the subsequent deferral of board meetings of the body, due to difficulties experienced in the peace process, progress on a number of those matters has been slower than originally anticipated. The Northern Executive and Assembly were restored on 30 May 2000. The board met on 1 June 2000 and the second meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, trade and business development sector, will be held in County Dublin on 30 June. At this meeting, Ministers will consider a number of proposals relating to the activities of the trade and business development body and will deal with a number of administrative matters arising from its establishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the council must approve the appointment of a chief executive to the body, the management of the body, including in relation to staffing matters, is a statutory function of the board. I am satisfied that all steps necessary to <Col N="1312" /> enable the body to effectively fulfil its remit are being taken.</P>

      <P>The Government has set out, in the context of the national development plan &ndash; NDP &ndash; the range of public investments which will be made to improve prosperity and regional attractiveness across the country. The NDP will involve an investment of £40.588 billion, in 1999 prices, over the period 2000-2006. The annual investment plan is broken down by region in line with the designation of Ireland into two regions &ndash; southern and eastern &ndash; S&amp;E &ndash; region and Border, Midland and Western &ndash; BMW &ndash; region. The breakdown of the overall plan expenditure on a regional basis clearly shows that the <i>per capita</i> spend in the BMW region of £14,051 is nearly 40% greater than that of the £10,157 <i>per capita</i> expenditure for the S&amp;E region.</P>
      <P>There is, therefore, a strong horizontal commitment to realising an effective regional strategy such that by 2006 the main differences between the BMW and S&amp;E regions are minimised if not eliminated. Within the NDP, plan investments on the Employment and Human Resources Development Operational Programme &ndash; HRDOP &ndash; will amount to £9.9 billion. The HRDOP will enable investment in policies which enable people develop their skill levels so that they can realise their full potential within the ever-changing market place.</P>
      <P>In addition, over the last year, IDA Ireland has expended considerable effort on reviewing its role on planning its future strategy to ensure that it continues to meet national needs in the year 2000 and following years. In this regard, I have ensured that the need for more balanced regional development has been brought to the core of the agency's agenda and it has now become the main focus of its activity.</P>
      <P>The significant infrastructure, human resource, enterprise and social investments planned for the next seven years are designed to rebalance regional growth and employment.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the ILO declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work and its follow-up, which was adopted at the June 1998 International Labour Conference.</P>
      <P>This declaration emphasises that all members of the ILO, even if they have not ratified the conventions in question, have an obligation, arising from the very fact of membership in the organisation, to respect, to promote and to realise, in good faith and in accordance with the Constitution, the principles concerning the fundamental rights which are the subject of those conventions, namely, freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour; the effective abolition of child labour; and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has ratified all seven of the core conventions designated by the ILO as follows: Convention 29, Forced Labour Convention, 1930, ratification registered by Ireland on 2 March 1931; Convention 87, Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948, ratification registered by Ireland on 4 June 1955; Convention 98, Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949, ratification registered by Ireland on 4 June 1955; Convention 100, Equal Remuneration Convention, <Col N="1314" /> 1951, ratification registered by Ireland on 18 December 1974; Convention 105, Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, 1957, ratification registered by Ireland on 11 June 1958;</P>
    <P>Convention 111, Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention, 1958, ratification registered by Ireland on 22 April 1999; and Convention 138, Minimum Age Convention, 1973, ratification registered by Ireland on 22 June 1978.</P>
    <P>In June 1999, the International Labour Conference adopted convention No. 182 concerning the prohibition and immediate action for the elimination of child labour. Ireland ratified that convention on 20 December 1999 and was the first EU member state to do so.</P>
    <P>The Government supports compliance with the above instruments as affirming its commitment to ensuring that our labour standards reflect best international practice.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the widespread concern within the personnel of the emergency services and their families at the lack of a comprehensive and adequate set of regulations obliging the owners and users of pleasure craft to ensure that their craft are fully and comprehensively equipped with emergency provisions such as flares, second engines, radar and other safety devices so as to ensure that in the event of such pleasure craft encountering difficulties the rescue associated with the users of that craft do not in turn result in putting the personnel of our emergency services in serious danger resulting either in injury or even loss of life; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Action Group on Small Powered Recreational Craft, including personal watercraft, recently presented me with its final report. This report made a number of recommendations including some in respect of the carriage and use of lifejackets, the carriage of safety equipment and consumption of alcohol. On the basis of this report, I am currently proposing the introduction of a legislative framework for the regulation of recreational craft. This is being achieved through amendments to the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, which are included in the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Bill, 1999. The Bill passed its final stages in the Dáil and Seanad on 20 June 2000 and is being submitted to the President for signature.</P>
      <P>The Bill will impose certain safety standards for the use of leisure craft. These will improve safety practices to take account of the safety of the passengers and occupants of the vessels in question.</P>
      <P>Following on the enactment of this legislation, I hope to quickly introduce implementing regulations based on the recommendations of the action group's final report.</P>
      <P>I consider that these regulations, allied to the recently launched &ldquo;Year 2000 Safety on the Water&rdquo; campaign, will contribute to an increase in safety in the water-based leisure sector and a resultant decrease in the emergency calls received by the emergency services in future.</P>

      <P>Under the Gas Acts, 1976 to 1995, Bord Gáis Éireann, BGE, has statutory responsibility to develop and maintain an efficient and cost-effective gas transmission and distribution system. Extensions to the transmission system require my consent whereas extensions of the distribution network fall exclusively within the day to day responsibilities of the board.</P>
      <P>BGE has informed me that it carried out an assessment on the possibility of expanding the gas network to Tipperary town. The potential size of the natural gas market in the town would not justify the capital costs involved.</P>
      <P>However, if the market increases significantly in the future, BGE will re-assess the situation and if the economics prove positive, the company will then be in a position to supply natural gas to Tipperary town.</P>

      <P>The minimum height requirement for both males and females had previously been set at 5' 5&rdquo;. However, in March 1998, I reduced the height requirement for female applicants for general enlistment in the Defence Forces to 5' 4&rdquo;, in light of the natural height differential between males and females and to encourage an increased participation by women in the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>While I am in favour of retaining this reduced height requirement for women, I must be mindful of the professional advice of the Medical Corps, and the actual experience of training units, that persons of shorter stature encounter greater difficulties in carrying the bulk and weight of combat order equipment. Therefore, I do not envisage any further lowering of height requirements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the possible use of St. Bricin's Military Hospital for civilian patients was first mooted in late 1997 following contacts between military medical staff and the Mater Hospital. Agreement in principle was reached in 1998 between my Department, the Department of Health and Children and the Mater Misericordiae Hospital on a proposal to use St. Bricin's Military Hospital as a step down medical facility into which certain categories of civilian patients could be transferred from the Mater Hospital. It was agreed that initially a pilot scheme could be set up under which up to eight civilian patients would be accommodated in St. Bricin's for periods rang<Col N="1319" /> ing from seven to ten days. If this pilot scheme proved successful, the intention would be to enter into a long-term arrangement for accommodating up to 20 civilian patients at a time at St. Bricin's Hospital.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children has overall responsibility for the proposal. Accordingly, before any pilot scheme can commence, it is essential that the Department of Health and Children is fully satisfied with regard to all the arrangements surrounding the transfer, accommodation and treatment of civilian patients in St. Bricin's Hospital. I am informed that proposals were made by the Mater Hospital to the Department of Health and Children with regard to the use of St. Bricin's Hospital. While it was accepted that these proposals had merit, a number of important issues still required clarification such as legal and insurance issues which are in the remit of the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>With effect from 1 March 2000 the new Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, is the statutory body with responsibility for health and personal social services for people who live in Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow. The ERHA is currently examining the accident and emergency services and hospital waiting lists in its region with a view to bringing forward recommendations to improve services and address existing deficiencies in these areas of service provision. The proposals for St. Bricin's Hospital will be actively considered in the context of this review.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children has recently written to my Department and asked that my Department formally consider providing access to the entire patient accommodation facilities at St. Bricin's Hospital.</P>
      <P>The exact nature and details of such a collaboration will now be discussed between the two Departments and the military authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>There were only 28 apprentices at the Army Apprentice School in Devoy Barracks, Naas, at the time of closure of that barracks. Of these, 18 attended the Dublin Institute of Technology for the purpose of completing their final 'off the job' training module which consisted of ten weeks. These 18 apprentices were variously training as motor mechanics, carpenters and electricians. They commenced their attendance at Dublin Institute of Technology in late January 1999 and completed it at the end of March 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1320" /> The remaining ten apprentices, who are training in electronics-communications, are located in the School of Signals on the Curragh. They will complete their technical training in the middle of the year 2001.</P>
    <P>In 1998, the average cost of training an apprentice at the former Army Apprentice School had reached the level of £100,000 per annum. This was clearly quite unsustainable.</P>
    <P>When the closure of the Army Apprentice School was announced, I gave an undertaking that every apprentice would be given the opportunity to complete their training. I am informed by the military authorities that the new arrangements with Dublin Institute of Technology worked very satisfactorily and that the standard of instruction provided was excellent. As promised, all of the Army apprentices either have already completed, or are continuing on to complete, their apprenticeships.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that, in future, Army apprentices will attend at FÁS, Dublin Institute of Technology and/or regional technical college courses for their formal &ldquo;off the job&rdquo; training. This type of format for training is already the long established situation with all Naval Service apprentices. The distinct apprenticeship needs of the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps are all kept under regular review. Apprentices will continue to be recruited to the various branches of the Defence Forces, for specific trades and crafts, as and when required, in response to identified service needs. There are no proposals on hand from the military authorities for the open recruitment of further apprentices to the Army at the present time.</P>

      <P>My Department is considering five cases where the farming transferee has died.</P>
      <P>The scheme of early retirement from farming makes no explicit provision for such cases and the governing principle is that when a retiring farmer is admitted to the scheme, the transferred holding must be farmed in accordance with the terms of the scheme for the entire period for which the pension is payable. Therefore, in cases where transferees die, the transferors must seek to find replacements.</P>
      <P>Each of the cases on hands is being examined on its own merits and my Department will advise the participants concerned of the outcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

      <P>It is a condition of the scheme that participants must apply, on reaching their 66th birthday, to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for either the contributory and non-contributory old age pension. This condition also applies to participants' partners in a joint management application. If a pension is awarded it must be offset against the farm retirement pension. Participants in the scheme are told of this condition when they join, and they are required to notify my Department if they or their partners in joint management are awarded an old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overpayments are being recovered from the early retirement pensions of 584 persons. In the vast majority of these cases the overpayments arose from the offsetting of the old age pensions they or their spouses receive from the Department of Social Community and Family Affairs. In the remainder of cases the overpayments arise from the area released under the scheme being reduced through the disposal of lands or the par<Col N="1322" /> ticipant having been paid at the incorrect rate of pension.</P>
    <P>However, I should say that every effort is made to minimise any hardship to the participants where an overpayment is being recovered.</P>

      <P>The drug payment scheme, with a threshold of £42 per month per individual or family, was introduced on 1 July 1999 and replaced the drug cost <Col N="1324" /> subsidisation scheme &ndash; DCSS &ndash; and drug refund scheme &ndash; DRS. The primary aim of the scheme is to bring about important improvements over the previous schemes and the scheme is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines. With regard to the increase, I would point out that there has been no increase in the thresholds for the DCSS or DRS since 1991.</P>
      <P>A common list of reimbursable items was introduced for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme to ensure equity in relation to the products reimbursed by the State under both schemes.  This common list is subject to ongoing review and amendment as new products become available and additions and deletions are notified on a monthly basis. The list of reimbursable food items to which persons registered under the drug payment scheme are entitled is in line with those items available to medical card holders and includes breads, bread mixes, flours and pizza bases. It is considered that the range of such items available under State reimbursement schemes provides a reasonable choice and persons requiring items which are not reimbursable would be expected to meet the full cost of such items.</P>
      <P>In 1998, the total cost of claims reimbursed in respect of coeliac foods under the drug cost subsidisation scheme was £192,563, of which £102,588 was in respect of foods which are on the common list of reimbursable items. Of the £89,975 reimbursed for coeliac foods which are now no longer reimbursable, over £42,500 was in respect of cakes and biscuits.</P>
      <P>People who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the local health board has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>In view of this special provision, I do not feel it justifiable, nor did previous Governments on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means or in the case of children, to their parents' means, as a general rule. It is, of course, open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness refers to the fact that health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme and will consult with the social partners by the end of 2000. Particular emphasis will be placed on the needs of families with children and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits.</P>

      <P>As part of the settlement of the nurses' pay dispute, the Labour Court recommended payment of a lump sum of £1,250 to all nurses employed in the public sector. The lump sum was also payable to student public health nurses, post-registration student nurses and pupil midwives. It was not payable to student nurses participating in the nursing registration-diploma programmes or to agency nurses. The qualifying date for payment of the lump sum was 5 November 1999.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Nursing Alliance raised queries with the Health Service Employers Agency &ndash; HSEA &ndash; regarding temporary-part-time nurses who may not have worked on that date. Following a meeting with the Nursing Alliance on 8 June 2000 a small working group will be established to examine individual cases concerning the lump sum payment.</P>

      <P>The General Assembly of the United Nations has proclaimed 2001 as the International Year of Volunteers known as IYV 2001. The year is designed to enhance recognition, facilitation, networking and promotion of volunteer service. The intended outcomes of the year are that more needs be identified with which volunteers can help; that more people everywhere offer their services as volunteers; and that volunteer programmes receive increased resources and facilities, to help them assign those new volunteers to tackling the needs.</P>
      <P>In such a year all can gain. Individuals can find a renewed sense of purpose. Volunteer groups can be reinvigorated. Governments and the non-profit and private sectors can enter into fresh partnerships to make for greater participation, alleviate problems and promote good governance.</P>
      <P>The UN year of the volunteer will provide a focus for activity to support volunteering. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides that a national committee on volunteering will be established, with participation from relevant interests, which will devise strategies and actions for supporting and developing volunteering. The committee will devise strategies and actions for supporting and developing volunteering, not just during the international year, but for the longer term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will shortly be bringing proposals to Government regarding the setting up of this committee and issues of structures and appropriate budget will be examined as part of this process.

A number of organisations have already made submissions to my Depart<Col N="1332" /> ment in relation to IYV 2001.

      <P>As I indicated in my response to Parliamentary Question No. 190 from Deputy Charles Flanagan on 7 June 2000, I expect to be in a position to advise the applicant of my decision very shortly.</P>
      <P>The procedures involved in processing an application for naturalisation include the examination and verification of various documents submitted, conducting inquiries regarding work permits, tax affairs etc. and requesting a report from the Garda in relation to an applicant's character and that of his or her named referees. This application was received in my Department in December 1996 and the aforementioned procedures were initiated. On considering the case with a view to making a submission to me, my Department felt that it was necessary to clarify one point in respect of the application. This matter was subsequently raised and was resolved satisfactorily in October 1999.</P>
      <P>While I appreciate that there appears to have been a long delay in processing this application, I should stress that the decision to naturalise a person is a very serious matter and, as the various procedures involved in the process are quite lengthy, delays are not uncommon.</P>

      <P>The Firearms (Temporary Custody) Order, 1972, required all persons residing in the State, in the interest of public safety, to surrender to the Garda Síochána all pistols, revolvers and rifles of a calibre in excess of .22 and ammunition for same. On expiry of the Order, after one month, the Garda Síochána, in line with the Government decision, adopted a policy of not licensing these firearms. Following a further Government decision in 1993, this policy was relaxed to allow the licensing of bolt-action rifles up to .270 for deer hunting and culling and competitive target shooting.</P>
      <P>I recently decided that a further review of the policy in this area would now be appropriate and accordingly my Department, in consultation with the Garda authorities, have commenced such a review.</P>

      <P>The Garda conciliation and arbitration scheme, which is similar to schemes operating elsewhere in the public service, provides for a conciliation council and an arbitration board for pay and other specified conditions of service of members of all ranks of the Garda Síochána up to and including the rank of chief superintendent. The scheme has provided a valuable mechanism for the garda representative bodies to pursue claims for improvements in pay and conditions.</P>

      <P>The Helsinki European Council in December 1999 agreed that the civilian resources available to the EU and its member states to respond to international crises should be enhanced. As a follow up to this, the Portuguese Presidency submitted a report to the European Council that was held in Feira on 19 and 20 June 2000.</P>
      <P>The report, among other items, addresses the role of policing in the management of international crises. In particular it envisages a greater involvement by the EU, an increase in the number of police made available by member states for international missions and enhancing the ability of member states to rapidly deploy police on such missions.</P>
      <P>The European Council welcomed the overall report and, in so far as policing is concerned, welcomed the fact that member states, co-operating voluntarily, have undertaken that by 2003 they will be able to provide up to 5,000 police officers for international missions across the range of conflict prevention and crisis management operations. Member states have also undertaken to be able to identify and deploy up to 1,000 police officers within 30 days.</P>

      <P>In relation to the Deputy's question regarding the withdrawal of the community employment scheme from schools, responsibility for the operation of such schemes in schools rests with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Officials from my Department are in discussions with their counterparts in that Department regarding this issue. In general, I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to the provision by my Department of additional assistance to schools for secretarial and caretaking services.</P>
      <P>At primary level, my Department provides funding towards the cost of caretaking and secretarial services under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of caretakers and clerical officers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. However, this scheme has been superseded in the PESP Agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. As the Deputy is aware, I recently announced that, with effect from September of this year, I will be extending the scheme to all primary schools. In addition I will be setting a minimum grant of £2,400 which will be payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less.</P>
      <P>These improvements mean that with effect from September 2000 all primary schools will be receiving an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999 has increased this year to approximately £12.2 million and will further increase in 2001 to approximately £16.8 million.</P>
      <P>At second level, the assistance provided by my Department towards the provision of caretaking and secretarial services reflects the different school management and ownership arrangements at second level. In the case of voluntary secondary schools in the free education scheme, all schools with 200 or more pupils receive financial assistance towards the cost of both caretaking and secretarial services under the PESP scheme. There are also a number of secondary schools in the 1978 scheme for the employment of clerical officers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of vocational schools and colleges, caretaking and clerical staff are allocated to vocational education committees on a scheme wide basis. It is a matter for the vocational education committee to deploy staff in the best manner possible to meet the needs of the committee and its schools. All schools in the community and <Col N="1341" /> comprehensive school sector have been provided with clerical and caretaking services.</P>
    <P>In addition, I am satisfied that my recent announcement of the introduction of a school services support fund at second level from next September is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. Schools will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to second level schools each year. The flexibility given to schools under this initiative will be supported by the putting in place of guidelines, which will strike the right balance between allowing a reasonable level of discretion and achieving the implementation of national policy priorities.</P>

      <P>I indicated in a reply to a question from the Deputy on 15 February 2000 that the cost plan for the building project in question is being examined by my Department's technical staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the rate of progress to construction for a capital project depends on factors such as the complexity and size of the project, the time required to undertake architectural planning, the volume of other projects being <Col N="1342" /> dealt with by the design team, the period of time required for the granting of planning permission and a fire certificate and the outcome of the tender competition. These processes are by their nature lengthy and complex and can take a considerable period of time to complete. Delays can arise at any point in the process, consequently it is not possible to say when projects being processed at present will proceed to construction. However, every effort is made by my Department to minimise delays and to ensure that construction is started in the shortest period of time possible. In all cases, the school authorities will be kept informed of progress.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the children in question. Officials of my Department are investigating this case with a view to securing a suitable educational placement for these children. Under current arrangements, children with autism have access to a range of educational support services. The precise nature of the support provided will depend on the severity of the condition in each individual case. These supports include resource teaching support in mainstream primary and post primary schools, special classes in primary schools and teaching support in special schools. Each special class, which operates at a pupil teacher ratio of 6:1, also receives the support of a special needs assistant, enhanced capitation and funding towards equipment needs.</P>
      <P>In the particular case of children with autism, there is also a need for additional support services such as speech and language therapy and occupational therapy. The services are provided on an outreach basis through the relevant health authorities. My Department works in close co-operation with the health authorities in arranging to have these services put in place.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1343" /> In the case of primary schools, the new planning guidelines in operation for all new building projects since January 2000 make provision for hard-play areas and ball-courts ranging in size from 785 square metres to in excess of 1,600 square metres, depending on the anticipated enrolment figures. I am satisfied that these facilities, in conjunction with the general purposes area which is included as part of the planning brief for all new primary schools and for existing schools undergoing major extensions, are more than adequate.</P>
    <P>The general design brief for post primary schools specifies that where site area and configuration permits, an area should be reserved suitable for use as a practice playing field. Additionally, the design brief provides for hard-play areas, ranging in size from 1020mf7&gt;2 to 3060mf7&gt;2 in area, depending on the school's enrolment.</P>
    <P>All new post primary schools and post primary schools for which an extension is being provided qualify for a PE hall. For schools with an enrolment below 450 students, the PE hall to be provided is 604mf7&gt;2 while schools with an enrolment in <Col N="1344" /> excess of 450 students qualify for a PE hall of 806mf7&gt;2.</P>

      <P>As the person to whom the Deputy refers in the question is in employment, he would not be eligible to avail himself of a grant for living expenses while undertaking a course of study. Students in the 18 to 21 age group may re-enter the education system to complete their education or repeat the leaving certificate. For those resuming their education there is no charge. For those repeating the leaving certificate an annual fee of £100 applies, but this is waived in the case of medical card holders.</P>
      <P>The special initiatives for disadvantaged adults scheme administered by vocational education committees provides discretionary assistance towards the cost of books, travel, lunches and child care. It is open to the person in question to make an approach to the VEC for help in this area.</P>
