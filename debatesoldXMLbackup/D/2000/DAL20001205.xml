    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The consultants' reports have been completed and received by the working group. The group has finalised its consideration of the reports. It had been intended to present the reports to the next plenary meeting of the PPF process, but that meeting was deferred in light of other consultations as part of the pre-budget process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I envisage that the reports will be discussed at the postponed plenary meeting of the PPF and the Government will give consideration to the <Col N="430" /> views of the social partners in its examination of the reports' analysis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is there a delay with this report? Last June the Taoiseach said the report was imminent, as the group was established under the previous arrangement of Partnership 2000 in December 2000. Since the Taoiseach last answered questions here, has he had an opportunity to see the recommendations in the report and does he find them acceptable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been some delays. There has been an enormous number of meetings and those involved in the working group were also involved in the process of negotiations on the PPF. They did not have meetings during that process, nor did they have meetings while tied up in other events. The report is almost completed &ndash; there are some slight amendments to be completed and I checked this yesterday. In the normal course of events it would go to the plenary because it was a report of Partnership 2000, and in all these cases over the years as soon as it goes to the plenary we put it in the Oireachtas Library on the same day.</P>
      <P>I have not seen the full document but I have seen some of the findings. Phase 1 entailed a static analysis of the cost and distribution implications of the introduction of a system of basic income. The two main issues which emerged from that phase relate to the tax rate required to finance the basic income proposal and the rate of payment under the examination. The other issue was the distribution implications for respective income groups within the economy, those who would gain or lose out financially under the system being imposed.</P>
      <P>Some of the key issues included the tax rate &ndash; both consultants agreed that the cost of the hypothetical basic income payment levels would be just over £12 billion in extra tax revenue expenditure savings which would need to be funded either by higher tax or savings in other areas of expenditure. The ESRI calculated that this would require a tax rate of 51.6%. Professor Clarke estimated that the rate would be 47.26%. The steering group asked the Department of Finance to prepare an updated estimate of the required tax rate based on the information available and the estimate was a rate of 47% required for 2001. Further economic growth since this estimate was made would reduce the rate even further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of the distributional effects, the distributional analysis compares the outcome in 2001 under the basic income system with the outcomes of three conventional options with access to the same resources. The different methodologies used by consultants to examine the distributional effects yielded somewhat different results. The ESRI found that, on average, there were gains for the bottom six income groups and losses for the top four. The families headed by single, widowed, separated or divorced persons <Col N="431" /> rather than by a couple accounted for most of the potential losers. Professor Clarke found that average households in every sector would have their disposable incomes rise throughout the period from implementation of the basic income system. The increases in average household disposable income under the basic income system would be very progressive, with the largest percentage increases going to those in low income groups and small increases going to the top income group households.</P>
    <P>In the context of the focus on basic income and tackling poverty, two points are drawn from the report. First, a total of 70% of households in the bottom four sectors would gain from basic income while 16% would lose compared with conventional options. Second, half of the individuals who would be before the 40% poverty line under conventional options would be brought over this poverty line by basic income.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why was this report not published before the budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, the report is almost finished but even if it were finished in the last period it still would have required further examination by the Government. The Government has not yet got the report. It has not even gone into the social partnership process, which was the process that instigated it in the first place. I hope the report will be published, but as Deputy Bruton knows, it is a commitment that is to form part of a Green Paper on the other side of its publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that work on the completion of this report was deferred until after the budget to allow other work to be done? Does that not imply that the Government deliberately decided that this issue would not be considered in the context of the budget and contrived a situation whereby the report would not be published before the budget so that the distributional issues that are raised in this important report would not even be considered by the social partners and others in the lead in to the budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not the case. It is their call that it will go to the programme and then it will have to go to the Government. The Government is committed to a Green Paper one way or the other. As I said before, this report is not something that will go quickly into the system. It is far too complex for that. As the Deputy knows, from the outset the report was not to come up with recommendations; that was for further examination by Government. The findings in the brief report that I got, and the enormous changes it would make in the system, will not be done overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the distribution figures read out by the Taoiseach, which indicate that house<Col N="432" /> holds headed by lone parents would lose, not suggest that under our existing system there may well be a financial disincentive to couples to stay together? Is that not a logical inversion of the report that has been presented and, if so, has the Taoiseach not considered that we need to examine our social welfare code to take account of the fact that there are many disincentives in it currently for couples, particularly parents, to stay together with their children and many financial incentives for them not to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some disincentives in the current system but, thankfully, many of those that have existed over the years have been removed, although not all of them. I hope more of those disincentives will be removed tomorrow. In regard to this particular report, it depends on some of the methodologies. That will be the advantage of the Green Paper, which I hope can be produced in the spring, because the Green Paper will take the phase one and phase two findings, the distributional effects, the tax rates and the arguments that have been made on migration, the informal economy and the labour market and put them into the report. I hope this can be done quickly.</P>
      <P>The work has been painstaking. The ESRI looked at all models, including what had been done in New Zealand. The report is extremely comprehensive and raises many arguments and debates on the distribution effects. Many of the basic income cases are hypothetical, but it is an important report and I will have it placed in the Oireachtas Library early in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Will the Taoiseach agree, on the day when the Society of St. Vincent de Paul Society said that 200,000 people are living in consistent poverty without an adequate income, that there is a huge urgency for the introduction of a minimum basis income for all? Will he further agree that this debate needs to be expedited and the idea of a basic income needs to be implemented without debating it to death, as has happened with other issues on which the Government had reports, for example, private rented accommodation?</P>
      <P>Will he also agree that the minimum wage of £4.40 per hour, which is taxed by the Exchequer, is not a good model on which to work and it is disgraceful that workers on the minimum wage, a poverty wage, should have tax taken from them, leaving many of them living in poverty? Will he agree that it is a question of bringing up the living standards and quality of life of all people, rather than pretending to give with one hand while taking away with the other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Thankfully, we have a minimum wage, which was the highest in Europe on its introduction last April. Some countries may have gone beyond that level. It would be good to ensure that as much as possible of the minimum wage is not taxable. This is not an easy goal to <Col N="433" /> reach as it takes an enormous effort, but it is another goal to try to reach.</P>
      <P>As will be seen from the recent independent report published a few weeks ago, lower paid workers here pay less tax than workers in other countries. This is to be welcomed and we should try to do more in this area, while ensuring that people who can work and are healthy are given an opportunity to work. There are other categories of people who would like to work but it is not possible for them to do so. We must, as we did in the 1990s, continue to improve their relative wealth position. As long as there are people in this marginalised position, we must continue to work on it. I would argue strongly that we have done an enormous amount to improve the position of these people and used our wealth in this area. However, as long as there are difficulties we must continue to deal with them.</P>
      <P>The findings are relevant to phase 2 of the report, which examined the potential dynamic impact of a basic income system and its long-term sustainability, having regard to the free movement of people, capital and our open borders. That analysis was carried out by the ESRI alone; no other group was involved. A basic income has not yet been implemented in any country, so one cannot benchmark it.</P>
      <P>As I said in reply to Deputy Bruton, Professor Clarke and others used all the research available in St. John's University in New York which had been gathered on a world-wide basis. They also looked at what had been done in New Zealand. In trying to make sense of the report, we still have to design something which has not been used anywhere else and see if it can be implemented and is sustainable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree Alaska has had a limited form of guaranteed basic income and, therefore, there are models and indicators, although none are of the type being examined in the report? I welcome the Taoiseach's statement that guaranteed basic income would benefit the less well-off and not those on the highest incomes. Given the widening gap between rich and poor, that is not a bad thing.</P>
      <P>The Green Paper was due in summer 1999. The Taoiseach said other work got in the way but summer 1999 was a long time ago. Is it true the report was concluded six months ago? If so, why was it not published sooner? Six months is a long time in political terms. Does the report include European Commission research commissioned on guaranteed basic income which would be more relevant in European terms?</P>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach had any discussions with his colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, given that the Minister for Social Welfare in Finland is a well known exponent of guaranteed basic income? Many comparisons have been made between Ireland and Finland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not take issue <Col N="434" /> with what I said about the Alaskan example. There are some examples but what we are trying to in the guaranteed basic income study has not been done anywhere. The Deputy is correct that some analysis has been conducted elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I reported to the House on 21 June that the report was finished. A small amount of work remains to be done and the report was set aside by the group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it was doing other work and it did not finish the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that shows it has a low priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>A never, never issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a priority but the group views it as a long-term issue, which will not happen in the short-term. We have lost some time. Last year I also reported that the group had set the report aside for the period of the negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the same people were involved in the negotiations for the new national agreement and they gave priority to that work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not think the work should be given to someone else if the group attaches so little importance to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe that should have been done at the outset but they have been working on this for some years and that is the position. They believe they could deal with something in the short-term which they could directly influence now rather than some years down the road.</P>
      <P>I have asked the working group to clear the report and it agreed to do so within the partnership framework at the November meeting which was not held because there were other issues. It is unlikely that a meeting will be held in December but one has been arranged for January and the report will be cleared then. We will then have to produce the Green Paper as quickly as we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare in Finland is an exponent of guaranteed basic income. Has the Taoiseach discussed the issue with the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been involved in the preliminary discussions on the document I have been using. We discussed the presentation by the European Commission, which is not in these reports, but it should be taken into account in the preparation of the Green Paper because it <Col N="435" /> is a useful presentation in conjunction with these documents in preparing the overall case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Taoiseach has put on record that he accepts that the proposal on analysis is redistributive, we require significant redistribution of wealth between those who increasingly have more and those who are increasingly left behind. Having had an opportunity to examine at least the preliminary conclusions and a <i>précis</i> of the report, does the Taoiseach accept guaranteed basic income is a concept that he will support in Government and begin to put in train or does he view the continuation of the report and the mechanisms of analysis as merely an academic exercise? If the former is the case, will the Taoiseach put a timeframe on serious proposals being available for study by the House or its committees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have worked on this for the past few years and, any time any of the groups wished to discuss or debate it with me, I agreed to it. A great deal of the work until this stage was an academic exercise, as the Deputy will appreciate. First, it was a case of finding somewhere that had tried this. I cannot say at this stage that I am absolutely convinced it is workable. Further work needs to be done on it. However, the group certainly dealt with the arguments about this issue put forward in 1995 and 1996 and it analysed other arguments. Certainly the case is put more clearly than in some of the discussion papers and some of the conferences that took place in those years.</P>
      <P>A great deal will centre on the social solidarity fund. This was indicated at an early stage in some of the discussions on how the benchmarks can be made to work and who will stand to lose or gain. Professor Clarke said from the outset, and he also said it publicly, so it is not new, that a social solidarity fund would provide a mechanism to compensate significant losers under what are hypothetical figures in a hypothetical scheme he designed. The group has taken up that and has reiterated that these mechanisms are merely indicative to provide a broad view on how such a fund will operate. Therefore, the group did not comment on the viability of the proposals made under the fund. Clearly, someone must do that.</P>
      <P>However, the group stated that a social solidarity fund reinforces a form of means testing into the tax-welfare system and applies retention of significant elements of the administrative costs associated with such a system. In the detail I have received, which admittedly is not the full report, it is not spelled out precisely how that can be done. I assume it is expected that the Government will comment on that or at least include it in the Green Paper for discussion by the Houses and committees of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;it has been argued that basic incomes can do a great deal of good and that they do not and would not prove to be a good system. I can bring forward the argument in its full sense. It is not something in which the entire tax and welfare code, labour market, migration and distribution can be changed, rushed through and bounced into a new system. That is not what we are dealing with because ours is a system which has been designed over decades. Neither is it what the ESRI, Professor Clarke, St. John's University or any other group believes we should do. They say we should examine this carefully. Even in their conclusions, which I gave to Deputy Howlin, they state that significant means of our systems need to be maintained. They are guarding against these systems being turned on their head.</P>

      <P>At the outset, everybody knew a cost would be involved in having a basic income involving hundreds of thousands of people.

We should publish this report as quickly as possible so that people can see the real implications of what we are talking about, rather than keeping the matter going in some sort of half life. I did not intend it to continue three years after it was established. When it was set up originally, it was intended to be dealt with it quickly. Since the Taoiseach took over, however, it has been postponed instead of being dealt with. Would it not be much fairer to the people who, for good reasons, are advocating the basic income, to publish the report quickly so the public can see the real choices involved? This would be better than keeping the matter going forever so that no conclusion is ever reached, which seems to be the current tactic of those involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can speak for the people involved when I say that is not their intention. They have put an enormous amount of work into an extremely complex system. Its purpose was to consider and evaluate the social, budgetary and administrative impact of the introduction of a basic income system, effectively turning the present system on its head. They set about doing it in two ways: first, by examining the economic and budgetary aspects of introducing the system, including the costs, distribution impact and international comparisons and, second, by studying the immediate and long-term dynamic effects of a basic income system. They looked at how it might affect wage rates, competitiveness and tax rates. Deputy Bruton is right about the one issue he picked up on, but it is part of a wider study. Unless something else happens which is not within my control &ndash; as the last meetings were not under my control &ndash; I can safely say that this report should be issued in January.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the progress that has been made in integrating the tax and social welfare systems, moves us a number of steps towards making it easier to introduce a guaranteed basic income, rather than having to upturn the entire State apparatus which might otherwise have been the case? I welcome the progress that has been made over the years from budget to budget. However, rather than dwelling on a tax rate which obviously sounds quite uninviting, will the Taoiseach examine, and perhaps promote, the issues that need to be dealt with and can be helped by a guaranteed basic income? These include child care, tackling child poverty, working from home, job sharing, farm income support, gender equality and so many other issues that come to our attention every day. How would they be helped by a guaranteed basic income which would, perhaps, represent better value for money than a tax rate? Although he is not a member of the working group, will the Taoiseach, in co-operation with the Whips, set a date on which the issue may be debated in the House to ensure the report is not left hanging in the wind? As so often happens when reports are concluded and presented, things start to happen.</P>

      <P>The working group has promised me that I will have the report before the House returns. A date can be fixed with the Whip, which I hope will be adhered to. To be fair to those involved, they have been working on other issues. On the question of winners and losers raised by Deputies Sargent and Bruton, one has to mention a tax rate because it is one of the key issues. There are arguments about every aspect, including the competitiveness of the economy. Assessing the impact of a basic income scheme on growth and competitiveness is even more difficult. The proposal involves factors tending to increase both supply and demand. On one side of the argument, there is the effect on low wages, reducing the supply of low skilled lab<Col N="439" /> our and increasing the demand for higher paid, higher skilled labour. Even if total employment was to remain static within the economy&mdash;</P>

On the other side, a basic income could improve growth, as the ESRI has argued, by promoting a more flexible labour market and a more stable macro-economic environment and by generating a fairer distribution of income. The report marks the end of what has been three years work.</P>

There have been warnings of 50% plus taxation rates, etc. On what basis is such a taxation rate assumed? Would it relate, yet again, to PAYE workers, as happened in the past? Is there any presumption, for example, as to how much of the £7 billion or £8 billion exported every year by multinational companies or how much of the billions of pounds paid to the banks in interest on the national debt should be taxed and as to whether there should be extra taxes on land speculation and wealth to provide a basic income for our people?

      <P>Section 11(1) of the Public Service Management Act, 1997, makes provision for the appointment of special advisers to my office. As provided for in section 11(3) of the Public Service Management Act, the terms and conditions of these appointments are subject to determination by the Minister for Finance. The appointments are subject to the Civil Service Regulations <Col N="440" /> Acts, 1956 to 1996, and any other Act for the time being in force relating to the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>Under the requirements of section 19 of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, I am obliged to lay details concerning my political appointees before the House on an annual basis. Deputies will therefore be aware of the arrangements that apply in my office. There are, inevitably, changes in personnel and structure from time to time.</P>
      <P>In regard to the appointments I have made of advisers and civil servants attached to my private office and the Government Information Service, the following are the details of these staff who assist me in dealing with the complexities and volume of Government business: Gerry Hickey &ndash; programme manager and special adviser; Martin Mansergh &ndash; special adviser on Northern Ireland, economic and social affairs; Gerard Howlin &ndash; special adviser; Una Claffey &ndash; political adviser. Peter MacDonagh, who works in my Department, is the social policy adviser to the Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion. He also works with the Ministers for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Health and Children and the relevant Ministers of State.</P>
      <P>Katherine Bulbulia is programme manager and special adviser to the Tánaiste but is based in my office. John Murray, deputy Government press secretary and head of the Government Information Services has recently tendered his resignation for personal reasons. Elizabeth Cogan is assistant to John Murray.</P>
      <P>The civil servants in my private office are Barbara Jones, who is involved in script writing and other duties, Olive Melvin, personal secretary, my private secretary &ndash; assistant principal, two assistant private secretaries &ndash; administrative officer and higher executive officer grades &ndash; and nine clerical officers. They provide the necessary support services to me in respect of my Dáil and Government responsibilities as well as maintaining my diary, processing correspondence and the general clerical services associated with a private office.</P>
      <P>The Government press secretary is Joe Lennon, a civil servant on secondment from the Department of Finance. There are currently five civil servants in the Government press service and a further six in the communications unit. The Government press service provides the necessary support services to the Government press secretary and the deputy Government press secretary in respect of their role in providing an effective and co-ordinated media service. The communications unit provides a comprehensive information service to Government Ministers and their Departments on Government policy initiatives and developments, and alerts them to any problems which may arise in relation to their implementation. In this way Departments are able to provide a better service to the public.</P>

Second, will he indicate whether there is a fixed percentage above which payment can be made to an adviser over the existing salary before he or she became an adviser and what is that percentage? Has the Taoiseach had a chance to <Col N="442" /> reflect further on the programme manager system? Certainly, it has not saved money since the consultancy rates of all the Ministers have increased &ndash; that of the Minister sitting beside the Taoiseach has increased considerably over previous consultants' rates. Will the Taoiseach consider again going back to the programme manager system as a more efficient way of delivering good government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a percentage for an individual taking up any of the posts from outside the public service or even where a public servant comes to work for a Minister. They are set down in regulations of some years ago. One is allowed take one's full package and what would be one's salary, overtime and special allowances, such as travel allowance, and one can get a figure on top of that package of about 10%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, of what one's full package would be. When one loses one's package, one can lose one's salary and remuneration, whether it is benefit in kind or whatever, and that is what creates the conflict.</P>
      <P>The argument between the Deputy and me on the programme managers only concerns the numbers involved. As I said here many times, their existence is not the issue. The Government has taken the view that the ratio is about 50:30 &ndash; in terms of the people contracted by the Governments of which the Deputy and I were part, there were more than 50 in one Government as against 30 in the other.

The Taoiseach has a number of political advisers in his party who probably have an amount of experience in politics &ndash; he has six sitting behind him, all of whom are paid less than the political adviser in his Department.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister who is on his way to Cairo. The position is that under the Agenda 2000 agreement, headage grants in the disadvantaged areas are to move from a payment per animal to a payment per hectare basis. This part of the agreement was well signalled at the time. Under transitional arrangements, the headage schemes as they have operated up to now will continue to apply for this year. A new area based scheme is to be introduced with effect from next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness a task force, representative of the Department and the main farming bodies, was established to formulate a new scheme. The task force met on a number of occasions and, having considered a range of options, the group recommended a scheme which would involve, <Col N="444" /><i>inter alia</i>, a payment per hectare depending on the type of livestock on the holding. It was envisaged that each livestock unit would attract one hectare payment. The group noted that any scheme which does not have a link to production produces winners and losers whereas the scheme proposed resulted in very little redistribution of aid.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced details of the proposed scheme on 29 May last. At the same time, he announced a £120 million increase in the overall allocation of money for disadvantaged area payments. That scheme took particular account of the difficulties facing sheep farmers in mountain areas. Effectively, the Minister increased the annual provision for compensatory allowances from £120 million to £140 million over the period 2001 to 2006. The proposed scheme was then submitted to the European Commission as part of the overall rural development plan.</P>
    <P>The Commission was unwilling to accept the scheme proposed mainly on the grounds that it did not represent a clear shift from headage related payments to area related payments. The Commission viewed the fact that each livestock unit would attract one per hectare payment as continuing the link to production. In these circumstances a number of alternative proposals were examined. The only scheme acceptable to the Commission is one which totally breaks the link to production.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>The scheme agreed in July and since approved by the European Commission provides for area related payments as follows: More severely handicapped lowland &ndash; £70 per hectare up to 45 hectares; less severely handicapped lowland &ndash; £60 per hectare up to 45 hectares; mountain type land &ndash; £45 per hectare up to 60 hectares.</P>
    <P>The Government has already committed some £360 million additional funding for the scheme over the period 2001 &ndash; 2006. The new arrangements involve a cost of £180 million in 2001, representing an increase of about £60 million over the current scheme. There are no losers this year since the existing schemes remain in place under the transitional arrangements. It is estimated that the number of farmers qualifying for payment under the new area based scheme will rise from the current 90,000 to 109,000 in 2001. From 2001, some 81,000 farmers stand to gain about £66 million annually while 28,000 farmers will incur some losses. I have, however, negotiated a compensation package for losers under which 90% of losses will be made good in 2001, 80% in 2002 and 50% in 2003. Under these arrangements, the average loss in 2001 will be about £32, rising to £64 in 2002.</P>
    <P>At the time the new scheme was agreed in July last, the Irish Farmers Association, in particular, acknowledged that the package was a balanced one backed by increased resources which is designed, as far as possible, to secure the incomes of vulnerable sectors including drystock farmers and both mountain and lowland sheep farmers. <Col N="445" /> They also acknowledged that the new package meets the commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness that the incomes of farmers dependent on disadvantaged area payments will be protected. The reality is that moving from an animal based payment system to an area based payment system, based solely on the disadvantaged status of the land, involves winners and losers.</P>
    <P>The Minister has asked his officials to carry out a review of the scheme to see if an equitable long-term solution can be found to the problem of reduced payments. As I indicated earlier, the average loss in 2001, for those farmers who stand to lose, will be about £32. The Minister's immediate priority, therefore, is to concentrate on putting arrangements in place for delivery of the new area based system in 2001. The Minister is anxious, however, to find an equitable solution to this issue and I hope a review can be carried out during the early part of next year.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that the scheme which was agreed in July and subsequently implemented does not deal with the problem, as evidenced by the information provided in the reply that the scheme will compensate 90% of the loss in 2001, 80% in 2002, 50% in 2003 and that farmers will have to bear the full loss thereafter? Does the Minister also agree that the impact of the scheme on hill farmers, particularly those who keep sheep and suckler cows, has been less than in other areas? Does he accept there is an urgent necessity for a further measure to specifically address the difficulties of people in mountain areas who keep sheep, particularly those who keep sheep and suckler cows?</P>

Ireland was the only country which fought against the area based payment. However, it was accepted by the partners in farming that this was the only way forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent decision by the Egyptian authorities to suspend the issue of import licences to western European countries, including Ireland, was taken to allow them take account of the BSE developments within the EU and to assess the measures and decisions being taken to deal with the situation. The developments I refer to relate to the situation in certain other member states and not to Ireland's situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that Egypt is our largest market world wide for Irish beef, the Government takes very seriously any situation which would jeopardise <Col N="447" /> that market and has taken immediate action to deal with the difficulty that has arisen. To begin with, our ambassador in Cairo has been in contact with the Egyptian authorities and has outlined the facts in relation to BSE in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development spoke with the Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister and Agriculture Minister Dr. Wali last week and impressed upon him the importance of the market to Ireland, the quality and safety controls in place in Ireland and the guarantees which can be given to consumers of Irish beef.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach raised this issue by phone with President Mubarak on Friday last and briefed him on the full facts about Irish beef exports and requested him to avoid taking definitive action which may damage this trade. Senior officials of my Department are currently in Egypt for meetings with high ranking Egyptian officials, during which they will outline in detail the level of BSE controls in place in Ireland. Their message to the Egyptians is that the controls offer the maximum possible assurances of safety to consumers of Irish beef.</P>
    <P>The Minister is currently on his way to Cairo to meet the Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister to bring him fully up-to-date on the situation and to further argue in favour of Ireland's extensive controls. He will also brief the Egyptians on the latest developments at EU level and the range of measures agreed to deal with BSE in Europe. Therefore, it is clear that every possible effort is being made to secure a lifting of the temporary suspension of licences in Egypt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Our good wishes go with the Minister and we hope his efforts will be successful, as they should be. Does he agree that the Government should consider taking action at EU level against France and Germany which failed to implement appropriate measures to minimise concern about BSE &ndash; measures such as SRM, comprehensive traceability, testing any group of animals in which an incident occurs and the ban on meat and bonemeal in ruminant rations? These measures have been in place in Ireland for the past four years. Why was a coherent strategy not introduced at EU level? Did the EU believe this matter was confined by borders? This is a trans-frontier, trans-border issue and should be tackled as such. Does the Minister agree we are paying for the sins of our EU neighbours who failed to take appropriate action? Does he also agree that Egypt is not greatly concerned about the safety of our beef but that its action was aimed at incidents which arose in another EU country? The Egyptian action is affecting Irish farmers, particularly winter fatteners who face impoverishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. N. O'Keeffe Mr. N. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the remarks made by Deputy Penrose. The situation first arose in mid-October when one of the major mul<Col N="448" /> tiples in France purchased livestock from a dealer or farmer which was found to include an animal with BSE. Things have snowballed since then across Europe. We are most affected as we have the largest volume of beef to export. The other countries produce sufficient beef for domestic supply. The problem has snowballed in places such as France and Germany to our disadvantage, and we are the major sufferers for that reason.</P>
      <P>I cannot say what action can be taken against both countries by the EU, be it legal or otherwise, but it is an issue of concern and will be followed up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the position that the Egyptian authorities have no quibble or complaint about the quality of Irish beef? The Taoiseach has had discussions with President Mubarak and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development had discussions with the Egyptian authorities prior to him visiting there today. Is it not the case that they are worried by the way in which other EU member states have handled the matter, which has precipitated the crisis? What steps can the Government take at national and EU level to compensate winter fatteners and beef finishers, the numbers of whom have been decreasing over the past few years and who have tried to survive this year? We are talking about a decrease of £100 per head while £800 million has been wiped off the value of stock. Does the Government anticipate bringing forward budgetary or other measures, complementing EU efforts, to ensure the survival of people who are threatened if they do not get help soon?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We supply two thirds of the Egyptian beef market, or between 157,000 and 160,000 tonnes, worth about £200 million. We are very aware of the difficulties of beef fatteners and that their number is becoming fewer each year and that we will have no off-season beef if some protection is not put in place. The Minister is on his way to Cairo and tonight he will meet Mr. Wali, the Deputy Prime Minister. There will be a beef management meeting in Brussels on 12 December 2000 which will discuss the mechanism for intervention. I take it they will also discuss the pricing arrangement and the animal destruct scheme, the scheme to deal with animals over 30 months who are found to be infected.</P>

      <P>Teagasc is an independent body. While it submits its review, once its finances are in order they can spend money in line with their own decision provided this is done in a proper manner. Last year, eight colleges got £180,000 each &ndash; Ballyhayes, Clonakilty, Gurteen, Kildalton, Mellowes, Mountbellew, Pallaskenry and Warrenstown &ndash; and Rockwell received £100,000.

      <P>Investigation of this condition has been in progress in Denmark for the past 12 months and a report was published in October 2000. Test procedures to identify animals that carry the defective gene are not yet freely available as they must first be patented in Denmark. However, my Department, in conjunction with the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, is keeping abreast of developments and is closely monitoring the situation with a view to minimising any risk that might arise. In this regard, the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation is well advanced in the development of a sophisticated IT database that will further facilitate the monitoring of CVM and other genetic defects.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that a number of bulls have been named as carriers of this disease. Apparently Jos, Mau, Lbo and Len are all top bulls and grandsons of Bell, the carrier of CVM &ndash; Complex Vertebral Malformation &ndash; in the Holstein breed. What steps is the Minister of State or the Minister taking to identify the position in Ireland? Is semen from those bulls <Col N="452" /> being given to farmers of the Holstein breed in Ireland? What steps are being taken to arrest this serious disease? As the Minister of State said in his reply this disease has been discovered only recently in Denmark. It is a serious disease and if it is detected here shortly we will have another serious disease side by side with BSE affecting the cattle breed.</P>

      <P>We are aware of the concerns expressed by the Deputy and everything possible is being done. I compliment the Deputy on his great knowledge of the bull sires that are standing at our AI centres. Great credit is due to the Deputy that he is so familiar with the breeds and the names of the Holstein bulls. There are about 12 sons of carrier bulls in the current Irish test programme. These may or may not be carriers themselves. Given that this problem has arisen only recently this is an important question. At present the only breed affected is the Holstein breed. The condition occurs when two such carriers are mated. In such an instance there is a 25% chance that the progeny will receive a copy of the defective gene from each parent. Where this happens such calves are usually malformed and may be stillborn. I understand that a national magazine &ndash; I apologise that I cannot recall its title &ndash; recently carried details and a news item on the disease. We are investigating all that information as well. I wish to allay any fears the Deputy may have that we are in any way neglecting our duties in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>

Will the Minister agree that more attention should be paid to our wider genetic base to safeguard the future of the Holstein breed? So far as I can see in-breeding is the cause of this disease which has recently been detected. Surely, it is in the interests of every farmer engaged in Holstein breeding that we diversify from this tight band of proven sires in the cattle breeding business. I urge the Minister to ensure every step is taken to nip this serious disease in the bud, otherwise there will be serious consequence for Irish farmers.</P>

      <P>A number of issues including the higher number of BSE cases in France and the recent confirmation of cases in Spain and Germany, have seriously affected consumer confidence in these and other countries. This situation has been exacerbated by unilateral action taken by a number of member states and most recently, the Egyptian authorities have decided to temporarily suspend imports from EU countries pending a clarification of the situation in Europe.   </P>
      <P>The problem has been tackled on three fronts. First, the Minister has endeavoured along with colleagues in the Agriculture Council, to restore consumer confidence in beef. Second, he has placed a strong emphasis on ensuring that appropriate market measures are put in place in order to alleviate the impact on producers. Third, we are endeavouring to ensure that all markets remain open to Irish beef.</P>
      <P>On the first point, he has endeavoured to secure the adoption of an EU wide approach to the BSE problem with a view to putting in place effective control measures which will prevent the spread of the disease and provide maximum protection to the consumer. The decisions taken in the Council yesterday should make a considerable contribution to the achievement of these objectives. The measures adopted are: a temporary ban on feeding of meat and bonemeal to all farm animals; animals over 30 months can go into the food chain only if tested; a &ldquo;purchase for destruction&rdquo; scheme to remove from the food chain all cattle over 30 months which have not yet been tested for BSE.</P>
      <P>I welcome these decisions and believe that, combined with the decision taken last month to require all cattle over 30 months of age to be tested for BSE with effect from 1 July 2001, they will provide an improved framework for protecting human health and restoring confidence in beef.</P>
      <P>So far as market support measures are concerned, I welcome the conclusion of the Council that it is essential to introduce intervention and I am confident an effective and meaningful intervention arrangement which can provide the basis for resumption of orderly marketing will be put in place at the meeting of the beef management committee meeting on 12 December 2000. The &ldquo;purchase for destruction&rdquo; scheme should also make a substantial contribution to improving market balance in the sector. The Commission has also given a commitment to the Council to examine the consequence of the current crisis of the producers and to report back to the Council with any appropriate proposals. The Council has undertaken to act on any such proposals as a matter of urgency. The Commission has also agreed to increase the advances of the beef premiums from 60% to 80% in order to ease the financial pressure on beef producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>The Commission has already increased export refunds and introduced a private storage aid <Col N="454" /> scheme for cows in order to provide additional support to the market. Export refunds have been increased by 15% in the case of male live cattle and beef and by 130% in the case of female beef. These changes are worth 5p per lb in the case of male beef and 9p per lb in the case of female beef and should significantly improve the competitiveness of our exporters on third country markets. A private storage scheme for cow beef has been introduced with effect from 27 November and will run until 2 February 2001. I have urged the beef processing sector to make maximum use of the scheme so that its full benefits will be available to Irish farmers who wish to sell cows over the coming months.</P>
    <P>With regard to export markets, my Department, our embassies abroad and Bord Bia have been very active in recent weeks in reassuring our customers in our major markets about the safety of Irish beef, the limited incidents of the disease in Ireland and the controls which have been put in place over the years ensure maximum protection of the consumer. The Government has at the highest level made every effort to ensure the Egyptian market remains open.</P>
    <P>In this context I cannot over emphasise the importance of the Egyptian market for Irish beef. For this reason, the Government takes very seriously the recent action by Egypt to suspend the issue of import licensees to Western European countries, including Ireland. The reason they have taken this decision is to allow them to take account of the developments within the EU related to BSE and to assess the measures and decisions being taken to deal with this situation. The developments to which I refer relate to the situation in certain other member states and not to Ireland's situation.</P>
    <P>The Government has taken immediate action to deal with the situation in Egypt. To begin with, our Ambassador in Cairo has been in contact with the authorities there and has outlined the facts of our situation in relation to BSE. Senior officials of my Department will travel to Egypt at the weekend for meetings with senior Egyptian officials. Ireland has an extremely positive case to make on BSE and these officials ensure that the Egyptian authorities were made fully aware of the controls we have in place.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Walsh, has spoken to the Deputy Prime Minister and Agriculture Minister Dr. Wali and has impressed upon him the importance of the market, the quality and safety controls in place in Ireland and the guarantees which can be given to consumers of Irish beef. He will also meet him to brief him on the range of measures which will be put in place within the EU to deal with BSE which I believe will help restore consumer confidence and eliminate much of the confusion which has arisen out of the recent BSE scares.</P>

The compensation procedures for the &ldquo;purchase for destruction&rdquo; scheme will also be put in place at the beef management committee meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for food is delegated to me under ministerial directive approved by the Government. I have been closely monitoring and working with the beef industry for the past three and a half years. I have travelled to practically all of Europe and to some third countries. During that period the Department has put in place a traceability system. We have spent in the region of £60 million putting in place that traceability and monitoring system. We have spent <Col N="456" /> a substantial amount of money on promotion through An Bord Bia in terms of subsidising and assisting that area. I should not use the word &ldquo;subsidising&rdquo;, but a substantial amount has been spent in the area of promotion.</P>
      <P>Up to last week or the week before, we won back markets in places like France to which our exports were down to practically zero &ndash; our exports are back up to 50,000 tonnes. We developed a new market in Italy to which we export more than 20,000 tonnes. We have two new markets in Holland to which we export 14,000 tonnes. These are approximate figures, as I did not expect I would be answering this question. We export approximately 14,000 tonnes to Sweden and we also have other small outlets. Our total beef exports are in the region of 500,000 tonnes. The Deputies can work out the figures &ndash; I am not 100 miles out on the figures I have given.</P>

      <P>Yes, Sir, and I hope you will agree it is a point of order. So far in priority questions today both Ministers of State have had to be pulled up in their tracks because their responses went over the limit laid down in our rules of procedure. Perhaps the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will use his good offices to ensure those who prepare the briefs in Departments will be asked to prepare less wordy briefs for their Ministers to ensure we can have some real discussion. In both cases today the Ministers have had to leave out substantial parts of their responses that do not appear on the record until after we have had the discussion here and we cannot come back to deal with them. It might be vain to do this, but I ask the Ministers of State and Ministers to take more care with their responses &ndash; if they ever look at them before they come into this House &ndash; to make sure they comply with the rules of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent flooding caused localised hardship to many people in both urban and rural areas. My Department's regional inspectors have reported that while many crops suffered from flooding, it is unlikely that lasting damage was done. The harvesting of root crops and the sowing of winter cereals has suffered significant disruption. As it would not have been appropriate to single out any particular section of the community for special attention, the Government initiated an <i>ex gratia</i> scheme of humanitarian assistance to relieve cases of severe hardship. The Irish Red Cross Society is implementing this scheme, details of which have been published in the national newspapers. The scheme will alleviate the most serious effects of the widespread flooding. The applications must be submitted before next Friday, 8 December 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that the Minister of State's reply means that no assessment has been carried out of the damage to agriculture? Will he indicate whether the scheme, as advertised by the Government, includes any element for damage to crops in the ground or for the losses that might arise from the inability to harvest those crops?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>As usual, Deputy Dukes is adopting a negative approach. The Department's regional inspectors submitted reports on the position in their areas of operation. They requested information on livestock losses, crop losses, damage to farm buildings and food storage, be it silage or hay. All that information was submitted. The job of doing this work has been given to the Irish Red Cross Society and it will be done on a humanitarian basis. Reports have been submitted in respect of each area affected by the flooding and Teagasc has indicated whether there was damage. In most of the crop cases, the damage was done already because there was such a high level of rainfall during September and October, which prevented the harvesting of crops, and in cases where the water would have run off within a week, it should not have done too much damage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that in response to a supplementary question the Minister of State has answered my first question. He indicated that certain assessments have been carried out. Has anyone done an evaluation to try to put together information that has come in to give us a reasonably accurate or indicative picture of the overall <Col N="458" /> extent of the losses? Does the scheme that has been advertised in the public papers, to which the Minister of State referred, include provision for compensation for damage or loss of crops in the ground or loss arising from the fact that crops cannot be harvested?</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development</askee>
      <Quest>the steps he will take to compensate the 7,284 farmers whose land is classified as mountain land and who are facing a reduction of £3.9 million annually in their disadvantaged area payments from 2001 onwards.</Quest>
      <QRef>[28275/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Agenda 2000 agreement the position is that headage grants in the disadvantaged areas are to move from a payment per animal to a payment per hectare basis. This part of the agreement was well signalled. Under transitional arrangements the headage schemes, as they have operated up to now, will continue to apply for this year. A new area based scheme is to be introduced with effect from next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As provided for in the Programme for Pros<Col N="459" /> perity and Fairness, a task force, representative of the Department and the main farming bodies, was established to formulate a new scheme. The task force met on a number of occasions and, having considered a range of options, the group recommended a scheme which would involve,<i> inter alia</i>, a payment per hectare depending on the type of livestock on the holding. It was envisaged that each livestock unit would attract one hectare payment. The group noted that any scheme, which does not have a link to production, produces winners and losers whereas the scheme proposed resulted in very little redistribution of aid. The Minister announced details of the proposed scheme on 29 May last and at the same time he announced a £120 million increase in the overall allocation of money for disadvantaged area payments. That scheme took particular account of the difficulties facing sheep farmers in mountain areas. Effectively, he increased the annual provision for compensatory allowances from £120 million to £140 million over the period 2001 to 2006. The proposed scheme was then submitted to the European Commission.</P>
    <P>The Commission was unwilling to accept this on the grounds that it did not represent a clear shift from headage related payments to area related payments. The Commission viewed the fact that each livestock unit would attract one per hectare payment as continuing the link to production. In these circumstances a number of alternative proposals were examined. The only scheme acceptable to the Commission is one which totally breaks the link to production.</P>
    <P>The Government has already committed £360 million extra to the fund. The Minister has, however, negotiated a compensation package for losers under which 90% of losses will be made good in 2001, 80% in 2002 and 50% in 2003. Under these arrangements the average loss in 2001 will be about £32 rising to £64 in 2002. He has asked my officials to carry out a review of the scheme to see if an equitable long-term solution can be found to the problem of reduced payments, both in mountain and other areas. As I indicated, these losses will be about £32 in the first year. The Minister's immediate priority, therefore, is to concentrate on putting arrangements in place for delivery of the new area based system in 2001. He is anxious to find an equitable solution to this issue. It is hoped the review will be carried out early next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not happy with the Minister of State's reply. It is a pity the Minister himself is not here but, as we know, he is away on more serious business. It is evident that there are 7,284 farmers in mountain areas in the country with losses totalling £3.9 million by virtue of the changeover from headage payments to area-based payments.</P>

Has it been written into the regulations of the Department that this compensation will be paid or will it be deferred as the years go by? We do not know.</P>

      <P>That is what the Minister wants to do &ndash; to set up a review group to look at this. The only scheme in which there are no losers is where the most severely handicapped area land would attract a payment of £95 per hectare while less severely handicapped land would attract a payment of approximately £90 per hectare. The payment of £95 per hectare in the MSH areas would be required in order to claim a differential between MSH and the LSH. That is one of the difficulties here but I assure Deputies that the Minister is interested in achieving balance in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the position that those small farmers are all in a category that will lose out? That is the antithesis of what should be achieved in relation to the payments system. Will the Minister of State ensure that from 2003 onwards they will be looked after?</P>
      <P>The Government depends on Independent Deputies. Is it true that those Deputies have been agitating for this to be sorted out or are they toothless tigers when it comes to fighting for a national issue which affects the mountainous areas of the country, an issue on which it is vital they fight? Have they capitulated on this matter?</P>

      <P>To give Deputies another figure, the 5,330 farmers who are exclusively involved in sheep farming will see their annual payments increase from £5 million to approximately £8.3 million under the new area-based system. There will be an increase of £956 to £1,159 in the average payout to farmers. Some intensively stocked farmers involved exclusively in seed production will be losers because they will have less than 49 hectares. The hill sheep farmers will, in general, be in those mixed sheep and suckler enterprises. We are trying to find a balance to that, something that will encourage them to stay on the land. I assure Deputies of the Minister's sincere interest in this matter. He has already instructed officials to start preparing the groundwork for an early review in the new year.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development</askee>
      <Quest>if he has made any protest to the French Government concerning its failure to prevent the feeding of meat and bone meal to ruminants, thereby sparking the latest unease about BSE; if he will take steps to ensure that new action by the French Government does not unfairly disadvantage Irish beef exports; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[28414/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. N. O'Keeffe Mr. N. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Recent public concerns in relation to BSE derive from a number of recent events in Europe where a number of issues including the publication of the Phillips report, the higher number of cases in France and the confirmation of cases in Spain and Germany seriously affected consumer confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council of Agriculture Ministers moved swiftly to re-establish a Community approach to <Col N="462" /> dealing with the problem of BSE. The intention was to obviate the need for unilateral action by member states which only serves to give rise to disproportionate alarm among consumers both in Europe and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I have made my position clear on these issues in the discussions in the Council which reached agreement yesterday on a range of conclusions aimed at protecting public health and restoring consumer confidence in beef. The conclusions also provided for the introduction of support for the beef market. The measures include a temporary ban on feeding of meat and bone meal to all farm animals; animals over 30 months going into the food chain only if tested for BSE; a purchase for destruction scheme to remove from the food chain all cattle over 30 months which have not yet been tested for BSE; and the introduction of intervention purchasing.</P>
    <P>I welcome these decisions. Combined with the decision taken last month to require all cattle over 12 months of age to be tested for BSE with effect from 1 July 2001, this will provide an improved framework for protecting human health and in restoring confidence in beef. It was essential that this particular Council reached a successful conclusion and that the full range of issues which had arisen from the most recent BSE crisis were adequately addressed. I am planning for the introduction of an expanded testing regime at the earliest possible date. The resultant restoration of consumer confidence is the critical first step in achieving market balance. I accept that the Irish beef sector has suffered disproportionately in the current crisis and I have brought this to the attention of my colleagues. The sector stands to gain most from a restoration of confidence especially in high volume markets.</P>
    <P>I was particularly concerned to have adequate market support and I am confident that I have secured agreement for an effective and meaningful intervention arrangement which can provide the basis for a resumption of orderly marketing. The commitment by the Commission to look at the consequences of this current crisis for producers was also important from an Irish perspective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I found it difficult to keep up with the Minister of State's speed of delivery. I invite him to answer my question. Has he made any protest to the French Government about the fact that it was its negligence and refusal to implement the kinds of measures we implemented in 1996 that directly gave rise to the latest turn of the screw in this crisis? Will the Minister of State answer the next part of my question, which relates to taking steps to ensure that new action by the French Government does not unfairly disadvantage Irish beef exports? Will he take account of the fact that that French Government has a most disreputable record? It was the Government which stood by while French farmers blocked the importation of Irish beef on the grounds that it was a danger to the health of <Col N="463" /> French consumers. It stood by and took no action while that same danger to French consumers was cultivated on French farms. Is the Minister of State aware of these problems and is he doing anything to prevent them recurring?</P>

      <P>The three issues raised by Deputy Dukes are matters of concern and have been raised. The question of the French disadvantaging Irish beef is one of which we are well aware and it has been highlighted. The difficulties the French have created for Irish beef and its export potential as well as the French mishandling of both BSE and the whole sector of disease have created real problems for Ireland. We are aware of that and it has been highlighted at Council of Ministers meetings by the Minister and the Commissioner, who has spoken out clearly about the two countries in Europe which are creating problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that the French have been the greatest proponents of renationalisation policies? What steps is he taking with Bord Bia and other agencies to ensure the rush to renationalisation &ndash; protectionism in another form &ndash; does not take place? After all, it has certainly been our <i>betes noire </i>and we have behaved like meek lambs while it renationalises and protects its industries. Does the Minister of State agree we have been too good as Europeans?</P>

      <P>It is important for us to be good Europeans because we are beneficiaries and we have done well in the European Union. When I travelled to food fairs and different shows throughout Europe it was always an embarrassment to me to see what France had on view in terms of traceability and the systems it had in place. It was very distinguished in the way it handled its business in terms of the show pieces, the scale and the details of traceability. It was an embarrassment to me because we could not put in place something similar, but I have now found that our traceability systems are much better than those in France and the Deputy's question is very relevant&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>My officials have had productive discussions with officials of the Department of the Environment and Local Government on the potential implications for REPS farmers of the introduction of environmental by-laws by local authorities. The making of such by-laws, however, is a power devolved to local authorities. Furthermore, the circumstances may differ from one local authority area to another and, as a result, the provisions of the by-laws will not be uniform. My Department has sought legal opinion on the implications of the by-laws, which may have an effect on REPS payments. On receipt of this, we will approach the local authorities directly to explain the issues and to seek their agreement to consult my Department when preparing such by-laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that 14 local authorities are planning to introduce by-laws and that two others have already done so? Is the Minister of State aware that all of these proposed by-laws are different? Is he aware that at least one local authority has made a number of schemes conditional on farms having a lower P level on their land than is now required under the REPS? Does the Minister of State agree it is essential there is some co-ordination between the by-laws adopted by local authorities and the provisions of the REP scheme in order to avoid having possibly up to 27 separate sets of requirements around the country for the REP scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The lack of uniformity was referred to in the earlier part of the reply. Longford, Offaly, Tipperary North Riding, Westmeath, Mayo and Leitrim County Councils are proposing similar by-laws. Leitrim has decided not to introduce such by-laws in areas of high risk because it believes existing powers can deal with the issue. Westmeath County Council's proposed by-laws do not exempt REPS participants. North Tipperary county council has received submissions for a draft and the current proposals do not exclude REPS participants. Offaly County Council is considering whether to make by-laws on the subject. Mayo County Council is proposing by-laws and farmers who wish to purchase <Col N="466" /> phosphorous fertiliser under those by-laws will have to obtain a permit from the county council.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is right about the lack of uniformity in regard to the standards but I am glad the Deputy has raised this issue because we are in danger of losing REPS payments from Europe should this continue. I would be grateful if the Deputy, the members of the Labour Party and our own party would ensure that they consult with our Department on some uniform system throughout the country because the standards include 16 weeks slurry holding, 12 weeks slurry holding, 20 weeks slurry holding&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have a problem with not having a debate on item No. 19 which concerns a code of practice for civil servants. Before we lay down standards for others we should be sure we can impose adequate standards on ourselves. It is with the greatest regret that I say the position of the Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, has caused serious problems in the promotion of food safety. I am referring to the gap between his public statements as a Minister of State and the difficulties which have apparently been encountered in a facility in which he has an interest in living up to the standards. Is the Minister for Education and Science satisfied that the position of the Minister of State does not cause difficulty for us in promoting food abroad, given that the difficulties have been advertised widely throughout Europe in a very competitive market in a manner which is damaging to the interests of Ireland as a place which sells safe food?</P>

Before we deal with this issue, will the Minister for Education and Science, on behalf of the Government, deal with the validity of the scheme of licensing meat and bone meal when the person charged under an order of the Government with administering it, the Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, had an undisclosed financial interest in it?</P>

The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform had to face similar questions in regard to a vehicle within his charge. I ask the Minister to bring this matter to a head so that there is consistency in Government.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister for Education and Science agree that there is escalating anxiety among parents and students over the secondary school strike? As the oral exams are to be held in February, there is a risk that if this dispute is not settled before Christmas the entire leaving certificate will be undermined next year. Is the Minister willing to accept the Fine Gael proposal, put forward by Deputy Kenny, for the establishment of a commission on teaching, similar to the Commission on Nursing which was successful in settling a dispute in that profession? The issues concerning teachers are not confined simply to pay, but also concern the operation of the profession as a whole, working conditions and other matters which would be of benefit to parents, such as greater information for parents and the upgrading of the profession. The best way to deal with these matters would be through a commission on teaching, as Deputy Kenny has proposed on behalf of Fine Gael. Has the Minister considered the proposal and is he prepared to endorse it so that we can move towards settling this potentially very damaging dispute. A whole generation of young people's careers may be blighted by this dispute.</P>

      <P>This is eighth day during which the country's school children have been denied their right to education. The presence of 12,000 teachers in Molesworth Street this afternoon is an indication of the anger they feel at the Government's dismissive treatment. The teachers are offering an olive branch and have held out the prospect of resolving the dispute at an early stage. They are simply looking for a forum in which issues of concern can be discussed and resolved. The Minister for Education and Science has political responsibility for resolving this matter. Is he prepared to take an initiative this week to ensure that such a forum or mechanism can be put in place at an early stage so that the issues concerned can be dealt with satisfactorily? Will he do that as a matter of urgency?</P>

      <P>As Deputies will know, I met yesterday with the ASTI's president, vice-president, general secretary and deputy general secretary to listen to their views. As Deputies will be aware also, discussions concerning the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness were still in progress at that stage. The ASTI strongly reiterated its view that the independent body provided for under the PPF, and presided over by a judge, is not adequate to address the issues in the current dispute or the reasons for its continuing action. Subsequent to that, the PPF was adjusted last night in the agreement between the social partners. It will now deliver a cumulative increase in take-home pay of 32.6% for teachers. In addition, the <Col N="477" /> agreement provides that one quarter of any increase arising from the report of the benchmarking body will be implemented with effect from 1 December 2001.</P>
      <P>These were among the issues the ASTI raised with me in the four points it wishes to have considered. The four points on which its claim is based are payment for productivity, an adjustment to close the gap which has developed between the salaries of teachers and those of other comparable graduate grades, compensation for cost of living increases and a share in economic prosperity. It is quite clear that under the PPF, the social partners are dealing with each one of these issues. There is an independent forum to deal with those issues and in that general context I am anxious to find any solutions that can be found to the present difficulties.</P>

      <P>In page 5, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;a claim of a class' means any claim based on similar circumstances pursued by either a group or by individuals;&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan is correct. Amendment No. 1 proposes to define &ldquo;a claim of a class&rdquo;. On Committee Stage I pointed out that my advice was that it was not necessary. I have checked the matter since then and have again been advised that there is no need to define &ldquo;a claim of a class&rdquo;. The expression is used only once in the Bill and that is in the definition of &ldquo;delegated claim&rdquo; in section 6. All references of this nature in the Bill are to classes of claims or a class of delegated claims. A class of claim, for example, Army deafness claims or assault claims, is easily understood and this was accepted in the <Col N="484" /> debate on Committee Stage. It was, however, considered necessary to define a claim and a counter claim so there would be clarity about the type of claim and counter claim which could be managed by the State Claims Agency. These are defined in sections 6 and 7.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 5 would exclude from the definition of a claim in section 7(1) any class of claim which might be prescribed by the Minister for Finance. I am satisfied that there are sufficient provisions in the Bill to meet the purpose of this amendment. Delegation orders to be made by the Government under section 9(1) will cover claims or classes of claims. Such orders can be revoked or amended to remove certain classes of claims or, if necessary, to put them in. This is the correct way to deal with the issue rather than give the Minister the power to prescribe that a class of claims be excluded. In these circumstances, I can not accept the amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made my case for me. He said the expression &ldquo;a claim of a class&rdquo; appears only once in the Bill. It is not something I have seen previously. If something only appears once in a Bill and is a unique expression in Irish law, it requires definition, and I was attempting to define it. If it means a class of a claim, which appears to be the burden of the Minister's argument, why not change the term to &ldquo;a class of a claim&rdquo;, &ldquo;a class action&rdquo; or &ldquo;a class claim&rdquo;. The expression &ldquo;a claim of a class&rdquo; is new. It requires definition so people will understand what it means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's point but my advice is that it is not necessary to define it in the Bill. I asked about it because I could understand the argument he made on Committee Stage. I was concerned about it. If a definition was required on the basis of the Deputy's argument, I would have put one down on Report Stage. My advice, however, is that it is not necessary.</P>

The effect of that is to equip the Minister with greater flexibility to enable him to deal with any unforeseen circumstances by way of regulation.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred me to section 9(1)(<i>b</i>) which appears to confer that power on the Minister. It states: &ldquo;An order under paragraph (<i>a</i>) may exempt any class of claims against all or any of the State authorities from the delegation effected by the order&rdquo;.

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to amend the definition of a claim to exclude a claim involving a question of the validity of any law having regard to the provisions of the Constitution. It is based on an amendment put down by Deputy McDowell on Committee Stage which I promised to examine further.</P>
      <P>Members will agree that claims which raise constitutional issues are not appropriate to be handled by a claims agency. It might be argued that the existing provisions of the Bill are sufficient to ensure that such claims will not fall within the definition of a claim. A claim has to be one which is wholly or mainly one for compensation or damages for personal injury or property loss. The key word in the present context is &ldquo;mainly&rdquo;. A claim with an incidental element additional to compensation or damages would meet the definition of a claim but a claim which involved a constitutional issue would not or would be extremely unlikely to meet it. This amendment will remove any doubt that might exist in the matter.</P>
      <P>The amended definition will not, however, apply to claims under section 12(4), the subject of amendment No. 12 which deals with the background of persons who may be appointed to the policy committee. This is to ensure that claims referred to in that subsection relate to claims generally rather than to the restricted definition of claims of this section for the purpose of claims management by the agency. Deputy McDowell sought clarity on this matter on Committee Stage and I have responded positively.</P>

      <P>This amendment is in response to the points made by Deputy Noonan during the debate on Committee Stage in relation to the reserve functions of local authorities. We had some lengthy discussion on it. I undertook on that occasion to come back to the matter on Report Stage. The amendment will ensure that claims against a local authority can be delegated to the agency only following a request from it and with the consent of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. The amendment is framed so that it can cover other bodies which fall under paragraph<i> (j)</i> of the definition of State authority in section 7(1). Any of those bodies which have autonomy for the way in which they expend resources under their governing legislation must comply with the legislation and rules governing that expenditure, which is essentially the point well made by Deputy Noonan on Committee Stage. In the normal course, if they have autonomy in the way in which they spend funds provided by them, they have autonomy in how they deal with claims against them. The Bill does not effect amendment of the legislation governing such bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph <i>(j)</i> of the definition of State authority is an enabling provision. It simply acts in parallel, putting in place a mechanism to allow such bodies to be covered should they, in accord<Col N="487" /> ance with their own legislation &ndash; for example in the case of local authorities &ndash; choose to request to be brought within the ambit of the agency and should the Minister decide that it is appropriate to accede to that request.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>This arose on Committee Stage when I suggested to the Minister by way of amendment that if one looks at the manner in which local authorities operate, their functions are divided. As every Member of the House who has served as a member of a local authority knows, their functions are divided into reserve functions and executive functions. The expenditure of money is a reserve function. Money can only be spent after the elected members have voted that it should be spent, either by way of special vote or by way of voting for the Book of Estimates. The settlement of a claim would be analogous because there would be a payment of money by a local authority to an individual claimant. It seemed that this would require the assent of the local authority and the permission of the Minister before it could be dealt with by the National Treasury Management Agency acting as the claims agency for the State.</P>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's amendment, will he clarify whether he envisages a local authority ceding its right to settle insurance claims by means of a once-off decision so that they could say that any action taken against them in the future above a certain amount or above a certain level of claim will be dealt with by the claims agency or is he saying that his amendment will require an individual decision on the basis of each individual claim or class of claim being delegated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>My interpretation is that it is on a case by case basis. I do not see a unilateral declaration being made in the way the Deputy has put it. It would be imprudent of the local authorities to take a blanket view on the passing of this legislation. I imagine there may be particular cases where a judgment call would be made by the local authorities so I do not necessarily see it being forever and a day, that they would have all those claims dealt with exclusively on that basis.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I will try to be as clear as I can for the Deputy. Perhaps I put it badly to him. This amendment clearly gives the local authorities the power to make that decision. My view is that they will make that decision on a case by case basis. That is what I was essentially saying. That was the intent of the discussion that the Deputy also had with me on Committee Stage and that is precisely what I tried to recognise in that. I do not want to spancel them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to understand this. Is the Minister saying there would be no merit in a situation where up to a certain level of claim the authority would devolve to the agency? Would it not be a more efficient way of dealing with it? For example, up to a District Court limit, would it not be more sensible if that was devolved to the agency, having whatever access is necessary to the local authority in terms of documentation, advice and so on? Is there not some merit in devolving that to the agency rather than it still having to go through the fairly unwieldy process of case by case call by the local authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy probably would agree, speaking from the perspective of the House, that I should not prescribe or put limits, even small limits, on local authorities. In a general sense, the State Claims Agency will deal with the claims and it will be more in a specific type of case that the local authority may want to take a view. It is not necessary for us, for the Government or the House, in legislation, to prescribe that. There may be particular issues that could arise irrespective of the size of the claim that may warrant a particular course of action to be taken and I want to give that flexibility to the local authority. That was based on a fairly wide-ranging discussion we had on this matter on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 7 not moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 39, to delete &ldquo;level.&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;level after the special circumstances of any claim or a claim of a class have been taken into account by the Agency.</P>
      <P>(4) The Government may advise the Agency when, in their opinion, the special circumstances of a claim or a claim of a class should be taken into account.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This proposes to amend page 9, line 39, section 8(3). In effect, section 8(3) mandates the agency to settle claims at the lowest achievable level. I raised this previously on Committee Stage. Once the agency is mandated to settle at the lowest achievable level, it is not possible for the agency to <Col N="489" /> take other considerations into account. I put it to the Ministers that there would be particularly meritorious cases where the Government of the day or a particular Department or Minister would think that to err on the side of generosity would be not only just but also prudent. This will prevent the agency from erring on the side of generosity.</P>
    <P>Anybody who was listening to the accounts of the proceedings before the Lindsay tribunal, for example, could envisage a situation where if claims were to ensue from the hearings before that tribunal, it might be the wish of everybody here that the claimants be dealt with in the most generous possible fashion. This subsection precludes such generosity on behalf of the Executive and would leave an Executive with no option but to withdraw the claim or class of claim from the agency and either settle it in the courts or by negotiation. This would defeat the purpose of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another issue arises also. The issues of either aggravated damages or punitive damages in terms of Irish case law are not particularly well formulated in this jurisdiction. Yet aggravated damages and punitive damages are areas of claim where there is particularly strong case law in the United States and extensive case law in the United Kingdom. This will be part of claims here in the future. The claims have been made in a number of cases in the past but there is little enough case law on which one could draw to decide whether the precedents are sufficiently strong to see whether such claims would be applicable to a particular claim.</P>
    <P>Given the current development of law in these areas, it would seem to me that if the agency were to be mandated to settle at the lowest achievable level, it could not consider the type of argument which would be made before a court for punitive or aggravated damages and, consequently, would be inhibited from reaching settlements. I did not table an amendment to this section on Committee Stage but, on reflection, I believe the Minister of State should take the amendment into account, if not today, then prior to his visit to the Seanad. The agency should be able to deal with claims based on aggravation or punitive considerations in addition to the type of claims with which we are familiar. That would be specifically excluded by this subsection.</P>
    <P>This is an important policy point. Claims based on punitive or aggravated damages are likely to become the norm in this jurisdiction in the near future and the Minister may be excluding a range of claims with which he foresees the agency dealing by not including the type of provision in section 8(3) which is proposed in this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand where the Deputy is coming from but I do not believe the amendment is necessary. Even if it were accepted, I am not sure it would have any practical effect. The agency, in managing claims, must take account of the circumstances in each case, irrespective of <Col N="490" /> whether special circumstances apply. I do not believe it is necessary to include the type of provision proposed in the amendment. There is already ample provision in the Bill to deal with any situations which arise in which Ministers would wish to give directions to the agency in terms of general policy or guidelines as to the performance of its claims management functions. This is provided for in section 15.</P>
      <P>The agency will not be dealing with the type of cases mentioned during the Committee Stage debate in which special circumstances apply, cases such as hepatitis C where a compensation tribunal is sitting, cases involving an autistic child and its rights in regard to education and cases of institutional child abuse, in regard to which the Minister for Education and Science has already announced the establishment of a compensation board.</P>
      <P>The agency will deal with claims for compensation or damages for personal injury or property damage. These claims, which are of a routine and recurring nature, will be dealt with by the agency in an efficient and cost effective manner. I emphasise that the agency will also deal with such issues in a fair and reasonable manner. We argued that point on Committee Stage when I pointed out that the circumstances of a claim will obviously be taken into account in making a settlement.</P>
      <P>I reiterate the comments I made in response to the Second Stage debate. I have no doubt that cases will arise which will involve sensitive issues or in which injury will be caused, through negligence on the State's part. I assure Deputies that in such circumstances, the agency will deal with claimants in a fair and sympathetic manner. I have already referred to the fact that the Minister of the day can issue directions and guidelines to the agency.</P>
      <P>There is general agreement that the present arrangements for handling the type of claims with which the agency will deal are unsatisfactory and that a new approach is required to put in place a structured and coherent response. Much has been said about the existence of a compensation culture in this country. There is a feeling that the State, the taxpayer, is being ripped off. It is entirely reasonable that the agency should be mandated to manage claims in such a way as to ensure that the State's liability and expenses are contained at the lowest achievable level. Therefore, I can not accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>It appears to me that section 8(3) is very restrictive. The Minister of State said in respect of a previous amendment that the Government or the House should not be prescriptive in these matters. If the agency is to be charged with the management of delegated claims and must achieve the lowest possible level of expenses, etc. in connection with that management, that is a statutory requirement which would not leave the agency with any flexibility in particular circumstances which could arise. I take the <Col N="491" /> point that the hepatitis C issue was not such a circumstance.</P>
      <P>Surely, nobody can anticipate what other set of circumstances may arise with which, in the agency's view, it would be sensible, fair and just for it to deal, while perhaps not entirely conforming to the requirement to contain expenses and management costs to the State at the lowest achievable level. There should be some flexibility in this regard as it is very difficult to anticipate all the circumstances which may arise.</P>
      <P>It goes without saying that the purpose of this exercise is that, <i>inter alia</i>, it will achieve efficiencies which have not existed heretofore given the diffuse manner in which such claims have been handled through the Office of the Chief State Solicitor. It should not be necessary to state that that is the Bill's purpose. The Minister of State appears to be saying that the section is required because it is necessary to state clearly that the State should get good value for money. I would have thought that was the Bill's obvious purpose and that the statutory invocation of section 8(3) could well give rise to a situation in which there would not be any flexibility in circumstances which, as yet, may be unforeseen but which will, indisputably, arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the comments made by Deputy Rabbitte. What is the purpose of including this subsection at all? Its inclusion will make flexibility difficult to achieve, particularly in such circumstances as outlined by Deputy Noonan. If the subsection were omitted altogether, the legislation would not be weakened in any way. The NTMA has performed its duties in an exemplary fashion to date and I cannot foresee it going off the rails and settling claims at levels above that which one would consider prudent. The subsection could cause problems in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State's reply has created more difficulties for me because he suggested that the claims agency's principal work would be the settlement of hundreds, if not thousands, of the routine claims made against Government Departments and agencies on a yearly basis, whether or not those who run the Departments and agencies are actually negligent.</P>
      <P>I recall when the former Attorney General, Dermot Gleeson, first discussed this matter with me. Our discussions arose from the claims being made by members of the Defence Forces. The genesis of this Bill lies in claims of the nature of the Defence Force claims which caused great anxiety at the time. The Government of the day and its successor wondered how these claims could be settled in any kind of prudent or realistic manner. This is not about the multiplicity of accidents which occur across Government Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This relates precisely to what we are discussing. Deputy Barrett has put his finger on it. If the <Col N="492" /> Minister's argument stands up, then subsection 8(3) is not necessary because the intention is the agency will settle in a way that is more efficient and less expensive then processing claims individually. The subsection states that &ldquo;the agency shall manage delegated claims and counterclaims in such manner as to ensure . the lowest achievable level&rdquo;. However, in whose opinion will this be achieved? If it is in the opinion of the agency, then the provision is redundant. However, if it is in the opinion of the Department of Finance, subsection 8(3) allows the Department to second guess settlements made by the agency.</P>
    <P>If that is the purpose of the subsection then there is an attempt by the Minister's advisers to subvert the thrust of the Bill, which should not happen. Responsibility is either being given to the agency, in line with the reporting mechanisms in the Bill and the consultations provided for, or it is not. Who will make the call? In whose opinion will a claim be settled at the lowest achievable level? The subsection talks about the State's liability as well as the State's expenses. The actual amount of the claim and the expenses needed to settle it are in question here.</P>
    <P>This is something of a Trojan horse, with the Department of Finance second guessing the claims agency. It runs counter to the principle of the Bill and the subsection should be dropped.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the arguments, and apart from legal advice or advice from officials, I disagree with what has been said. The arguments being put forward presuppose that the people involved in the claims agency and those negotiating any settlement would not have the capacity to come to a fair and reasonable settlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary that is my point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the view, and Members on both sides have expressed the view quite vociferously in recent years in the context of various matters and costs to the State, that there should be terms of reference in the Bill and that the State, taking account of the fact that they are reasonable and fair, should ensure protection for the taxpayer and seek to settle these matters at a reasonable level while taking account of the lowest achievable level. I do not see anything wrong or contradictory in this. So what if, as the three Deputies opposite have said, it inserts specific terms of reference into the Bill? We are guardians of the taxpayers' money.</P>
      <P>I take on board what has been said and that there will be circumstances in which they will have to be fair and reasonable, but every case will be different. There will be very low and very high levels of claims and settlements. We, as legislators, should include some terms of reference in the Bill in order that we do not have an open, free-for-all in terms of the possible liability of the State.</P>
      <P>We should bear in mind that if somebody is not satisfied with the settlement they have the option of recourse to the courts, which I am sure some will exercise.</P>

      <P>In page 14, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) The Minister shall appoint a person to be a member of the Policy Committee only if he or she has substantial expertise and experience at a senior level in any of the following&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) the management of legal claims,</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) litigation under the law relating to civil liability,</P>

      <P>(<i>h</i>) trade union matters.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is based on Deputy Noonan's amendment No. 13, which was discussed on Committee Stage. Both amendments draw on section 7 of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act, 2000, in relation to members of the commission provided for in that legislation. The areas specified in amendment No. 12 from which members of the policy committee are to be appointed are those which are considered to be appropriate and relevant to the policy committee whose functions under subsection (1) is to advise the agency on policy and procedures in relation to the performance of its claims management functions. This amendment is a response to Deputy Noonan's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment substantially meets the point I raised. I tabled a similar amendment on Committee Stage, as in a parallel Bill dealing with the national pensions fund a similar provision was included to restrict the Minister from appointing members of the commission &ndash; a central part of that Bill &ndash; unless they had particular expert knowledge of their areas of responsibility. The Minister said it was a new departure and he envisaged that would happen regarding other Bills. It should happen in terms of this one as this amendment is tabled by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="496" /> Another issue raised concerning the other Bill was that the consumer interest should also be included. The Minister subsequently tabled an amendment on Report Stage to include the consumer interest in that Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. My amendment, which is along the same lines as the Minister's, includes the consumer interest, but it has been dropped from the Minister's amendment. If it decided to confine persons who will be members of the policy committee to persons with a particular expertise, the Minister's amendment runs very well down to subsection (4)(<i>g</i>). People with a particular expertise could be found in the public service, but it does not necessarily follow that the public servant appointed would have a particular interest. In terms of trade union matters, the subsection is widened to include a representative of the trade union movement. The Minister accepted the point that if a person who is expert in trade union matters is included, that category is not of the same level of expertise as the other trade descriptions. He said that I was right and that logically he should also include consumers. He went on to amend the section and include them. The Minister of State has, however, removed them from this subsection. Will he include them? Can he add paragraph (<i>i</i>) to his amendment and include the phrase regarding consumers used in the other Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to establish the National Training Fund. The fund will support a range of training initiatives aimed at the employed and those seeking to enter or return to employment. The establishment of the fund is part of a wider strategy for the promotion of human resource development in response to the social and competitiveness challenges now facing us.</P>
      <P>We are living in the midst of a period of unprecedented economic growth. We are experiencing the positive effects of reformed public finances, increased competition, a pro-enterprise environment, a successful and focused industrial policy, low taxation, and long run investment in initial education and vocational training.</P>
      <P>Globally, we have experienced growing and increasingly diverse trade and a dispersal of the factors of production. We have seen the growth of the knowledge economy and the shift from &ldquo;bricks to clicks&rdquo;, as it has been called. We have witnessed the growth and consolidation of the European Union as a trading bloc. In Ireland we have been fortunate to experience the confluence of these two rivers of change, national and global. The steps we have taken to put our own house in order have allowed us to gain enormously from globalisation and the knowledge economy. This is why we attract 27% of all US green field investment in Europe. It is why we are the largest exporter of software globally and it is why young dynamic Irish companies are now beginning to penetrate the technology powerhouse of the US.</P>
      <P>Change has fostered prosperity but that very prosperity and the change which has fuelled it brings new challenges and new uncertainties. We are now at the point of full employment when viewed in classical economic terms. We are also on the cusp of a significant change in demographics, where the numbers of new entrants to the labour force will fall from 27,000 this year to under 12,000 by 2008. Concurrently, we will be faced with significant labour and skills requirements to service the expanding economy and address infrastructural deficits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These changes place the spotlight firmly on the issue of productivity. Traditionally, productivity has been thought about in simple efficiency terms. However, as Professor Michael Porter points out, at the national level productivity has a much more strategic meaning. It reflects the way in which we use our national resources, the quality of our people, the opportunities facing them and their ability to innovate and move to higher levels of economic advantage. Productivity has traditionally been seen as being the province of manufacturing where the number of hypotheti<Col N="499" /> cal &ldquo;widgets&rdquo; produced by each worker can be easily measured but productivity, especially when seen from a broader perspective, is equally applicable to the services sector. Higher quality services can command a higher price and thus support higher living standards among those employed in the services sector.</P>
    <P>It is a cliché that Ireland needs to move up the value chain but it is one which bears repeating and expansion. Put at its simplest, Ireland cannot sustain developed economy wage levels with a developing country's base of goods and services outputs. This poses an enormous challenge for us. We have made it into the premier division but now we need to stay there. We need to consolidate our position in an era of increasing competition and external pressures such as rising oil prices.</P>
    <P>I said that we have reached what would be described as full employment in terms of classical economics but we need to treat this concept of &ldquo;full employment&rdquo; very cautiously. It has some validity in that levels of unemployment below 4% send unequivocal signals that the labour market is becoming very tight. It tells us that there are attendant potential pressures on wages and competitiveness and that we cannot be complacent. However, it categorically does not tell us that we have solved the unemployment problem, nor does it tell us anything about the levels of employment which we have the potential to achieve.</P>
    <P>As far as unemployment and underemployment is concerned, we still have 52,000 people who are short-term unemployed and 28,000 people who are long-term unemployed. In addition to these people who indicate that they are unemployed in response to the Labour Force survey, we also have a significant group of some 80,000 people who are &ldquo;marginally attached&rdquo; to the workforce. In all, this represents a number of people who could benefit from work.</P>
    <P>Many people find themselves in unemployment because of structural changes in the economy which devalue their existing skills set. People who left the education system early with marginal skills in the first place are demonstrably the most vulnerable in times of economic downturn. Also, one consequence of moving up the value chain is that even the highly skilled of one era can become the unemployed of the next. In all cases, the evidence shows that the longer one remains unemployed, the less likely one is to find and secure a job. The quality of the training programmes we offer can be a critical determining factor in helping people back into employment.</P>
    <P>Those services themselves have to respond to labour market conditions. Given our low levels of unemployment, we are now in a position to more precisely identify and target the training needs of unemployed people. In many cases these can encompass quite basic skills such as literacy and numeracy, as well as a need to provide entirely new skills to people whose existing skills set is no <Col N="500" /> longer marketable. The National Training Fund will support this approach.</P>
    <P>As well as people who are unemployed, we also have a large number of women who remain outside the labour force. By comparison with the best performers among our EU counterparts &ndash; Denmark, for example &ndash; our female employment rate of 51.4% is lagging behind. It is also notable that our employment rate for females in the 45 to 64 year age group lags behind the EU best performers by a very significant margin. Work in the home has given women many marketable skills and interpersonal qualities, as is demonstrated by the growing numbers of women who are returning to or taking up work. However, in many cases, women need to equip themselves with specific skills in order to find jobs. Here again, training is the key.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that we should not become excessively starry-eyed about technology. Technological development in our economy is a major driving force but we can only achieve that development and leverage for greater advantage if we have the necessary backup infrastructure in place. Craft skills are part of that backup. The national development plan involves £23 billion of investment in infrastructural projects. Having the necessary levels of craft skills and crafts persons is a key success factor underpinning that plan. The apprenticeship system plays an essential role here and will be an important component of the national training fund.</P>
    <P>Apprenticeship and return to work training are essential elements of the Government's strategy to grow our employment rate and ensure that work opportunities are available for all who seek them. This strategy must be complemented by a greater focus on training and enterprises. Going forward, enterprises will be increasingly dependent on the existing work force and its ability to adapt to technological and competitive changes. This is an inevitable consequence of our high employment environment and demographic change factors.</P>
    <P>It is a positive sign that enterprises are already recognising that. The 1997 White Paper on Human Resource Development indicated that the spend on training by Irish firms was 1.5% of payroll. A recent survey of firms conducted by IBEC suggests that this has increased to 3%. While this survey of 1,292 firms may not be entirely representative, it provides many useful insights into the training activities of firms. For example, 45% of the companies surveyed had a specific budget for training and the average number of training days was five per annum. As against this, 40% of companies did not have a specific training budget, suggesting that training was pursued on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. The remaining 5% of companies identified no spending on training at all.</P>
    <P>Both IBEC and the expert group on future skills needs have undertaken research on the reasons for and barriers to training identified by firms. The main reasons cited for training are <Col N="501" /> competitiveness; productivity improvement; staff motivation and retention; and regulatory compliance. The main barriers identified by firms are time, or, more precisely, the lack of it, and cost in terms of downtime while staff are on training and access, which is an issue particularly for firms in regional locations where qualified trainers may not be readily accessible. Firms also believe that there is insufficient information available to allow them to make informed choices about the appropriate trainer, and this can also lead to unnecessary costs if the training provided does not meet their needs. Price is also cited as an issue, suggesting that there may be insufficient competition in the training market. Finally, some firms are beginning to identify low basic skills among new recruits as a factor which requires them to undertake increased induction training.</P>
    <P>These data suggest that the picture on enterprise training is changing. There is increased commitment among firms, but there are still significant numbers of firms whose approach to training is <i>ad hoc</i>, and a smaller number of firms who simply do not train at all. It is also clear that firms find the costs of training too high and that the market in supply of training may not be sufficiently developed. Policy, and the structures through which it is delivered, needs to respond to these issues.</P>
    <P>Today, almost 900,000 people work in the commercial services sector. This number has grown by almost 250,000 since 1990. Growth in international services has been particularly impressive, rising from 11,000 in 1990 to 49,000 by 1999.</P>
    <P>Manufacturing remains critically important and is continuing to prosper. However, our manufacturing base is changing significantly. This can be seen by the fact that the high tech sector &ndash; chemicals, engineering and IT &ndash; grew by 42,123 jobs from 1990 to 1999. By contrast, lower technology sectors such as textiles, clothing and furniture lost almost 11,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>In addition to these structural changes in the enterprise sector, we have also seen some significant shifts in industrial policy. In 1998, I came into this House to put in place a new statutory framework for the development of indigenous manufacturing and internationally trading companies under the Industrial Development Bill, 1998. I outlined then the need for a more focused approach to assisting companies, bringing all aspects of business support, including marketing, research and development and training, together under one agency &ndash; Enterprise Ireland.</P>
    <P>More recently, my Department has worked with the social partners to develop a pilot programme in enterprise led training support. The Skillnets initiative gives enterprises an opportunity to collaborate in identifying and addressing their shared training needs. Moreover, by pooling resources and by group purchasing solutions to common training problems, the costs of accessing training can be reduced for individual network members. Skillnets has been enthusiastically wel<Col N="502" /> comed and 60 projects are now in operation or getting under way.</P>
    <P>In addition to these developments, the issue of lifelong learning is becoming an increasing concern. Under the ambit of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, my Department has convened a task force on lifelong learning to develop a strategic framework and address issues such as access, flexibility of provision and workplace upskilling. The task force will report to Government early next year and I expect that its work will have a significant effect on the development of policy in this area into the future. Set against these dramatic changes, much of our statutory framework for enterprise and apprentice training derives from the 1960s. When the Industrial Training Act, 1967, was introduced, Ireland was still trying to come to terms with the competitive effects of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement of 1964. Industry was seen solely in terms of manufacturing, with services being little more than an afterthought.</P>
    <P>The framework of the 1967 Act is based on the concept of designating sectors, establishing statutory industrial training committees to oversee training in these sectors and imposing sectoral levies to fund that training. This framework is increasingly at odds with the developments I have just described. It is too rigid. It ignores intersectoral and value chain links which are increasingly important to competitiveness, and it creates an artificial distinction between firm specific and sector specific assistance. It is too focused on manufacturing to the detriment of the services sector. In terms of finance, the system of sectoral and apprenticeship levies reflects many of these flaws and does not provide an appropriate funding base for training.</P>
    <P>I put it to the House, therefore, that it is clear that we need a new approach to training in and for employment. We need new funding mechanisms and new structures. Those structures must be flexible, responsive and client friendly. This Bill provides an essential statutory underpinning for this new approach.</P>
    <P>I now propose to outline to the House the principal features of the Bill. The main purpose of the Bill is to establish the national training fund and consequent national training levy. The fund will finance a range of schemes aimed at raising the skills of those in employment and providing training to those who wish to acquire skills for the purposes of taking up employment.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the payment by employers of a levy equivalent to 0.7% of the reckonable earnings of employees insured for the purposes of social welfare legislation under class A, with the exception of community employment participants, and class H employments. There will be no additional financial imposition on employers as the cost of the levy will be off-set by a comparable cut in employers' PRSI contributions. This cut will be effected by a ministerial order which will be brought forward by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to <Col N="503" /> coincide with the introduction of the national training fund levy.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides for the establishment of the national training fund. The fund will operate a current account and an investment account. Any moneys which are not required to meet current expenditure will be transferred to the investment account and may be transferred back to the current account as required. The Bill will thus provide a ring-fenced source of funds for training. This section also provides for the Exchequer to make contributions to the fund if required.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the imposition of the national training fund levy on employers in respect of relevant employees.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that the rate of the levy payable by the employer will be 0.7% of the reckonable earnings of relevant employees, subject to the ceilings which apply for payment of employers' PRSI contributions and certain exemptions.</P>
    <P>The section also provides for the payment by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs of a sum of £120 million from the social insurance fund to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for the year 2000 to take account of the fact that those training schemes falling within the ambit of the fund's purposes have already been subvented by the State this year. The section also provides for funds from the former levy grant schemes, which are now held by FÁS, to be transferred to the national training fund.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the collection of the levy. The sums collected will be transferred to the social insurance fund in the first instance and, from there, to the national training fund.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that the Revenue Commissioners may supply information regarding reckonable earnings of persons in respect of whom the levy is payable.</P>
    <P>Section 7 sets out the basis for making payments from the fund. This section provides for payments to be made from the fund for schemes, the purpose of which are to raise the skills of those in employment, or to provide training to those who wish to acquire skills for the purpose of taking up employment. This section provides that a wide range of schemes may be subvented by the fund. As regards the selection of schemes to be funded, this will be determined by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Earlier I described a number of key areas such as apprenticeship, skills training for unemployed people and those outside the labour force, in-company training and lifelong learning which need concerted and sustained attention. All these areas will fall within the ambit of the national training fund. The moneys to be allocated to schemes will be determined with the consent of the Minister for Finance in tandem with the annual Estimates process. This is essential given that many of the organisations being subvented <Col N="504" /> by the fund will also be in receipt of Exchequer funding.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for penalties for specified offences under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for the repeal of certain sections of the Industrial Training Act, 1967, and the entire Industrial Training (Apprenticeship Levy) Act, 1994. The principal items covered are the repeal of the statutory provisions covering the former apprenticeship and sectoral levies which were suspended in 2000 in anticipation of the introduction of the national training fund levy and those providing for the establishment and operation of the statutory industrial training committees which were integrally linked to the sectoral levy grant schemes. The remaining sections of the Bill are standard provisions.</P>
    <P>I am happy we have made significant strides in eliminating the &ldquo;grant mentality&rdquo; which has tended to characterise the relationship between firms and State agencies. However, we need to be constantly vigilant that grant aid provides value for money. In the training area, there has been a tendency to provide small incremental amounts of funding on a recurrent basis. There is a strong risk that such an approach can lead to an increase in rent seeking, where firms feel a historical entitlement to grant aid and where incremental funding fails to achieve any significant change in commitment to training.</P>
    <P>This issue will be addressed in the context of the national training fund by applying the following criteria. Human resource development investment should be clearly linked to the articulated strategic plans of the enterprise or to assisting enterprises to develop such plans. Support should be designed to achieve a &ldquo;step change&rdquo; in the human resource development performance of the company, that is, it should make a significant improvement in the company's approach to training and development. Particular attention should be given to the achievement of recognised standards, such as Excellence Through People, or to certification of the skills acquired. Support should be degressive, that is, it should be directed to building self-sustaining capability within the firm. It should, therefore, decline over time or only be provided for major new step change initiatives.</P>
    <P>The boundaries of the competitiveness game are now well established. Increasingly, the issue is not about whether we are in the right ball park, but rather how skilfully we play the game. Our &ldquo;match fitness&rdquo; depends on the quality of our human resources and the development opportunities we can offer our people, whether they are entering the labour market for the first time or seeking to return to work or to change career, or simply to advance within their chosen occupation.</P>
    <P>We have made enormous strides at both the level of competitiveness and social inclusion. We have achieved this in large part through investing in skills, especially in the initial education and training area. We need to take a broader approach which looks to the future and ensures that the skills base we have built is maintained <Col N="505" /> and upgraded to meet the challenges to come. The National Training Fund Bill and the policy approach I have outlined provide for precisely such an approach. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which gives us an opportunity to discuss important issues in relation to training, training for the future and where we should be going in terms of investment in training. We are coming to a crossroads in industrial development in terms of training and up-skilling the workforce. It is fundamentally important that the right decisions are taken so that a proper structure is in place to up-skill the workforce and to target unemployed people and bring them into the workforce. We must also ensure that people in jobs with short-term viability are not left on the scrap heap when the company goes to the wall and that they have the opportunity to get back into employment quickly.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the fund was announced in last year's budget by the Minister for Finance, yet it took 12 months for the Bill to be published. I am disappointed the priority being given to the Bill by the Minister is to push it through at the last minute. It is fundamentally important that this issue is thoroughly debated so that we make the right decisions on where we go in the future. I hope the fund is additional money and that it is not simply a case of balancing the books and shifting money from one place to another. We need a concerted and focused approach to industrial training in the future.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the shift from &ldquo;bricks to clicks&rdquo;. Given the current rate of progress, a large proportion of the population will never make that transition in terms of basic reading or computer skills. Sadly, 25% of the population have poor literacy skills. I will come back to this point later.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that manufacturing remains critically important. This is the area of industry which will come under the most severe challenge in the coming years. We must focus on manufacturing and ensure there is a balance in terms of providing people with the necessary manufacturing and service skills. When looking at human resources it is important to focus not only on the company but also on individuals to see how they can benefit from additional training and investment in this area. There are two sides to the coin and sadly for too long we have looked at it only from an enterprise point of view. We must ensure that people have the necessary skills to take up employment and that employment is secure. There is also the educational aspect, which comes under a different Department. This will give people the skills to operate a different machine and also improve safety skills, etc. People with poor literacy must also have educational and IT elements tied into their training. This will give them the opportunity to develop and take up further employment either within a company or with another company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="506" /> Future economic competitiveness will be determined less by accumulated capital and more by the skill and ingenuity of the workforce. Our economic success in recent years has been heavily influenced by earlier investments in education and demographic trends which gave us a deep reservoir of talented people ready to take up employment opportunities as they became available. However, labour shortages are one of the greatest threats to the continued prosperity of many businesses. Firms are reporting vacancy rates of approximately 10% across all grades, the highest being in the IT sector where the vacancy rate is approximately 15%. As the traditional sources of labour force growth dry up, our continued economic success will depend on our capacity to continually upgrade the skills of those within the workforce.</P>
    <P>A recent survey by the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland highlighted the fact that 56% of companies have no staff training budget, which differs from the figure given by the Minister.</P>
    <P>To underline the importance of the new challenge of continuous upscaling, the EU Commission, in its White Paper on lifelong learning some years ago, recommended that a balance sheet of human skills should be maintained by companies in the same way they maintain balance sheets of their physical assets. This would bring home to employers the importance of investing in the development of their workers' skills, which have been overlooked.</P>
    <P>While some employers are excellent at providing such investment, others are looking to this fund as an avenue to provide the investment. There are still employers who are not prepared to invest in their employees to develop human resources. Sadly, these companies are under severe pressure and will go to the wall and the employees will end up on the live register. A concerted effort needs to be put into that element of the industrial sector to ensure such employers buy into this programme.</P>
    <P>Ireland is less well placed to confront this new challenge. It was one of the slowest countries in Europe to introduce free second level education. A high proportion of workers aged over 45 did not proceed beyond primary education. Ireland fared badly in the recent OECD literacy survey on these age groups. Literacy has never offered business a bigger payback through which it can transform significant numbers of workers from underperformers to high contributors. One in four of the population has low literacy skills which means they cannot read and comprehend the instructions on the back of a paracetemol box. Approximately 500,000 adults cannot cope with the most basic literacy tasks.</P>
    <P>Low levels of literacy affect a worker's performance and undermine the economic productivity of a company. Employees with poor basic skills cost a company employing more than 50 people approximately £65,000 per annum and, although literacy is a major issue, only 13,000 adults or 2% of those with literacy difficulties <Col N="507" /> participate in literacy programmes. An average company employing 1,000 or more could save up to £500 per employee if basic skills were provided to the workforce. These benefits outweigh any investment cost but, sadly, employers have yet to realise the positive impact of such investment.</P>
    <P>There is not only a high level of illiteracy among the adult workforce as there is evidence that there is little awareness of the problem among those affected. Only 8% of those with the lowest level of literacy think their skills are poor. The provision of adult education in Ireland has been slower than in other countries. A total of 24% of people reported that they had participated in adult education in the previous year compared to 41% in other advanced countries which were surveyed.</P>
    <P>A person with low literacy skills is only one fifth as likely to participate in adult education as a person with high literacy skills. Training for those already at work is poorly developed. Although it has improved in recent years Irish businesses are still considerably behind international best practice in terms of investment in training as a proportion of payroll. The State's investment in training in the past has been highly skewed towards training for the unemployed. This had a good foundation when unemployment was high but the continuing low support by the State for training within employment is hard to understand in the current labour market.</P>
    <P>Many of the unemployed of tomorrow are employed today. Outreach programmes which have been carefully designed must reach out to these people. While the Departments of Social, Community and Family Affairs and Education and Science recently expanded their back to education programmes these are still not mainstream interventions. A minimum of six to 12 months unemployment is a precondition for participation in many such programmes. Significantly, they cover persons aged between 17 and 21. These are often crucial years as early school leavers should have access to well supported, flexible options in training and education.</P>
    <P>It also highlights a problem I came across recently. A young female lone parent re-entered the education system to get proper training so that she could take up employment. She received a training allowance from FÁS but the health board stopped her rent allowance. She was £3 per week better off having taken up training, but she had to pay transport costs to and from the training centre, buy books and ask her mother to mind her child. She was asked to give a commitment to training while losing money.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that there are barriers to people taking up training or employment. These barriers must be broken down. We can put all the funding we want into programmes but if those barriers remain, the people who need training will never get it. The same scenario would have resulted had the young girl tried to take up employment. Her rent allowance would have <Col N="508" /> been stopped. She came under so much financial pressure that she had to give up her training course. She is now in receipt of unemployment assistance. It is wrong for the State to promote this.</P>
    <P>Despite Ireland's labour shortages a large number of people are on the live register. The local employment service, which has been developed in recent years, must concentrate its efforts on creating opportunities for the hard core of long-term unemployed to return to work. Given the fall in the level of unemployment a labour market policy which actively intervenes in regard to people who have been unemployed for a year or more can be more focused and effective.</P>
    <P>The ESRI found in a recent survey that 50% of job schemes have had no effect. A review of such schemes is needed to incentivise them and to encourage people back into employment. It is also important that the social economy programme is seriously examined to ascertain how sustainable employment can be provided in both urban and rural disadvantaged communities. We should also try to tie in training programmes. While community employment schemes were run in the past, a training element should be tied into similar job schemes. Specific targets should be set for reducing the number of long-term unemployed in each community and partnership area. We would then be able to ascertain whether such policy initiatives are working.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael is committed to radical initiatives in the area of lifelong learning. The policy response must not be focused only on instruments for remedying narrowly defined reading and writing skills. The key is to engage people in lifelong learning by making our community one which actively engages and makes literacy skills demands on all people to help them to participate. Many agents in different areas of life must think about learning opportunities if we are to succeed. It requires the creation of a literacy rich and learning rich environment at home, in the workplace and in the community.</P>
    <P>A major programme of adult education must be developed and a balanced expansion of employer training programmes of conventional and second chance education, of innovative options accessible to all those with weak literacy skills and of basic adult literacy should be developed through an integrated approach to lifelong learning focused particularly on those with difficulties. It is important when examining these training programmes that a social element is included and that people can gain from these training programmes as well as employers. We have until now focused too narrowly on what we call education and what we define as training. We must also give something back to participants.</P>
    <P>Any person who leaves school with a junior certificate or less should be given the right to access an education bursary which he or she could draw down at any stage of their future working lives, whether at work or on social welfare. It should also be made available to persons who <Col N="509" /> have been made redundant from designated industries where re-employment opportunities are scarce. Such a bursary could be used to fund educational training programmes provided by public or private agencies or by employers. That would bring a certain element of competition to which the Minister referred.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has proposed that a bursary to the value of £10,000 be established. This measure would demonstrate the seriousness in facilitating lifelong learning. It would also be a very tangible statement to early leavers, provide them with a second chance and would encourage both schools and colleges to develop flexible programmes with suitable entry points to meet the needs of the group for which opportunities are almost non-existent. Foundation and progression modules should be developed to meet that need.</P>
    <P>The Government should sit down with employer and trade union bodies to develop workplace training partnerships. A budget should be set aside to pump-prime such initiatives. The Government should set a target to bring the mature student intake up to 15% and the emphasis should be on courses which help people with their work and employment. In partnership areas, a full-time education co-ordinator should be employed and given a budget to actively promote these new adult education options and to develop the necessary support systems, including crèche facilities, to ensure adults succeed in completing the course they undertake.</P>
    <P>A national register of employers should be established who would be willing to participate in an innovative employment promise. This scheme would involve employers sponsoring individual students by providing them with employment during summer holidays and guaranteeing a job interview on completion of their studies. That would give young people the work experience they require and which sometimes is lacking and would also give a degree of additional benefit to employers. That is something which needs to be promoted and which could be examined in terms of this budget and the funding under it. Perhaps the Minister would examine that.</P>
    <P>There is the issue of the shortage of skills of which everyone is very conscious. However, we should also examine the target of bringing 50% of all new employment to green field sites in the Border, midlands and west region or anywhere outside Dublin. As we know, Dublin is choking at present. The infrastructure does not exist. We discussed earlier at a committee meeting bringing in people with skills from places such as Canada, South Africa or Birmingham to take up employment as shortages have arisen. It will take them hours to get to work and years to get enough money together for a deposit on a house. If the proper structures existed and if infrastructural problems were resolved, people would queue up to come in.</P>
    <P>We should examine new methods of encouraging industry to the BMW region or decentralising employment. As I have suggested here and in a <Col N="510" /> number of other places, we should establish a skills register of people willing to go to some of these disadvantaged areas, whether they are from the area or want to move out of the overpopulated cities to take up employment there. Employment could then be targeted into that region. Employers with skills shortages could be encouraged to set up a subsidiary of the company or to diversify the company in the region, which would give balanced employment throughout the country. The barrier to doing that is, examining innovative ideas and providing the badly needed infrastructure.</P>
    <P>On the issue of infrastructure and information technology, the ability of people to grasp IT and develop it is fundamentally important. E-commerce has the capacity to transform many areas of life. Early priorities in this area should be the establishment of an on-line university and Internet services for schools and educational institutes. Internet access should be provided for the vast majority of the country within a short period, for example by 2002. That should be a target of the fund because, if people have the basic skills, they can upskill within their homes and that will have the benefit of not placing demands on child care facilities, although child care facilities are non-existent at present. The provision of training courses and distance learning on the Internet should be examined. I hope some of the budget will be used to develop some of those issues.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned the issue of apprentices, the way apprenticeships have changed over the years and the way they need to continually change. I will address a specific point regarding apprenticeships. There is a huge demand in some parts of the country for places in phases two, four and six in carpentry and electrician apprenticeships among others. However, in other parts of the country, there are vacancies and places are left idle. I do not understand how we can stand over a system that allows vacancies to exist in one part of the country while people are waiting to access places in another part.</P>
    <P>Part of the problem is because the living away from home allowance provided to apprentices is £27.50. That is a paltry sum to try to attract someone to take up the part of the apprenticeship where he or she must move away from home. The sum of £27.50 will not cover any costs. If such people happened to be trainee gardaí who were stationed away for a period from the training college in Templemore or away from home, they would receive an allowance of £80. One is £53 better off by being an apprentice in the Garda than an apprentice learning a skill, such as becoming an electrician, carpenter or whatever.</P>
    <P>A huge shortage of such skills exists at present and an increase in the allowance for apprentices should be examined. The figure of £27.50 is not realistic and I am sure anyone would accept that. An increase in that area would help resolve problems where vacancies exist in some parts of the country. People living in Dublin, for example, cannot afford to move to Galway and complete <Col N="511" /> their three months' or six months' placement when they receive only £27.50 a week. It is not possible. Perhaps the Minister would examine that issue.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, has maintained that the Dublin solution to the taxi problem is not the correct solution for the rest of the country. I wonder how his non-taxi driving constituents respond to the proposition that a cartel is acceptable and beneficial in Limerick but not in Dublin. The reality is that a cartel, <Col N="512" /> by its nature, is always bad for the consumer &ndash; whether in Limerick, Galway, Cork or Dublin &ndash; just as it is always good for the members of the cartel. Its sole purpose is to restrict supply and thereby increase the price so the consumer has a lesser service for which he or she pays more.</P>
      <P>The evidence of this, if such evidence was needed, is the cost of taxi plates, which I understand were trading in Limerick at £60,000 to £70,000 each. One has to ask why? Of itself, a plate has no intrinsic value. Its value comes from a derived demand for a taxi service, a demand which in Limerick, Dublin and elsewhere was either not being met or was being suppressed through excessive prices, or both.</P>
      <P>The cost of the taxi service to the public, inexplicably over the past few weeks, has been completely lost in the debate. I suppose it is understandable that a public desperate for a service has not always counted the cost of it, but the reality is that we have all paid more than necessary. This upward pressure on prices has been exacerbated by the practice of cosying out, whereby cosies paid an average £1,200 a month to the plate owner even before they began to earn a penny for themselves.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, many cosies operated in almost feudal conditions of servitude with no security of tenure, and were often forced to collude in tax evasion with the plate owner. I doubt whether the people of Limerick really want what the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, is promising to sustain for them &ndash; an inadequate service at a higher price, provided through slave labour. Nevertheless, Deputy O'Dea did what he and many of his colleagues have always done, he told his audience what they wanted to hear. What he forgot, however, was that while this may have worked well in the past as a way of deceiving the public, in an era of mass communications, one can no longer segment an audience by giving them different messages and hoping to get away with it. Eventually, the first group will hear what is being promised to the second.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a junior Minister of the Government should diminish all politicians by publicly engaging in this particularly despicable form of deception and manipulation of public opinion is beyond comment. That he compounded his offence by offering as an excuse that he did not know he was being recorded, was pathetic. It was merely further proof of his belief that provided he was not found out, it was an acceptable way of doing business. What defies comprehension altogether, however, is that our Taoiseach, the leader of our Government, found absolutely nothing wrong in all of this. He found it perfectly acceptable that one of his Ministers should deliberately and calculatingly set out to undermine a decision of another Minister, which was backed by a High Court judgment. We have all been left wondering who speaks for the Government on this issue, and whether the Government's position is the same as that of the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy. <Col N="513" /> Weeks later, we are still wondering because the Taoiseach has not moved decisively and asked for Deputy O'Dea's resignation, thus demonstrating to everybody that he fully supports the position of Deputy Molloy and that the latter has full Government backing. The fact that the Taoiseach has not done so, suggests to me and to many others that he agrees with Deputy O'Dea's view that the Government's decision was, to quote Deputy O'Dea, &ldquo;disastrous and unworkable&rdquo;, that &ldquo;there were impertinent people in Government&rdquo; who had been known to change their minds before, and that all that was required now was to keep up the pressure.</P>
    <P>Do the Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil still think they can have it both ways, that they can be both Government and Opposition, and that they can speak out of both sides of their mouths at once? Can it be that, even yet, Fianna Fáil is so in thrall to the taxi lobby that it continues, in the face of public wrath and a High Court judgment, to try to appease them? We have a glad-handing, back-slapping, hand-shaking Taoiseach who avoids hard decisions like the plague, but on this occasion the old nod and wink approach will not work. The public demands clear leadership on the taxi issue. They are sick to the back teeth of queuing, inconvenience, disruption, danger, bully boy tactics, intimidation and threats. They want to know whose side the Taoiseach is on. For as long as Deputy O'Dea remains a junior Minister, the public will continue to believe the Taoiseach puts their interests behind that of a small, vocal minority who for a long time have been joined at the hip with Fianna Fáil, to their mutual benefit and at the expense of the common good.</P>
    <P>We are now witnessing this Government's third failed attempt to address the taxi shortage. The Progressive Democrats have not covered themselves in glory, despite the fact that they are trying to rescue something from it now. It was ironic to witness a party which prided itself on being the party of competition and free enterprise, adopting a &ldquo;plate for plate&rdquo; solution which could only reinforce and strengthen the power of the existing cartel. Worse than that, however, was the fact that when this solution had failed &ndash; it was always doomed to fail and we told the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, last year it would fail &ndash; and during the entire year the matter was before the courts, Deputy Molloy gave not a moment's thought to how he would organise, administer and regulate for an alternative solution. The mayhem on the streets is a direct result of the lack of planning and clarity the Minister has displayed in dealing with this issue.</P>
    <P>The response of the taxi industry is totally out of proportion to the effect of deregulation. Had the Minister given any time to understanding how the existing industry operates, much of the confrontation we have witnessed could have been avoided and the public would not have been deprived of a taxi service at this critical time of year.</P>
    <P>Basic to finding a solution which gives the public a service and which also affords the affected <Col N="514" /> taxi owners a slightly softer landing, is an understanding of the disparate nature of the industry and the varying aspirations of its members. The taxi-hackney industries, which are inextricably bound together, consist of driver-plate owners, non-driving plate owners, multiple plate owners, cosies, wheelchair plate owners, hackney drivers and booking companies. All of these have special, different interests and the new arrangements proposed by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, impact on them all in different ways. Consequently, the reaction of all those groups in recent weeks has been violent, angry and most of all confused. Their demands, whatever they are, have been very poorly articulated. Their pronouncements have varied from expressions of resentment that hackneys should now get &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; plates, as they regard them, and demands for compensation from the public purse, to a reversal of the deregulation decision and the abandonment of the wheelchair accessibility requirement. For the first time in the five years that I have been talking to taximen about this issue, they have called for an increase in standards in the industry. Curiously, there have also been calls to bring forward, from 2003 to 2001, the wheelchair accessibility requirement. In short, there is general confusion because they do not seem to know what they want, although they seem to be focusing on opposition to the deregulation of taxi numbers. Deregulation, however, is precisely the solution around which the general public have united in support. Having suffered delays, inconvenience and the danger of a woefully inadequate taxi service for years, the public can no longer be ignored.</P>
    <P>Besides depriving the public of a service, restricting the number of taxis also created a climate where abuse and misuse could prosper until eventually the only thing that was important to the members of that industry was protecting the capital value of the taxi plate. That was much more important than the service they were supposed to provide. Their public service licences gave them the considerable benefit of a sole right to ply the streets for trade in an expanding economy, but that was not enough for them. Assuring taxi drivers that there is more than enough business to keep them fully employed and that this will grow when members of the public become accustomed to the idea that there will be a taxi service available to them as and when they need it is of little consolation to them now when their main concerns are their asset, pension and security.</P>
    <P>The real opposition and much of the vitriol comes from the owners of the original 2,000 licences in Dublin. The fundamental difference between these plates and the newer wheelchair accessible plates issued in the past three years is that the plate can be passed from car to car with the result that even when the owner of the licence is at home in bed, the cosy is out earning money for him or her. If he or she is a multiple plate holder, he or she can have several dozen cosies <Col N="515" /> earning an income for him or her. A wheelchair accessible plate is only issued in respect of a specific car. As such, it will only be used during the hours in which the plate owner or members of his or her family can drive it and earn an income.</P>
    <P>The attraction of the older plates is the non-owner driver income. That is what this whole war is about and what has made them so valuable and resulted in their owners resorting to every form of pressure and intimidation to maintain their value. If the Minister of State was to separate that market from the newer deregulated market for wheelchair accessible taxis, he may find that opposition would drop away and we may have a taxi service before Christmas and a better service in the future. Those who have purchased wheelchair accessible taxis do not depend on cosies in the same way; they have become more of a family business in order to make maximum usage of the plate. That is as it should be.</P>
    <P>The wheelchair requirement should come into play after one year, rather than three. There should be a clear statement from the Minister of State, preferably today, that conversion must take place after one year in respect of all new licences issued during the coming year. The only reason I support a one year delay is to allow the Minister of State time to revise the specifications for wheelchair accessible taxis which are entirely inappropriate to many forms of disability. Despite the fact that the Department delayed the issue of wheelchair accessible taxi licences for almost one year, it has got the specifications completely and utterly wrong. In concentrating on wheelchair use, it has excluded many other forms of disability. Elderly persons, in particular, find it almost impossible to climb into them given the height of the floor. A revision of the specifications is, therefore, absolutely essential.</P>
    <P>Removing the wheelchair requirement in respect of the existing 2,000 licences in Dublin would ensure they would always have a greater value than a wheelchair accessible taxi licence. While wheelchair accessible taxis would rapidly account for the majority of taxis, the licences would not and should not have any resale value. It would still be possible, however, for the owners of the 2,000 existing licences to continue the practice of hiring out the plate to cosies. The reality is that there will be always be people who will not be able to afford or will choose not to purchase a wheelchair accessible taxi, the cost of which is considerable, starting from about £22,000, excluding conversion costs. The fact that the licence cannot be switched from car to car means that the taxi is on the road all of the time and will, as a consequence, have to be replaced more regularly.</P>
    <P>This practice would maintain the income of all the hard luck cases about which we have heard on the airwaves recently, those who have been deprived of a pension, lost a nest egg or had to retire due to bad health or widows who have had to continue paying the mortgage. Undoubtedly, as more and more taxis come on stream in a <Col N="516" /> deregulated market, the resale value of the original licences would gradually diminish. That is as it should be. It is not a desirable practice as it sustains the cosy system, but it would not diminish overnight, which is the greatest fear of the existing licence holders.</P>
    <P>I readily accept that this would not be the ideal solution, but it would have the merit of dealing with hardship cases of widows and pensioners. The biggest advantage would be that it would obviate the need for the payment of compensation from the public purse. I need hardly remind the Minister of State that there is no support for the payment of compensation from the public purse to those who have worked hard over many years to maintain a monopoly and a cartel. It would go against the grain to compensate them for the loss of profits.</P>
    <P>I exclude from this those who purchased wheelchair accessible taxi licences in recent years for £15,000. This must be repaid. They should have to pay no more than the cost of future wheelchair accessible taxi licence. The money will have to be repaid by the Government which insisted on this price being put on the taxi licences. It should not be repaid by local authorities. Neither I nor any other member of a local authority could possibly tell our constituents that their local charges have to be increased in order to repay taxi owners the amount paid for licences because of a decision made by the Government.</P>
    <P>I would not favour a complete lack of standards in the segment of the market filled by the original 2,000 licences. An effort should be made within the next week to improve the regulations to improve, even on a gradual basis, the standard of car used. For instance, no car should be more than five years old. Ideally, we should move towards a single, identifiable car, of which a capital city could be proud, not some of the clapped out cars which we see around the city.</P>
    <P>The details of the system apart, dividing the taxi market in two, drawing a line in the sand between the old market and the new, would offer a way forward, should the Minister of State care to take it up. This solution would have been offered to him had he not jumped in with a quick fix gimmick this time last year. It is an indictment of the Minister of State that he had no interest in the industry until he thought public anger was such that he should do something. He came up with a solution to which he had given absolutely no thought.</P>
    <P>One way or another, whatever solution the Government chooses, it cannot allow the current situation to continue. It raises serious questions about the strength of our democracy when the Garda Síochána has to admit publicly that it is not in a position to maintain law and order in the face of threats of violence from a small group of people, as happened when Aer Rianta suggested that it would move to allow hackneys to pick up passengers at the airport where there is now no service available for the many people who use it, including elderly, disabled and business people. <Col N="517" /> What sort of message does this send to visitors and emigrants returning home for Christmas? What is happening not just to our airport, but also to our entire city is completely and utterly unacceptable. It is criminal that pubs, clubs and shops are denuded of people at this critical time of year for the economy.</P>
    <P>There is palpable public outrage that a small group of self-employed persons seem to be running the country. Not only are they dictating what the Government can and cannot do, they are intimidating the Garda Síochána to the point where it can no longer guarantee public safety, if the diktats of taxi licence holders are thwarted in any way. Today when students sought to barricade themselves into the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Garda Síochána was not so intimidated; the students were quickly removed. One wonders whether it is one law for the friends of Fianna Fáil in the taxi industry and another for everybody else.</P>
    <P>It is time the Government started governing and defended our democracy by vindicating the rights of the majority, rather than continuing to succumb to the rule of the mob. It cannot stand by indefinitely watching the message that might is right being communicated not just to taxi drivers, but to all the groups which may in the future seek to have their grievances resolved by threatening street mayhem, violence and intimidation. There have been explicit and implicit threats of violence in recent weeks if additional taxi licences are issued and similar threats if hackneys are allowed to provide a service at the airport; in other words, if existing drivers cannot provide a service under current conditions, they will not allow anybody else to do so. This has been their position all along, only now they are becoming more militant.</P>
    <P>This is an insupportable position for a Government to tolerate. It was frightening two mornings ago to hear on the radio that, according to the Garda Síochána, decisions legitimately made in the public interest cannot be defended by the forces of law and order. The Government can no longer allow our economy to be jeopardised and the public to be subjected to continuing inconvenience, disruption and danger at a time of year when demand for taxis is at its greatest. The issues of public safety and taxis are inextricably linked on the streets of Dublin. If the Garda cannot provide protection for people who want to acquire taxi licences and for hackneys giving a taxi service at the airport, how can we expect them to protect the many young people who go into the city every night, particularly at this time of the year? It is an indictment of this country that this cannot be done.</P>
    <P>We have the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, to thank for much of this disruption. He and others like him continue to give false comfort to taxi owners. If the taxi owners did not believe they had the support of many members of the Government, they would not be so ready to forego income. Only the promise of a greater <Col N="518" /> prize in the long run is worth that. The Taoiseach's response must be to seek Deputy O'Dea's resignation. The taxi issue apart, how can any Taoiseach allow one of his Ministers to preach anarchy, incite opposition to a decision of his Government, shirk collective Government responsibility and still retain credibility as a leader and a person who makes decisions in the public interest and sticks by them?</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, who has not bothered to attend this debate tonight, has let all politicians down by his two faced performance. He has deceived his constituents, disgraced his Government and has not even represented the interests of Limerick taxi drivers. If he supported them, believed their case was just and that the Government got the High Court decision wrong, he would have resigned in protest. He has not done that and now he should be forced out.</P>

      <P>We are most impressed by the huge volume of support in the House for the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea. Where are the full benches of Fianna Fáil Members anxious to help the Minister of State fight this motion? The Minister, Deputy Woods, has been sent to the debate. He is the senior Minister and is embarrassed by the Minister of State's actions. He has been sent to the House because he is the only Member who can be ordered to be present to support a man who was described by our late colleague, Jim Kemmy, as Mighty Mouse in Limerick and Mickey Mouse in the Dáil. No truer words were ever spoken.</P>
      <P>This motion expresses our lack of confidence in a man who is lily livered, disloyal, does not know how to behave as a Government Minister and has left little or no mark on his ministry. I do not know why the Taoiseach, who suffers from chronic indecisiveness, has left him in his job. How could any Taoiseach countenance a Minister of State, knowingly and viciously, going behind the back of a coalition partner and being so disloyal by urging and inciting the taxi men and women of Limerick to keep fighting: &ldquo;Keep fighting and keep digging lads, we will get the Progressive Democrats out&rdquo;. It was reminiscent, as was reported in one newspaper article, of the Albert Reynolds &ldquo;temporary little arrangement&rdquo; speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here was the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, doing the same thing. The attitude was: &ldquo;If we push hard enough, the Minister, Deputy Harney will give in. Has she not given in to us before, bitten the bullet and stayed around no matter what dirt is thrown up about Fianna Fáil? We will try it once more so keep going lads&rdquo;. This week the Government launched a document which contained the following line: &ldquo;Leinster House itself would become more inviting and more accessible to the public&rdquo;. The Minister of State who is the subject of this motion takes a lion's share of the blame for the disgraceful picketing of this House and the closure of the roads so that Members had difficulty getting in to exercise their <Col N="519" /> democratic vote. How dare he, an elected Member, behave in that way to other Members of the House and, more importantly, to his political party?</P>
    <P>This man has a column in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> although I am mystified how he still has permission to write it as a Minister of State. Heretofore, if people who had columns in other organs of the media either stood for election or got elected, they were asked to step away from doing something which gave them a high profile. It is a mystery to me and many others, first, how the Minister of State continues to write this column every Sunday and, second, that he finds the time. Is the Minister for Education and Science not giving him enough work? Is there nothing he can occupy this man with to stop him undermining the Government? What on earth is his role? It is rather like a question on &ldquo;Who wants to be a millionaire&rdquo;&ndash; can anybody name anything the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, has delivered for the country? Can anybody name what previous ministry of State he held?</P>
    <P>We are aware he is the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science but that is all we know. The Taoiseach made promises to the House about the Youth Services Bill, which is within the remit of the Minister of State. He promised it would be ready before Christmas, not Christmas 2000 but Christmas 1997. The Bill appeared before Christmas 2000, three years late. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, could have spent his time more productively working on that legislation, meeting youth organisations and preparing a Bill that would confirm their role and ensure they were properly funded and resourced. He would have been better employed doing that than acting in a treasonous manner against his Government colleagues and the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Molloy on the radio trying to imply that the conversations he had with Deputy O'Dea were grossly exaggerated in the newspapers. Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Woods, will tell us what Deputy Molloy and Deputy O'Dea discussed when they met. Deputy O'Dea's statements have remained uncorrected and unchecked. We heard that senior members of the Fianna Fáil Party called on Deputy O'Dea. Why not the Taoiseach? This is more chronic indecisiveness. These were the same emissaries the Taoiseach sent to deal with Deputy Foley, Deputy Ellis and Deputy Burke. Why does he not confront somebody in whom he had sufficient confidence to appoint him Minister of State? Why did he not tell him to shut up or get out of his job? Deputy O'Dea has let the Government down.</P>
    <P>Let us look at school transport, another area within the remit of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea. Does he even know he is responsible for school transport? I assume he will arrive to the House at some stage to defend himself. On the other hand he might shrink away in a Mickey <Col N="520" /> Mouse fashion so nobody can remind him of how ineffective he is. He is effective when he goes behind the scenes to damage another Minister and when he tells taxi drivers to come to Dublin and threaten the seat of democracy. He is responsible for some of the anarchy we saw outside Leinster House and for the potential danger to women and children who were at the front of that picket line.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister of State know he is in charge of school transport? Perhaps the Minister will tell the House he has taken the Minister of State's responsibilities from him. A report was prepared on the school transport system nearly three years ago by the education committee of this House but no action was taken. School buses are ancient, leaking and creaking. Bus drivers are trying to provide a service with antiquated equipment. One of the main recommendations of the report was that the buses be provided with mobile phones or a radio network system to ensure that if one bus broke down another bus could pick up the children after finishing its school run. This was not provided. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, failed again. He did not care.</P>
    <P>He issued a White Paper on adult education. We have yet to see any delivery on it aside, perhaps, from some extra money for the groups dealing with adult literacy. He does not appear to realise that he is a Minister of State in the Government. He thinks he is just Willie O'Dea, franchised under the Fianna Fáil franchise. He takes the franchise and wears it like a badge, like McDonald's where one can buy the franchise. He puts on the Fianna Fáil vest and then runs his own business independently. He is a member of the Minister's party and I do not understand why the Minister does not take action against him. He is probably afraid to because today another Minister of State is in dire trouble. If that continues, the Taoiseach will have to get rid of a number of Ministers.</P>
    <P>The same Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, wrote in a recent article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> that it is time to get away from parish pump politics and to be statesmen. This mighty mouse, or Mickey Mouse wants us all to be states men, and women, I assume, as well. What does he do? When he is caught on tape at a meeting, he expresses amazement and says he did not realise he was being taped. If he had a chance, he would probably have tried to withdraw what he said. He did not have the guts then to stand by it. He has not said a single word since to publicly indicate that he supports the Government. We have a strangely worded amendment by the Government to the motion which states that Minister of State, Willie O'Dea, has reaffirmed his support for the Government. When did he affirm it? He has reaffirmed it as if somehow or other, Ministers of State can get up each morning and decide that today they will affirm Government policy but tomorrow they will not bother. They bought into the system and are members of Fianna Fáil. I do not know how the Minister can let down his great <Col N="521" /> party by allowing this man to continue in the role he is playing, having let down the Government so badly. It is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>One has to ask what the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, is adding to this Government. One also has to ask what the Taoiseach is doing about people who are as disloyal as Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea? The Taoiseach would not even stand up in this House and say he had met the Minister of State and told him either that he was gone or after one more transgression like this he would be gone.</P>
    <P>Picture the situation when Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, was in Fianna Fáil in opposition. He voted against his party on the Barrington Hospital issue which led the late Jim Kemmy to talk about him as mighty mouse in the constituency. He was expelled from the party for that. How bigger his transgression as a Minister of State and how additional to his transgression is the fact that he was doing this to a partner in Government, a party with whom the Taoiseach said he was working well and with whom the Minister, Deputy Harney, said she was working well. I can guarantee if the Minister, Deputy Harney, was the Taoiseach today, Deputy O'Dea would not still be a Minister of State, going by her fighting words. However, the Minister, Deputy Harney, will come to the House and vote for this amendment. She wants to stay there. She is stuck like glue to Fianna Fáil for some inexplicable reason. She will not walk away in this instance.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said there will be no going back on the decision made by the Government. If there is even the slightest going back on it, it will be clear to the Minister, Deputy Harney, I hope, that she and her Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, mean nothing in the Government and that they are easily sacrificed. There is some deep suspicion among the public. I keep getting asked about the stranglehold the taxi industry has on Fianna Fáil. There is the &ldquo;northside five&rdquo; or &ldquo;northside six&rdquo; depending on whether the Taoiseach is willing to be linked to the &ldquo;northside five&rdquo; and there is the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, down in Limerick. What do they have over Fianna Fáil that when Fianna Fáil, in Government a few years ago, tried to open up the taxi industry, the taxi people were able with the majority on Dublin Corporation to prevent extra plates reaching the public? The county councils were given the power to set up taxi ranks in Fingal, Dún Laoghaire and South Dublin. None was set up because every time they went to do something, there were enough people behind the scenes to get at the Fianna Fáil members of the council to stop them making progress. Reports were published, there were more discussions and the Taoiseach set up his forum because that would take it away from the poor old councillors in case they dirtied their hands with it. It was placed with the Taoiseach's Department on a forum basis. What came out of the forum was a decision that did not stand up. Who examined <Col N="522" /> that decision? As Deputy Mitchell said over and over again, how did the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, announce something that would not stand up to a court challenge? What was happening in that taxi forum? Were they all meeting and deciding when they would have the taxi party or when they would have their outing to Bray or somewhere else at the seaside? What were they doing in that taxi forum that the one decision the Minister came up with was challenged and lost in court? It does not augur well even for this decision that has been made now. Fine Gael supports the deregulation of the taxi service.</P>
    <P>While criticising Deputy Callely and other backbench Fianna Fáilers who are undermining Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, in a subterfuge way, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, is a qualified legal person who advocated the breaking of a High Court decision. He was not going to do it himself but he was advocating to other people to act illegally. The terms he used were &ldquo;to keep up the pressure&rdquo; and &ldquo;to maintain pressure to have the deregulation policy reversed&rdquo;. This was in direct contravention to a High Court decision. This man is a qualified barrister to the best of my knowledge. He may also be an accountant. It is very hard to know at times what he is. Perhaps he is just a part-time journalist for the <i>Sunday Independent</i>. He certainly is not an effective acting Minister of State. There is nobody on the Fianna Fáil benches saying &ldquo;we love Willie, come back Willie, all is forgiven&rdquo;. There is nobody here to defend him except the Minister.</P>
    <P>He was advocating the breaking of the law and, if for no other reason, he should have been expelled from this position as a Minister of State. There is no doubt that if Deputy Bruton had been Taoiseach and one of his Ministers had done something similar, he or she would not have lasted the 24 hours. It is a disgrace that the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, is still in Government and managing to keep his head down.</P>
    <P>One also has to ask whether the traditional support of Fianna Fáil is still there for the taxi lobby. I have no problem if the Minister can find a way, as Deputy Mitchell said, to make sure that people who bought the £15,000 wheelchair accessible taxi licences are not dramatically disadvantaged by this deregulation. There are a small number of other people, such as widows, who are dependent on the income from taxis. It is a disgrace that the Government made the announcement about deregulation without having worked out how those people were to be handled and how they would receive compensation for their spending. Some airy-fairy notion about tax rebates was put forward. The fact that the whole package was not made and announced at the same time has inflamed and added to the difficulties and it has led to some disgraceful interviews with some of the taxi people, particularly those we heard one morning saying they would never take a person with a wheelchair as a fare, that it was a nuisance on a wet day and so on. <Col N="523" /> How dare they say that? They are providing a public service, they have licences issued under the public system and they are obliged to give a public service. They obtained their licences because they agreed to have vehicles that were adapted to take wheelchairs.</P>
    <P>We have a complete mess &ndash; chronic indecisiveness by the Taoiseach with offshore statements from Zagreb. The taxi statement came from Zagreb, other statements came from other far-flung places. The Taoiseach cannot be questioned about Deputy O'Dea from Zagreb. The Fianna Fáil spin machine has gone into overdrive to make sure any backlash on this decision will hit the Progressive Democrats and that Fianna Fáil will sail off into the west or over to Mexico or wherever they can find refuge and Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, will quietly reduce himself in notoriety for a week or two, until he finds something else on which he will have to reaffirm his support for Government policy. The Minister for Education and Science will be a disgrace if he allows that man to remain working for him, given the manner in which he has treated the Government, the Fianna Fáil Party and his Government colleague. I hope the Minister will inform us in his reply that he has had enough of Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, and that, at the very least, he will be moved from his Department.</P>

      <P>further notes the Government's commitment to a process of dialogue with existing licence holders and its readiness to provide special tax allowances and an administrative scheme in relation to certain licence fees by way of mitigation for appropriate cases.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have been deeply concerned at the position of widows and others who could suffer particular hardship as a result of this issue; the amendment shows that the Government is in agreement with the Opposition on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government has been concerned to improve the quality and availability of taxi services to the public in Dublin and other urban areas. A background to this concern was the fail<Col N="524" /> ure of the previous Government to make any impact on the chronic taxi deficit in Dublin. No new taxi licences were issued in Dublin under the previous Government. Between 1997 and 1999, some 750 new wheelchair accessible taxi licences were granted by Dublin Corporation. While this limited increase in taxi supply was welcome, the present Government determined in late 1999 that a much greater supply of taxis was needed in Dublin to meet public demand. That is why we developed our radical initiative for the issue of 3,100 new Dublin taxi licences. This initiative was followed up by new regulations made by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, in January of this year.</P>
    <P>Members will be aware that these regulations were struck down by the High Court in a judgment which was finalised on 14 November. In that judgment, the High Court made it clear that limitation of taxi licences in the interest of existing licence holders cannot be contemplated. The outcome of the court case called for a modified policy approach to the issues involved but the direction and resolve of the Government's proposed reforms has not altered.</P>
    <P>In light of the High Court judgment, the Government determined that it would not be reasonable or desirable to maintain quantitative controls on taxi licences such as have operated for more than 20 years. Accordingly, the new regulations do not place or authorise any restriction on the number of new taxi licences which will be granted by local licensing authorities. These changes apply not just to Dublin but also to taxi services operating in all other taximeter areas.</P>
    <P>The regulations provide, in accordance with EU requirements, for more frequent and systematic testing of taxis and other public service vehicles. This function is to be discharged annually rather than biannually in future by National Car Testing Services Ltd. and for a transitional period, vehicle testing by Garda public service vehicle inspectors, including the Dublin Carriage Office, will continue in parallel with NCTS testing.</P>
    <P>By 1 January 2002, taxis must be fitted with taximeters which are capable of printing automatic receipts. The new regulations also validate the operation of taxi sharing from taxi stands designated by local authorities for this purpose. All of these new provisions, together with the continuation of existing requirements for public service vehicle driver licensing and insurance, are designed to ensure an improved quantity and quality of service to customers in the new situation. The Government looks forward to a rapid improvement in taxi services under the new arrangements. In addition, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, intends to consult extensively with representatives of consumer groups, people with disabilities and taxi service providers in order to develop further quality improvements in taxi services in the medium term.</P>
    <P>There is a continuing need to promote and give <Col N="525" /> an incentive for the provision of wheelchair accessible taxis. It is also desirable to ensure that new applications for taxi licences are bona fide for the purpose of providing public service. With these considerations in mind, the regulations fix the fee for the grant of the new taxi licence at £5,000 and for new wheelchair accessible taxi licences at £100.</P>
    <P>It is not practicable to maintain a universal requirement of wheelchair accessibility in the short-term given that early and rapid progress is needed to respond to customer demand for taxis. However, Deputy Molloy has put on record his intention that the process of making all taxi vehicles wheelchair accessible will commence from the end of 2003. Taxi service providers should gear themselves to this requirement. The Government calls on taxi service providers to respond positively to the challenges and opportunities which will be offered by the new business environment which the regulations will establish.</P>
    <P>We acknowledge that the adjustments which have been necessitated will be difficult for many existing taxi operators. However, we are confident that with appropriate organisation and marketing, these operators and others can achieve good results given the present urgent and buoyant demand for enhanced taxi services.</P>
    <P>In view of the many changes which are now taking place, certain recent holders of wheelchair accessible taxi licences will be in a position of having paid much higher licence fees to local authorities than those which will now obtain. The Minister intends to consult local authorities and taxi representative bodies with a view to developing an administrative scheme to address this situation. In addition, the Minister for Finance will consider a provision to allow tax relief over a number of years for any actual capital loss incurred by existing taxi licence holders by reference to the sum paid for the licence. The details will be published in the Finance Bill, 2001.</P>
    <P>As the capital of a rapidly expanding economy, Dublin has seen increasing demand for mobility in all modes of travel. The volume of traffic passing through Dublin Airport has more than doubled since 1993, reaching almost 13 million in 1999. There are now in the region of 122 hotels in Dublin compared to 88 in 1995 and tourism has become a major industry in the Dublin region. The present inadequate supply of taxis in Dublin risks harming the capital's reputation in the eyes of international business people and other visitors and would also remain a source of extreme frustration for the city's residents. The continuance of this situation is insupportable.</P>
    <P>We are confident this important Government initiative will benefit the public and the Dublin taxi industry alike. The Dublin taxi market, like many other sectors of Dublin's economy, is capable of significant and sustained growth. As such, it can well support a larger service-driven industry to the mutual benefit of all concerned.</P>
    <P>The Government has acted decisively to ensure a high quality taxi service for customers in Dublin <Col N="526" /> and other urban taximeter areas. We hope our actions will receive the support of all Members of the House. The Government's initiative has elicited different responses from the taxi industry. On the one hand, thousands of expressions of interest in new taxi licences have been made to local authorities and some 900 completed application forms had been returned by yesterday to Dublin Corporation alone. The corporation has made in the region of 750 conditional offers of new licences. On the other hand, taxi groups representing existing service providers have withdrawn their services in Dublin and some other areas. Some groups have mounted legal challenges to the new regulations.</P>
    <P>The Government is firmly committed to implementing the proposed new taxi regime which enjoys wide political and public support. Subject to this, we are anxious to progress a number of mitigating measures for the benefit of existing taxi licence holders and to consult further with the taxi groups in formulating detailed provisions in this regard. We are also ready to work with taxi service providers and others to develop further quality improvements for taxi services in the medium term.</P>
    <P>During discussions already conducted by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, both sides accepted the importance of continuing the process of dialogue on issues relating to the new taxi regime. When the current High Court cases are determined &ndash; we hope this will happen very shortly &ndash; we hope the pace and progress of discussions with taxi interests can be intensified and will produce good results.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, has been very effective in the Department of Education and Science, dealing with adult education, youth affairs and school transport. I would now like to outline some of his achievements in the field of adult education.</P>
    <P>For a long time, as a necessary response to our demographic profile, investment in education in Ireland has been concentrated on initial education for young people, resulting in the adult education sector being classified by many as the Cinderella of education. At a time when lifelong learning is increasingly moving centre stage throughout the OECD in terms of social inclusion and employment policies, the adult education sector is the last area of mass education in Ireland which remains to be developed. The first important step in developing this area was taken by the Government with the appointment in 1997 of Deputy O'Dea as the first ever Minister of State with responsibility for adult education.</P>
    <P>Shortly afterwards, the OECD international adult literacy survey results for Ireland were published, showing that about 25% of the Irish adult population were found to score at the lowest literacy level. This percentage was the highest in any of the countries surveyed at the time, except for Poland. Only about 10% in the Netherlands scored at level one, while in Sweden the figure was 6%.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="527" /> The survey showed early school leavers, older adults and unemployed people as being most at risk of literacy difficulties, with participation in adult education and training being least likely for those with the poorest skills.</P>
    <P>At that time the overall budget for adult literacy development in Ireland was £850,000, and 85% of provision was taught by volunteers, with a maximum provision of two hours tuition per week. The Minister of State took immediate steps to increase investment in this area on a phased basis. Provision in 2000 is £7.825 million, with a further £960,000 for programme development. He also took a number of important steps to ensure that the increase in funds would be used in a strategic way to increase access to literacy help for those in need, to promote improved public awareness and integrated links with other agencies and to improve the quality and relevance of the service.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Minister of State's work and the extra funds he obtained, participation in the adult literacy service has increased from 5,000 to 13,000; awareness and outreach strategies have been strengthened; and referral networks have been developed and expanded, linking key actors such as FÁS, the local employment service, area partnerships, welfare and health interests, the Garda and probation services, schools, youth service and community groups. These networks are designed to promote awareness of the service and to provide a structured mechanism for the identification of area needs and the referral of those in need to the service. Flexibility of timing of provision, a continuum from one-to-one voluntary tuition to tuition in small groups, with the option of national certification, and innovation is also being encouraged. Family literacy programmes and special tuition for migrant groups, Travellers and those with special needs are also being expanded. FÁS and community employment joint literacy programmes are being expanded to all regions, with 30 now in operation. A national referral directory on adult literacy services has been published and disseminated.</P>
    <P>Funds have been provided by the Minister for a television programme, &ldquo;Read Write Now&rdquo;, which is broadcast by RTE 1. It consists of 12 half hour programmes which are shown at 11 p.m. on Tuesday night and repeated the next day. This is supplemented by a national freephone helpline manned by trained literacy tutors, organised by the National Adult Literacy Agency, and learner workbooks and resource packs. It is planned to develop videos of the series for distribution free to adult literacy schemes, public libraries and video outlets. The programme has been watched by an average of 172,000 adults each week since its inception. The Minister, Deputy O'Dea, can point to the highest ratings ever for an educational programme in Ireland. Use of television allows those with literacy difficulties to learn in the privacy of their own homes as well as promoting awareness of where to go for help and encour<Col N="528" /> aging them to join a more formal programme. It has also been agreed in principle with RTE and NALA to develop a follow-on radio series with more basic and intensive levels of tuition for broadcast on national radio in the new year.</P>
    <P>These developments, increasing access to literacy help for adults, have been accompanied by a major drive to enhance the quality and professionalism of the adult literacy service through nationally accredited staff development programmes and the development of a quality framework in line with best practice internationally.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Dea, established an interdepartmental group on literacy for the unemployed to develop an integrated response to addressing the literacy needs of unemployed people and &ldquo;to jointly develop measures in consultation with the appropriate statutory agencies and expert groups, and report back to the Cabinet committee, including estimated costs and available funding&rdquo;. The group includes representatives of the Departments of Education and Science, Social, Community and Family Affairs and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, FÁS, vocational education committees, the National Adult Literacy Agency and the local employment service. The group has submitted an interim report to Government recommending targets and timescales for an expansion of funding for the adult literacy service; an increase in provision of foundation and level one courses; and expansion of FÁS community employment literacy programmes and the removal of certain financial barriers.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Dea, is pursuing all these issues in the context of the White Paper on Adult Education and the national development plan. The work of the group is continuing. The national development plan provides for an investment of £73.6 million in the coming years in this critical area and will be supplemented by a £1 billion investment under the back to education initiative, providing for an expansion of part-time Youthreach, PLC and VTOS options. This will be important in providing flexible progression pathways, particularly at foundation level, to enable adults to move from the literacy service into modular part-time programmes. The budget is expected to increase by a further £1.772 million in 2001.</P>
    <P>Under the national development plan, in addition to the adult literacy investment already mentioned, £35 million over the period 2000-06 has also been provided for the development of adult educational guidance and programme support measures. The need is recognised not only to expand adult education programmes, but also to develop support services so that adults can gain optimum benefit from a return to education which is relevant to their needs. The funds are to provide a service covering a spectrum of needs ranging from initial outreach, particularly in the fields of literacy and basic education, vocational information, guidance and orientation, advice in dealing with learning fears as well as counselling <Col N="529" /> and access to expert services where necessary. To progress matters a multi-agency working group was established in association with the National Centre for Guidance in Education and other relevant interests to oversee the development. Phase 1 has begun with 11 projects in 2000. There will be expansion to further areas in 2001. Therefore, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, has been particularly busy and active in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, has been very active also on the policy front. In 1998 the first ever Green Paper, &ldquo;Adult Education in an Era of Lifelong Learning&rdquo;, was published. This was followed by a comprehensive consultation process which gave rise to a level of debate and discussion that was unprecedented in the sphere of adult education. Various organisations convened seminars and focus groups, the Department of Education and Science held six regional seminars, there was a national invitation process for written submissions and over 70 individual meetings were held by the Department with national level education and training organisations, Departments, research, manpower, industrial development agencies and community and voluntary sector organisations. The consultation process culminated with a national forum on adult education in Dublin Castle in September 1999. The Minister of State took part in many of these consultation processes.</P>
    <P>Feedback from the process informed the development of the White Paper, &ldquo;Adult Education: Learning for Life&rdquo;, which was launched by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, in August 2000. This is the first ever White Paper on adult education in the history of the State and it set out a comprehensive strategy for the future development of the sector as a major element in promoting a continuum of lifelong learning.</P>
    <P>The paper sets out the central role of adult education in promoting competitiveness and employment, in addressing poverty and disadvantage, in promoting personal development and enrichment, in supporting participative democracy and in strengthening individuals, families and communities. It provides an over-arching framework for the development of an integrated education and training system, bringing together the policies of a range of Departments and agencies in the context of a co-ordinated approach. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, has played a vital role in promoting inter-departmental co-operation in this area, where the promotion of lifelong learning opportunities is an integral and central element of education, training, employment, welfare, health, information society, justice, equality, local urban and rural development, and arts and cultural policies. The White Paper sets out a major strategy for growth in this area, enhancing access from literacy to advanced levels, building support services such as guidance and child care, supporting &ldquo;adult friendly&rdquo; models of delivery flexibility and responsiveness, promoting quality and innovation, addressing the needs of mar<Col N="530" /> ginalised groups, supporting the expansion of community education models and partnerships with the statutory sector, and setting out structures for a co-ordinated &ndash; inter-agency approach at national and local levels.</P>
    <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Programme for Competitiveness and Work and the yearly national employment action plans all contain commitments to the promotion of lifelong learning, and the issue moved centre stage in the national development plan and in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. In the knowledge society, a well developed education and training system and a workforce which is adaptable and willing to learn new skills are both necessities. Research throughout the world has demonstrated the central influence of education on life chances, and in recent years, there has been a growing realisation that education must be lifelong if we are to have an inclusive and democratic society which can adapt successfully to meet new challenges. In addition, we know that increasing children's participation and benefit from education is heavily dependent on also enabling parents to support their children's learning. Globalisation, increased competition, new technology, demographic change, a continuing need to upskill the workforce, more leisure time and an emphasis on social and cultural development are all converging factors which make it an imperative to invest systematically in adult education. This Government recognised the need for development in this area in appointing Deputy O'Dea as the first Minister of State for adult education.</P>
    <P>The value of that decision has been proved in the achievements of the sector since then &ndash; in adult literacy incorporating multi-media approaches, developing guidance and child care promoting equality, flexibility, access and quality supports, in securing major investment under the national development plan, and in the development of a co-ordinated integrated strategic policy framework which sets out a blueprint to underpin the future development of the sector. He has secured a commitment to partnership of all &ndash; Government, education and training providers, business, trade unions, communities, voluntary organisations, individuals &ndash; to meet the challenge of bringing the concept of lifelong learning to reality.</P>
    <P>In short, the achievements of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, in this area have been outstanding in so short a time. These developments did not occur overnight. They required much planning, dialogue and interaction with key stakeholders, dedication and insight, and a willingness to work in partnership towards achieving a professional policy, a systematic approach and a high quality service. The Minister of State has been to the forefront in leading these developments.</P>

      <P>The Deputy suggested he had done nothing, that he was no great value but the reality is the opposite. He has done a tremendous amount of work and has been a beaver behind the scenes as is clear from the output. He is very much appreciated by those organisations. I have met a number of them, not as many as he because he is working in that area continuously, and they certainly have a great appreciation for the work he is doing.</P>
      <P>There is a provision in the national development plan for an expenditure of more than £166 million on youth services during the seven-year period of the plan. This is further evidence of the importance attached to this provision. The development so far illustrates very clearly the commitment of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, and the Government to significant additional funding in that area. These figures include provision for the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund. The purpose of this fund is to develop youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has potential to develop. The fund was set up with a view to attracting young people in those areas who are at risk of becoming involved in drugs, into more health and productive pursuits. All will agree this is a very worthwhile scheme, which is funded through my Department, and which aims to tackle the drug problem that exists in certain identified areas.</P>
      <P>In April 2000, the Youth Work Bill, 2000, was published. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, introduced the Second Stage of the Bill in Dáil Éireann on 23 November 2000. The purpose of this is to provide a statutory framework for the provision of youth work programmes and services.</P>

It provides for a three-year youth work development plan for each vocational education committee area. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, has put in an enormous amount of work into that area and I am conscious of that. The Bill was put forward after detailed discussions between the Minister of State and his officials with the various organisations and interest groups. Those discussions were very satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, at the Minister's request, guidelines in relation to child protection in the youth work area have been produced by the national youth <Col N="532" /> work advisory committee and it is the Minister of State's intention that a comprehensive training programme will be made available for youth workers and volunteers. He is also involved with the youth information centres. On the international scene, the Minister and his officials are very much involved in the meetings, consultations, etc. that are taking place in regard to the production of an EU White Paper on youth policy in the latter part of 2001.</P>

The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, was particularly concerned that pupils with special needs should be able to attend a school appropriate to their particular needs. There has been an increase of more than 100 transport services catering for pupils with special needs since he took office. It is clear that from school transport to youth affairs to adult education, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, has been innovative and dynamic and has given unstinting energy and commitment to the improvement of public services for the community in his sphere of activity.

      <P>This motion should be about much more than an act of disloyalty on the part of one Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, directed against his Government colleagues with one eye, no doubt, directed towards trying to inflict some political damage on his coalition colleagues, the Progressive Democrats.</P>
      <P>Nobody who has followed the colourful political career of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, with even a casual degree of interest, will have been surprised that he regarded the prospect of some marginal constituency advantage accruing to him to be much more important than any principle of collective Government responsibility.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, has built much of his political career on acting the big man in Limerick and keeping his head well down in Dublin. My late colleague, Jim Kemmy, probably summed up his approach best when he described him as acting like mighty mouse in Limerick and behaving like a church mouse in Dublin.</P>
      <P>It is ironic that his disloyalty is directed on this occasion primarily against the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, who knows a thing or two about running with the hare and hunting with the hounds and distancing himself from Government decisions that might be unpopular with his constituents. During the course of the rod angling dispute, Deputy Molloy, then a full member of the Cabinet, had no problem standing shoulder to shoulder with the anglers of Galway west while dutifully trooping through the lobbies to support the Government position in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, has defended himself by saying that when he described the proposals of the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, as disastrous and when he encouraged the taxi drivers of Limerick &ldquo;to keep the pressure on&rdquo; he did not know he was being recorded. Is this to suggest that it would have been all right if he had not been recorded? Part of the reason that politics is held in low regard is because so many politicians tend to say one thing in private and another in public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I doubt if anyone, including the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, expected his duplicitous behaviour would lead to an immediate rebuke from his party leader. That is not the Taoiseach's style. When confronted with dissent and disloyalty, the Taoiseach's inclination is to turn the other way and look for another photo-opportunity. One can hardly expect high standards from a Taoiseach who appointed Ray Burke to the key position of Minister for Foreign Affairs and presided over the appointment of Deputy Ellis to the Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Foley to the Committee of Public Accounts and Deputy Lawlor to the <Col N="534" /> Members' interests committee, which includes, among its responsibilities, the job of monitoring ethical standards among Deputies.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has turned a blind eye to far more serious offences than the constituency opportunism of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea. His refusal to take any action against the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy O'Keeffe, who failed to disclose that he stood to benefit from the defeat of the Labour Party's Private Members' motion in the Dáil on Wednesday last, seeking a total ban on the feeding of meat and bone meal to any animals, prior to speaking on the motion and voting twice against it, is just the latest example of a Taoiseach who is content to lead from behind. The Taoiseach's failure to take any action in regard to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, or even to acknowledge the seriousness of the matter, renders his words at the weekend about ethics and standards in politics totally meaningless.</P>
    <P>This debate is about much more than the sins of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea. The more important issue has been the mishandling by the Government of the whole taxi issue. Let me make it clear. The Labour Party supports the lifting of quantitative restrictions on taxi numbers. We made that clear in our immediate response to the announcement by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, on 21 November, but the incompetent and inept manner in which this has been done has led to the first general taxi strike in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>For the past few Christmases the people of Dublin and most other cities have had to endure a serious taxi shortage. They have endured the past two weeks without a taxi service and now they face the prospect of an entire Christmas period without taxis. The Government that promised an improved taxi service has left us with no taxi service. This has resulted in major inconvenience for the travelling public at the very time of year when people are most likely to want to stay out late socialising.</P>
    <P>The withdrawal of taxis also had very serious consequences for commercial life not only in Dublin but in all major urban areas. Shops have reported that takings are down. Restaurants &ndash; at a time when they would normally do record business &ndash; have reported vacant tables. Nightclubs are reported to have laid off staff.</P>
    <P>The persistent refusal of the taxi organisations over recent years to agree to any proposals to increase taxi numbers to a level that would realistically be capable of meeting the demand has lost them many friends. The tactics of the taxi drivers since the dispute began seems designed to simply further alienate the public. However, we should not lose sight of the fact that many taxi drivers and their families are facing the prospect of a Christmas with no income.</P>
    <P>A major element souring the atmosphere around this issue has been the absolute sense of betrayal that many taxi drivers feel at the way in <Col N="535" /> which they were used and ultimately discarded by Fianna Fáil. The taxi fleet in Dublin provided what was, in effect, a transport wing of the Fianna Fáil election campaign during the 1997 general election. Many of us remember seeing taxi after taxi driving around covered with Fianna Fáil posters and stickers. Many of us also remember in the same election campaign the newspaper photographs of the Taoiseach happily posing with dozens of taxi drivers wearing T-shirts carrying the legend &ldquo;taxi drivers for zero tolerance&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The taxi drivers believed that if Fianna Fáil was returned to power its cosy cartel would be protected. Their confidence would have been reinforced by the fact that the programme agreed by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, An Action Programme for the Millennium, did not make a single reference to the taxi problem in Dublin or anywhere else.</P>
      <P>Taxi drivers are not the first group to find that Fianna Fáil will betray one when political expediency demands it. The Progressive Democrats, having endured the worst year since their formation in 1985, had to be seen to win some sort of political victory. The taxi drivers who had done so much to put the taxi drivers' friend, Deputy Bertie Ahern, into the position he now holds were abandoned. Is it any wonder they feel angry and betrayed?</P>
      <P>This dispute will have to be settled by discussion and negotiation at some stage. It is better that this should be done now, rather than at the end of a long dispute that would be costly for everyone. It is far better that it should be done through a process of negotiation rather than being left to the courts. Discussion and negotiation are the way to go.</P>
      <P>Taxi drivers have lost the battle on any numerical limitation and they need to acknowledge that. With no limit on the number of licences to be issued, there is a strong case for a significant improvement in the qualitative standards that should be applied. Setting a higher standard in terms of the quality of service to be provided by taxis will achieve a number of objectives. It will benefit serious, professional, full-time taxi drivers. It will discourage the entry of cowboys who will see an opportunity to make a quick buck by providing a low quality service at peak times. It will also benefit the consumers who will be confident that the taxi drivers who pick them up on the street or at a rank are of good character, that the car is clean and mechanically safe and sound, and that the driver is capable of getting the passenger to his or her destination in the most effective and economic way possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to this, it seems that the principal hurdle to getting to operate a taxi has been to get the money to buy a licence. There appears to have been little checking of the character of applicants. Many people will recall the sense of shock experi<Col N="536" /> enced when it was disclosed that the man convicted in the X case was driving a taxi. That was a shock in terms of the parental response when people were thinking their teenage daughters might have been driven home at night by the man convicted of such offences.</P>
    <P>Many people will also have been carried in taxis whose drivers did not seem to have a very sound knowledge of the area in which they were operating. Again there is an issue of poor maintenance and the mechanical condition of the vehicles. These are areas where there is an opportunity to introduce proper regulation in a deregulated market to secure better standards and to do things properly.</P>
    <P>It is also true that we have all been forced to depend to a great extent on taxis because of the generally poor standard of our public transport system. Increasing the numbers of taxis may provide the Progressive Democrats with the political, albeit temporary, comfort blanket, but it will not on its own, provide an adequate public transport service for the public.</P>

        <b>:</b> Deputy O'Dea should look on those empty rows of seats with some trepidation. They look innocuous enough as inanimate objects but he should regard them as hiding daggers pointed at his back. That is not because he is an opportunistic politician, as he has shown, not because he was speaking out of the two sides of his mouth at once, which he was, but because he was caught doing it, which is the unforgivable sin in Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stand for more taxis on the streets of Dublin in particular but not for the way in which this has been handled. Outright overnight deregulation is not the way this should be done. Extra taxis can be provided in Dublin to provide a service for all our people while at the same time allowing those <Col N="537" /> providing that service to have a decent living. There are many modern systems of global positioning and so on which could help with an A-1 taxi service in Dublin while allowing drivers and one car owners to provide decent services. I do not, of course, carry any spear for the speculators who bought up dozens of taxi plates in some cases. They abused cosies and exploited the situation and I do not speak for them.</P>
    <P>Deregulation, as provided for here and as supported by all the main right wing parties, is not in the interests of the public. Neither is it the real issue in many ways. The political key here is to create an economic regime where every publicly owned service is privatised and left to the speculator and the profiteer. Dublin Bus is next in the sights, then Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta &ndash; any public industry that can be taken over by opportunistic privateers who will then cherrypick for profits while leaving the service obligation to the public purse. That is the real agenda &ndash; to deregulate and to privatise.</P>
    <P>The campaign of vilification and outright smear against all taxi drivers in this controversy is disgusting in the extreme. Sections of the media have disgraced themselves with the distortions, slanders and smears they have directed against all those involved in the taxi sector. Incidents during the march of the drivers and their families have been exaggerated out of all proportion. Unfortunate incidents occur on the fields of play of hurling, rugby and soccer every week and occasionally someone may get their jaw broken in disgusting scenes but every member of the GAA club, soccer club or rugby club is not thereby vilified as a thug or gangster, which is what is happening with taxi drivers. There is a sinister campaign here and those politicians who have joined in it should be brought to account. Ordinary people have been dragooned in some cases because of the resentment of the inability of the Government, primarily, to provide a decent service over the years.</P>
    <P>The campaign of vilification has been to hide the real facts of the matter. The disgraceful state of Dublin's public transport system is one of the main issues that is being hidden. It is outrageous that tens of thousands of mainly young people are brought into the city centre on Friday and Saturday nights and at 12 o'clock they are virtually abandoned, save by a very limited service, and then the taxi drivers are blamed because these people cannot be cleared instantly off the streets.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have used this issue quite cynically to raise their tattered flag after a year in which they have been covered by mud while performing their role as mudguard for Fianna Fáil. They saw an opportunity and have gone for it most unscrupulously. There is a solution &ndash; an adequate number of taxis in Dublin and a proper, rational approach to allow everyone to make a decent living by providing a service &ndash; but it is not outright deregulation. However, will we now see corporations buying limousines, putting taxi plates on them and using the public <Col N="538" /> transport lanes to impress foreign visitors? There should be just compensation not for speculators but for the single owners who perhaps invested redundancy money or mortgaged their homes in view of the situation the Government stood over. The Government would not have changed the rules overnight for a multinational company in that way and innocent people trying their best to provide for their families should not be treated that way either.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was somewhat surprised when I saw this motion because there are far more deserving cases for no confidence than Deputy O'Dea. I think immediately of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. One need only look at the OECD report on the appalling state of the Irish environment or the millennium report of the Environmental Protection Agency, which shows unprecedented levels of air and water pollution in Ireland. The EU Commission is now taking us to court because of our terrible environmental record and we cannot even comply with the Kyoto Protocol, yet our Minister goes to The Hague and preaches to others. He is a far more deserving case.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Dea can be accused of cynical opportunism but that should not be surprising, he is a member of Fianna Fáil. This is the party that has been described by the Minister for Foreign Affairs as a pragmatic party of the centre, which is a wonderful description. They are unapologetically populist and always have been. This is the &ldquo;all things to all men&rdquo; party, the &ldquo;whatever you're having yourself&rdquo; party and the &ldquo;speaking out of both sides of your mouth&rdquo; party. That is the Fianna Fáil party and it always has been. It was built on the motto, &ldquo;I have my principles and if you don't like them, I have others.&rdquo;  Deputy O'Dea was pandering to his local electorate. He knows, and others will agree, that this is primarily a Dublin problem. It does not affect Limerick, Cork or Galway to the same extent, where there seems to be an adequate taxi services. He knew it was a Dublin issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The taxi people have obviously put their faith in Fianna Fáil and have been kicked in the teeth, as Deputy McManus said. They have been abandoned when it was politically expedient to do so. The Progressive Democrats have made this an issue. They see it as their political lifeline and have been quite cynical in their approach. If one looks at the history of this issue, neither party has anything to be proud of. In the programme for Government there was no mention of dealing with the taxi problem. The taxi people felt they had their men in, that the Taoiseach was their friend and that he would look after them. There was a slight change when the programme was renegotiated, as there was then a promise of 3,000 taxi plates to be given out to existing licence holders. That was the fatal mistake. It was put forward by Dr. John Fingleton, for whom I have a lot of admiration. He proposed this before being appointed to the Competition Authority but it <Col N="539" /> was a mistake, because clearly it discriminated against the hackney owners and the cosies. The cosies are the people who are being exploited in many cases by those who own taxi plates. We were told by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, that he had received legal advice and that this was the route to take. Who gave that legal advice? I as a lay person could have told the Minister of State that this was discrimination, yet he proceeded down this road. The result was inevitable &ndash; we were told this was not possible, that he could not act in this way and the result is that we have a judgment which states that he cannot confine the numbers of taxi plates.</P>

      <P>Before the adjournment I stated that there should be a top-up payment for apprentices so that they are brought in line with apprentices in other professions such as the Garda.</P>
      <P>Fundamental issues arise in relation to bottlenecks within the system that need to be tackled if we are to put a proper training fund in place. The Minister said that section 7 provides for a wide range of schemes which may be subvented by the fund. That is important but it is also important that proper structures are put in place. We should examine the PRSI element, something which is being considered in relation to this Bill, and give employers a clawback in PRSI if they are willing to put a structured training programme in their place of employment. That would benefit the employer, but also the employee because it is important that the employee buys into the process, whether through literacy programmes, the provision of basic computer skills or whatever. It is also important that there is an independent external evaluation of any such programme because employers claim that a number of the programmes put in place by FÁS, and the other State agencies, do not meet their specific requirements. There should be flexibility for the employers to buy in a package that will be independently evaluated but which would have a social element for employees incorporated into it so that everyone benefits from the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important, especially in the context of the budget tomorrow, that we do not put training programmes in place without the proper information technology structures and proper child care facilities. Otherwise, such programmes will be a waste of time. This year, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform failed to use his total budgetary allocation for the provision of child care facilities. It is a huge disappointment that that target has not been met. It is of fundamental importance, in relation to the Department <Col N="540" /> of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, that such provision is made in relation to the training programmes that will be developed under the Bill. We need to have a social contract tied into the training programmes, and this comes back to the point the Minister made in relation to changing from bricks to clicks.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that we must move up the value chain. I wholeheartedly agree with her on that point but we cannot expect employers, and especially employees, to upgrade their skills unless they can read and write. That is why I focused on the issue of literacy in my contribution because for far too long, that issue has been ignored. The Minister for Education and Science used nice words about the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, but, sadly, he has failed to make an impact on that area to date. The way forward is to tie in the training with literacy programmes and the development of IT skills. We should examine that in the context of those who are unemployed. It is wrong for people to say that those on the live register are downright lazy because many of those people would take up employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill. It is an important reform in the area of training. For too long, too many employers have regarded training as a cost rather than an investment. The contribution by the Minister this evening was a very cogent one, to which I would take little exception. I have some reservations about the Bill. I hope that we might be able to cope with that on Committee Stage because there are a number of departures in it that are not warranted by the thrust of the contribution she has made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's speech was, in the context of all speeches nowadays from Ministers, about the condition of the economy and all the mantra that we know so well, but she seems entirely unaware of the irony that while there is a need for much <Col N="541" /> more focus on the inadequacy of the training programmes and schemes available in Ireland, especially in terms of upskilling the existing workforce, the concentration is on high profile international roadshows to recruit workers here. There is something surreal about the high profile globetrotting by the Minister, Deputy Harney, and her officials in trying to induce people in South Africa, Beijing or Newfoundland to take up employment in Ireland. It is a surreal sight because at home there is an utterly inadequate focus on the very real need to upgrade the skills of Irish workers in the manufacturing and services sectors. Even worse, while the roadshow rumbles from continent to continent, the system at home is at sixes and sevens in trying to send economic refugees back to their country of origin while the State continues to entice commitments from other non-nationals to come here. Only the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs seems to have recognised the Alice in Wonderland quality and the fundamental unfairness of what she calls this shambolic policy.</P>
    <P>When reading about and hearing the Minister in far-flung places, I wonder whether anybody has paused to ask the reason we maintain a roadshow, junketing from Johannesburg to Beijing to Newfoundland to recruit workers to unthinkingly come to Ireland. Every worker who transfers to Ireland will need a house or other accommodation. Prospective migrants are not told that we have a housing crisis and that Government policy has made housing unaffordable for ordinary people, as well as inducing a rising rate of inflation and rising interest rates. Immigrants will probably purchase a car to add further to existing congestion. They are not told that our road system, public transport and railways are in a chaotic and sometimes dangerous condition. To what purpose do we engage in a roadshow circus of this kind while the infrastructure deficit is not being addressed and the housing crisis is not being tackled?</P>
    <P>Are we really serving a worthwhile purpose in seeking to dishonestly attract workers from across the world while the Government is overseeing infrastructural chaos, surging inflation and rising industrial unrest? Are we being honest with the people we are enticing here?</P>
    <P>It seems we are still caught in the old paradigm. The IDA still goes in search of jobs wherever it can get them. It is appropriate to at least check the merits of a policy designed to support ongoing unsustainable growth rates while the country is trapped in an infrastructural deficit &ndash; a housing crisis, surging inflation, rising interest rates and a general conduct of economic policy that is failing to share the prosperity.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile there is also a need for a national initiative to upgrade skills which, if unattended to, will lead to the demise of some of our more vulnerable sectors. It is regrettable that the Minister seems determined to abolish the industrial training committees, some of which worked extremely well and are essential to sustaining <Col N="542" /> growth and maintaining competitiveness. It is worth recording that one of Mrs. Thatcher's first actions was to drive trade union representatives off similar committees in the UK. The Labour Party will table amendments on Committee Stage in my name to provide for such industrial training committees in the new dispensation.</P>
    <P>I wanted to make that point about the pressure to feed the ongoing growth rates even if, ironically, that means travelling to Durban, Johannesburg, Newfoundland or China when Ministers are in conflict and the system is unable to cope with migrants. There may not always be a skills match, but the subject matter of the Bill is about this skills match and putting in place a better training system. For that reason, I support the Bill. The idea of a levy that is universal and collectable is obviously good. At a time when there is a slowdown in funds from the European Union for this kind of valuable work then it is good that this fund is being ring-fenced and cannot be raided in bad times. This makes much sense.</P>
    <P>For obvious reasons, since the 1980s the emphasis has been on the unemployed and unemployment. Servicing the skills needs of the people already in work suffered as a result of that focus. Deputy Naughten said he supported the Minister's invocation that we move up the value chain. Clearly she is correct, but we cannot do this unless the people who are employed are given the opportunities. I am afraid there is still inadequate appreciation of that need in the small and medium size indigenous enterprise sector. Today during the debate on the Supplementary Estimates for the Department I was struck that one of the areas which sent most of the money back to the Department of Finance was the area of science, technology and innovation. That is a great pity, and it must mean that the take-up rate by the companies concerned is very poor for whatever reason. Perhaps during times of boom and bloom they think it is not necessary, but the fact of the matter is that it is more necessary now than ever. The fact that the moneys provided for this purpose cannot be drawn down does not reflect well on those companies.</P>
    <P>I wish to put on the record a letter sent to the Taoiseach about the omissions in the Bill. For some reason the Minister advocates the repeal of certain sections of the 1967 Act which will remove the industrial training committees. This is a pity by and large. While they did not work equally, those that did work worked very well. It is a great pity that provision for their continuation in some form or other is not provided for in the Bill. The Minister said the performance of the industrial training committees is too rigid. At this late hour of the night I did not understand some of the other points she made but I will study her densely, cogently argued script before Committee Stage. She said: &ldquo;The framework of the 1967 Act is based on the concept of designating sectors, establishing statutory industrial training committees to oversee training in these sectors and imposing sectoral levies to fund that training&rdquo;. <Col N="543" /> There is nothing too much wrong with that in terms of designating sectors or establishing the industrial training committees. Presumably the sectoral levies will be absorbed into the national fund. The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>This framework is increasingly at odds with the developments I have just described. It is too rigid. It ignores intersectoral and value chain linkages which are increasingly important to competitiveness&mdash;</P>
    <P>There is much in that sentence and one would need time to think about it.</P>
    <P>&mdash;and it creates an artificial distinction between firm-specific and sector-specific assistance.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it does. I am an admirer of Professor Michael Porter and have had occasion to read him, but we should not take it too far. The Minister told me in the House in reply to parliamentary questions that the cornerstone of our economic progress is social partnership. The Minister of State, Deputy Davern, does not operate in that area but he knows the phrase as well and he would not need any prompting&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Government lives by social partnership, then it is fair that it should die by it where it chooses to derogate from it. The construction committee has been a very successful industrial training committee. I do not know whether it is being suggested that the procedures are too cumbersome or too slow, but the committee has worked well and some of the thinking that has emanated from it has been valuable in terms of the recent economic boom. That will go with the stroke of a pen and that is a pity. In addition Congress was under the impression, as was IBEC &ndash; but for obvious reasons a different argument <Col N="544" /> applies &ndash; that it would be involved in an advisory capacity in terms of the disbursement of the fund.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, succinctly outlined the twofold purpose of the fund in her contribution which is &ldquo;raising the skills of those in employment and providing training to those who wish to acquire skills for the purposes of taking up employment&rdquo;. That is a good, short summary of the legislation, but who chooses the schemes that will meet this twofold objective? That is the issue and the objective will be met by the Minister under the legislation. She is discounting any advisory committee comprised of the social partners and that is also a pity.</P>
      <P>I wish to read into the record the letter from the general secretary of Congress to the Taoiseach. It will provide some moral authority for my amendments on Committee Stage. I do not know how many Ministers will be in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development then but I expect the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, will outline to his Government colleagues the wisdom of my amendments.</P>

      <P>Dear Taoiseach,</P>
      <P>I am writing to you to convey the strongest concerns of Congress at a number of aspects of the above piece of legislation. While supporting the establishment of a training fund which is universal in coverage and easily capable of collection, Congress takes the view that the legislation is flawed in its failure to provide a consultative mechanism for the social partners and further flawed by the manner in which it seeks to dismantle the consultative mechanisms which are already in place.</P>
      <P>The involvement of the Social Partners in the financing and administration of vocational training is seen as a keystone to the effective management of vocational training systems at a European level. The current Commission Working paper on lifelong learning states that social partners should be &ldquo;systematically integrated into the development and implementation process&rdquo; of lifelong learning initiatives. Unions will have legitimate views to express both as regards the nature and content of the training to be provided and as to the balance between training for those in work and training for those seeking work.</P>

      <i>Consultative Mechanism within the NTF.</i>There has been an underlying consensus, going as least as far back as the foundation of ANCO in 1970, that the financing of Vocational Training should be a matter to be co-determined between the Government and the Social Partners. This legislation effectively terminates that consensus in section 7(1) and replaces it with a Ministerial prerogative &ldquo;whenever and so often that the Minister considers that is appropriate.&rdquo;<Col N="545" /> This is clearly unacceptable to Congress and is at variance with the approach to lifelong learning contained in the PPF.</P>
    <P>It is vital from the point of view of Congress that a forum exists for expressing those views. The importance of having a consultative mechanism is widely acknowledged both at National and European level. The National Competitiveness Council, in its most recent &ldquo;Statement on Skills&rdquo;, recognises this fact in recommending that employers and unions be represented on the management structure of the NTF.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Industrial Training Committees</i>Congress is gravely concerned that the repeals proposed in the schedule of the Bill would have the effect of abolishing the Industrial Training Committees and Joint Training Committees. These tripartite Committees have performed an extremely useful function since their inception.</P>
    <P>We have been in discussion with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment regarding the future role and shape of these Committees. We had expected that the Department would respond to the points made by Congress prior to bringing forward legislative proposals for their abolition.</P>
    <P>The structure of the Vocational Training and Education system in Ireland has been underpinned by a high level of consensus between the Government and the Social Partners. This has underlined the recent changes in apprenticeship and the development of a stronger emphasis on education and training for those in work.</P>
    <P>Congress would therefore urge that the Government would amend the legislation as follows:</P>
    <P>(1) To provide for a tripartite management committee of the National Training Fund;</P>
    <P>(2) Not to proceed with the repeal of Sections 24, 25, 27(2) and the Second Schedule of the Industrial Training Act 1967, thus continuing the mandate of the Industrial Training Committees.</P>
    <P>The letter is signed by the general secretary, Peter Cassells. It contains reasonable arguments and I do not see how the need to be modern in any way makes redundant the argument for consultative mechanisms set out in Congress's letter. They will only strengthen the Bill. The Government is free if the system is considered to be less efficient than it might be but the notion of consultation at that level is important.</P>
    <P>Mr. Cassells makes passing reference to the fact that there has been an improvement in the apprenticeship system in recent times. That was badly needed because the system was badly neglected during the recession. The employers were quite happy to foist the system on FÁS and when the boom arrived the necessary skilled manpower was not available. The area of apprenticeship, on which Deputy Naughten focused, is important, as is the extent of literacy problems, which was a <Col N="546" /> theme running through the Deputy's contribution.</P>
    <P>I have never heard unemployment figures broken down in the fashion they were broken down in the Minister's contribution. One needs to reflect on them, but they were broken down into a number of segments. A total of 52,000 people are still short-term unemployed while 28,000 are long-term unemployed. I presume these yardsticks are based on the labour force survey rather than on the live register. In addition to the people who indicated they were unemployed in response to the labour force survey, there is also a significant group, comprising 60,000, who are marginally attached to the workforce. I will have to take some advice on that. A number of people around here are marginally attached to what they do. I am not sure what it means but they still get paid.</P>

      <P>Whether one operates on the basis of the labour force survey or the live register there are still many people unemployed. If there is a revamp of training possibilities, more resources will be available in terms of providing labour, especially women in the home or married women generally. Suitable targeted, tailored training would bring some of those women, who have acquired considerable skills and who cannot be matched elsewhere, back into the workforce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true in many cases. If one is out of the workforce for a period, especially when technology is rapidly changing, it is normal and understandable to lack confidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. There are opportunities in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that, in the surveys to which she referred, 40% of companies did not have a specific training budget, suggesting that training was pursued on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. That is very sobering. Notwithstanding the progress made and on which we praised ourselves earlier, 40% of companies not making specific budgetary provision for training is a matter of concern in the times in which we live and in the context of accelerating change. Some 40% of companies is a great deal and much work remains to be done in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder about the Minister's reference to what she obviously considers a great success in terms of the Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Act, 1998, the legislation which created Enterprise Ireland and which amalgamated agencies. Clearly the Minister believes it to be a considerable landmark and achievement. I am not sure if it is. FÁS has a certain infrastructure for training. Enterprise Ireland in the Irish context seems to be unwieldy. I do not know how well it <Col N="547" /> has gelled together. It is difficult to judge it from outside.</P>
    <P>I also note that the normal pattern which would have occurred in other countries, whereby people who provided the services provided by Enterprise Ireland would have spun off into private industry a long time ago, does not seem to have happened in Enterprise Ireland, for whatever reason, to anything like the extent one might have expected. Therefore, there is not the same freedom to recruit young people recently out of the education system who have ideas and some experience at that level and are involved in innovation. An agency such as Enterprise Ireland must be constantly regenerated. One must ask to what extent the leadership, board and managing director of the company have been hidebound by that historical situation.</P>
    <P>We have a tremendous predilection in Ireland for rejigging agencies and Departments as if it were the be all and end all. I am not so sure it is a great policy. It takes years for new agencies to settle down and turf wars are fought about this or that or who will be the chief executive and so on. Much of that happened in this case and a compromise was made at the time that An Bord Tráchtála would not be included, which was purely politically motivated. I am not sure that is the best way. There are concerns about the responsiveness of the agency at some levels although there is great praise for it in respect of other areas.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill. I hope it will produce a shift in the thinking of employers on the matter of training and especially the importance of upskilling the existing workforce. I note that the establishment of the fund does not mean the funding of new activities in the next year. I suppose we must learn to walk before we can run. However, one gets the impression from the speech that a number of new activities or innovations might be undertaken. It appears funding is not provided for these new activities next year, although I hope there will be an increasing spend in the apprenticeship because that is urgent and important at this stage.</P>
    <P>I fully support the notion of a dedicated payroll levy. That can only be good in providing stability. The youth employment levy was sucked back into the general maw of the Exchequer. It was another tax and did not mean anything in terms of youth employment or creating employment in that area.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister between now and Committee Stage, which is not that long because we must ensure the Bill is passed in this calendar year, rethink the question of excising the industrial training committees? Strong representations have been made by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on this and, given the general ethos of partnership, such excisions are undesirable. I do not understand why the permanent government would resist some type of advisory committee to the Minister for the disbursement of the fund. These would be modest amendments which would have an impact in terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="548" /> I do not raise the question whether we are caught on the old paradigm because I do not recognise the existing skills shortage and the need for us to keep our contracts with companies located here. We brought them here on the basis that we still had cheaper and better quality labour than they might get elsewhere. It is important we meet these commitments. One cannot but be struck by the incongruity that, on the one hand, we are trying to round up migrants, the majority of whom, admittedly, are probably economic refugees, who are in Ireland to send them back to their countries of origin while, on the other, we are in Beijing encouraging people to come here. I do not understand that.</P>
    <P>Neither do I understand it in terms of the Minister's definition of what productivity means in the modern context, that we neglect proper focus on the upgrading of the existing workforce in favour of going abroad to bring people here who will need houses and cars and who will further clutter up the streets of this city. It is reasonable to ask for what purpose this is being done. How important is it to us that we achieve another percentage point in the growth rate or that we feed the voracious appetite of the tiger in a situation where we are caught in the infrastructural deficit? It will take us at least five years to bring housing back into synch. The Bacon reports have had no more impact on this than the person selling papers on the corner of O'Connell Bridge, apart from tightening up the rental market, which is the only impact it has had.</P>

We will have to bring them in. We will have to re-examine that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Deputy Martin Brady may come along. The Minister used a nice phrase when she spoke of the shift from bricks to clicks in the growth of the knowledge economy. That has been seen throughout the country. One need only look at primary schools in every village. Information technology is available in all of them and students have the opportunity to learn about computers and train to use the Internet, send e-mails, find a web page and find information generally on computers. Much training <Col N="549" /> and retraining is going on in this regard. As the Tánaiste said, it concerns those in employment and others who wish to acquire skills for the purpose of securing employment. This is a particularly important point given the current skills shortage. One omission, however, relates to training people with disabilities and I am surprised it has not been covered in the Bill. Both in this House and in the Seanad there have been debates about the provision of personal assistants for people with physical and sensory disabilities. This matter was raised recently on the Adjournment of the Seanad by Senator John Cregan, and the reply from the Department stated:</P>
      <P>In this context, it is necessary for FÁS, as the operational agency for the programme, to prioritise projects according to needs. FÁS currently gives priority to caring and support projects based in the community and voluntary sector, including services for people with disabilities. The restructuring of community employment also involves the proposed mainstreaming of certain essential services currently provided under CE, including services for disabled persons. Mainstreaming in the context of CE is the term used to describe the proposed transfer of funding and the provision of services to the relevant mainline Department with direct responsibility for the area concerned. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has a good record when it comes to the prioritisation it is giving to carers of those with disabilities, so I thought there would be some reference to this matter in the legislation.</P>
      <P>As outlined in the explanatory memorandum, the principal items covered in section 9 are the repeal of the statutory provisions covering the former apprenticeship and sectoral levies which were suspended in 2000 in anticipation of the introduction of the national training fund levy and those providing for the establishment and operation of the statutory industrial training committees, which were integrally linked to the sectoral levies grant schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sound apprenticeship scheme was operated by the former training authority, AnCO, and sponsorship was provided by companies which trained people for employment. Given the current skills shortage, employers are keen to acquire workers and it may be that training is suffering. We are often told there is no time for training or retraining, but I do not agree that is the case. Training is very important and must continue. More emphasis should be placed on apprenticeships. In the past, many students were able to enter a trade as an apprentice after doing their intermediate certificate examination, but that does not seem to be occurring in the same way now. Perhaps we have put the cart before the horse in terms of training, with a view to getting people employment. We should not repeal statutory provisions covering the former apprenticeship levies until a national training fund levy has <Col N="550" /> been established. The Tánaiste has referred to this matter which is dealt with in the legislation.</P>
    <P>As regards the financial implications, it seems everyone is a winner and nobody will lose. The introduction of the national training fund and the associated levy will offset the cost of programmes that otherwise would require State support. This will result in savings to the Exchequer. I understand there are no net additional costs arising for employers from the introduction of the national training fund levy which will be offset by a corresponding 0.7% reduction in employers' PRSI contributions. Savings will arise for certain companies due to the abolition of the existing sectoral levies, and that is an important point to establish.</P>
    <P>There is also provision in the legislation for payment by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs of a sum of £420 million from the social insurance fund to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for the year 2000, to take account of the fact that the relevant training schemes have been subvented by the Exchequer this year.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for funds from the former levy grant scheme which are held by FÁS, to be transferred to the national training fund. This money will be used for relevant training initiatives under the fund. The levy grant scheme is being abolished through the repeal of the relevant section of the Industrial Training Act, 1967. Will there be any reduction in funding to FÁS? Such funding should continue and perhaps the Tánaiste, in her reply, could provide details of European funding for FÁS schemes.</P>
    <P>Rural Deputies are aware of the importance of the role of FÁS and community employment schemes. In various debates, the Tánaiste has said that, following Government approval in 1999, community employment programmes are being restructured to take account of falling unemployment levels and to better target available places for the long-term unemployed. According to the Tánaiste, a number of people are still classed as short-term and long-term unemployed, and we must make provision for them. She provided statistics showing that there were 52,000 short-term unemployed and 28,000 long-term unemployed persons. The Tánaiste referred in particular to the need to increase the rate of female employment.</P>
    <P>As part of the process of restructuring the employment schemes and in consultation with the social partners, a decision was taken to gradually reduce the numbers employed in community employment schemes, from an average of 37,500 in 1999 to 28,000 by the year 2003. The Government's restructuring decision included, among other measures, a new three year limit on participation in community employment schemes, except in the case of island residents. This was meant to discourage repeated participation in the CE programme. Once an exception is made, however, one will be asked to be even more flexible. I hope the Tánaiste will be more flexible as regards these schemes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="551" /> The restructuring of the community employment programme is part of an overall shift in strategic policy in favour of greater investment in training places, particularly for persons under 25 years of age and long-term unemployed people. I understand that the Department is giving active consideration in the first instance to the mainstreaming of community employment services to school secretaries, caretakers and classroom assistants, and to personal assistants for those with disabilities. This is an important issue and the Tánaiste and her Department should look across the whole spectrum of possible employment schemes. Certain matters should be examined and changes could be made across the board. Every case concerning social employment schemes is different.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the role of agriculture in national training schemes. Last week, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development discussed education and training when he replied to the debate on BSE. There is a major role for the farming community in such schemes. For example, Teagasc has said that three out of four farmers in the west are engaged in part-time farming. The question arises, however, as to where farmers will get jobs. I cannot visualise a situation where farmers in my part of east Galway could travel 40 miles to find employment in Galway city, in addition to doing some farming in the morning and in the evening when they return home after another 40 mile journey. It is not physically possible for people to continue as part-time farmers in such circumstances and it is unfair to ask small farmers to do so.</P>
    <P>I welcome the White Paper on Rural Development which was launched by the Minister of State, Deputy Davern. He spoke about farmers being able to get employment within a reasonable distance of their homes. They will not be able to continue to drive long distances to get work. The social employment and community employment schemes are very important for those who want to secure off-farm employment.</P>
    <P>In the debate last week on education and training the Minister spoke strongly about the information leaflets on BSE available through the Department. I understand the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has also produced a video on the subject, which is available to veterinary surgeons. Copies have been distributed to local authority veterinary inspectors responsible for monitoring controls at local authority abattoirs.</P>
    <P>The industrial training programme for meat industry operatives is being developed by FÁS in conjunction with the Department, the meat industry and other meat regulatory authorities. The programme is progressing well with the beef abattoir pilot programme nearing completion while the training of operatives at meat plants is under way. The programme will be subject to external audit to guarantee its integrity. It is very important that education and training are being <Col N="552" /> provided in the agriculture industry and I would like to see it continue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte referred to the social economy programme. There appears to be some confusion as to how one qualifies for entry to the programme. The main ingredient is that one must have a business plan. Many such plans are produced in consultation with FÁS and submitted to the Department in order to seek an extension to a three year programme. This is a good development. To avoid community groups having to process reams and reams of paper it should be a requirement only to submit a simple business plan. If it is not possible to provide for this, I repeat my call that responsibility for a number of FÁS schemes be transferred to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, which is already responsible for the very popular student summer job scheme.</P>
    <P>There is also an opportunity to look at the role of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in devising social assistance schemes in order to benefit those over the age of 50 or 55 years who will find it very difficult to obtain employment once they complete a community employment scheme. This is one reason there has been a strong call at local authority level, in the Seanad and in this House to allow persons to remain on a scheme once they reach the age of 50 or 55 years. Those over the age of 45 years should also be allowed to re-enter the scheme sooner. Currently, they have to wait one year.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which has been introduced earlier than promised by the Government. The need for training must be emphasised. I am afraid that we will be very keen to attract people to this country to fill the available jobs, but it should not be forgotten that there is a need to provide training to enable the people concerned acquire the skills that they need if they are to progress in their chosen employment. I congratulate the Tánaiste on introducing the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinBrady" hpid="Mr. M. Brady Mr. M. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kitt for sharing his time with me. I congratulate the Minister and her officials on bringing forward this measure which gives effect to one of last year's budgetary measures. In some respects, it merely gives status to what is already happening. Any criticisms, therefore, that the Government has been unduly dilatory in giving effect to announced policy are seriously misplaced. This partnership Government is good. It is delivering consistently on the programme agreed in 1997, the elements of which are benefiting every citizen in some measure, but nowhere has the impact of Government policy been more apparent than in the area of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government economic policy has delivered a massive reduction in the numbers of unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed. The November live register figure of 136,962 shows a massive month-on-month drop of 117,907 on the June 1997 figure. Those in receipt of full weekly <Col N="553" /> payments now number fewer than 95,000. Not only do the figures reflect the positive effects of the Government's policies, they also reflect, as the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, indicated, the achievements of those who, through self-will and participation in employment support programmes, are availing of greater employment opportunities, resulting in a better standard of living for themselves and their dependants.</P>
    <P>The continuous fall in the numbers on the live register &ndash; many employment opportunities continue to be available to the unemployed &ndash; gives the lie to the old statement that one is better off on the dole. It is untrue. The various training schemes operated directly and indirectly under the auspices of the Minister's Department have contributed much to the increase in the numbers in employment. I refer in particular to the community employment and job initiative schemes which have successfully facilitated the entry of many long-term unemployed persons as well as new entrants to the economy. The success of such endeavours is now evident in the mainstreaming of many activities under various Departments.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Department are to be further congratulated on the manner in which the schemes have successfully redeemed their merits and extended their trial bases to incorporate the marginalised and the socially excluded in training programmes as the ranks of the involuntary unemployed have been systematically thinned out by the success of the Government's policies. The Minister of State, Deputy Eoin Ryan, has played no small part in this. He has acted above and beyond the call of duty in his drugs portfolio and gone out of his way to meet community groups. He has not been found wanting. I congratulate him on his commitment.</P>

      <P>Members of the Traveller community are now participating in a number of training schemes and programmes designed to integrate them fully into the white rather than the black economy, with which many of them are familiar.</P>
      <P>The pace at which employment is continuing to expand is astonishing. The quality of the jobs being created in many sectors is extremely high. Nonetheless, we should not be blind to the fact that a modern, complex economy has a requirement for a broad and varied mix of skills. Additional retraining has increasingly become a feature of lifetime employment. The national training fund will provide valuable support in meeting such training needs in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the features of a modern, fast paced, competitive and dynamic economy is that companies will fail as well as succeed. This will entail job losses, but a strong and expanding economy can provide alternative employment for those <Col N="554" /> unfortunate enough to lose their jobs in such circumstances. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Bill, which I welcome. It updates the 1967 Act which has served training and development well. The Act was innovative and had greatest effect during the 1970s and 1980s, but time has moved on. Business is now much more sophisticated and has a need for a different type of training. The Tánaiste referred to two training groups, the employed and the unemployed. I will refer first to training for the employed. It has become necessary to have ongoing training of the employed to ensure they are able to respond to changes in the economy and in their businesses and to ensure their skills are updated and responsive to a changing working environment. When looking at training we tend not to look at the entire scope of training and development. There must be ongoing training in all employment sectors.</P>
      <P>My experience has been in employment in the private sector. There is a need for constant training of management, supervisors, crafts people and among semi-skilled and unskilled workers. We should consider more than just skills training. Knowledge of the job, the product, the company, the market and the raw materials is also important. Employees of a company or organisation should be knowledgeable not only about the work they do but also about the organisation generally. Knowledge and information are changing commodities and it is incumbent on companies to ensure their employees' knowledge is updated as technologies, markets and efficiencies change. It is important that employees are aware of the changes.</P>
      <P>Awareness of the need or reason for something happening is 80% of the way towards securing the acceptance of change by people at the coalface. Lack of knowledge creates fear and insecurity and increases everybody's inherent resistance to change, both as an individual and as part of a group. However, if there is knowledge of why it is necessary, the resistance to change will be reduced and it is more likely to be embraced. Many companies have become inefficient and gone out of business because they did not change or adapt to changing circumstances. Sometimes the management did not have the skills or the will to face the introduction of change and the reaction that inevitably occurs in an organisation when change is introduced. Knowledge is most important for a work force.</P>
      <P>Attitudinal training also tends to be neglected. Many years ago we were told that the three commodities in training were knowledge, attitude and skills. It is important to ensure that attitudinal training is undertaken, in the context of people's attitudes to an organisation, and that there is a programme to encourage a positive attitude. This is clearly linked to the knowledge area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People tend to concentrate on skills. Skills are vital to an organisation be they at management, <Col N="555" /> supervisory, craft or factory floor level. The 1967 Act introduced the AnCO levy grant system. It had a huge effect. I saw that effect because 26 years ago I was appointed training manager in the organisation in which I worked. Companies, especially indigenous companies, had no understanding or acceptance of the need for training. In fact, they saw it as an expense.</P>
    <P>The stick rather than the carrot was used in the old levy grant scheme. The stick was a 1% levy on wages. If the companies did certain things, such as appoint a qualified training manager, carry out assessments of training needs and implement programmes to meet those needs, they would get back 90% of the levy. That was the incentive. Many managers at the time were extremely resistant to that approach. They saw it as an interference with their right to manage their companies. I saw the same managers, following the introduction of training, quickly become converts to it because of the success that resulted.</P>
    <P>I saw people at factory floor level, who were trained by AnCO as instructors, come back to the business and open the eyes of supervisors and middle management with the skills they obtained. There was a quick conversion to the benefit of training in many areas. There was still some resistance. However, we had moved away from the stick approach and training and development were eventually accepted as benefits.</P>
    <P>Organisations are relatively quick to accept training for semi-skilled and unskilled employees because there is an immediate benefit. In other words, if one wants somebody on an assembly line to do A, B and C at a certain rate, there is an understanding that one must train them to do it. There is less understanding, however, of training for people at higher levels such as supervisory and junior management. Often there is less value placed on the man management skills required at that level. It is important that in this more enlightened era than 1967, when the Act was introduced, we do not undervalue the need for skills in man management.</P>
    <P>This applies to the public service as well as other areas. I am aware of difficulties in Departments as a result of a lack of man management and motivational skills on the part of the people in charge. They still believe in an autocratic approach whereby instructions are issued and are to be responded to in a pavlovian manner by the work force.</P>
    <P>This recently came to my attention at a State body. It has 40 staff but there is low morale and stress, the result of a lack of understanding about the need for proper motivation of employees, information for employees about developments and, above all, the need to listen to their views and learn from them. Often the person at the coalface knows more about the manufacture of the product, the giving of the service or, if they are interfacing with the public on an issue, how the public feels, than the bosses who are a few steps removed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="556" /> Middle and senior management have much to learn from the experience of people who are at the coalface whether that is on the factory floor or providing a service in a health board, council, State body or insurance company. Training and development can ensure people understand that. Even though we think this is an enlightened age, it is not the case in many areas.</P>
    <P>Back in the old days, crafts held a very high status and were very valued. They are and should still be similarly valued. It appals me when somebody says of someone that they only did an apprenticeship. An apprenticeship in a craft area is a marvellous skill for life. We should examine the training, which I am not criticising. I am only examining it because I do not know what the problem is. The value put on the craft areas has created a shortage in these areas. There is no doubt there is a shortage of plumbers, carpenters, fitters and, to some extent, electricians but perhaps not to a great degree because of the input of the ESB over the years in that area. It has been excellent in ensuring that people have been trained in the electrical crafts. We should ensure that the value to the State, industry and areas of traditional crafts are not underestimated.</P>
    <P>The training of the unemployed is the most difficult area of all because it relates to what I mentioned earlier, knowledge, attitude and skills. These three areas are important but are difficult to communicate. FÁS has done very good work in this regard. The social employment schemes are often derided. They were very important in many ways. We have reached the stage now where communities are looking for participants to work. Going back to the start of the social employment schemes when there was very high unemployment, with regard to knowledge, attitude and skills, those schemes had more impact than in any other area about which I am talking. I knew people who did not work for five, six or seven years, who went out and started building walls and found they had skills they never thought they had. Their attitude towards work and the work ethic totally changed. One fellow who was unemployed is employing ten people today. He went on a social employment scheme, was shown how to build walls in a village and now everybody wants him &ndash; he is in demand.</P>
    <P>I know of several cases like that. That involved a skills change as well as an attitudinal change. It was a great attitudinal change to break the mould of people who were long-term unemployed, who felt they were unemployable and who perhaps were unemployable in their previous state, and to match them with skills. Perhaps there was an absence of knowledge in terms of the social employment schemes but there was not always an absence of skills. People have stated that all the schemes did was take people off the live register, which they did, but they achieved much more than that. I compliment FÁS on the work it has done in that and other areas.</P>
    <P>We must be aware of people who become unemployed whose skills become redundant. <Col N="557" /> Once somebody became unemployed, traditionally we felt that they should go on the live register for unemployment benefit, then on to unemployment assistance and, after a period, to FÁS and they were three or four years unemployed at that stage. Where skills become redundant, no matter what age, there is no reason somebody of 55, 60, 65 or 70 cannot become computer literate. There should be a concentration on the whole area of skill changes, on identifying where a skill is lost and becomes redundant and aspects of that skill that might relate to another skill in the same or another area. As skills become redundant in the technological age, one will see much more of this. We must ensure that the positive aspects of those skills are identified and there should be a move towards that.</P>
    <P>In the old days we were very much into assessment of training needs. One did not introduce training without a thorough assessment of training needs, otherwise one was training for something which might not be needed or for the sake of training. However, if one could respond to a training need, identify training areas where new skills are needed, there should not be age discrimination. Perhaps it is less so nowadays but there was a time when we had high unemployment and if one was an unemployed male under 40 or an unemployed female under 36, one was unemployed for life. That was the case only 12 or 14 years ago. I hope that has changed but we must see change among the training agencies.</P>
    <P>We have a great opportunity in the areas of knowledge, attitude and skills to train refugees and immigrants, those who have got refugees, status and have been accepted as immigrants. There is a marvellous opportunity to train them in motor skills and skills already mentioned which are needed in the community, but we should also concentrate on the area of knowledge. Above all we should train them to understand our culture, our work culture, what it means to live in Ireland and what Irish people feel should happen and how one should respond in the workforce. In that area, there is a great need for training of management and supervisors to ensure they recognise the difference in cultural attitudes in the workplace of people who are coming here from abroad and who are badly needed. There is an aspect of training in that area to be examined, and the challenge is for the Department to do so.</P>
    <P>The training of Travellers was raised. Some training is available for Travellers but much more needs to be done in this regard. Training is available in a centre run by Limerick County Council in Rathkeale, County Limerick, where I come from. There is a training centre for Travellers and Traveller women train there and learn skills and some of them work in the local factory. We have not tackled the area of training of Travellers because we have not identified the Traveller community's training needs. We decide what a Traveller should be trained in but have we asked the Travellers' opinion? Have we sat down with Travellers and told them individually that we will <Col N="558" /> introduce training programmes and asked them what they think should be involved? I know that in certain circumstances the most important certificate a Traveller can get is a driver's licence because it is a way for him or her to make a living.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. I spent many years involved in this area. I pay tribute to one other organisation, the Irish Management Institute, which in the 1970s and 1980s did a great deal in the whole training area, particularly the training of management. The contribution of the Irish Management Institute from the time it was founded has never been recognised. My knowledge of it in the 1970s was that it did marvellous work in the training of management and supervisors. I pay tribute to the Irish Management Institute for the work it did over that period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is being introduced to establish the national training fund. The Bill's provisions will result in the financing of training for people in employment and in the provision of training for those who wish to acquire skills for the purpose of taking up employment. The Bill also provides for the payment by employers of a 0.7% levy and the making of certain adjustments which will eliminate the burden of the levy. The contribution of this levy to the fund will prove extremely positive.</P>
      <P>Section 7, which is one of the most important sections in the Bill, concerns the various schemes which can be put in place. The Department would do well to focus on the type of companies we are trying to address here and to examine the variety of company structures within the economy. The multinationals, which trade internationally, provide in-house training programmes on an ongoing basis. They are willing to employ people from any background, educate them and encourage them to serve the company. Dell offers a programme in which, regardless of people's background, they can avail of a variety of in-house courses at a range of levels and skill themselves up to the point where they can enter the management structure. I heard some of the company's employees being interviewed recently. It was interesting to note that one of the managers, who came from a council background, entered the company as a human resource executive and moved up the ladder to a position where he is now responsible for the company's thousands of employees. If we invest in proper courses and skill-up employees, people will be able to move from tier to tier in these companies.</P>
      <P>Companies should be able to avail of funding which would encourage them to stay in Ireland and participate in schemes such as this one. This scheme is evidence of the Government's recognition that such companies require support. Employees will be able to learn skills within their companies and grow with the companies, thereby keeping main players in industry in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should also focus on the SME sector which is the one most in need of attention. I encounter many SMEs through my work on the county <Col N="559" /> enterprise board. There is a need to focus on training company managers. The economy has changed dramatically over the past five years and this change will accelerate at an even greater level over the coming five years. We must ensure that company managers are up to speed with the dramatic and dynamic changes which are occurring within our economy. We must ensure that the indigenous SME sector is allowed to participate fully in new developments in the economy which, in turn, will serve economies within the EU and beyond.</P>
    <P>The manufacturing and services sectors also require special attention because methods of manufacturing are changing in addition to changes in the types of services being delivered and their manner of delivery. Technology is forcing change on everyone. More often than not, those at management level in small businesses simply do not have time to set up a training structure for their staff in order that the companies would be prepared for increasingly competitive environments. A method must be devised to give such people the necessary time-out to set up training structures.</P>
    <P>The SMEs are willing to participate in training but have not found the means by which to do that. They recognise the opportunities which exist within Ireland and abroad to sell their products and grow their companies but they require Government support. This fund will go some way towards addressing that.</P>
    <P>Unemployed people are the focus of much debate and we must focus on their needs. Many unemployed people have availed of FÁS funding to complete ECDL courses. Having completed courses such as ECDL and advanced ECDL, these people require assistance and encouragement to enter the workforce. The courses organised and funded by FÁS are of great value to the unemployed and the marginalised because they give them a sense of purpose and offer them the hope of breaking out of the cycle of unemployment. We must address the hard core of long-term unemployed people who are not familiar with technology and who do not appreciate how the courses on offer can help them to access sustainable and full-time jobs.</P>
    <P>Marginalised people, through funding provided by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and FÁS, have availed of myriad courses which will help them to re-enter the workforce. They are now driving developments in information technology and are demanding new courses which will provide them with the type of qualifications being sought by employers. This Bill offers an ideal mechanism through which we can respond to the types of demands being made of the Government to assist unemployed people to re-enter the workforce. Unemployed people are excited by the fact that IT courses are finally breaking the cycle.</P>
    <P>FÁS courses have enabled people with disabilities to participate more fully in the workforce <Col N="560" /> either from their homes or in the workplace. We must build on that because a considerable number of disabled people have not availed of the courses on offer, as a result of which they are not in mainstream employment and are not in the position to work from home. Some of the funding being provided for in this Bill should be directed towards this sector. They should be given every opportunity because even with limited funding they have proved that when they avail of education courses they can access full-time employment and impress employers.</P>
    <P>The culture of the disabled being in a specific part of the economy and not participating in the mainstream workforce is gone. To complement what has already happened in the sector we need to invest money to get those people who are now valuable to the economy to return to mainstream employment, and there is a wonderful opportunity through the funding provided in this Bill to make that happen.</P>
    <P>County enterprise boards, which interact on a daily basis with SMEs, should be the body through which the fund is disbursed. They can adopt an even-handed approach in terms of the various schemes which can be undertaken and the courses which can be put in place. They know who they are dealing with, the companies in the incubation units and those with which they have worked over the past number of years. The enterprise boards are working quite well.</P>
    <P>At county level there are county enterprise boards, county councils, the county chairman of SPCs and many other different structures. Over the years, however, not enough acknowledgment has been given to the work undertaken by county enterprise boards which have strengthened the indigenous sector and increased the number of jobs, which otherwise would not exist. Due to the fact that they have been successful they should be allowed to build on that by being the main body through which the fund is disbursed. By using the enterprise boards it will be possible to fund, for example, the Traveller community, as they will be able to investigate their requirements, etc.</P>
    <P>A very valuable asset to the economy which is not being tapped to the extent it should are senior citizens. Nationally, the Senior Citizens Parliament has been established with various divisions of the parliament being set up throughout the country &ndash; one was set up in Kilkenny this week and the first meeting was attended by almost 100 people. The main criticism they had was that despite the fact they are retired, and the fact that more and more people are being asked to retire at an earlier age, they believe they have much more to give to the economy and they are not being given the opportunity to take an active role in it.</P>
    <P>We will find on looking back that that generation of people is the one which made the economy what it is today. The Government has a responsibility to acknowledge that there is a depth of experience in that group and to find a <Col N="561" /> way through the fund to bring them into the main workforce so as to ensure their experience is put to work. If that means using part of the fund to educate these people in information and communications technology, or any other course available, that should be done. They should not be disregarded because they are a very important part of the economy. They are settled and reliable and I am sure that, given the experience they have acquired over the years, they would put it to work if given the opportunity. I encourage the Minister to actively examine this. Most people at the meeting in Kilkenny were interested in playing, perhaps a lighter role, but certainly an active role in the economy, and we should be encouraging them in the way I have outlined.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat concerned by the number of women employed in the economy. This is a resource we should be using as many women, while they might be staying at home, have actually availed of various technology and other courses. They are skilled and prepared to return to the workforce. Due to the demand by many employers who cannot get people to work there is now an opportunity for women in the home. More and more employers are advertising jobs with flexible hours. This resource is largely untapped and we must give these people an opportunity to return to the workforce. The Government has invested in the courses and we need to move those who have qualified into employment, and we should ensure this happens through the fund.</P>
    <P>Crafts and skills were mentioned. I come from a county which is synonymous worldwide with craft and design. The Kilkenny Design Centre has been the centre of design for a long number of years. Part of the objective of the fund could be to keep the old crafts and skills alive through funding them as they will deliver jobs in the long term. Kilkenny, for all crafts, has accessed the new e-commerce section of the economy through the Internet and is selling product on that basis. This proves that investment in this area, whether in training people in skills or giving them money to qualify in various courses, keeps alive something which is perhaps threatened by technology. Carlow has identified various crafts associated with the river and is now working on this as part of its county development plan. It is trying to set aside funds to keep these crafts alive in the area.</P>
    <P>Dúchas has a role to play in this regard and we should look for its co-operation in terms of the fund. Dúchas has stone masons, carpenters, etc., and the Government, perhaps through the Bill, should encourage Dúchas to take on more young people to educate them in the craft of restoration. Encouraging craft and design and building restoration serves the tourism industry and a huge amount can be achieved in this regard. We should teach young people a craft or skill which is threatened as people are not becoming involved in them because there are more jobs with better pay elsewhere, particularly in the technology sector. <Col N="562" /> Many young people would like to be involved in restoration work.</P>
    <P>As in every other sector, Dúchas cannot get employees and is finding the numbers are not coming forward for its requirement for teaching skills and crafts. I encourage Dúchas, in partnership with the Department and through this fund, to devise a method whereby they can begin to bring people on board, teach them skills, strengthen that section of the economy, restore more buildings and, thereby, serve the tourism industry to the fullest extent.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the new and rapidly developing economy created by the Internet and technology. This is a huge sector, largely untapped, running right across the economy, whether in services industry or transport, manufacturing, crafts or mainstream information and communications technology. The new economy will offer more jobs and more opportunities in the world market. The smallest company, such as the bodhrán maker we see advertised on television, can access that market and deliver new jobs in the new economy. We need to up-skill the operators in that field. If we do that a dynamic economy will be created and a large number of jobs will result from accessing a world market in a very simple fashion. Lastly, we need management courses and courses to deal with stress. All this development in the economy brings its own stresses and pressures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. It is imaginative and if it delivers on what I have read in the Minister's speech we will have done a good day's work. I wish to refer to the old AnCO service. I suppose it is dating oneself to say I remember when the centre was developed in Galway. It was a truly remarkable occasion. I recall the late 1960s and early 1970s when the one brick wall was knocked 20 times in a week and rebuilt. The outcome of that could be seen in the workforce in Merview, County Galway, in the 1980s and 1990s by the skills they acquired in steel fabrication, carpentry and so on under the flagship of the then training agency, AnCO. That pattern of training can be set as an example of what we hope will happen for the men and women who will have to be trained for the next 20 or 25 years. I do not know whether all that can be done under the provisions of this Bill but I genuinely believe it will make an honest effort. Everybody has a number of issues to bring to this debate but I wish to refer to four or five.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of all the ingredients that make up the workplace, training is the most important. At the end of the day if we do not have people with the required skills, whether on the modern factory floor or elsewhere, we are lost. Unless the new <Col N="563" /> cohort of people are highly skilled, whether in the area of computers, building, banking, etc., they will not stay the pace and the whole system will fall asunder.  In the euphoria of the Celtic tiger we should look at two areas. It is true to say, as the Minister and every commentator point out, that we have never had anything like the present rate of job creation. It is wonderful to live at this time. Those of us who came through the 1980s and 1990s will recall those dark days.</P>
    <P>There has been no appreciable change in the number of job losses from the 1980s and the 1990s but what is remarkable about the economy is that job losses are replaced almost overnight. In some cases one is replaced by two. However, in the event of a major slowdown a number of jobs are at risk. People forget that there are redundancies, that firms close down and that were it not for this wonderful environment there would be huge problems all the time. We have to look at that area as well as early warning systems. If this National Training Fund Bill means anything, I sincerely hope it can intervene in areas where it should be possible to salvage jobs through retraining, redirection and so on.</P>
    <P>Between 27,000 and 30,000 enter the Irish workforce each year. That number is likely to drop to 12,000 in seven years' time. If the economy continues to develop and if after five, six or seven years only 10,000 or 12,000 enter the workforce, there will be major problems. Given that the Minister has referred to some of those figures, I assume in global terms that what I say is correct.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the 4%, or 146,000, who are unemployed. I have no doubt there is great scope within that cohort for retraining and returning to the labour force. How it is to be done is another story but I shall return to that later. There is a huge amount of American investment in Ireland, which we all welcome. I understand that 27% of all US green field investment in Europe comes to Ireland but how long will it last? It will probably last as long as the US companies believe this is the right place to be and as soon as the position changes they will move elsewhere. I assume the national training concept on which we are now embarking will take note of the requirements of that particular market.</P>
    <P>The manufacturing and service sectors are the miracle of the Irish economy in the past ten years. It is all about productivity and competitiveness. We have to watch wages and inflation. We are in the middle of an oil crisis and we hope great things will be announced in tomorrow's budget. The whole area of interest rate hikes and currency changes have a huge part to play in how we manage to keep our people at work.</P>
    <P>On the question of the 4% who are officially unemployed, I note there are 52,000 on short-term unemployment and 28,000 on long-term unemployment. I note in a labour force survey that the Minister said 60,000 extra were marginally attached. That is a lovely phrase. I am not 100% sure what it means and I do not know if the <Col N="564" /> Minister knows what it means. How could one be marginally attached? One is either in or out. I assume what she is getting at is that it may be possible under certain circumstances for many of those people who are ripe for retraining to be reorganised. It is all attitudinal. It is a huge step forward for many who come from homes where their parents were unemployed and have seen nothing else for a couple of generations. If this training fund is to mean anything, a huge amount of time and effort will have to be put in. Progress will be slow. There are thousands of potential workers for the labour force if only we could open that particular lock.</P>
    <P>This brings me to another important matter in the area I represent in East Galway. There is a raging row in my part of the world about the new rules concerning the social employment schemes. I have a bee in my bonnet about this and, irrespective of which Minister is involved in this area, I will fight it because a huge injustice is being done. The purists say there is no such thing as continuous training.</P>
    <P>Several speakers referred to the general development and street structure of our villages and towns and I am sure many others will also refer to that. Who changed the face of rural Ireland? It was not the county councils, as they did not have a penny to carry out any work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Caltra looks very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>We know who changed Caltra. The face of rural Ireland was changed by the participants on FÁS schemes. A number of those workers did not know the skills they possessed. When they were trained in so-called semi skilled, manual jobs, they were able to lay footpaths, car parks and flowerbeds and do other work. Such work is not half finished in rural Ireland. The local authorities have withdrawn from that work and they will not return to it, but that is the way of life.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment put forward a daft proposal on 1 April. She said that irrespective of the age or knowledge of SES participants, they will be able to continue for three more years on an SES but then they will have to paddle their own canoes. There is a cohort of workers approaching 50 years of age participating on such schemes and most of them are good at what they do but there is little else they can do and they know there is a great deal more work for them to do. It would be different if there was not enough work for them to do. That breed will live on and in seven, eight or ten years' time, they will retire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The laws and regulations governing the SES should be changed. A group of 300 people who packed a room in a building in Tuam a fortnight ago, put forward the most sensible arrangement regarding that scheme, which I will put to the Minister of State. Under that scheme, people up to the age of 50 should be able to work for three years and withdraw from the scheme for one year <Col N="565" /> and after that they should be allowed to work every year until they retire.</P>
    <P>When I was chairman of Mount Bellew town development, we had all sorts of plans, but that is all we had. When we walked out of halls following meetings 20 years ago, we had no way of executing such plans, but we have now. Work to be done under such plans can be passed to the participants of SESs who do a brilliant job. Given that it takes 12 to 15 participants to run a scheme and it might be possible only to assemble enough people to run a scheme in every four or five parishes, village renewal and rural development will be killed by the daft idea that the cohort of workers approaching 50 years of age participating on such schemes could and should do something else. I wish they were able to do that, as do they, but they are not. They consider they have done a magnificent job to have come as far as they have, given that seven or eight years ago they were drawing the dole for which we got no return.</P>
    <P>That proposed small change to the SESs makes eminent sense. In terms of that cohort of workers who will be working in five, six to eight years' time, that arrangement will phase out and there will not be a need to introduce rules as those workers would be nearing retirement. Given all the training being provided, those who are 40 and 45 years of age and in receipt of social welfare will be retrained for the so-called better job.</P>
    <P>On behalf of every community development association, town development association and everyone who did good work in rural Ireland, that cohort of workers who have nowhere else to go have done a wonderful job in making rural Ireland more attractive. The Minister of State should make the change I proposed. Unless I have misread him, I believe he does not consider there is anything wrong in what I said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Connaughton for sharing his time with me, given it is evident he is very convinced about what he talked about. I support what he said, particularly concerning participants in FÁS schemes. Those workers have been very important in carrying out improvements to villages in my area, including Rockcorry, Smithborough and Three Mile House. Those workers got certificates and cheques for their good work through the tidy town groups. Without them that work would not have been carried out. Newbliss is another example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will highlight one example of their work, that done at the Kavanagh Centre, Inniskeen. I am sure Dr. O'Hanlon would support me on this issue. That premises was developed with the support of FÁS, cross-Border funding, IFI, etc., but without the contribution of the participants on <Col N="566" /> FÁS schemes and other workers, that premises might be closed down. We need to examine how such schemes can be restructured. Recently one of the head people in personnel in that premises told a group of us that the personnel there had discovered that in their parish 15 to 20 people in the 50 to 55 age bracket who are in receipt of social welfare could be utilised in that premises and they would be glad to help out, if allowed to do so under the scheme. I urge the Minister of State to ensure the necessary changes are made to ensure those who have or who can gain skills can contribute to the community rather than continue in receipt of social welfare and feel less beneficial than if allowed under the scheme to help out in their own community.</P>
    <P>I refer to the beef and pork industries. The contracts of employment in those industries introduced by individuals in recent years have decimated the availability of young trained boners and trained workers to do quality work. I remember my involvement in Cork Mart, IMP, where everything was literally done to the beast, including the removal of what would be considered nearly waste material now. That was put into cans, cooked and so on. That sort of product is now imported from other countries. We have lost many of those skills because of the system. I urge the Minister the State to ensure funds are made available, if necessary, to set up a structure for those industries where proper training can be given in an area such as Monaghan where the food industry is very important. I am aware that FÁS has tried to provide such training through the industries, but unfortunately when young people get trained to a certain level, rather than completing their training, they are taken on and paid full wages as there is such a demand for them. A proper structure to provide such training is required. People are willing to undertake such training in my immediate area where the food industry is of such importance.</P>
    <P>The second largest industry in the area I represent is the furniture industry, which is facing a major problem in recruiting properly trained craft workers. There is an idea that we can move to using machinery in that industry, but if we do, we would produce a lower quality product for a low product market in which we would have to compete with many other countries, which would not be in our best interests. People from my area have to travel to Limerick, Connemara or some other area to get training. There is an urgency to ensure proper training is available for those who wish to take it up in the areas where furniture is produced such as Monaghan, Louth and Meath, but mainly Monaghan. There is an urgent need to look at how these people can be facilitated in local vocational education committees. It should be done close to home as we would then have a much higher level of participation.</P>
    <P>There are enormous opportunities now in the building sector. Times were never as good in this area but there is a danger that we will not have properly trained personnel and if that occurs we <Col N="567" /> may have problems with health and safety. That in turn causes accidents, which then raises insurance costs. It is a vicious circle and we must re-examine the training of building workers. Much as we would like the building boom to last forever, it will not and those who are properly trained will have better opportunities in difficult times.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Browne.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to establish the national training fund to raise the skills of those in employment and to provide training for those who wish to acquire skills for employment. I welcome this excellent Bill, particularly as it provides for the training of more workers. We need more people in all our industries. We need more carpenters, bricklayers and plumbers; we need more skilled people as we do not have enough of them at present.</P>
      <P>I welcome the training offered by FÁS all over the country, particularly in Sligo, where many courses from carpentry to computer skills are offered. Like other speakers, I welcome FÁS's great work, particularly in our villages. Many of those villages were derelict ten to 15 years ago but they are now bright and shiny, with nice stone walls and footpaths. Much of this work should have been done by the county councils but they did not have the funding, so FÁS did it. I welcome that work.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the work done by FÁS in old graveyards, many of which would have been almost derelict were it not for the work of local people through FÁS schemes. This might also have been the job of the county councils but again they did not have the funding and FÁS did the work, which I welcome, for people who have gone before us. These near derelict graveyards have now received a new lease of life. There is now even a scheme for cleaning headstones and those coming back from America, Australia and Britain can trace their families through three or four generations as a result.</P>
      <P>Many young people are interested in stone masonry and the nearest such course to me is in Gweedore, County Donegal. There is an excellent 12 month masonry course there and when people complete it they can get employment building stone walls. It is a great skill to have and one Irish people have had for generations. One need only look at the stone bridges around the country; they were built by Irish people and thankfully those skills have not gone. There are also other skills being taught by FÁS, such as building horse traps and baskets, and often the organisation employs people who are almost at the end of their working lives to train young people in these skills. That is a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At one stage I was employed by the VEC to train young Travellers in Sligo. They had excellent skills in tinsmithing, such as the saucepans, <Col N="568" /> ponnies and tin cans that old Travelling people used to make at the side of the road. Those young people brought that skill back and it was excellent to see. They taught me a thing or two.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that provision has been made to train young people in carpentry and bricklaying but I have raised the issue of safety on building sites with the Minister of State before and though some work has been done in this area, more remains to be done. There have been too many fatalities as a result of people falling from poor scaffolding. We have cowboy builders who do not care about providing scaffolding so long as they are making money. They sometimes use a ladder rather than scaffolding and one sees builders running up and down to put slates on a roof. If one is building a house, an apartment block or a factory one should have proper scaffolding. There should be somebody to supervise that scaffolding because nobody wants to see people on building sites being hurt or killed. The Minister of State is doing an excellent job in this regard but more work must be done to protect those who are roofing houses and shuttering apartment blocks. We need more safety on our building sites.</P>

        <i>(Wexford)</i>
        <b>:</b> I welcome the Bill which is worthwhile and long overdue, but it also gives us the opportunity to debate some of the issues regarding training. When one goes into any hotel in the country one finds some company or other has a training course going on there. That is a major change from the past when very few companies could offer training. Much of the training is done by large, multinational companies as they can afford it; as the Tánaiste said, they allocate a significant amount of funding to training and retraining. However, we must also look at smaller companies which do not have enough funding to match the changes in technology. A lot of business is done by e-mail, fax and telephone and it is important the Tánaiste works with the small business associations to ensure small companies are not left behind in the area of training and retraining. They have to be able to meet the changes in technology, which are occurring on a daily basis. In many cases, computers bought six months ago are now obsolete and it is very costly for some of the smaller companies to compete.</P>
      <P>In relation to the community employment scheme, which was mentioned earlier, the decision to ask people to leave the scheme after three years is crazy, particularly in the case of older people. Many people in their mid-50s or early 60s who come to my clinics are fit, skilled and able to participate in an employment scheme but they have no hope of being taken on by an employer. When the three years are up they are told to go back and draw the dole. That is not good enough. I do not necessarily blame the Minister, Deputy Harney, for that because I am baffled as to how 14 Ministers can sit around the Cabinet table and agree to a reduction in the community schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="569" /> In every county, and the Ministers will be aware of this, there is a significant number of people who are only suitable for social employment or community employment schemes. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, to bring his influence to bear on the Ministers to make changes in that regard because it is better for people to work in local communities on community employment schemes than to twiddle their thumbs on the fair greens or walk around the town with nothing to do. We can all give examples of that. My local GAA club had a very good person for three years who kept the fields cut and made sure that the gates and the fencing were maintained. He was 57 years of age when his three years were up and he was told he had to go. The club then had to try to employ someone at a far higher rate but, more importantly, that person is now unemployed.</P>
    <P>I have a vested interest in the disabled because I have a daughter who is confined to a wheelchair. The Minister made a statement in the Dáil recently about changes in the personal assistants service but the wider issue of the disabled needs to be examined. The Minister of State's brother, Deputy Michael Kitt, said earlier that he did not see any reference to the disabled in the Bill. As it passes through the Oireachtas I hope a section will be inserted to allocate funding for training and retraining of disabled people specifically because many disabled people are highly intelligent and particularly talented in the area of modern technology. Many of them would have used computers in school more often than other people, yet employers, despite the scarcity of workers, do not seem to want to employ them.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there is a genuine fear among employers that these people will be out on sick leave too often or whatever but that is not the case. The Government should undertake a public relations exercise with employers to inform them that there are many intelligent disabled people who could fill some of the existing job vacancies if they were given the opportunity. I know the Minister of State took a direct interest in the personal assistants service and I ask him to take a direct interest in training also.</P>
    <P>In relation to the shortage of skills in the building trade, it is frightening to hear county managers say at county council meetings that there is a difficulty in getting contractors to build council houses to meet the housing demand. They are now talking about a scarcity of contractors to meet the National Development Plan 2000-2006, as laid down by the Government. There is a need to re-examine the skills and perhaps the time has come to consider establishing a multi-skills and craft school in every county. Schools throughout the country are closed from 4 p.m. so we have the facilities available. There is a need to examine how we can involve FÁS, Teagasc, the vocational education committees and the building industry in making night classes available for partially skilled or unskilled young people for training in bricklaying, carpentry and other areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="570" /> We have the agencies and the building industry which is crying out for workers so there should be a meeting of minds on this issue. Facilities could be provided in the evening in vacant vocational education committees and secondary schools. That should be examined because we will have serious problems during the coming five or six years in meeting the targets of the building industry due to the scarcity of contractors and skilled workers.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas committee on agriculture has been debating whether some of the Teagasc training centres should be closed down or left open. There is a need to examine agriculture and retraining for the future because many farmers are in difficulties. They are finding it difficult to survive without an off-farm income. Someone made the point recently at a committee meeting that many young and not so young farmers have basic skills. They are able to weld, do a bit of engineering and a little carpentry, skills they acquired during their time in farming, and it would require little effort to train them fully in these skills. They could then get a job to supplement their farm income thereby enabling them to make a decent living. That is an issue Teagasc should examine. People do not have to go out to Multyfarnham or Athenry to do that because there are Teagasc centres in every county where these people could be retrained for a new way of life off the farm. It is an issue that needs serious examination.</P>
    <P>I sometimes wonder about the number of agencies in operation. We have county councils, urban district councils, Leader, county enterprise boards, town and rural area partnerships, FÁS, VTOS and Youthreach. At times there is a lot of confusion among people about where to go and they often get the run around. Whatever about maintaining all these agencies, we certainly should be able to have a one stop shop instead of having them scattered throughout a particular county. There is a need to bring them under one umbrella so that people could go to a one stop shop in these areas and try to secure employment or training. That is an area the Minister should examine.</P>
    <P>One of the major problems in relation to the numbers of unemployed, and I am talking about the experience in my county, is that those people, particularly in the younger age group, left school early. We know that early school leavers find it very difficult to get a job, both in the short and the long-term. They also have many other social problems if they leave school early. Since I first came into this House, there has been a significant number of reports on the problem of early school leavers and how to deal with the problem, yet no Minister for Education has been able to come up with a formula. I have a document prepared by the Wexford area partnership responding to early school leaving in the Wexford area and some of the figures are frightening in regard to the number of people who leave school early in Wexford. That is one of the reasons we have such a high <Col N="571" /> unemployment rate in Wexford. There should be some system in the Department to deal with this problem. Despite the fact that numerous reports have been produced, no one seems to be able to come up with a system to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, together with the Minister for Education and Science, to look favourably at counties such as Wexford which have produced documents and could, with limited funding, initiate pilot schemes to encourage students to stay in school longer so that they can secure jobs. Programmes such as the VTOs are aimed at giving people a second chance at education, while Youthreach operates programmes for early school leavers between the ages of 15 and 18 years. These scheme have been successful in the past and I hope they can be extended so that more young people can be retrained, giving them a better opportunity to re-enter the work environment. The people who operate the Youthreach programme in County Wexford have said there is an 80% placement rate under VTOs. Such programmes should be extended.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope it will be implemented as quickly as possible. I ask the Minister of State to bring to the attention of the Minister the need for a specific section on training, retraining and opportunities for the disabled.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill which will provide funding to bring people who are marginally excluded into the work force. While it is a boom time for people who are on the roller coaster, it is a dull and difficult time for those people on the sideline. Work gives people the opportunity to meet other people, make friends and go on social outings. However, a person who is unemployed is isolated and spends most of his time in his flat or apartment, while some unemployed people may have to look after their elderly parents and do not have an opportunity to make friends. We know the number of people on the live register, but there are other people who are unable to work because of family commitments. These are the people towards whom the fund should be directed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>FÁS training schemes are parish-based and provide excellent training for young people. The young people on these schemes are involved in tidying public parks, repairing old buildings, etc. The courses provided by FÁS are also excellent, but there are only a limited number of places available on them. This is a rerun of our earlier debate today. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, does not forget that we gave him a free hand to implement his proposal without a vote. I have time for the Minister, but his time on the Government benches is running out. We will <Col N="572" /> take over where he left off and I know he will wish us well in that.</P>
    <P>I know dozens of young people who have availed of FÁS courses but they are principally based in large towns and cities and it can be costly for young people from rural areas to take up a place on them. Grants could be provided under this fund to enable young people from rural areas to take up places on FÁS courses in, say, Dublin. It should be possible to pay for their accommodation and give them some pocket money. These courses normally run for 12 months and they yield results.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to get a plumber, carpenter, bricklayer or plasterer nowadays and there is a need for more places on courses in the trades area.  These are simple enough skills which can be learned by both boys and girls. These trades are no longer the preserve of men. I have seen excellent carpentry work done by young girls who may have a more delicate touch than young men. However, everything we say will be a waste of time unless teachers are properly paid and the funding is in place. I know the Minister will bear this point in mind.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Browne on the need for a section to deal with disabled people. I read a shocking report in one of today's newspapers. This report entitled &ldquo;Miserable Plight of Disabled in Rural Areas&rdquo;, states:</P>
    <P>The vast majority of people with disability in rural Ireland are without employment or suitable accommodation despite the fact that most want to lead an independent existence, a groundbreaking survey has found. The report &ldquo;Visualising Inclusion&rdquo; found that one third of people with disabilities are without secondary education, 80% with disability are available for work, yet only 23% are employed. Low pay, lack of qualifications and the attitude of employers are cited as a barrier to employment.</P>
    <P>This is unfair and discriminatory and it is time we got over that hurdle. These people are entitled to equal opportunities. I agree with Deputy Browne that they are willing to work and want to prove themselves in the workforce. They will be at work every day come hail, rain or sunshine. That is their attitude to life and all they need is a little encouragement, training and extra time. This is the least we can do at a time when our economy is booming. We are not looking after these people. I ask the Minister to include a section to deal with disabled people. It is a marvellous time for people on the roller coaster but there is a major difficulty for people who are trying to enter the workforce.</P>
    <P>The day when people had a job for life is gone. There are wonderful opportunities available and young people change jobs. However, training must be provided for them. If there are better opportunities elsewhere multinational companies will move on and we will have to provide alternative employment for a large workforce. We must put in place a <Col N="573" /> system which will provide retraining for the people so that they can take up other employment. One of the reasons our economy is booming is that people had the necessary qualifications. We should keep in the back of our mind the possibility of hiccups and ensure we are ready to deal with any problems which arise so that young people will not be left idle and have to once again take to the emigration boats.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which updates the present position by making training a priority. According to statistics, most of the start-ups and projects funded by the IDA 30 years ago are gone. As a result many of the people employed in these areas have been left high and dry. Deputy Naughten and I are familiar with the harsh reality of closures in the textile industry in our area. Many employees approached me and other politicians to ask what they could do because they had been working in the industry for the previous ten, 15 or 20 years. They had been subjected to terrible trauma but were prepared to take up FÁS training courses. Luckily the expansion of the economy has created more employment opportunities but, unfortunately, training was not built into the system. Approximately 50% of employers do not provide training courses.</P>
      <P>IDA grants were available for such courses in the past but not enough emphasis was placed on training employees. Training should be provided as part of an individual's employment because the economy is changing rapidly. Technology, new products and market demand are changing and it is important that training is provided. The EU provided much of the funding for training in the past but that will be reduced. The Government has anticipated this and is to establish a fund to complement the funding from the EU Social Fund. That is welcome.</P>
      <P>Apprenticeships have come to the fore. I was in Athlone recently at a ceremony to mark the graduation of a number of apprentices. It was a great occasion for them and their families because most of them had jobs. Jobs are now available for trained apprentices. FÁS has embarked on recruiting campaigns abroad to entice people to come to Ireland to work but there are people here who could take up the same jobs if they were trained. We have not faced up to that. If an individual loses his job after 20 years he is not retrained. He is frustrated at losing his job but if he had been given the option of training, the company might not have folded and it could have branched out into other areas of production.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill but I refer to a problem in the apprenticeship training programme. When an apprentice undertakes the study module of his training he is given an allowance of £27 and at that stage some apprentices opt out because they spent the previous year gaining practical experience, being paid £100 a week. The Minister should concentrate on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I have not read up on the legislation but having perused the explanatory memorandum one question keeps popping into my head, and I hope the Minister of State will answer it when he closes the debate. The establishment of FÁS a number of years ago was a good idea. There was massive unemployment and people were removed from the live register to take up training courses. There is little unemployment today and we are faced with a labour shortage.</P>
      <P>How many administrators are in FÁS? When the NTF is set up I assume FÁS administrators will be involved because the training issue is extremely important. When this legislation is enacted, I hope it does not emulate the health board legislation whereby a significant percentage of the money allocated to the fund will be eaten up by administration costs and will not be spent on the front line where it is needed.</P>
      <P>Most of those working for FÁS do a good job but the difficulties they were employed to address do not exist anymore. How many people will be employed in the administration of the fund? How much will that cost? I would hate a scenario where 60% of the funding provided would be eaten up by administrations, with 40% spent on the front line. This is a hobby horse of mine and it must be considered by the Government and all parties in the House.</P>
      <P>Those who participate in FÁS courses and community employment schemes do excellent work in rural and urban communities. However, a number of my friends are employees in the services industry, which has been the primary creator of employment in Ireland over the past ten years. There is no grant for employing people. A friend of mine in a small town in Leitrim employs 90 people in three retail outlets. He installed a computer system, which cost £90,000, but only received £1,000 for training his staff. He is a large employer who has made a huge commitment, but under the legislation employers must pay a national training levy of 0.7% which will be offset by a cut in employers' PRSI. They are making a payment and not getting a service in return. If the Minister or I, as employers, want to train our employees, we must pay for it. If I install a state-of-the-art computer system in my company I must pay for the training of my employees, which is hugely expensive. I do not understand how the legislation addresses that anomaly but, as I have not read it fully, I hope the Minister will say that I am wrong. I have no difficulty with that but I do not understand how that problem will be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are people on lists in all FÁS offices who are available for employment but the majority do not want to work because they work part time in the agriculture industry or they have been unemployed for a long time. A difficulty exists in that regard. An employer may not want to employ a person because he or she knows that person is not what is needed, even if that person has been <Col N="575" /> on training courses. I hope the Bill and the national training fund will help alleviate that.</P>
    <P>If people who apply for training schemes do not want to be employed, there is no point in accepting them for the scheme. We must try to alleviate that problem, but that is where the community employment scheme comes into effect. People might be happy to work three days a week on a community employment scheme in graveyards, public parks or whatever doing wonderful work for the community and spend another two or three days on the farm, for instance. There are proposals to change all that, not in this Bill but through the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and that would be a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>We must focus on internal training in companies already established, and I assume that is the focus of the Bill. This is hugely important. We must focus too on the service industries where many people are employed and the cost of training them on new computers or whatever is prohibitive. Most employers looking at the bottom line will see they can afford to install a new, state of the art computer system but will query whether they can afford the necessary training for employees to work on it.</P>
    <P>The national training fund could play a very positive role where, if an employer installs a state of the art computer system, he or she could be guaranteed a certain percentage to train his or her employees. Everyone would be better off. The employer and employees would be better off and so would the consumer, who is king, because he or she would be served by people who would know what they were doing. How many times, has anyone gone into a retail outlet to have to wait ten or 15 minutes to be dealt with. Why are the people serving them not trained? It is because the employer cannot afford it. I have been in the position where I have been behind a computer serving people and I would have been better off if I had been supplied with a hammer because I did not know what was going on. It is towards alleviating that type of problem that the national training fund should work.</P>
    <P>The manufacturing sector is slightly different. The IDA has been pro-active in this area for a long time, as have Forfás and Enterprise Ireland. They provide funding for training which is very necessary in manufacturing. We have been slow to do that on the service side and, if the Bill deals with that issue, it will have done a wonderful day's work.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister is involved in the employment sector, my other gripe is that the PRSI paid by employers is still too high. There should not be a cost to employ a person. There should be an incentive to employ them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill. Does the fund represent extra funding or is it a new type of funding? Existing funding is derived from levies, the Exchequer and European funding. Deputy Michael Kitt asked if we will see cutbacks in <Col N="576" /> European funding. The answer is certainly &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and it is happening already. I speak from experience. In a previous incarnation I was a FÁS instructor and I used to teach languages. The experience in FÁS, which is a fantastic organisation, is that there have been cutbacks. Deputy Reynolds spoke about the amount of expenditure on administration. Administrative costs have been severely cut back with the result that some of the training centres are almost ghost towns where previously they were bustling.</P>
      <P>It is very important, not just if the economy is to remain competitive but if society is to function properly, that the idea of apprenticeships continues. We require plasterers, plumbers and electricians and the boom exposes these labour shortages. We only have to look at our own back door. If the lift breaks down in Leinster House 2000, how long will it take to find someone to fix it? If the heating does not work properly, again difficulties arise. That is a microcosm of problems which exist elsewhere. We have had to wait many months even to construct a cycleway. While nice work is taking place in my constituency along the Dodder, it is taking five months to complete because the skilled artisans cannot be found to do the work. These problems need to be addressed.</P>
      <P>We have had an attitude problem for many years towards apprenticeships. I remember when I went to school, if a person was not doing well, he or she was told to go to the &ldquo;tech.&rdquo;. Such an attitude does not exist elsewhere. It certainly does not exist in Germany, where I lived for some time, where to have one's <i>Beruf</i> was a matter of pride. We must instil that level of pride in what Germans call the professions and we call apprenticeships.</P>
      <P>I will focus on the cutbacks in EU funding which have resulted in cutbacks in language training in some FÁS training centres. Language training is vital. The Minister referred to us being more like Boston than Berlin and that we have an American-type economy. However, we must realise that we are now becoming part of a federal Europe. Many of us might object to that evolution but we see one more step towards it with the Nice Treaty. There is no question that there is capital mobility within the federal Europe, and we will require increasing labour mobility. When the boom ends, which it must do at some stage, people may have to go abroad. That is why it is vital language training continues in FÁS centres.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about one aspect. I know from experience that FÁS has done deals with some of the major multinationals regarding training. One example is Hewlett Packard. It was a good idea in that people were specifically trained and got jobs with Hewlett Packard. It was a good deal for the company and FÁS could derive some satisfaction from it. I would like to see the employer footing the entire bill. Multinationals receive too many subsidies in any event and Hewlett Packard and other similar companies should foot the entire bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a reference to the contradiction of <Col N="577" /> the Minister going abroad trying to recruit while there is the so-called problem of economic refugees. Clearly there are people in the country who will do the jobs if they have the training. It is a feature within some FÁS training centres that a good number of the people there come from other countries. We must encourage as many people as possible within the country, by giving them the green card, if necessary. We should examine what we have already rather than going off to Durban, Beijing or wherever.</P>
    <P>I have a number of specific points which the Minister of State could perhaps address when he replies. What will be fundable through this new mechanism? Is it only to fund expenditure within the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment or can it also fund training within other Departments, for example, fishery training, hotel training, training under the Department of Education and Science or training within the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development in organic farming, for example?</P>
    <P>It appears the Bill will result in the abolition of industrial training committees established under the Industrial Training Act, 1967. These mechanisms have represented involvement of the social partners in helping to identify sectoral needs. It is important to keep this involvement of the social partners. What substitute, if any, is planned for the industrial training committees?</P>
    <P>I hope the fund will be used to address existing deficiencies in training. A recent international adult literacy survey found that Ireland's literacy scores were poor, with 25% scoring at the lowest level. The proportion of employed people who undertook education or training in the year was only 30%. We are a long way from lifelong learning goals. Only half the adult population from 25 to 64 have achieved leaving certificate standard or better. As a result, very often, training authorities such as FÁS are seen as the last resort. Difficulties are experienced by some instructors who have to deal with people who are problematic in some respects. They are pushed into FÁS but that should not be the case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Several Deputies referred to the issue of train<Col N="578" /> ing for people with disabilities. In addition to support from the fund for people with disabilities on mainstream FÁS courses, a further £30 million is being provided in 2001 for Exchequer funds for training and employment in this area.</P>
    <P>It is a reflection of the importance which is attached to training that the introduction of this Bill has stimulated such an interesting debate. It is also gratifying to note that Members on all sides of the House have welcomed the new focus on training which the Bill provides and the fact that it will be a ring-fenced fund which is removed from the vicissitudes of public spending.</P>
    <P>There will be an increase in funding for certain key schemes, such as apprenticeships, which was referred to by Deputies Rabbitte and Michael Kitt. Deputy Naughten spoke extensively about lifelong learning issues. He referred especially to the need to pursue policies which take account of the need of the individual and to balance these with the needs of the enterprise. He also referred to the importance of literacy and the development of basic skills, as, indeed, did Deputy Gormley, as a foundation for employability and further learning. These issues are being addressed by the lifelong learning task force in the context of the White Paper on Adult Education. I was privileged to participate in the launch of a particular scheme this morning which demonstrates that much good work is taking place on this matter in the community. I accept, however, that current literacy and numeracy levels are totally unacceptable. We need to do much work in that area.</P>
    <P>FÁS is already working on this matter in collaboration with the National Adult Literacy Agency on the introduction of a pilot literacy module within community employment. It is hoped that growing employment and wage levels will result in increases in the fund in future years, especially for lifelong learning initiatives.</P>
    <P>The repeal of the provisions relating to the industrial training committees has given rise to significant comment. It should be stated that moving away from the statutory committees does not have negative implications in terms of the involvement of stakeholders in training. We are concerned to address in the Bill the rigidity of the statutory system imposed by the 1967 Act. When these provisions were introduced, FÁS, or AnCO at it was then known, was effectively the sole provider of vocational and employment training. Now, however, that situation is very different.</P>
    <P>The statutory ITC system is simply too rigid and narrowly focused to cater for this changed environment and the very different allocation of roles and responsibilities which now exists. Deputy Rabbitte noted that the performance of the committees is not uniform as sectors which were dominant in the 1960s are no longer dominant today. A statutory system of committees can fossilise training policy and constrain it from responding to the emergence of new sectoral needs and inter-firm initiatives.</P>
    <P>In that regard, it must be said that both <Col N="579" /> Enterprise Ireland and FÁS continue to have the legal power to appoint advisory committees as required, while both the board of Skillnets and the expert group on future skills needs are representative of enterprise and training interests.</P>
    <P>At the broader level, concerns have been raised about the absence of an overall structure which would allow the stakeholders to input to the decision-making process on the allocation of NTF funds. This issue was raised particularly by Deputy Rabbitte. I appreciate these concerns and specific proposals are being developed to provide an overall advisory committee in this context.</P>
    <P>I stress the importance of human resource development to Ireland's future prosperity and the welfare and living standards of our people. The development of a skilled and adaptable workforce is a winning proposition for employers and individuals alike. The national training fund creates a new, more explicit focus on human resource development and provides a ring-fenced source of funding to ensure success.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to establish a non-statutory advisory committee whose role will be to ensure we have a co-ordinated overall strategy for employment related training. It will inform the Minister of emerging developments concerning employment related training to ensure that our provision is in line with best international practice. It is envisaged that, as part of its remit, the committee could make proposals to my Department in relation to areas to be funded from the national training fund or offer advice on the direction of existing schemes under the fund. It is intended that the committee should have the strongest possible expertise drawn from the stakeholders in training, enterprise and human resource development.</P>
    <P>I thank Members for their contributions. I have not managed to cover some issues in my reply because I was anxious to allow every Deputy to contribute, particularly Deputy Gormley who asked to share my time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i> (Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>
        <b>:</b> Having met the workers concerned, I am aware that, apart from Deputy McGuinness and myself, you, a Cheann Comhairle, know exactly what is wrong in this case. The appointment of a liquidator coming up to Christmas has come as a shock to the 15 or 16 workers who are permanently employed in Independent Analytical Systems, a company which appeared to be doing well. If part-time workers are included, the workforce total which is affected is 21.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bagenalstown is a lovely town for visitors who pass through by barge on the River Barrow, but it could do with extra industry. It certainly is not acceptable that any group of workers is released from employment. I hope the Minister will explain what exactly is going on in that company. Conflicting stories emerged from a report in a newspaper last Sunday, and they are difficult to understand. The businessman concerned was so successful in his home base that he made a profit of £500,000 in 1999. Five weeks ago he bought this company in Bagenalstown but then called in a liquidator. I am totally baffled because people involved in business are generally hard-nosed individuals who weigh up everything and eventually come into an enterprise because they can see a future in it. I find it totally baffling that after five weeks a new owner can go into liquidation, even though his own home company, based in Portlaoise, made a profit of £500,000 in 1999. The Sugar Company, which has been taken over by Greencore and which accounts for 47% of the workload of the company, has caused a problem for it by reducing the price it is prepared to pay for sample tests from £41 to £30 approximately, which is a source of some surprise. Some of the workers are willing to take over the company provided that the Sugar Company, with which I hope <Col N="581" /> it will be possible to arrange a meeting, will account for 47% of its workload.</P>
    <P>The reason the Sugar Company is seeking a reduction is that Teagasc can undercut the company. I find it strange that Teagasc can undercut a private company causing redundancies. It should stick to what it is good at, advising farmers. If it wants to enter competition, there should be a level playing field. Teagasc and Independent Analytical Systems cannot compete on a level playing field.</P>
    <P>The workers who are willing to take over the company must know the facts. I am not certain that the article which appeared on Sunday clarified the matter. The workers are of the view that some of the information contained within it was incorrect. What exactly is going on in the Sugar Company? Could it have lost £600,000 over a ten year period and, if so, why? What can the workers take from this debate that will help them to make up their minds as to whether they should take over the company? They have the necessary expertise to keep it going. It is important, therefore, that they know exactly what is going on. The Minister of State has the background information.</P>
    <P>Should it happen that the workers cannot take over the company, the Minister of State should look on Bagenalstown as a place which needs new industry. From the point of view of the Government, the loss of 20 workers in Bagenalstown would not be a catastrophe in comparison to the loss of 150 elsewhere, but to Bagenalstown, which has few industries, it would be a major blow. It is relying more and more on the attraction of new industries. I, therefore, hope the Minister of State will give the workers some hope to move forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my constitutency colleague, Deputy Browne, in highlighting the difficulties being experienced in Muine Bheag, Bagenalstown, County Carlow. Bagenalstown is a small, rural town with a population of 3,500. Its traditional business structure has recently failed. Small traditional businesses have closed due to changing times in rural areas resulting in job losses. The local economy is threatened. The threatened closure of Independent Analytical Services with the loss of 17 full-time and four seasonal employees is a blow which is particularly hard to take at this time of year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also hard to take when one reviews the activity of the company. It has a satisfied and happy customer base. Greencore, located only ten miles from Muine Bheag, accounts for 47% of the business transacted. The quality EUF system has the capacity to deliver up to 500 samples per week on a ten day turnaround basis. The workforce is skilled and has proved that it can compete with the best. The shop steward, Ms Christine O'Neill, and chairman, Mr. John Barry, in conjunction with the trade union representa<Col N="582" /> tive, Mr. Denis Hyne, will confirm that the company has an excellent industrial relations record and a very good relationship with all of its customers.</P>
    <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment or Enterprise Ireland should contact Greencore, the Sugar Company to secure the jobs in question while solutions are sought &ndash; either a take over by companies in the United Kingdom or elsewhere waiting to enter the Irish market in this area or facilitating the employees of the company to take it over. Will the Department or Enterprise Ireland arrange such a meeting to facilitate such a debate which should involve public representatives and the employees of the company? Can the county enterprise board enter the negotiations to save the jobs in question?</P>
    <P>Can the exact position be determined? As Deputy Browne outlined, the employees of the company read about the trading details of the company in a Sunday newspaper. This is not a great way to receive a communication from either management or the liquidator. Perhaps a meeting with the liquidator, Mr. A. J. Fitzpatrick, would be appropriate to determine the facts of the case.</P>
    <P>Lest the company collapse, can FÁS and all other State agencies, including Enterprise Ireland, enter into immediate discussions with each and every employee to assess their skills and determine if they can be placed elsewhere in the local economy?</P>
    <P>Can Enterprise Ireland or another State agency be requested to acquire the building and locate within it a developing indigenous company? The town has been devastated by the loss of employment. It has no land zoned for development. There are only between seven and ten companies in the existing industrial estate. Can any State agency assist in the purchase of the building or, alternatively, assist the urban district council to purchase it or a landbank to facilitate the development of an industrial base in Muine Bheag which is affected by this sad news at this time of year?</P>
    <P>Does the IDA have a role to play? Can it focus its attention on Muine Bheag? There may be competitors outside the country willing to enter the Irish market and which would gladly work in partnership with the current set of employees because of the base they have established to develop the company and set it on the right road for the future. This can be achieved if an initial meeting with Greencore, the Sugar Company can be arranged which should involve public representatives and the trade unions to, at least, ensure the jobs in question are secure while negotiations and meetings take place.</P>
    <P>Due to the Government policy on rural development which involves the establishment of the roots of companies in rural Ireland and the relocation of certain companies from more popu<Col N="583" /> lated areas such as Dublin and the other main urban centres, areas such as Muine Bheag are being looked at. All the community needs is the support of the Government and State agencies to ensure there is a ray of hope and it is kept together in terms of employment. Great strides are being made locally. Great attempts have been made to keep the company open. The workers have been in negotiations and have the support of the local community and public representatives. An input by all the State agencies would be of assistance. Given its interest in the skilled workforce taking over the company, the county enterprise board may have a very significant role to play.</P>
    <P>Every action should be taken immediately. We should be proactive. While 21 jobs may be a small number, in a local community with a small population which has been affected by other closures, this is a serious blow, one which we cannot stand over. There is a need for immediate action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising these matters on the Adjournment. I understand Independent Analytical Services went into liquidation last Tuesday and that the total staff of 17 were issued with redundancy notices to take effect prior to Christmas. Deputy Browne said that this will have a major impact on a rural area such as this. In response to the suggestion made by Deputy McGuinness, FÁS has agreed that placement staff will meet with the company employees and conduct individual interviews with all the staff concerned. They will be offered the full range of FÁS services available.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland is working proactively to address the development needs of its client companies in the south-east region. To this end it has taken action across a range of initiatives. These include working directly with individual companies, working at a sectoral level with groups of companies and working proactively to encourage the development of new start up enterprises. This is evident from the performance of the south east region in 1999. In terms of job gains it was second to Dublin. Investment support approvals in the south east in Enterprise Ireland client companies in 1999 was £6,990,192, which was the third highest level of approvals in the country after Dublin and the north east. Enterprise Ireland in the south east is working with a portfolio of 346 companies employing a total of 16,000 people in a structured way to help them increase sales, exports and jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Enterprise Ireland international services programme is also being strongly promoted in the region to raise awareness in relation to this growing sector. Enterprise Ireland's south east regional office is in discussion with a number of <Col N="584" /> software and information and communications technology promoters. The south east region of Enterprise Ireland has as an objective to locate indigenous internationally traded services projects in the region. These include software developers, call centres and shared services centres.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland, which is the development agency with responsibility for attracting overseas industry to Ireland, has a significant presence in Carlow town with approximately 1,300 people employed in eight companies in the town. Chief among these are Braun Ireland Limited. I visited that plant recently with regard to a health and safety matter. It employs 885 people and Lapple Ireland Limited employs 289. The presence of these quality employers in the town has had a positive spin off for employment in the county overall.</P>
    <P>Future plans for Carlow, which includes Muine Bheag in its catchment area, include the development of a high quality business and technology park at a newly acquired 50 acre site in Carlow town. It is proposed also, early in the new year, to seek planning permission for the erection of 100,000 square foot of high-spec office accommodation targeted at the international services section, which will include software development, financial services and customer services operations. In addition, it is proposed to seek submissions from developers to erect and finance a 25,000 square foot advance factory at the existing IDA industrial estate.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Carlow County Enterprise Board, established in 1994, has been active in the micro enterprises sector. During the period 1994 to 1999, the board assisted in the creation of 597 full-time and 340 part-time jobs in Carlow.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="585" /> I am pleased that unemployment figures in County Carlow, generally, have been falling in recent times, with the total number of unemployed standing at 2,009 compared with 2,577 in 1999. The Government is committed to ensuring the most equitable regional distribution of job opportunities and has impressed on the industrial development agencies, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, the crucial importance of making greater efforts to provide employment throughout the country. I will pursue the suggestions made by Deputy McGuinness with regard to the agencies, particularly Enterprise Ireland. Moreover, the development agencies are structured on a regional basis to facilitate a balanced regional distribution of jobs, and resources are being deployed to reflect this focus. The agencies' focus on regionalisation ensures that an attractive financial package will be made available to any appropriate project which may choose to locate or expand in the region.</P>
    <P>The strategies of the Department for the continued promotion of enterprises focus on the promotion of Ireland as an attractive location for foreign direct investment and on the further development of the indigenous sector. Complementary measures in the national development plan will also help to underpin the regional strategies of the development agencies. The measures provided for in the plan will provide the infrastructure necessary for the attraction of overseas investment currently lacking outside the major urban areas.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the strenuous efforts being made by the industrial development agencies &ndash; Enterprise Ireland, IDA, FÁS and the Carlow County Enterprise Board &ndash; will continue to yield positive results for Bagenalstown and County Carlow. Any suggestions made by the Deputies with regard to the activities of particular agencies will be conveyed to those agencies.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this item for the Adjournment debate. It is vital that the national breast screening programme is extended nationwide. Irish women are more likely to die of breast cancer than many of their European counterparts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unacceptable that the programme is only reaching women in the North Eastern Health Board, Midland Health Board and the Eastern Regional Health Authority areas. It must be extended nationwide immediately. Will the Minister give the House an indication when the next phases of the programme will be implemented? A total of 1,670 women are newly diagnosed with <Col N="586" /> breast cancer annually and approximately 650 die from the disease each year. In Ireland, 43% of women who develop breast cancer die compared with an overall mortality rate of 37% for the European Union and 30% in some countries.</P>
    <P>Why are the figures so high in Ireland? What can we do to reduce these appalling statistics and how quickly can we do it? We must improve them dramatically. The Minister will agree that screening will play an important part in that. I am also calling for a nationwide information campaign. Some work has been done in this regard to ensure that the take up rate of the screening service is increased from the current low rate of 50% to 55% in the areas where the pilot programme is being run. Whatever the reasons for the low take up, whether it is poor information, poor access or fear, these issues must be addressed and women must be encouraged to take up the service available in those areas. Hopefully, it will be available throughout the country as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on the recent work it has done. We must ensure that women who are vulnerable avail of the service. I also call for the urgent establishment of specialist units throughout the country. Women will travel if they believe the specialist help is available. I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments on the extension of the national breast cancer screening programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue. It is vital to have a national breast cancer screening programme. The decision to initiate a national screening programme was part of the national cancer strategy action plan set up in 1997 by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan. There was a widespread welcome for the plan.</P>
      <P>Irish women are more likely to die of breast cancer than women in other European countries. They are twice as likely to die from the disease as a woman in the United States. There has been much discussion about treatment. Stronger emphasis must be put on early intervention and early detection. This has a significant impact on the survival rate from this frightening disease which affects many families in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I attended the launch by the Minister and the Taoiseach of the national breast cancer screening programme two months ago in Dublin Castle. The title of the programme as a national programme is somewhat flawed in that it is not reaching all parts of the country. The programme will invite women in the 50 to 64 year old age group to participate in the screening process. However, only women in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area and the North Eastern Health Board and Midland Health Board areas can benefit. Women living outside these areas must wait until the Minister has had a chance to <Col N="587" /> evaluate the first phase. He will then make a decision on whether to extend the programme.</P>
    <P>The programme should be extended. I concur with Deputy Fitzgerald's comments on the reports in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and I compliment the newspaper on its radio advertisements. A brave woman, Brighid McLoughlin, made public the experience she had with breast cancer and said that if five women came forward for breast cancer screening and testing, her efforts would have been a success. It focused me on the fact that this programme is really only reaching half the population. The aim of the programme is to reduce the cancer mortality rate by at least 20% in the target age group, and given the resources and with the proper management structures in place, I have no doubt it can be successful. However, the discrimination against the other 50% of women in the target group should be addressed immediately. If we are convinced of the necessity for such a programme, surely at this time when we see escalating costs of medical care, it makes sense to channel resources into a preventative programme. The programme will be a success and there is no doubting the figures from other jurisdictions. In the UK, for instance, the mortality rate for breast cancer has fallen by over 20% in the 55 to 69 year age group. Of this, 6.5% can be attributed directly to screening.</P>
    <P>There was some disquiet that the initial offers of screening had been quite low, as low as 50% or even lower in some cases. That can be addressed. The programme is in its initial stages and a public awareness campaign and the campaign we have seen over the past weekend will contribute to eliminating some of its teething problems. I do not understand why we cannot have a commitment at this stage to a timescale. Surely the success of the screening programme has been proven in other jurisdictions in other countries and now is the time to do it when we have the finances. We have a budget tomorrow in which I hope there will be some provision towards extending such a very valuable programme on a nationwide basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Clune and Fitzgerald for raising the important topic of the national breast screening programme on the Adjournment this evening. The Deputies may be aware that BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, was formally launched on 10 October 2000. Phase 1 of the programme will cover the Eastern, North Eastern and Midland Health Board areas and will target 140,000 women in the age cohort 50 to 64, which represents approximately 50% of the national target population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The service is being delivered by two central units, the Eccles unit on the Mater Hospital campus and the Merrion Unit on St. Vincent's <Col N="588" /> Hospital campus, with outreach to the community by means of three mobile units. The Eccles unit is now fully commissioned and screening commenced there in February 2000. Limited screening is also in progress in St. Vincent's Hospital pending the construction of the new Merrion unit. The first mobile unit commenced screening on 21 August 2000 in Longford and moved to the Navan area on 13 November 2000. The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process rather than the costs involved and my Department's key objective is to ensure that the Irish programme meets the necessary quality assurance criteria. It is for this reason that the Irish national breast screening programme must be driven by international quality assurance standards and best practice. Specifically, the phasing will take account of the following critical success factors: the achievement of acceptable compliance levels among the target population, on-going evaluation of the programme from the quality perspective, availability of the necessary clinical expertise to conduct the programme and supporting facilities.</P>
    <P>Phase II will involve the extension of the programme to the rest of the country. The national breast screening board is currently examining the proposal for the phase II roll-out of the screening programme to the rest of Ireland. At the recent launch, the chairman stated that the programme covered half of the country's eligible population and when the first year's results were evaluated, it was hoped to be able to advise me that they have achieved a world class service that should be extended as quickly as is practicable to the rest of the country and perhaps to an even wider age cohort of women. At the opening I took the opportunity to speak to the board and to the chairperson of the board, Dr. Sheelah Ryan, who made those comments at the time. I have spoken to a number of people on the board since. I am very anxious that we roll out phase II as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Any new programme needs to be evaluated. One needs to find out what works and what does not. One also needs to make sure that the base is firmly established on which such a programme is built. It is easy to announce things and say we are going to do them but what is important is that once we make the announcement, all of the preparations are in place, that clinical expertise and centres are there and most importantly that the protocols and the standards can be met by phase II. I am committed to extending it as quickly as I can, which I communicated to the board. It is revising its projections in that context with a view to perhaps rolling-out phase II earlier than anticipated. It had anticipated phase II at the commencement of next year, in other words, at the end of 2001 and the beginning of 2002. I asked it to review that with a view to seeing if we can bring it forward a little earlier.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="589" /> A comprehensive communication strategy comprising advertising and public relations and a contact programme is under way. Details of this were announced at the official opening of the units in Dublin Castle in October. A partnership with the health boards in the areas being screened has been agreed to promote the programme to as wide an audience as possible and to encourage uptake. A BreastCheck symposium took place in the Northern Area Health Board to maximise the uptake there. This exercise will be repeated in other areas as the programme expands. A comprehensive contact programme targeting women's groups on the ground has also been ramped-up to further inform women of the programme and the need to participate.</P>
    <P>BreastCheck has been working in partnership with other groups such as the Irish College of General Practitioners. A GP co-ordinator and 13 GP facilitators have been appointed to ensure that local GPs are informed about the programme and their help is sought to promote the service. Information evenings in the GP units take place at regular intervals.</P>
    <P>Information packs have been distributed to all GPs who are key to the success of the programme and a tailored information pack has also been distributed to the relevant nursing groups, e.g., practice nurses and public health nurses. Publicity to date has centred on the current screening locations using outdoor advertising and regional press and local radio advertising. Advertising recently extended to the national media with national press coverage and a new radio advertisement featuring Marian Finucane designed to raise awareness about the service. It is planned to develop this campaign further for 2001. In terms of communication, they were anxious to get the campaign down in the regions where it was happening. They were slightly worried in the beginning that if we did a national campaign of advertising one might mislead many people in the areas that are not covered. Nonetheless we realised with all the debate about the symptomatic breast centre that we need a far greater public education campaign in relation to cancer services generally because, as Deputies know, we had many misinformed comments about what we are trying to do <i>vis-à-vis</i> the establishment of centres of excellence countrywide.</P>
    <P>We are conscious of the importance of early access to symptomatic mammography services and of the provision of an equivalent standard of excellence in both symptomatic and screening mammography services. A review of symptomatic breast cancer services was carried out by a sub-group of the National Cancer Forum at the request of my predecessor, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen. This review commenced in 1999 and I received the report of the review in April this year. Having considered the report entitled &ldquo;Development of Services for <Col N="590" /> Symptomatic Breast Disease&rdquo;, I accept the broad thrust of its recommendations. This report is essentially about the development of centres of excellence for the specialist treatment of breast disease. The report refers to the strong evidence which exists that women with breast cancer are at a lower risk of relapse and have a better opportunity of long-term survival if they are treated in a multi-disciplinary setting. This means that surgeons, radiologists, pathologists, medical oncologists, radiotherapists, plastic surgeons, nurses, counsellors and others all bring expertise together to provide the best care for each patient. The report recommends the establishment of these specialist units.</P>
    <P>It is in this context that I emphasise the importance of prioritising women's health over and above geopolitical considerations. Having considered the report, I established an expert advisory group to assist and liaise with health boards in formulating the health boards' implementation plans for the development of specialist breast units. This advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor Niall O'Higgins met with all of the health boards recently. I expect to be in a position shortly to announce the establishment of the first phase of these centres of excellence.</P>
    <P>Further evidence of our commitment is the increased funding provided for the programme. A total of £2 million was made available over the period 1997 and 1998. In 1999, this amount was increased to £3.8 million capital and £2.9 million revenue. In 2000, a sum totalling £5.3 million revenue has been provided and this is supported with a sum of £1.1 million in capital moneys. I propose to provide a further £1.5 million revenue in 2001 to the Eastern Regional Health Authority specifically to provide for the increased demand on the symptomatic service arising from the screening service in the Mater and St. Vincent's Hospitals.</P>
    <P>From all of the foregoing it is clear that we are embarking on a well thought out and planned national breast cancer screening programme which forms part of the wider national cancer strategy. The national breast screening programme is resourced and possesses in-built mechanisms to assess our progress and effectiveness. Most of all, it has the essential patient focus enshrined in its women's charter which should serve to encourage and attract women to participate in the programme. A dedicated team is implementing it. Let us now build on the foundations that have been laid to date.</P>

      <P>The Irish Horseracing Authority, with its 16 person board, has done an excellent job since its establishment in 1994. It is nonetheless considered that a smaller board could operate its board business more efficiently and all the main industry interests agree that this would be desirable. The composition of the board of Horse Racing Ireland as set out in the memorandum of understanding agreed with the Turf Club-INHSC was arrived at after much consideration and wide consultation in the industry and reflects fair representation on the board for all the major sectors in the industry which depend on the industry for their livelihoods. Many other parties including the racegoers sought representation on the board. It was not possible, in the smaller board of 13 which was considered optimum, to accommodate all those parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the racegoers, the original proposals for the establishment of HRI launched by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy <Col N="594" /> McCreevy, and I, in July last included specific provision for the setting up by HRI of a race-goers consultative forum. This aspect of the original proposals has not been changed and will stand. It envisaged that the forum will include representatives of racegoers clubs, racecourse supporters clubs and other organisations operating in the interests of racegoers. On that basis, I expect that the interests of racegoers will be given a wider and better overall representation in discussions on the matters which most affect them.</P>

      <P>The pig industry is in a reasonably satisfactory state at present. While producer prices are lower than in some other EU countries, they are about 27% higher than the poor levels experienced a year ago. Producers are obtaining good levels of efficiency. The industry as a whole, however, is at a crossroads and has to face emerging challenges, many of which have been identified in the Agri Food 2010 report. These include meeting international best practice in terms of processing scale, structure and capacity utilisation, meeting the demands of the catering and retail sectors, maintenance of export markets in the context of growing international competitiveness, food safety, product innovation and increase in value added. Environmental and <Col N="595" /> animal health considerations will also have important consequences for the industry in the future.</P>
      <P>A study of the pig industry on the island of Ireland was commissioned jointly with the Northern Ireland authorities. I expect the final report of this study will be available in the next couple of weeks. I will be examining its findings closely and I look forward to working with the industry on progressing the findings of the study with a view to doing everything possible to ensure the success of the industry going forward.</P>
      <P>The plan of action setting out the Government's response to the 2010 report indicates that financial assistance will be provided for suitable projects put forward by the processing industry that are consistent with the direction in which the industry needs to go to ensure its future.</P>

      <P>The commitment referred to is being addressed by two schemes &ndash; the scheme of early retirement from farming and the scheme of installation aid for young farmers 2000-06.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applications under the scheme of early retirement from farming closed with effect from 31 December 1999. The purpose of this scheme was to address two structural defects in Irish agriculture, the age profile of farmers and the viability of farm holdings. It offered pensions to farmers, aged between 55 and 66 years, who <Col N="599" /> either transferred or leased their farms to young farmers. A measure of the scheme's success is that 10,000 farmers retired, releasing 300,000 hectares of land to younger farmers whose average age was 31 years. This brought forward the retirement age of farmers by an average of six years. The scheme also contributed to the increase in average farm size, as the young farmer availing of the scheme was required to enlarge the released lands by five hectares, or by 10%, whichever was the greater.</P>
    <P>A new scheme of early retirement came into operation on 27 November as part of my Department's rural development plan. This new scheme will run until the end of 2006 and will cost in the region of £600 million. About 7,000 farmers are expected to avail of the opportunity to retire early joining the 10,000 farmers who have already retired under the old scheme. An important feature of the new scheme is the introduction of viability criteria which will allow part-time farmers who satisfy various conditions to avail of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I believe it is fair to say that the early retirement from farming scheme has proven very successful. Not alone did it provide an opportunity for the older farmers to retire but it also contributed to the development of viable farm holdings. The new scheme will build on the achievements of the old scheme and will make a significant contribution towards meeting the commitment referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The new scheme of installation aid for young farmers is complementary to the scheme of early retirement. Its aim is to encourage young people to take up farming and to help to defray their start up costs. This scheme forms part of the regional operational programmes and is expected to be operational early next year. While a total of 7,957 farms have availed of installation schemes up to now, it is expected that an additional 4,000 will avail of the new scheme for which £29.8 million has been allocated.</P>

      <P>The position is that all cattle imported into Ireland are subject to strict regulation. The export of cattle from the UK has been prohibited since March 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under EU legislation all cattle movements between member states must be notified under the Animo system. Cattle must be accompanied by veterinary certification confirming that they comply with the stringent animal and public <Col N="600" /> health requirements under Directive 64/432/EEC, as amended. The cattle are currently imported through a single entry point and they are subject to a documentary check on arrival. A physical check is carried out by Departmental staff on the animals at their point of destination, including for certain animal diseases. In accordance with EU legislation and since September 1998 the cattle retain their country of origin animal identification and they are issued with special red passports. Prior to this date, the cattle were assigned with a special series of eartag numbers. The animal movements are recorded on the passports and notified to the animal tracing system.</P>
    <P>Cattle from third countries may be imported only from countries which have been specifically approved by EU veterinary officials. Such cattle are imported through approved border inspection points and they must be accompanied by animal and public health certification conforming to EU requirements. The list of approved countries exporting to the EU is subject to continuous monitoring and review. Ireland imports only a small number of cattle from Canada for breeding purposes. These animals are subject to documentary, physical and identification checks at the point of import. They are further subject to post importation checks at the point of destination, including isolation and detention for specified periods and tested for a range of animal diseases. The animals are assigned a special individual red numeric eartag and a red passport. Again the animal movements are recorded on the passport and notified to the animal tracing system.</P>

      <P>The CAP Rural Development Plan 2000-2006 is comprised of four support measures covering early retirement, compensatory allowances, agri-environment and afforestation and involves total EU and national expenditure of almost £4 billion &ndash; a 105% increase on the 1994-1999 period. The main elements are as follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="602" /> A total of £1.6 billion in public funding is available under the rural environment protection scheme. The new scheme is designed to build on the progress achieved under the 1994 to 1999 REPS programme. It contains a number of new elements intended to boost participation, including an increase in the basic rate of payment for smaller farms, 20 hectares or less; and provision for farmers with lands in an environmentally sensitive target area to receive payment on those lands up to a limit of 10 hectares, without having to participate in the general REPS programme.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the scheme are the establishment of farming practices and production methods which reflect the need for environmental conservation and protection; the protection of wildlife habitats and endangered species of flora and fauna; and the production of quality food in an extensive and environmentally friendly manner.</P>
    <P>Participants are required to farm to a detailed five year farm plan drawn up by an approved agricultural planner in accordance with the scheme specifications, which includes a nutrient management plan, a grassland management plan and other measures for the protection of the environment.</P>
    <P>A total of £602 million in public funding is available under the early retirement scheme. The objectives of the scheme are to provide an income for older farmers &ndash; between the ages of 55 and 66 &ndash; who decide to stop farming; to encourage the replacement of such older farmers by farmers able to improve, where necessary, the economic viability of the remaining agricultural holding; and to re-assign agricultural land to non-agricultural uses where it cannot be farmed under satisfactory conditions of economic viability.</P>
    <P>The measure contains two important changes from the previous scheme. Firstly, the need for transferees to enlarge the holding has been replaced by a requirement to demonstrate economic viability. Secondly, part-time farmers will be eligible both as transferors and transferees. </P>
    <P>In accordance with the Agenda 2000 agreement, the new compensatory allowances scheme for disadvantaged areas involves moving from an animal based or headage system to one based on area. Under transitional arrangements, the headage schemes as they have operated up to now will continue to apply for this year. The new area based system will be introduced in 2001.</P>
    <P>The new scheme involves total public funding of some £1.2 billion &ndash; an increase of £360 million.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the number of farmers qualifying for payment will rise from 90,000 currently to 109,000 in 2001.  From 2001, some 81,000 farmers stand to gain about £66 million annually while 28,000 farmers will incur some losses.  I have, however, negotiated a compensation package with the EU Commission whereby 90% of losses will be made good in 2001, 80% in 2002 and 50% in 2003. Under these arrangements, the average loss in 2001 will be about £32 and £64 in <Col N="603" /> 2002. I am anxious, however, to find an equitable long-term solution to the problem of losses and I have asked my officials to carry out an early examination with that in mind.</P>
    <P>The public funding for forestry is £542 million. The focus is on farm forestry with planting and maintenance grants and annual premiums for income support being provided. The premiums and grants have been increased substantially. In particular, these will encourage the ongoing planting of broadleaves with higher rates available for this type of planting.</P>
    <P>The REPS early retirement and forestry schemes have already been introduced. Application forms are available, as appropriate, from the local farm development service offices of my Department or the local offices of the forest service. The new compensatory allowance arrangements will take effect in 2001.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report and recommendations of the task force on the beef industry, combined with my Department's response to the Agri-Food 2000 report, provide a blue print for the development of the beef sector from primary production through to marketing. I have established a monitoring committee under the aegis of An Bord Bia to oversee the implementation of a number of these recommendations. The remaining recommendations of the beef task force are, depending on their nature, for implementation by the industry itself and by the relevant State agencies in co-operation with my Department.</P>
      <P>As far as primary production is concerned, the major requirement is to improve the quality of cattle through better breeding and husbandry practices in order to ensure an adequate supply of high quality beef needed to meet the demanding requirements of consumers in the EU market. Teagasc and the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation have intensified their efforts in recent months to promote the development of quality breeding by producers. In addition, I have used the national envelope for 2001 in order to encourage producers to replace their breeding herd more rapidly than normal and thereby improve their breeding stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the processing stage, the main issues which need to be addressed are the over-capacity in the <Col N="604" /> slaughtering sector and the need to encourage the production of value added products. Under the national development plan, priority will be given to the beef sector at primary slaughtering in the context of the productive sector operational programme. This initiative, operating in partnership with the industry itself, should facilitate development and rationalisation in the beef processing industry in a planned way. In addition, under the national development plan, the investment related to the production of value added products will also be encouraged in line with consumer demand.</P>
    <P>With regard to market promotion, responsibility for beef promotion is a matter for Bord Bia and, of course, the industry itself. Substantial resources are already available to Bord Bia for that purpose. However, given EU constraints on the promotion of Irish beef on the marketing of product on the basis of the country of origin, the promotion activities of An Bord Bia need to be supplemented by an industry funded campaign which is not subject to EU constraints. This was recognised in the context of the PDF. It was also a major recommendation of the task force and is one of those matters which the monitoring committee has been asked to implement.</P>
    <P>Apart from these issues, a major requirement in the beef industry is to remove the distrust which exists between producers and processors and bring about a greater degree of partnership and co-operation between them. To this end, my Department has been publishing prices paid by individual meat factories since mid February. The Government also engaged an independent group to examine allegations of anti-competitive practices in the industry and the reasons for the large differentials between producer and consumer prices. The report of this group has been published. I believe that these initiatives should help to rebuild the trust and partnership between beef producers and processors needed to enable the industry to achieve its full potential.</P>
    <P>The on-going monitoring and control programmes for the protection of Ireland's animal health status are essential in securing market outlets for our agricultural goods. The extensive bovine TB, brucellosis, BSE and enzootic bovine leucosis programmes reflect the Government's commitment on safeguarding our animal health status but also to allay concerns by the general public on the public health status of our agricultural products. It is worth noting that, despite the recent reported increase in the incidence of BSE, Ireland is classified by the Office International des Epizooties as having a low sporadic incidence of BSE for the purpose of the international trade code adopted by that organisation. The low level of the disease in the country has also been recognised by the European Union which has not included Ireland in the scope of the control measures in respect of BSE adopted following the recommendations of the scientific veterinary committee.</P>

      <P>Negotiations on agriculture started in March 2000 under the auspices of the world trade organisation, in accordance with Article 20 of the 1994 Agreement on Agriculture which was concluded as part of the last round of multilateral trade negotiations under the GATT. The first phase of the negotiations is a preparatory one, during which WTO members are submitting negotiating proposals in prep<Col N="606" /> aration for the commencement of substantive negotiations in 2001.</P>
      <P>The European Union participates in the WTO negotiations as a single entity with the EU Commission conducting the negotiations in accordance with a mandate adopted by the Council of Ministers. The EU negotiating mandate for agriculture was adopted by the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers on 27 September 1999 and endorsed subsequently by the General Affairs Council. The mandate is based primarily on the Agenda 2000 agreement decided by the European Council in Berlin in March 1999. At its meeting on 21 November 2000 the Council of Agriculture Ministers approved a comprehensive negotiating proposal, based on the mandate already agreed, which will be forwarded to Geneva before the end of the year. I am satisfied that this negotiating proposal provides a satisfactory framework for protecting the interests of the Irish agriculture and food industries and it is my intention to ensure that these interests will be fully protected in the negotiations themselves.</P>
      <P>Because of changes in the trading environment which may result from the WTO negotiations and from enlargement of the EU as well as factors such as changing consumer tastes, new food distribution channels and general technological developments, I established a group to make recommendations on the development of the Irish agriculture and food industries over the present decade. That group's report entitled Agri Food 2010 was completed earlier this year and I have approved and published a plan of action for the implementation of its recommendations. As a result, I expect that the agriculture and food industries will be well prepared to maximise their contribution to Irish wealth and employment and the development of rural areas over the next ten years.</P>

By Commission Decision 96/239/EC dated 27 March 1996, as amended by Commission Decision 96/362/EC of 11 June 1996, the exportation from the UK of meat products not derived from bovines slaughtered in the UK was permitted. In effect, this <Col N="608" /> allowed meat products of non UK origin to be processed in the UK under certain conditions and certified for export. The onus and legal responsibility for ensuring that only meat products of non-UK origin were certified for export was thereby placed on the UK authority.</P>
      <P>With the introduction of the European Communities (Importation of Bovine Animals and Products obtained from Bovine Animals from the United Kingdom) Regulations, 1999 (S.I.

The 1999 regulations permit the importation of deboned fresh beef, minced meat, meat preparations and meat products of UK origin provided that the products are sourced under the EU approved date-based export scheme and approved premises in the UK and from bovines under the export certified herd scheme in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>In accordance with Council Decision 98/256/EC, as amended, products of UK origin and of foreign origin must comply with special marking and labelling conditions and be sourced from designated slaughter plants and processing premises.

      <P>One of the objectives in the national climate change strategy is to secure methane reductions of 1.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in emissions from livestock. This reduction is equivalent to, rather than an actual, 10% reduction in livestock numbers by the year 2010. It will be achieved by a combination of some stock reduction based on current EU policies and coupled with extensification and other management measures in REPS. A research programme will also be undertaken by Teagasc to identify feeding regimes, appropriate to Irish conditions, that reduce methane emissions from individual animals. The <Col N="609" /> research will look at the use of feed additives, probiotics and engineering, changes in level of concentrate feeding, changes in the system of cattle production with focus on finishing them at a younger age and improved feeding and management at farm level.</P>

      <Quest>the plans he has to address the losses in headage payments for farmers in mountain type grazing areas; if he has sought EU approval for these proposals; and when he will announce these plans.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme agreed with the social partner farm organisations in July and since approved by the European Commission provides for area related payments as follows. More Severely Handicapped (lowland) &ndash; £70 per hectare up to 45 hectares; Less Severely Handicapped (lowland) &ndash; £60 per hectare up to 45 hectares; Mountain Type Land &ndash; £45 per hectare up to 60 hectares. Where a farmer farms a combination of land categories he will be paid on lowland, more severely handicapped, first, lowland, less severely handicapped, next the mountain grazings last. If a farmer only has lowland, more severely handicapped, and-or lowland, less severely handicapped, his overall limit is 45 hectares. If he has a combination of lowland, more severely handicapped, and-or lowland, less severely handicapped, and some mountain type land, he will be paid on up to 45 hectares lowland and up to an extra 15 hectares of mountain subject to an overall limit of 60 hectares. If a farmer only has mountain type land his overall limit is 60 hectares.</P>
      <P>The Government has already committed some £360 million additional funding for the scheme over the period 2001-06. The new arrangements involve a cost of £180 million in 2001 representing an increase of about £60 million over the current scheme. There are no losers this year since the existing schemes remain in place under the transitional arrangements. It is estimated that the number of farmers qualifying for payment under the new area based scheme will rise from 90,000 currently to 109,000 in 2001. From 2001, some 81,000 farmers stand to gain about £66 million annually while 28,000 farmers will incur some losses. I have however negotiated a compensation package for losers under which 90% of losses will be made good in 2001, 80% in 2002 and 50% in 2003. Under these arrangements the average loss in 2001 will be about £32 rising to £64 in 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked my officials to carry out a review of the scheme to see if an equitable long-term solution can be found to the problem of reduced payments. As I indicated earlier, the average loss in 2001, for those farmers who stand to lose, will <Col N="610" /> be about £32. My immediate priority therefore is to concentrate on putting arrangements in place for delivery of the new area based system in 2001. I am anxious however to find an equitable solution to this issue and I would hope that a review can be carried out during the early part of next year.</P>

In relation to the dissemination of information on BSE to farmers, veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers and butchers, my Department has done its utmost to ensure that all those involved in the industry are well informed.</P>
      <P>Information leaflets have been distributed to farmers at marts. In addition, my Department has produced a video on BSE which is available to veterinary surgeons. The video has also been distributed to all veterinary officials in meat factories, and to factory management, who have been advised to show it to all staff involved in the selection of animals for slaughter. Copies of the video have also been distributed to local authority veterinary inspectors, who have responsibility for controls at local authority abattoirs. My Department has made strenuous efforts to keep all of those involved in the industry fully informed, and I will continue to treat the provision of appropriate information to those who need it as a priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 95 together.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to quantify at this stage the drop in beef consumption within the EU arising from the current BSE situation. Given that the beef produced in Ireland from some nine out of every ten animals slaughtered is exported, any situation which threatens to adversely affect this trade is a matter of serious concern. In 1999, Ireland exported over 640,000 tonnes, carcass weight equivalent, to over 60 countries world-wide of which some 288,000 tonnes were exported to EU countries. To date, the markets directly affected by this current difficulty are Hungary, Oman, Philippines and the Czech Republic which have banned imports of beef from the EU and Egypt which has suspended the issue of import licences pending a review of the BSE situation in Europe. The Russian Federation has added a further three Irish counties to its banned list on foot of last August's BSE figures. My Department has been in contact with the relevant authorities in these countries to emphasise to them that Ireland's BSE control measures, which were significantly enhanced in 1996 and 1997, are among the most stringent in the world and that these controls offer the maximum possible assurances of safety to consumers of Irish beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="613" /> Clearly the effects of BSE being discovered in some member states which had not found it up to now and had not put in place preventative measures have been profound. It is the case that recent developments have caused serious problems within the market and these can only be dealt with by measures taken at EU level. In this regard, I believe that the decisions taken at yesterday's council should make a considerable contribution to improving the situation. The measures adopted include a temporary ban on feeding of meat and bone meal to all farm animals; animals over 30 months can go into the food chain only if tested; a 'purchase for destruction' scheme to remove from the food chain all cattle over 30 months which have not yet been tested for BSE; and intervention purchasing needs to be introduced.</P>
    <P>I strongly welcome these decisions and I believe that they will provide an improved framework for protecting human health and in restoring confidence in beef. The resultant restoration of consumer confidence is the critical first step in achieving market balance, which is of major importance to the Irish beef industry. In addition, the &lsquo;purchase for destruction' scheme should also make a significant contribution to improved market balance. I have been particularly concerned to ensure adequate market support and I am confident that I have secured agreement for an effective and meaningful intervention arrangement which should provide the basis for the resumption of orderly marketing.</P>
    <P>The agreement was also essential in reassuring our vital third country markets. I will be visiting Egypt immediately to secure the restoration of this market for Irish beef.</P>

      <P>In general, Teagasc training courses are aimed at farmers and horticulturists to upskill people for employment in farming, horticulture or agribusiness.</P>
      <P>However, some of the longer courses for new entrants, namely, the one year courses in colleges and the certificates in farming and in rural enterprise at local training centres, contain modules which provide students with skills which would equip them for off-farm employment. These include modules on information technology, buildings and maintenance and in many cases are delivered in association with FÁS and vocational education committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teagasc also run courses in rural business development &ndash; mainly in rural tourism and home food production &ndash; to equip rural people <Col N="614" /> to develop these enterprises at home. It runs some of these courses with assistance from the vocational education committees, institutes of technology and CERT.</P>
    <P>Teagasc is currently running a large number of short courses on information technology, mainly computer use and computer applications. While these are primarily to equip people to run farm computers, they will form a basis for some participants to seek off-farm employment.</P>
    <P>The proposed rural viability advisory service will offer farm families an &ldquo;options analysis&rdquo; where all the options &ndash; including on-farm developments and off-farm employment &ndash; will be examined. When off-farm employment is identified as a desirable and feasible option and a training need results, Teagasc will either provide the training or refer the family member to the appropriate training agency, for example, FÁS, CERT or VEC.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible, nor would it be appropriate to give an absolute guarantee as to the future availability of all ruminant vaccines. To do so, would be to prejudice the outcome of the ongoing review of veterinary vaccines currently on the Irish market, which must be carried out on the basis of objective and detailed criteria laid down under relevant EU and national legislation.</P>
      <P>Regulation of the veterinary vaccines market is covered by a comprehensive body of legislation at both EU and national levels, that is, Council Directive 81/851EEC and the Animal Remedies Regulations, 1996. Under the aforementioned national legislation, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is designated as competent authority as regards approval of individual vaccines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary impetus for changes in the licensing regime in Ireland was the fact that existing licences no longer met the requirements of EU legislation, not least because they did not designate a legally binding route of supply for each product. It was, therefore, necessary to fully review all vaccines on the Irish market. Under relevant EU rules, such review must be carried out to a precise, demonstrable standard, which involves detailed expert examination of product dossiers submitted by applicant companies. As provided for under the relevant legislation, it was agreed that the Irish Medicines Board, IMB, would carry out the detailed examination of the application dossiers and recommend in each case on the grant or otherwise of a licence and the <Col N="615" /> conditions which might be attached to such licence. In other words, the IMB would recommend but I would in each case decide on the grant of a licence and on the conditions which should be attached to such licence.</P>
    <P>In terms of exercising my statutory function as competent authority, I should stress that I do not have a general policy which would necessarily preclude any of the interests provided for in the 1996 Animal Remedies Regulations from selling vaccines. Furthermore, while I must give due regard to the recommendation of the IMB in each case, I am not bound by any such recommendation. Rather, each case will be fully evaluated on an objective basis, taking particular account of the criteria governing the designation of routes of supply contained in the 1996 regulations. Where, on the basis of this examination, it is concluded that a particular sales category meets all the necessary requirements, that category will be utilised.</P>
    <P>It should be clear from the forgoing that leaving the present control arrangements in place, is not an option if we are to meet our legal obligations under EU law and if our regulatory systems are to enjoy the confidence of counterparts in other member states. It should be borne in mind that many of these countries are important markets for our agricultural output. As far as my own approach is concerned, it should be equally clear that no appropriately licensed outlet provided for by the 1996 regulations will be excluded as a matter of general policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75, 133, 134 and 192 together.</P>
      <P>I am very aware of the difficulties being experienced by beef producers at present. These difficulties stem from a serious reduction in consumer confidence in some of our major continental markets leading to a sharp drop in consumption. The uncertainty in relation to third country markets has exacerbated the situation. The impact of all these developments can be seen from the fall in cattle prices in recent weeks, and particularly, cow prices.</P>
      <P>I have been tackling the problem on three fronts. First, I have endeavoured, along with my colleagues in the Agriculture Council, to restore consumer confidence in beef. Second, I have attempted to ensure that appropriate market measures are put in place in order to alleviate the impact on producers. Third, I have endeavoured to ensure that all markets remain open to Irish beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the first point, I have endeavoured to secure the adoption of an EU wide approach to the BSE problem with a view to putting in place effective control measures which will prevent the <Col N="617" /> spread of the disease and provide maximum protection to the consumer. I believe that the decisions taken in the Council yesterday should make a considerable contribution to the achievement of these objectives. The measures adopted are: a temporary ban on feeding of meat and bone meal to all farm animals; animals over 30 months can go into the food chain only if tested; a purchase for destruction scheme to remove from the food chain all cattle over 30 months which have not yet been tested for BSE. I welcome these decisions and I believe that, combined with the decision taken last month to require all cattle over 12 months of age to be tested for BSE with effect from 1 July 2001, they will provide an improved framework for protecting human health and in restoring confidence in beef.</P>
    <P>As far as market support measures are concerned, I welcome the conclusion of the Council that it is essential to introduce intervention and I am confident that an effective and meaningful intervention arrangement which can provide the basis for a resumption of orderly marketing will be put in place at the meeting of the beef management committee meeting on 12 December 2000. The &ldquo;purchase for destruction&rdquo; scheme should also make a substantial contribution to improving market balance in the sector. The Commission has also given a commitment to the Council to examine the consequence of the current crisis for producers and to report back to the Council, with any appropriate proposals. The Council has undertaken to act on any such proposals as a matter of urgency. The Commission has also agreed to increase the advances of the beef premiums from 60% to 80% in order to ease the financial pressure on beef producers.</P>
    <P>The Commission has already increased export refunds and introduced a private storage aid scheme for cows in order to provide additional support to the market. Export refunds have been increased by 15% in the case of male live cattle and beef and by 130% in the case of female beef. These changes are worth 5p/lb in the case of male beef and 9p/lb in the case of female beef and should significantly improve the competitiveness of our exporters on third country markets. A private storage scheme for cow beef has been introduced with effect from 27 November and will run until 2 February 2001. I have urged the beef processing sector to make maximum use of the scheme so that its full benefits will be available to Irish farmers who wish to sell cows over the coming months.</P>
    <P>With regard to export markets, My Department, our embassies abroad and Bord Bia have been very active in recent weeks in re-assuring our customers in our major markets about the safety of Irish beef, the limited incidence of the disease in Ireland and the controls which have been put in place over the years to ensure maximum protection of the consumer. The Government has, at the highest level, made every effort to ensure that the Egyptian market remains open.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" /> In this context I cannot overemphasise the importance of the Egyptian market for Irish beef. For this reason, the Government takes very seriously the recent action by Egypt to suspend the issue of import licences to Western European countries including Ireland. The reason they have taken this decision is to allow them take account of the developments within the EU related to BSE and to assess the measures and decisions being taken to deal with the situation. The developments I refer to relate to the situation in certain other member states and not to Ireland's situation.</P>
    <P>The Government has taken immediate action to deal with the situation in Egypt. To begin with, our ambassador in Cairo has been in contact with the authorities there and has outlined the facts of our situation in relation to BSE. Senior officials of my Department travelled to Egypt at the weekend for meetings with senior Egyptian officials. Ireland has an extremely positive case to make on BSE and these officials ensured that the Egyptian authorities were made fully aware of the controls we have in place.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to the Deputy Prime Minister and Agriculture Minister, Dr. Wali, and have impressed upon him the importance of the market to Ireland, the quality and safety controls in place in Ireland and the guarantees which can be given to consumers of Irish beef. I have also arranged to meet with him to brief him on the range of measures which will be put in place within the EU to deal with BSE which, I believe, help restore consumer confidence and eliminate much of the confusion which has arisen out of the recent BSE scares. Furthermore, the Taoiseach has raised the matter with President Mubarak and has impressed upon him the full facts about Irish beef exports and has asked him to avoid taking definitive action which may damage this trade.</P>
    <P>I think that the measures which have been taken at EU and national level are very positive developments and will, I hope, restore confidence in the market at producer and exporter level and help to alleviate the impact of the current difficulties on Irish cattle producers. I will keep the situation under review over the coming weeks.</P>

I am fully committed to ensuring compliance with EU rules governing the welfare of farm animals, <Col N="619" /> including animal transport. My Department is currently consulting the Attorney General's Office about signature and ratification of the Protocol of Amendment to the European Convention on the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes. Additionally, the Attorney General's Office is advising my Department on a draft order on animal transport which I propose to introduce as soon as possible in transposition of the relevant elements of Directive 64/432/EEC as amended.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as bovine tuberculosis is concerned, a total of 32,653 TB reactors have been disclosed for the period 1 January 2000 to 31 October 2000 compared with 36,565 for the same period in 1999. The APT, that is, the number of reactors per 1,000 tests, is currently at 3.9, down from 4.2 for the first ten months of 1999. Similarly the number of brucellosis reactors for the same period in 2000 is 3,294 compared with 4,253 for the same period in 1999. With regard to BSE, the number of cases reported for the period 1 January 2000 to 30 November 2000 is 126 compared with a figure of 75 for the same period last year.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains a number of measures with the objective of reducing current levels of, and ultimately eradicating, bovine TB from the national herd. Amongst the measures provided for is the allocation of specified staff resources in each district veterinary office, DVO, to carry out investigative work into the causes of herd breakdowns. In addition to current arrangements relating to wildlife, a pro-active approach will be taken in each DVO area, using 75 dedicated departmental and Farm Relief Service personnel, to the removal of all sources of infection, in the 20% of the country that yields some 50% of current TB reactors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="620" /> Also a number of additional measures have been added to the brucellosis programme in recent years. These include the introduction of a compulsory 30 day pre-movement test, the monitoring of cow slaughterings at meat plants and the replacement of the serum agglutination test on blood samples by the ELIZA Test. Furthermore, the milk ring test is in the process of being replaced by a whey ELIZA test in the brucellosis laboratory. In addition, my Department is in the course of introducing a new slurry treatment that should control spread of the disease.</P>
    <P>With regard to BSE I have, in the course of the Private Member's motion on Tuesday, 28 November 2000, and in answering Private Notice Questions on Thursday 30 November, already outlined in great detail the measures taken to restore confidence in the beef industry.</P>

      <P>I am fully aware of the views of the group in question and I have met its members on a number of occasions in the past.</P>
      <P>In response to their concerns, which relate largely to the position of quota holders no longer involved in milk production, I have already outlined in detail the options open to its members under the new regime. I have addressed the points raised by the group in the House.</P>
      <P>The provisions of Agenda 2000 allowed me to make important changes to the management of the milk quota regime here. The changes, which came into effect from 1 April, reflect the concerns on the part of the Government for the livelihoods of Ireland's dairy farmers and the long-term future of the dairy sector. These changes, which are designed to give active committed producers greater access to quota at a reasonable cost, were necessary if the dairy industry is to successfully position itself to face the competitive challenges which inevitably will arise in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>I have consulted widely and taken extensive legal advice on the new arrangements and I have listened to the different views. I believe the new arrangements are in the best interests of the future development of the industry and those committed to active milk production.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>As has already been well publicised, my Department has not been burying animals suspected of having BSE for a number of weeks past. As an interim measure, pending a resolution to the issue of disposal and ultimate destruction of BSE suspect animals, I recently announced a decision to discontinue the practice of burying BSE animals, in favour of holding them in cold storage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, my Department continues to actively pursue a number of specific options to resolve the substantive disposal-destruction issue. Such options will require the agreement of others, including the Environmental Protection Agency. I have made no secret of the fact that my favoured option for the disposal of these animals is incineration. I believe that there is a strong level of cross party consensus at national level in relation to the need for incineration facili<Col N="622" /> ties and I hope that this is reflected when these matters fall for decision at local level.</P>
    <P>Finally, burials which have already taken place involved individual BSE suspect animals buried under veterinary supervision and subject to a number of strict conditions. However, I have already indicated that in cases where local authorities, who have statutory responsibility for water quality, have specific concerns about the location of buried animals, my Department will provide any available information to facilitate an assessment of any risk to the local environment, and particularly to local water courses.</P>

      <P>A review of the sheep meat regime has been carried out recently on behalf of the EU Commission. One of the consultants carrying out the review visited Ireland. He had detailed discussions with my Department and was given a very full analysis of both the inadequacies of the sheep regime and the manner in which it could be adapted to address the disparity between the income of Irish sheep producers and producers in some other member states. During his visit the consultant also met with the sheep monitoring committee and thus received the views of producers and processors as well as Teagasc and academic interests on how the regime might be amended.</P>
      <P>The consultant's report on the regime issued recently. The overall conclusion of the report is that the common ewe premium system makes a significant contribution to the maintenance of producer's incomes but, because of the diversity of production across the EU, its effect on producers' income varies significantly between member states. It has identified many weaknesses in the system and the consultants have offered three options for the future development of the regime. These are the retention of the status quo, the correction of inaccuracies in the current system of calculating the premium and the introduction of a fixed premium.</P>
      <P>I took the opportunity to raise my concerns about the report at the recent sheepmeat conference in Brussels and I pointed out in particular that the question of the income gap between Irish and other EU producers needs to be addressed in any reform of the regime. I also asked Commissioner Fischler to examine how an acceptable level of differentiated payments might be implemented in the event of the introduction of a fixed premium. I suggested as an alternative that the present variable premium system might be retained with the introduction of measures such as an extensification premium and a supplementary ewe premium, particularly in member states where both market prices and producers' incomes are significantly below the average for the EU.</P>
      <P>The report is still being considered by the Commission and I will continue to press our case for a reform of the sheep meat regime which addresses the issue of the income gap between Irish and other EU sheep producers.</P>

      <P>Among the objectives of the Commission in tabling the proposals to which the Deputy refers is to ensure that food producers will bear full responsibility for the safety of the food they produce. This is made possible by the development of hazard analysis and critical control point, HACCP, principles and is in line with internationally accepted procedures. For the purposes of these proposed regulations, farmers are considered to be primary producers. While the regulations will require food producers to implement HACCP type procedures, it is proposed that primary production will be carried out in accordance with good practice guidelines and managed in such a way that hazards are monitored and, where necessary, eliminated or reduced to an acceptable level.</P>

      <P>The position is that no provision has been made in respect of any persons or group of persons who are not party to the proceedings in the Duff case and other associated cases. I have received legal advice to the effect that any proceedings that may be initiated by such persons are barred by the passage of time.</P>
      <P>This issue is extremely complex and has implications for the generality of milk producers in view of the limited amount of quota available. It is also the case that the State simply cannot be expected to take on legal responsibilities where they do not exist.</P>
      <P>However, notwithstanding this position, and despite the fact that there is no legal obligation to go further towards meeting the demands of the group in question, I am prepared to look at what can be done in the context of the additional quota which will become available on 1 April 2001.</P>

      <P>Recommendations on usage rates of nitrogen for all crops, including food crops, are contained in the Code of Good Agriculture Practice to Protect Waters from Pollution by Nitrates which was jointly drawn up by my Department and the Department of the Environment in 1996. The recommendations in the code relate to the timing of application of nitrogenous fertilisers and the precautions required to prevent pollution of water etc. These <Col N="627" /> requirements are equally applicable to all fertilisers. Participants in the rural environment protection scheme are obliged to use fertilisers in accordance with a nutrient management plan.</P>

      <P>Despite a number of agreements signed with Libya in recent years, the live cattle trade has not been resumed. The most recent agreement signed in Tripoli last June provided that Ireland would be officially listed as a source country for all Libyan tenders for the supply of live cattle. Since then, however, the Libyan Foreign Minister indicated that it had not been possible to import live cattle because of what he called logistical problems and that Libya would buy beef directly. Libya subsequently issued tenders for the supply of beef and Ireland was included in the list of countries invited to tender. I understand that a number of Irish companies have submitted bids recently.</P>

      <P>The vast majority of poultry produced in this country is slaughtered in EU approved premises under the control of my Department. All poultry is subject to ante and post-mortem inspection by officers of my Department. Processing, cutting, wrapping and dispatch of the product are also supervised by my officials. Poultrymeat samples are collected in all the slaughtering plants as part of a national monitoring programme and officially tested for residues and pathogens. In my view there is a considerable level of official control in place in regard to Irish poultry. Of course, there is a fundamental obligation on producers, processors, retailers and all others involved in the poultry industry to produce a safe product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legal requirements governing poultry production are set down in EU and national legislation. A small amount of Irish poultry is processed in premises under the control of local <Col N="628" /> authorities in accordance with the food hygiene regulations. The operation of these rules is objectively validated and endorsed from time to time by officials from outside agencies including the Food Safety Authority and the EU Commission.</P>
    <P>A considerable quantity of poultry on sale here is imported. If it is coming from other EU countries the product has been produced and officially controlled in the manner I have already outlined for Irish product produced here in EU approved plants. Conditions are also stipulated for product imported from outside the European Union.</P>
    <P>Sampling of some imported product is carried out by my officials and tested for pathogens and residues as with the national monitoring programme already mentioned.</P>
    <P>A national salmonella monitoring programme is in place in regard to poultry flocks in co-operation with the industry. This involves sampling, testing, hygiene controls and the destruction of infected flocks where necessary.</P>

      <P>It is intended that the new authority will have the important function of communicating to the public, the best scientific information available on particular issues of food safety.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 99 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>The jobs initiative programme, JI, is an active labour market programme which offers three-years work experience to persons who have been unemployed for five years or longer, at an agreed rate for the job. Participants may retain their secondary benefits, including the Christmas bonus payment, subject to the general retention conditions. Participants with children, depending on the family income, may also have an entitlement to family income supplement.</P>
      <P>An allowance, which is currently £220 per participant, per week, is paid by FÁS to managing agents. This allowance covers the cost of paying participants the rate for the job; it also includes an amount towards the training and development of the participants and the administration costs and overheads of the project. The rate of allowance payable per participant is reviewed annually and must not be so high as to provide a disincentive for JI participants to take up mainstream employment.</P>
      <P>While work experience programmes such as JI and the community employment programme meet the national minimum wage requirements, however, they are not covered under the terms of the PPF as it is not mainstream employment. The fundamental objective of these programmes is to progress participants into open labour market employment where they can benefit fully from the national partnership agreements.</P>

      <P>At present, EU law restricts both me and the Department, from intervening directly with insurance companies in the matter of what risks they are prepared to underwrite or premium levels that they set.</P>
      <P>The matter of providing house insurance on timber-framed building is relatively new to the insurance industry here. Last year 33,852 house were registered with Homebond, the national house building guarantee scheme. Less that 1% of these were timber-framed houses. Because underwriting criteria and the resulting premiums are based on claims history experience, a relatively new risk can be assessed by underwriters with caution. It can also happen that in the initial years of the cover a higher insurance premium can be charged.</P>
      <P>The standard perils contained in a house insurance policy include fire, storm damage and flooding. If the underwriter feels that timber-framed structures present an increased likelihood of a risk or that the severity of the damage would be greater in a timber framed house, the premium may be increased or in some circumstances the underwriter may choose not to cover the risk.</P>
      <P>Having said that, the Irish Insurance Federation, IIF, have confirmed to officials of our Department, that they have no evidence to suggest that insurance cover is being refused to owners of timber-framed houses.</P>
      <P>Likewise if, over time, the number of timber framed houses being built increases, and if claims experience to underwriters indicates that these houses are no worse a risk or indeed better, than cement block built houses, then the underwriting criteria and the consequent premium should reflect this.</P>
      <P>Because there are differing views between various underwriters on this particular risk and how it can be assessed, it is worth recommending that individuals shop around or engage the services of an insurance broker, to help obtain a favourable quote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The high cost of motor insurance in Ireland is directly attributable to the cost and frequency of claims incurred by insurance companies in settlement of claims following road accidents. This factor is especially relevant to young drivers whose adverse claims experience contributes to their consideration by motor insurance companies as a high risk category. The most recent road accident report published by the National Roads Authority for 1998 showed that 40% of drivers killed or seriously injured on Irish roads were between the ages of 18 and 34.</P>
      <P>EU law prevents me from intervening directly with the insurance companies in the matter of premium levels or in respect of the risks that they are prepared to underwrite.</P>
      <P>It is abundantly clear that the primary focus of initiatives, aimed at reducing the cost of motor insurance for young drivers must be on reducing the frequency of accidents and the subsequent claims. There are a number of such initiatives in place. For example, the Irish Insurance Federation, in conjunction with the Driving Instructors Register, has introduced a scheme of insurance premium discounts for the learner driver on completion of a required number of driving lessons. The National Safety Council, in co-operation with the Garda, continues to promote anti-speeding and anti-drink driving media campaigns. Greater attention to safety on the roads can further reinforce insurance cost reduction measures at Government level.</P>
      <P>The work of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board is aimed at providing me with information and advice on trends in motor insurance costs and with policy recommendations for addressing those costs.</P>
      <P>Further measures may be expected as a result of the work of the special working group set up to consider the establishment of a personal injuries tribunal. On the basis of that group's second report it is hoped to bring proposals to Government with the objective of putting arrangements in place to reduce the costs of delivering personal injury compensation.</P>
      <P>Finally, the most effective way of ensuring that the most competitive quotes are available to the Irish consumer is to have as many insurers as possible competing on the Irish market. It would appear that the implementation of EU legislation, opening up the EU market to competition from authorised insurers in all EU member states, has had a beneficial effect on competition in the Irish market.</P>

The review was commissioned by the board of the authority.

      <P>The board of the authority has informed me that it has endorsed the recommendations contained in the report.

      <P>The Department has a number of different channels through which it can form an objective assessment of the performance of the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, PRGF, partic<Col N="639" /> ularly in least developed countries. Our Embassies in Ireland Aid's priority countries maintain a strong dialogue with our partner Governments on their development process, including any involvement in the PRGF. The active involvement of our missions in donor wide co-ordination related to the preparation and implementation of poverty reduction strategy papers, PRSPs, allows Ireland Aid to monitor and, wherever possible, to influence World Bank and International Monetary Fund, IMF, programmes. In addition, I welcome views on the PRGF from the Irish NGO community many of whom also have a presence on the ground in these countries. The Department of Finance's representatives at both the IMF and the World Bank in Washington enable Ireland to monitor progress and to influence the direction of policy at board level. There is close co-ordination between the Departments of Finance and Foreign Affairs on the policy issues.</P>
      <P>The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. The enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility, ESAF, was renamed the PRGF in November 1999 and given new terms of reference in order to reflect a strengthened emphasis on poverty reduction by the IMF.</P>

      <P>The Simon Community every six months counts the number of homeless people sleeping rough on the streets of London. On 11 November 2000 it was found that there were 316 such people in the inner London boroughs of Camden, City of London, Haringey, Islington, Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster. It is important to note that the nationalities of the people concerned were not systematically recorded and that the suggestion in the Irish newspaper article mentioned by the Deputy that &ldquo;more than 60% of London's homeless are Irish&rdquo; is based on an uncorroborated statement about the count made by a member of the Simon Community. The director of the Simon Community in Britain has since informed the Irish Embassy in London that in his view it would be more accurate to say that at least one-third of the homeless people in inner London are Irish. According to statistics by ethnic group for the year ended 31 March 1999 compiled by the Housing Services Agency, an official body which provides resettlement services for homeless people in London, 11% of people sleeping on the streets of greater London were Irish.</P>
      <P>Social reasons connected to their domestic situations in Ireland account for why many young Irish people are homeless in London. In addition, too many of them still go to London and other cities in Britain inadequately prepared. The Government and voluntary organisations in Ireland are doing what they can to assist intending migrants in this regard. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs supports voluntary groups such as emigrant advice who give pre-departure advice and information. FÁS, the training and employment authority, makes available comprehensive information about coping with problems of living and working abroad.</P>
      <P>Out of respect for their privacy, it would not be appropriate to ask voluntary or official bodies to reveal the identities of homeless Irish people they assist.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government is committed to taking further steps to address the problem of homelessness among recently arrived Irish immigrants in Britain, especially in London. Through the DÍON Committee, based at the Embassy in London, the Irish Government has this year given grants amounting to £1,015,000 &ndash; an increase of over one-third on the funding provided in 1999 &ndash; from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment Vote to voluntary Irish organisations in Britain which advise and assist Irish people there, including groups which care for homeless Irish people. We intend to provide a further significant increase in funding next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The special social and health problems of Irish people in Britain are currently receiving special attention from the interdepartmental committee on emigration. Irish and British officials are con<Col N="641" /> sidering the possibility of special action, in the context of combating social exclusion, to address those problems, including homelessness.</P>

      <P>Six people were charged in 1997 in connection with his murder, five of whom were released. One person was charged with causing an affray but not murder. Following an RUC investigation into the actions of RUC officers on the night in question, which was supervised by the Independent Commission for Police Complaints, ICPC, the DPP decided not to proceed with the prosecution of any of the RUC officers involved.</P>
      <P>On 24 November, Nuala O'Loan, the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, announced that the handling of the case has been transferred to her office. Previously, the investigation was conducted by the Chief Constable under the supervision of the Independent Commission for Police Complaints.</P>
      <P>The Ombudsman stated that she would &ldquo;dedicate all the necessary resources to ensure that all avenues are investigated, exposed and exploited&rdquo;. The Government's position, as stated by the Taoiseach on 8 June 2000, is that the issues of concern involved must be satisfactorily addressed in a manner which would command the confidence of the community, through an independent, judicial public inquiry.</P>
      <P>The Government continue to monitor closely developments in Mr. Hamill's case and to pursue its concerns actively with the British authorities.</P>

We have also increased our contribution to UNAIDS from £75,000 in 1999 to £250,000 in 2000. The projects to be funded include initiatives in Zimbabwe, Lesotho and for research into a new HIV-AIDS vaccine. In the context of the Government's decision to reach the UN target of 0.7% of GNP on ODA by 2007, we are also looking at the possibilities for a greater financial involvement by <Col N="642" /> Ireland Aid in the current international and national initiatives against communicable diseases, particularly HIV-AIDS. This issue will be an important element to be considered in the forthcoming review of the aid programme which will <i>inter alia</i> examine priorities for future spending in our greatly expanded aid programme.</P>

    <P>In 1993 a voluntary severance scheme was introduced whereby full-time staff who wished to avail of the scheme were given nine weeks pay per year of service plus a pension lump sum in lieu of any superannuation entitlements.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is totally committed to its campaign to bring about the closure of the Sellafield plant.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Dáil Question No. 57 on 16 May 2000. In that reply, I referred to the reports published last February by the UK Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, NII, concerning the control and supervision of operations at Sellafield and the falsification of safety related data relating to MOX fuel pellets produced at the Sellafield MOX demonstration facility, and to my follow-up meeting with the UK Energy Minister.</P>
      <P>Both my Department and the RPII have since been maintaining contact with their UK counterparts regarding BNFL's progress in implementing the numerous safety-related recommendations contained in those reports. The MOX Demonstration Facility at Sellafield, which closed in September last year, following the revelations about the falsification of the MOX fuel pellets, remains closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reply to the Dáil Question No. 57 on 16 May also referred to initiatives in relation to nuclear reprocessing activities at Sellafield which Ireland would be taking at the June 2000 meeting of the OSPAR Commission. At that June meeting of the OSPAR Commission, Ireland was one of 12 contracting parties to the OSPAR Convention which joined forces to adopt a decision which clearly signalled the extent of international concern about nuclear reprocessing activities at Sellafield. Both Ireland and Denmark had tabled a proposal at that meeting calling for the ending of nuclear reprocessing at Sellafield. This proposal was seen by Ireland and Denmark as an important and crucial element in the implemen<Col N="645" /> tation of the 1998 OSPAR strategy on radioactive substances which commits the OSPAR contracting parties, including the UK, to the virtual elimination of radioactive discharges by the year 2020. The resulting decision adopted by the contracting parties effectively called on the UK and France to review as a matter of priority the implementation of the non-reprocessing option for spent nuclear fuel management. While both the UK and France abstained from voting on the decision, neither country was in any doubt about the pressure from neighbouring countries to end nuclear reprocessing.</P>
    <P>Also in relation to radioactive discharges from Sellafield, my Department sent a detailed submission on 27 September 2000 to the UK Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions in response to that Department's consultation document &ndash; UK Strategy for Radioactive Discharges 2001-2020. The UK consultation document was formulated with a view to showing how the UK will implement the OSPAR Strategy on Radioactive Substances. In its response to the UK consultation document, my Department pointed out that the UK targets for reduction in discharges are not consistent with the &ldquo;close to zero&rdquo; concentrations in the marine environment which the UK, in the OSPAR strategy, committed itself to achieving by the year 2020 and that, furthermore, the UK strategy needed to be revised in the light of the June 2000 OSPAR decision. Ireland will continue to apply the maximum pressure within OSPAR and on the UK to ensure that the objectives of the OSPAR strategy are implemented in full.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that the Irish Government's total opposition to the proposed establishment by BNFL of a MOX fuel fabrication plant at Sellafield continues to be made known to the UK. The NII report of last February about the falsification of safety related data relating to MOX fuel pellets undoubtedly raises serious questions about the safety and viability of this plant. The Irish Government will continue to oppose any start up of this plant.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy of the Government's total commitment to its campaign against the continued operation of Sellafield. The Sellafield plant represents an unacceptable risk to Ireland and the cessation of all activities there remains a priority for the Government.</P>

      <P>As the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I have stated on a number of occasions, the practical policy position is that Ireland has consistently confirmed its intention to participate only in peace support operations authorised by the United Nations. Therefore the question of members of the Defence Forces participating, in the context of the EU Headline Goal, in an overseas peace support operation which has not been authorised by the UN does not arise.</P>
      <P>The elaboration of the EU Headline Goal will facilitate the achievement by 2003 of an EU capacity to conduct the Petersberg Tasks. Ireland's ongoing participation in the development of European security and defence policy is fully consistent with our policy of neutrality and our commitment to international peace and security. The centrality of the UN and the primary role of the UN Security Council in matters of peace and security is explicitly recognised by the EU. Participation in an individual Petersberg mission remains a sovereign decision by the Government in every instance and on a case by case basis and any decision to participate would require Dáil approval in accordance with existing legislation.</P>
      <P>The recent EU Capabilities Commitment Conference provided the opportunity for the EU member states, including Ireland, to indicate formally the resources that they can make available for potential humanitarian or crisis management operations. These contributions were made in the context of the voluntary Headline Goal agreed at the European Council at Helsinki last year. In our interventions at the conference, Ireland reiterated these points and specified that in our case, in compliance with the terms of the relevant Irish legislation, we will participate only in missions authorised by the United Nations.</P>

      <P>My Department received a request from the group concerned in August of this year, seeking 20 acres at the former Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, County Cork. That request was received after the completion of an integrated action area plan <Col N="648" /> which sets out a blueprint for the future development of the barracks lands. The integrated action area plan was  submitted to Cork County Council in April 2000, in the context of an amendment to the Cork County development plan. The integrated plan provides for a wide range of community, amenity and commercial uses for the former barracks, the development of which will be critical in the future overall development of the town of Ballincollig.</P>
      <P>An integral element of the formulation of the integrated plan was a comprehensive public consultation process, whereby all interested parties were invited by the consultants involved to make written and oral submissions in relation to the future development of the Murphy barracks' lands. The group concerned did not make a submission.</P>
      <P>The integrated action area plan is the subject of ongoing discussions between the county council and my Department.</P>
      <P>I expect to be in a position to make decisions on the disposal of this property early in the new year.</P>

      <P>Regular contact with home helps to sustain the high morale of our personnel serving overseas and facilitating communication with home is seen as a priority.</P>
      <P>In the case of personnel serving in Lebanon with UNIFIL, the United Nations provides free postal facilities to Ireland for letters and small parcels. Each person is allowed five aerogrammes home per week. A parcel post service is available from UNIFIL to Ireland through the French post office in Naqoura. An Post charges a concessionary rate for postage of letters, postcards and newspapers from Ireland to UNIFIL. These items are charged at the ordinary foreign surface rate but are sent by air at no extra charge. These arrangements cater for the majority of personnel serving with overseas missions in the Middle East.</P>

    <P>Irish Military personnel are paid an overseas peace support allowance at a rate which ranges from £30.95 per day for the rank of private, up to £42.55 per day for the rank of commandant and upwards.

In the case of armed missions such as UNIFIL, a further allowance of <Col N="649" /> £12.50 per day is paid in addition to the overseas peace support allowance.</P>

      <P>Complaints regarding the operation of my Department's wildlife policy have been received from time to time from individuals and from organisations. The issues raised have been addressed and my Department has also reported on the issue to the Bern convention of the Council of Europe.</P>
      <P>My Department has in the past evaluated various methods for capturing badgers. The method currently used is considered to be the most humane method available. Though commonly referred to as a snare, this is technically incorrect as the device is designed specifically to restrain rather than to choke or squeeze on the target animal. The noose on the device is stopped and so is prevented from pulling tight and injuring the badger.</P>
      <P>All animals captured are subjected to post mortem examination, which includes monitoring for welfare purposes. Evidence from this post mortem data supports the view that the method used does not present a welfare problem for badgers. Field staff are fully trained in the correct application of the restraints used and a quality control system is in place at the production stage of the device. Other methods of capture have been evaluated but none has demonstrated any welfare advantage over the current method. While my Department continues to refine and look for improvement in capture methods and procedures, I am satisfied that the system currently applied represents a humane method of capture of the species.</P>

      <P>The position is that under the Agenda 2000 agreement headage grants in the disadvantaged areas are to move from a payment per animal to a payment per hectare basis. Under transitional arrangements the headage schemes as they have operated up to now will continue to apply for this year. A new area based scheme is to be introduced with effect from next year.</P>
      <P>As provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, PPF, a task force, representative of the Department and the social partner farm organisations, was established to formulate a new scheme. Following lengthy discussions the scheme agreed in July last and since approved by the European Commission provides for area related payments as follows:</P>
      <P>More Severely Handicapped (lowland)</P>
      <P>£70 per hectare up to 45 hectares.</P>
      <P>Less Severely Handicapped (lowland)</P>
      <P>£60 per hectare up to 45 hectares.</P>
      <P>Mountain type land</P>
      <P>£45 per hectare up to 60 hectares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="655" /> Where a farmer farms a combination of land categories he will be paid on lowland, more severely handicapped, first, lowland, less severely handicapped, next and the mountain grazings last.</P>
    <P>If a farmer only has lowland, more severely handicapped, and/or lowland, less severely handicapped, his overall limit is 45 hectares. If he has a combination of lowland, more severely handicapped, and/or lowland, less severely handicapped, and some mountain type land, he will be paid on up to 45 hectares lowland and up to an extra 15 hectares of mountain subject to an overall limit of 60 hectares.</P>
    <P>If a farmer only has mountain type land his overall limit is 60 hectares.</P>
    <P>The Government has already committed some £360 million additional funding for the scheme over the period 2001-06. The new arrangements involve a cost of £180 million in 2001 representing an increase of about £60 million over the current scheme. There are no losers this year since the existing schemes remain in place under the transitional arrangements. It is estimated that the number of farmers qualifying for payment under the new area based scheme will rise from 90,000 currently to 109,000 in 2001. From 2001, some 81,000 farmers stand to gain about £66 million annually while 28,000 farmers will incur some losses. I have however negotiated a compensation package for losers under which 90% of losses will be made good in 2001, 80% in 2002 and 50% in <Col N="656" /> 2003. Under these arrangements the average loss in 2001 will be about £32 rising to £64 in 2002.</P>
    <P>I have asked my officials to carry out a review of the scheme to find an equitable long-term solution to the problem of reduced payments. As I indicated earlier, the average loss in 2001 for those farmers who stand to lose will be about £32. My immediate priority therefore is to concentrate on putting arrangements in place for delivery of the new area based system in 2001. I am anxious, however, to find an equitable solution to this issue and I would hope that a review can be carried out during the early part of next year.</P>

      <P>Earlier this year an independent group was appointed by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to establish, <i>inter alia</i>, why there is such a large differential between the producer price and the prevailing consumer price. The group, which reported in September 2000, found that concerns about price gaps between the pro<Col N="659" /> ducer and consumer were based on simple comparisons between the level and movement of farm-gate prices and retail prices. Such comparisons were inadequate because they did not take full account of the weight losses involved in converting the live animal into saleable beef and they totally ignored cost developments in the post farm-gate sectors of the food chain which account for half the value of the total chain. The independent group concluded that, when these issues were properly considered, the changes in retail prices were fully explained by the combined movement in farm-gate prices and post farm-gate costs.</P>

      <Quest>the procedures followed when an animal is diagnosed with a disease such as tuberculosis, brucellosis or BSE; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Bovine animals which react positively to either a TB or brucellosis test must, by law, be removed to an approved export premises for slaughter. The EU Directive 64/433 which legislates for intra-Community trade in fresh meat, requires that all such animals are given a detailed veterinary examination and in this regard my Department maintains a permanent veterinary presence at all export slaughter premises. However, due to the high frequency of testing only some of these animals will have developed clinical disease and a proportion will in fact be false positives to the tuberculin test. Each of the reactors is subject to a full ante and post mortem inspection, the results of which determine eligibility for entry into the food chain.</P>
      <P>Where animals are either suspected of being affected by, or have been confirmed as cases of BSE the suspect herds are visited by both a veterinary inspector from the local district veterinary office, and a veterinary research officer from the Veterinary Research Laboratory.</P>
      <P>The suspect animal is euthanased, a sample of the brain tissue is sent for testing, the entire carcase of BSE suspect animals are frozen and retained by this Department, pending their ultimate destruction. The herd in question is immediately placed under official restriction and quarantined.</P>
      <P>An inventory of the herd and an initial epidemiological investigation is carried out. The course of the disease is monitored for a short while, following which, where BSE is not ruled out, suspects are slaughtered and the brains taken to the central Veterinary Research Laboratory for examination using both standard histology and immunocyto chemistry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If BSE is confirmed, the entire herds are depopulated and compensation for all the ani<Col N="660" /> mals is paid to the farmer by the State at the full market value of the animals. The slaughter of the animals being depopulated and destroyed is carried out in a special non-export meat factory. The carcases are then rendered into meat and bone meal at one specific rendering plant. The collection, transport, slaughter and destruction of the animals takes place under the direct control of the district veterinary office. The meat and bone meal and the tallow are excluded from the human food and animal feed chains, and are stored in secured premises supervised by the Department pending incineration. Brain sections of all the adult animals in the herds being depopulated are extracted from the animals being slaughtered and sent to the laboratory for testing for BSE. The brains are examined by histopathology and immunocyto chemistry.</P>
    <P>A full epidemiological examination of the BSE case takes place, including an examination of farm records and a search of the farm to determine if any evidence of potential exposure to meat and bonemeal can be found. The affected farm is disinfected with an approved disinfectant &ndash; 20,000 PPM of available chlorine &ndash; and left vacant for more than 30 days.</P>
    <P>In all cases, the progeny of the affected animal and the birth cohorts of the affected animal are traced, purchased at market value, slaughtered, destroyed and rendered in the same manner as depopulated herds.</P>

      <P>A range of measures to deal with the eradication of TB, brucellosis and BSE is in place on both sides of the Border. For many years there has been close liaison between the relevant Departments on animal health matters. In the context of the North-South Ministerial Council, it has been agreed that there would be merit in enhancing and putting this liaison on a more formal and structural footing. At the meeting of the council on 17 November last, agreement was reached on the structures to be put in place to implement this. Specifically, it was agreed to establish a strategic steering group to replace the existing arrangements, co-ordinate animal health policy on the island and make regular reports to the NSMC on co-operation on animal health matters together with recommendations for policy and-or operational decisions; to establish policy working groups which will consider policy issues on animal health which apply to the whole island. Initially, working groups will be created to explore eight different areas and the groups will be stood down or new ones formed, as <Col N="661" /> required; to continue co-operation on operational aspects of schemes; and to progress further joint collaboration on animal health research and development.</P>
      <P>The council also requested that the strategic steering group prepare an initial report on animal health on the island of Ireland for the North-South Ministerial Council meeting in its agricultural sectoral format with a view to development, by March 2002, of joint strategies for the improvement of animal health on both sides of the Border.</P>
      <P>As a result of a decision taken by the European Community arising from the incidence of BSE in the United Kingdom, a total ban on the import of live animals from Great Britain and Northern Ireland was imposed on 1 March 1990.</P>

      <P>My Department, which is the competent authority for the organic sector under EU regulation, has the function of setting national standards for organic produce. <Col N="663" /> The three private organic farming bodies, which have held approval to inspect the organic crop sector on behalf of my Department, proposed an &ldquo;agreed common standard&rdquo;. My Department indicated that it intended to set national standards in line with the framework set down in the EU regulations. Initially there was some confusion about how those standards would apply in practice. The three private organic farming bodies outlined a number of main points to me on which, in their view, their agreed standard differed from the EU Regulations. I have been able to give them assurances about a number of these and the others &ndash; animal housing, poultry numbers and withdrawal periods &ndash; are to be considered by a sub-group of the Organic Development Committee established following the AgriFood 2010 report. Interested parties will be able to make submissions to the sub-group which in turn will make a report to the main committee.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that the national standard will provide every reassurance to retailers and consumers as to the quality and integrity of Irish organic produce, without compromising the competitiveness of Irish organic producers. My objective is to ensure the continuing growth of the organic sector as part of mainstream farming in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The matter referred to falls in the first place within the remit of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. However, measures to preserve such sites <Col N="665" /> receive major support through the rural environment protection scheme. REPS is a critical element in the integration of environmental and agricultural policy in Ireland. It is concerned with the establishment of farming practices and controlled production methods that reflect the need for conservation, landscape protection and wider environmental problems. Participation in the scheme involves specific undertakings in relation to protecting wildlife habitats and endangered species of flora and fauna. At the end of the first REPS programming period, 1994-99, there were more than 45,000 participants, farming over 1.6 million hectares. A second and broadly similar scheme introduced on 27 November, which will run to the end of 2006, is expected to see the number of participants grow to 70,000.</P>
      <P>Measure 2, 4 and 5 address issues relating to habitat, wildlife and landscape protection. They include the implementation of a grassland management plan for sensitive areas aimed at reducing poaching, overgrazing and soil erosion to protect habitats and grassland flora; the protection of distinct areas of natural and semi-natural wildlife habitats; and the management and maintenance of field walls, hedgerows and boundaries for the benefit of inhabiting wildlife. Measure A of REPS, known as Supplementary Measure A under the 1994-99 scheme, lays down mandatory additional conditions for participants with lands in target areas, namely natural heritage areas, special areas of conservation, special protection areas and commonages.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to research by the UK Pesticide Action Network which has found that 520 species of insects and mites, 50 plant diseases and 113 weeds have become resistant to the pesticides meant to control these; and if, like the farmers in the Falkland Islands he will put in place a strategy to make Ireland a wholly organic producer.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of research by the UK pesticide action network in this matter.</P>
      <P>All organisms are characterised by variation in type resulting in different strains being present in any given population. This variation is natural and is influenced by and responds to environmental impacts such as climate, soil type, host pathogen relationship, competition and stress. It leads to a continuous evolution in the strains occurring in populations. The variation in insect, mite, plant disease and weed populations is influenced and altered by changing agricultural systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Resistance to pesticides is a naturally occurring, inheritable adjustment in the ability of individuals in a population to survive a treatment that would normally give effective control. The degree <Col N="666" /> and rapidity of the development of resistance varies, depending on whether the pesticide acts at a single-gene or multi-gene site in the pathogen. Loss in level of performance of a pesticide is usually gradual for pathogens with multi-gene resistance, while loss of performance for those pathogens with single-gene resistance may be more rapid.</P>
    <P>The use of single pesticides to control pathogens in agriculture, in human health programmes, and for industrial purposes, has accelerated the pace of change by selecting minority strains within populations and favouring their propagation, since competition is lacking. This has led to the development of resistance in certain pathogens. In recent years, the regulatory authorities have become more acutely aware of the risks associated with the repeated use on pest populations, over an extended time, of individual pesticides that have a simple mode of action. Through ensuring use of pesticides with different modes of action and though restricting the rates and frequency of application, the selection and propagation of minority strains can be reduced or eliminated.</P>
    <P>I have established an organic development committee, on foot of a recommendation by the Agri-Food 2010 committee, to draw up a coherent strategy for the development of the organic sector. I have asked the committee to make its recommendation to me by April 2001.</P>

      <P>My Department has in the past evaluated various methods for capturing badgers. The method currently used is the most humane method available. Though commonly referred to as a snare, this is technically incorrect as the device is designed specifically to restrain rather than to choke or squeeze on the target animal. The noose on the device is stopped and so is prevented from pulling tight and injuring the badger.</P>
      <P>All animals captured are subjected to post mortem examination which includes monitoring for welfare purposes. Evidence from post mortem data supports the view that the method used does not present a welfare problem for badgers. Field staff are fully trained in the correct application of the restraints used and a quality control system is in place at the production stage of the device. Other methods of capture have been evaluated but none has demonstrated any welfare advantage over the current method. While my Department will continue to refine and look for improvement in the capture method and procedures, I am satisfied that the system currently applied represents a humane method of capture of the species.</P>

      <P>The recent decision by the Egyptian authorities to suspend the issue of import licences to western European countries, including Ireland, was taken to allow them take account of the BSE developments within the EU and to assess the measures and decisions being taken to deal with the situation. The developments to which I refer relate to the situation in certain other member states and not to Ireland's situation.</P>
      <P>Given that Egypt is our largest market world-wide for Irish beef, the Government takes very seriously any situation which would jeopardise that market and has taken immediate action to deal with the difficulty that has arisen. To begin with, our ambassador in Cairo has been in contact with the Egyptian authorities and has outlined the facts of our situation in relation to BSE in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I spoke with the Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister and Agriculture Minister, Dr. Wali, last week and impressed upon him the importance of the market to Ireland, the quality and safety controls in place in Ireland and the guarantees which can be given to consumers of Irish beef.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach raised this issue by telephone with President Mubarak on Friday last and briefed him on the full facts about Irish beef exports and requested him to avoid taking definitive action which may damage this trade.</P>
      <P>Senior officials of the Department are currently in Egypt for meetings with high ranking Egyptian officials, and they have outlined in detail the level of BSE controls in place in Ireland. Their message to the Egyptians is that the controls offer the maximum possible assurances of safety to consumers of Irish beef. I am travelling to Cairo to meet with the Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister to bring him fully up to date on the situation and to further elaborate on Ireland's extensive controls. He will also brief the Egyptian authorities on the latest developments at EU level.</P>
      <P>It is the case that recent developments have caused serious problems within the market and these can only be dealt with by emergency measures taken at EU level which were covered in the agreement reached at the Council of Ministers yesterday.</P>

      <P>There has hitherto been no ban on feeding meat and bone meal, MBM, to non-ruminant animals, nor has there been any scientific evidence put forward, by, for example, the EU's scientific steering committee or the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, to suggest that the practice of feeding MBM to such animals constitutes a risk to public health. The feeding of MBM to ruminant animals, on the other hand, has been banned for some time. Ireland banned the feeding of MBM to ruminants as long ago as 1990, and in 1996 strengthened controls in this area to ensure that any risk of cross-contamination between non-ruminant and ruminant feedstuffs was effectively addressed. It has also been the case that the purchase and use of MBM for feeding to non-ruminant animals were permissible only under licence from the Department. Ireland's controls in this area have <Col N="673" /> been independently assessed on a number of occasions, including by the EU's food and veterinary office, over recent years and have been found to be rigorous.</P>
      <P>At the special meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers on 4 December 2000, it was, <i>inter alia</i>, decided to extend the ban on the use of MBM in feed for cattle and sheep to all animal feed on a temporary basis. This decision reflected concern within the EU that certain member states, other than Ireland, had yet to put in place controls of sufficient rigour to effectively address the risk of cross-contamination as between ruminant and non-ruminant feedstuffs.</P>
      <P>Pursuant to the decision by Council it will no longer be permissible to have and use MBM for feeding to non-ruminants. My Department will be in contact with those concerned and will be urgently addressing the disposal issue which obviously arises on foot of the decision.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the market development and promotion of Irish food and drink products on domestic and international markets rests with the statutory food promotion agency, Bord Bia. Working in partnership with my Department and the food industry, Bord Bia implements a range of programmes and activities tailored to enable Irish food products exploit new market opportunities and increase market share in existing markets. A measure of the success of the board's activities is the fact that in 1999 exports of food and drink products grew to £5.2 billion, with output exceeding the £10 billion mark.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding this success, as the pace of change in this increasingly competitive and consumer driven environment accelerates, Irish suppliers continue to face huge competitive challenges in areas of scale, innovation, product range and marketing capability. To meet these challenges, Bord Bia has undertaken a number of specific promotions to boost sales of Irish food products on international markets. These include a range of programmes targeted at retail development, food service and speciality foods in the UK and European markets. These programmes have been designed to identify new supply opportunities and increase the awareness and credibility of Ireland as a supplier to the retail sector.</P>
      <P>Bord Bia is actively engaged in the market promotion and development of Irish beef, lamb and pigmeat on export markets. In Britain the new Irish beef mark has been carried on retail packs to promote and highlight the quality attributes of Irish beef. This year an intensive market development programme for Irish lamb was undertaken, focusing particularly on the domestic, French and Mediterranean markets. In the pigmeat market the focus has been on targeting key customers and new accounts in Germany, France and Italy. Future target markets for pigmeat are Japan, the Philippines and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Also in 2000 Bord Bia participated in 15 trade fairs. Participation in these trade fairs is geared towards enhancing the image of Ireland &ndash; The Food Island &ndash; and increasing awareness of Ireland as a quality food supplier. An international markets retail programme is also in operation to assist Irish food companies to exploit the potential for Irish ethnic food in the US and Canada.</P>

      <P>The pig industry is in a reasonably satisfactory state at present. While producer prices are lower than in some other EU countries they are about 27% higher than the poor levels experienced a year ago. Producers are obtaining good levels of efficiency. The industry as a whole, however, is at a crossroads and has to face emerging challenges, many of which have been identified in the Agri Food 2010 report. These include meeting international best practice in terms of processing scale, structure and capacity utilisation, meeting the demands of the catering and retail sectors, maintenance of export markets in the context of growing international competitiveness, food safety, product innovation and an increase in value added. Environmental and animal health considerations will also have important consequences for the industry in the future.</P>
      <P>A study of the pig industry on the island of Ireland was commissioned jointly with the Northern Ireland authorities. I expect the final report of this study will be available in the next couple of weeks.

      <P>Bord Bia, which has responsibility for the promotion and marketing of lamb, will continue to seek new markets and will endeavour to maximise returns from existing markets for lamb during 2001. About 65% of Irish lamb is exported with a large portion of this going to the French market. The balance is accounted for by the Mediterranean markets, Spain and Portugal, Germany, Belgium and the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In France this year Bord Bia has been carrying out promotional campaigns identifying Irish lamb. These campaigns are targeted at regional level for maximum effect. Currently Bord Bia is <Col N="676" /> in discussions with Interbev and MLC regarding the possibility of an EU-wide joint generic lamb promotional campaign aimed at younger consumers who tend not to eat lamb. In addition to these promotional activities Bord Bia will engage in trade liaison, trade marketing and in-store promotions with retailers of Irish lamb.</P>
    <P>The market for light Irish lamb on the Mediterranean markets in 2000 was mixed. The situation is likely to continue in 2001, which means that the main focus of Bord Bia's activities will be to maintain existing trade relations and, where possible, to build new ones. Development of the market for lamb cuts to the German market is a priority for 2001. The number of plants cutting lamb continues to increase and this is leading to increased volumes available for export. Bord Bia will be supporting and assisting the development of this trade. The Belgian market is important for early lamb and trade development activities there will concentrate on this aspect of the market.</P>
    <P>In addition, following the recommendation of the sheepmeat forum, Bord Bia's quality assurance board is working on the development of a lamb quality assurance scheme. The introduction of such a scheme would confer great benefit on the lamb trade and would help to enhance the image and product profile of Irish lamb on export markets.</P>

      <P>I am always concerned to ensure that Irish beef exporters have unrestricted access to worldwide markets for their product. In 1999 some 641,000 tonnes, carcass weight equivalent, of Irish beef were exported and this represented an increase of over 26% on the 1998 level of exports and of over 35% on the 1997 level.</P>
      <P>In the light of the current BSE difficulty, I am particularly concerned to ensure that this level of access to markets is maintained. In that regard, both I and officials of my Department are in contact with those markets which have expressed concern about the safety of European beef to assure them that the levels of BSE controls in place in Ireland offer the maximum possible guarantees to consumers of Irish beef.</P>

      <P>The position is that since 1 January 2000, over £708 million has been paid to farmers under the various headage and premium schemes, of which in excess of £402 million relates to payments under the 2000 schemes. The payment targets set out in the protocol on direct payments to farmers are quite specific with regard to the premium schemes and payments under these schemes commenced on the specified dates.  For example, 60% advance payments under the 2000 suckler cow premium, the 2000 special beef premium and the new slaughter premium schemes were due to commence on 16 October 2000 and 186,000 payments valued at over £104 million issued to farmers under these schemes, including the national envelope, on that date. The present position is that 93% of January to August 2000 special beef premium applicants have been paid some £65 million. With regard to the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme, over 86% of all applicants have been paid almost £80 million. To date, 84% of new slaughter premium applicants have been paid some £12 million and an additional £2.3 million has been paid to those applicants who qualified under the national envelope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the ewe premium scheme, the protocol specifies that payment of each instalment will commence within seven days of publication of the regulation setting out the rate of payment and all eligible applicants will be paid within two weeks. Payment of the first instalment commenced on 23 June 2000 following publication of the relevant EU regulation on 20 June 2000 and 94% of all applicants were paid within two weeks. Payment of the second instalment <Col N="678" /> commenced on 23 October 2000 &ndash; the earliest possible date under EU regulations &ndash; and on that day 97% of all applicants were paid almost £18 million.</P>
    <P>There were no targets set in the protocol in respect of the disadvantaged areas headage schemes pending agreement on a new area based scheme.  Nevertheless, payments under the sheep headage scheme commenced on 8 September, almost three weeks earlier than the commencement date in 1999 and 90% of applicants have been paid some £18 million. Payments under the cattle headage-beef cow scheme also commenced earlier than in 1999 and so far, over £81 million has been paid to 88% of all cattle headage-beef cow applicants.</P>
    <P>Payments under the 2000 arable aid scheme commenced on 16 November in line with Agenda 2000 arrangements, EU regulations and protocol commitments. On that day, almost £85 million was paid to 96% of all applicants under this scheme. To date, over £89 million has been paid to 98% of applicants.</P>
    <P>Overall, the level of payments achieved to date displays my commitment to the early delivery of payments to farmers and is in line with the targets agreed with the farming bodies in the protocol on direct payments under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

      <P>I believe that the prospects for deer farmers are particularly favourable at the moment and I am pleased to see that both demand and prices for venison have shown great improvement this year. The Venison Industry Board, which received funding from the Interreg programme, is now actively involved in the marketing of venison and I expect this to put the market on a sound basis for expansion. Additional slaughtering facilities for deer were approved by my Department this year and exports in 2001 are expected to be maintained at current levels.</P>
      <P>Deer are included under the area based compensatory allowance scheme which will be in operation next year and further assistance for the housing and handling of deer will be available under the regional operational programmes. Funding will also be available under the REP scheme. Participation by deer farmers in the organic REP scheme would also meet the need for the production of a quality assured product which is so important to today's consumer and can command a premium price.</P>

      <P>An estimated 5,500 deer were processed in Ireland during 2000. Of the total, around 4,000 were red deer while 1,500 were fallow. All fallow venison produced was exported while around 90% per cent of red deer was for export. Total exports of venison in 2000 are estimated at around 200 tonnes valued at almost £800,000. The main markets for Irish venison during 2000 were the UK, France, Germany and the United States.</P>
      <P>Exports of venison in 2001 are expected to be maintained at similar levels to this year but I am hopeful that the increased confidence in the industry will be reflected in increased exports next year.</P>

      <P>The report of the Agri Food 2010 committee proposes a strategy for the development of the Irish agriculture and food industry over the next decade. As regards poultry the report identifies lack of scale as a key weakness and suggests a reduction in the number of approved poultrymeat plants from 23 to about seven, and a reduction in capacity of at least 20%, to achieve an optimum industry structure. While the report also recognises that such extreme rationalisation is unlikely, nevertheless it illustrates how far our current structures are from the optimum and therefore the clear need for significant change. The report also highlights the need for a more consumer-oriented approach by increasing the range of value-added and quality differentiated and niche products if further market share is not to be lost. It must be emphasised that the report stresses that it is the responsibility of the industry itself to set in train the rationalisation that is necessary for its future survival.</P>
      <P>The plan of action setting out the Government's response to the 2010 report indicates that financial assistance will be available under the national development plan through Enterprise Ireland for investment projects which address issues of competitiveness, product development, scale and processing efficiency.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 189 and 190 together.</P>
      <P>The recent flooding caused localised hardship to many people in both urban and rural areas. My Department's regional inspectors have reported that while many crops suffered from flooding, it is unlikely that lasting damage was done. The harvesting of root crops and the sowing of winter cereals have suffered significant disruption. As it would not have been appropriate to single out any particular section of the community for special attention, the Government initiated an <i>ex-gratia</i> scheme of humanitarian assistance to relieve cases of severe hardship. The Irish Red Cross Society is implementing this scheme, details of which have been published in the national newspapers. The scheme will alleviate the most serious effects of the widespread flooding and has been drawn up following reports from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>Following severe flooding in 1994-95 the Government assigned responsibility to the Office of Public Works to devise and implement flood relief measures. Priority areas were identified. I understand that a number of schemes have now been completed while work is ongoing on a number of others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>From the outset of the current crisis, I have impressed on my colleagues in the Council the need to tackle the BSE issue on the basis of a community-wide approach which would put effective control measures in place in order to protect human and animal <Col N="681" /> health and restore consumer confidence in beef. I have also impressed on the Council the need for appropriate market measures in order to alleviate the impact of the crisis on beef producers. I am satisfied that the conclusions agreed by the Council at its meeting yesterday meet all of these objectives. These conclusions include: the extension of the ban on the use of meat and bone meal in feed for cattle and sheep to all animal feed on a temporary basis; agreement on a framework for the lifting of national measures by certain member states; agreement on the Commission decision for a rapid BSE detection test for bovine animals over 30 months; the need for union funds for financing test; animals over 30 months can go into the food chain only if tested; the Council noted the proposal to carry out purchases for the destruction of livestock aged over 30 months in order to provide an alternative outlet for such animals; the compensation payment to producers for such animals would take account of the different types of animals and markets. The measure will attract 70% financing from the Union; the Council also decided that it is essential to introduce intervention; the details will be decided at the beef management committee on 12 December; the Council took the view that beef producers are likely to be adversely affected by the market situation and called on the Commission to report on the situation and make proposals to the Council, the Commission undertook to act on these as a matter of urgency; the Council called on the Commission to examine the question of alternative proteins for farm animals and to bring forward any appropriate proposals.</P>
      <P>I believe that it was essential that this particular Council reached a successful conclusion and that the full range of issues which had arisen from the most recent BSE crisis were adequately addressed. This agreement provides an improved framework for protecting human and animal health. I am planning for the introduction of an expanded testing regime at the earliest possible date. The resultant restoration of consumer confidence is the critical first step in achieving market balance. The Irish beef sector has suffered disproportionately in the current crisis and I have brought this to the attention of my colleagues. The sector stood to gain most from a restoration of confidence, especially in high volume markets.</P>
      <P>I am particularly concerned to have adequate market support and I am confident that I have secured agreement for an effective and meaningful intervention arrangement which could provide the basis for a resumption of orderly marketing. The commitment by the Commission to look at the consequences of this current crisis for producers was also important from an Irish perspective.</P>
      <P>I believe that the agreement was also essential in reassuring our vital third country markets. I will be visiting Egypt immediately to secure the restoration of this market for Irish beef.</P>

At the time I undertook to bring the views of the Irish Legislature to the attention of the fund and to monitor the development of the trend referred to above.</P>
      <P>The proceedings of this House, in relation to our ESAF contribution, were brought to the attention of the fund through our executive director and I am pleased to say that a new poverty-focused approach by both the IMF and the World Bank was adopted at the annual meetings in the autumn of 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This approach requires the preparation of a poverty reduction strategy paper, by the Government of the country concerned. The PRSP is <Col N="685" /> intended to incorporate an agreed anti-poverty strategy, adopted in a participatory process involving civil society and the development partners. It should thus foster ownership of the programme on the part of the developing countries. The resultant PRGF-supported programme should therefore be consistent with a comprehensive framework for macro-economic, structural and social policies to foster growth and reduce poverty.</P>
    <P>While it still remains to be seen how successful this approach proves in practice, it represents a significant step for the fund which has now explicitly acknowledged that &ldquo;social and sectoral programmes aimed at poverty reduction will be taken fully into account in the design of economic policies for promoting faster sustainable growth.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>While not claiming that this was as a result of Irish pressure alone, we did add our voice to the emerging criticisms of ESAF and calls for its reform. It has been restructured into the poverty reduction growth facility, and is more poverty oriented in that it takes more account of the concerns of the programme countries.</P>

A farming couple is entitled to avail of the increased standard rate band if both spouses are in receipt of income from the farm, for example, a partnership arrangement, or where both are employees of a company which owns the farm, or where one spouse is employed by the other spouse and is paid a salary which falls to be deducted in the normal way, as a genuine expense of the business.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to the PAYE allowance is governed by section 472 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.  The PAYE allowance, currently £1,000 at the standard rate, is available to ordinary employees. It is not available to the self-employed &ndash; a category which includes most farmers &ndash; proprietary directors, or the spouses of those two groups when employed in the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1994 Finance Act extended the PAYE allowance to children of the self-employed, <Col N="686" /> including farmers, and of proprietary directors who are genuinely employed in their parent's business. The conditions determining such genuine employment, which are set out in section 472, include a requirement that the person be required to devote substantially the whole of the their time to the employment throughout the relevant tax year, and also that the amount paid in respect of the employment should be not less than £3,600 per year.</P>

      <P>I am advised that the current list of tax exempted charitable bodies, published by the Revenue Commissioners at the end of September 2000, contains all but one tax exempted charity as of that date. The omission from the list of the charity in question arose following an objection to publication it lodged with the information commissioner in 1999 and which objection was upheld by him. The particular reason on which the objection was based no longer obtains and the body in question is not maintaining its objection to publication. Consequently, it will appear in the next update of the list of tax exempted charitable bodies at the end of December 2000.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have also informed me that the list of tax exempted charitable bodies is updated on a quarterly basis to take account of both newly exempted bodies and of bodies which notify Revenue that they have ceased activities. Copies of the list are available in diskette format from the charities section of the Revenue Commissioners and the list can also be accessed on the Revenue website at www. revenue.ie.

      <P>Former civil servants are an important source of recruits to the Civil Service. Their experience since leaving the Civil Service, including, for example, further education, vocational training or other employment, enriches the contribution which they can make on resuming work in the Civil Service. In this context I am anxious to encourage former civil servants to consider returning to the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>Former civil servants may rejoin the Civil Service by entering, and being successful at, the normal recruitment competitions run by the Civil Service Commission. These competitions are normally open to all appropriately qualified citizens. However, in recent years, the Civil Service Commission held clerical officer competitions confined to former civil servants. The competitions met with a satisfactory response from former civil servants, and it is intended to hold further such competitions confined to former civil servants, covering the executive officer grade as well as the clerical officer grade. I hope that these special competitions, along with the normal open recruitment competitions run by the Civil Service Commission, will offer former civil servants ample opportunity to return to the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the decision to exclude serving officers in the Revenue mobile service from the 1998 competition was made shortly after the issue of circular E.5490 in August 1998 &ndash; considerably earlier than 23 March 2000. As the Deputy was previously advised, it was decided exceptionally not to allow serving officers in the Revenue mobile service to take part in the 1998 competition. To have allowed these officers to take part in the competition would have had the effect of recycling vacancies between the various operational units in the Customs enforcement division and would not have been an effective use of resources.</P>
      <P>The day-to-day management of their office is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. The commissioners have assured me that the decision to exclude serving officers in the Revenue mobile service from the 1998 competition did not adversely affect the quality of the service.</P>
      <P>The commissioners have no plans at present to increase the number of staff in the Revenue mobile service. However, the deployment of staff within Revenue is kept under regular review and, if it were decided to increase the number of staff involved in the Revenue mobile service, staff would be assigned in the normal way from competition panels.</P>

      <P>The Labour Court, as part of the nurses' strike settlement, recommended the filling of 2,500 senior staff nurse posts. For the first filling of these posts, it was agreed that a nurse with 23 years post-registration service would qualify for appointment as a senior staff nurse. It is estimated that some 3,200 posts have been or are in the process of being filled.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the Health Service Employers Agency that some delay in processing appointments has occurred within the Eastern Regional Health Authority. However, both unions and management locally have worked closely to overcome difficulties and it is now expected that payment, including arrears, will be made on 21 December 2000.</P>

I have had inquiries made of the Eastern Regional Health <Col N="696" /> Authority concerning this matter. It has informed me that at present, Mater Hospital public patients are transferred to St. Luke's Hospital for radiotherapy. Public patients who require urgent radiotherapy are referred to the Mater Private Hospital for diagnosis and treatment. The cost of this service is met by the Mater Hospital.</P>
      <P>In the interest of delivering an integrated service to public patients, I understand that a proposal is presently being considered by the Mater Hospital, whereby the hospital would purchase radiotherapy services from the Mater Private Hospital, thus eliminating the need to transfer public patients to St. Luke's Hospital.</P>

      <P>The World Health Organisation's co-ordinator of its occupational and environmental health unit has publicly stated that all the information it has to date shows no adverse health effects from the use of mobile phones. Health conditions which have been ascribed to the use of mobile phones include some types of cancer and changes in brain activity. No studies of humans have as yet supported these claims. A large epidemiology study is being co-ordinated in ten countries by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is a specialised agency of the WHO, to identify if there are links between use of mobile phones and head and neck cancers. This study is anticipated to be completed in 2003.</P>
      <P>With regard to mobile phone masts the WHO established the international electromagnetic fields &ndash; EMF &ndash; project to assess the scientific evidence of possible health effects of EMF. The WHO has publicly stated that no study has shown adverse health effects at exposure levels from masts below the international guideline limits recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection.</P>
      <P>While the exposure levels to a user from mobile handsets are considerably larger than from masts they are still below the international guidelines.</P>
      <P>The monitoring of the levels of emissions from mobile phone masts is a function of the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. That office publishes an audit report on licensed operators each year. The audit is carried out by Enterprise Ireland for the office. The most recent report published in February 2000 focuses on compliance with the general public exposure limits specified by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection in 1998. The report shows that all the companies audited have procedures and arrangements in place to ensure compliance with the general public exposure limits.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 234 to 236, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The expert group report on various health professions recommended the creation of a clinical specialist post for the therapy grades, which includes speech and language therapists. The creation of this post would allow for a new grade of clinical specialist and for career progression for those who do not want to move into management. It would also ensure that clinical expertise is not lost to the professions. Under the auspices of the expert group, a number of such posts have been identified in speech and language therapy. However, as the speech and language therapists have withdrawn from the process, my Department is not in a position to allocate these posts at the moment.</P>
      <P>The expert group report also recommended the establishment of a therapy assistant grade. Talks in relation to this issue are in progress with IMPACT and it is hoped to establish a formal training scheme for therapy assistants as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Pay for therapists is a matter which was dealt with by the expert group report on various health professions. This report was published in April 2000, was accepted by the Government and is in the process of being implemented by my Department. I do not have the pay scales for speech and language therapists in other countries available to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that entitlement to a medical card under the Health Act, 1970 is based on hardship rather than on any specification that a particular number of the population should have a card. The decrease in the percentage of persons with a card is a reflection of a general improvement in the economy in recent years.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the health board chief executive officers are undertaking a review of the medical card scheme in keeping with a commitment made under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.  Particular emphasis will be placed on the needs of families with children, and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I recently announced a £25 million investment package which is aimed at alleviating anticipated critical service pressures and maintaining services for patients, particularly in acute hospitals, over the winter period. The investment package is being targeted at a number of key areas, including the contracting of private nursing home beds, the provision of aids and supports for use by older people and the appointment of additional accident and emergency consultants and consultant anaesthetists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the step-down beds, I have asked the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the <Col N="705" /> health boards to ensure that appropriate monitoring mechanisms are put in place to ensure that the beds contracted are occupied only by those who otherwise might seek admittance to, or are being inappropriately maintained in, an acute hospital setting. I have also asked the ERHA and the health boards to designate a person at senior management level to assume lead responsibility for the monitoring of these arrangements.</P>
    <P>The issue of providing a step-down bed within a reasonable distance from the patient's home is a matter for each agency. However, I would expect that reasonable account would be taken of the circumstances of each individual patient in the provision of step-down beds and taking account of the local availability of such beds.</P>

      <P>Clinical trials have been carried out over the years on patients in psychiatric institutions in this country.</P>
      <P>Up to 1987, a voluntary scheme of control over the conduct of clinical trials operated whereby these trials required the approval of the National Drugs Advisory Board and also the approval of an ethics committee in the hospital or institution in which the trials were carried out.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of the Control of Clinical Trials Acts, 1987 and 1990, the Irish Medicines Board is required to give approval for clinical trials including those conducted in psychiatric hospitals. The supporting data, protocols, patient information leaflets and consent forms associated with these trials would all have been assessed by the internal staff of the IMB and considered by the relevant advisory committees prior to approval. These trials would have been conducted under the supervision of consultants and would have had approval by the relevant local ethics committee prior to commencement.</P>
      <P>Drug research is essential for the rejection of ineffective or toxic drugs and the confirmation by ongoing assessment of the effectiveness and safety of existing therapeutic drugs. There is a regulatory requirement in almost all countries, including Ireland, that such trials be conducted before an application for a marketing authorisation would be considered. In the pre-marketing phase this process of development is a lengthy one involving various stages of investigation ranging from chemical development to experimentation on animals and finally to testing on humans. The tests on humans are extensive and include those carried out on healthy volunteers, on patients suffering from the condition for which the substance or preparation is intended to treat and on patients suffering from certain complications which could affect the behaviour of the drug under trial in the body.</P>
      <P>The question of the involvement of humans in clinical trials has received much attention over the years and has prompted several examinations, at both national and international level, of the controls applicable to such trials. At international level, in 1964 the World Medical Assembly adopted the Declaration of Helsinki which contains recommendations guiding physicians in biomedical research involving human subjects. This declaration has been revised on two occasions since, in 1975 and 1983, and compliance with it is a prerequisite for approval of clinical trials by most drug regulatory agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1987, the Control of Clinical Trials Act, 1987, replaced the voluntary arrangement for the clearance of submissions for trials through the then National Drugs Advisory Board. The Act introduced strict regulatory controls on the conducting of clinical trials in Ireland, under which a person proposing to conduct a clinical trial must first seek and be granted the permission of the Irish Medicines Board before undertaking the trial. In addition to such permission, the approval <Col N="710" /> of an appropriate ethics committee must also be obtained. The Act also provides a range of protections for persons participating as volunteers in clinical trials and includes the requirement for adequate informed consent as set out under section 9 of the Act.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was scheduled to take the driving test on 20 April 2000 at 3.15 p.m. in the Kilkenny driving test centre. Regrettably, traffic conditions and road works in the area of the test centre on that day resulted in a loss of time to the schedule such that the person's test could not be carried out. Tests were scheduled in the test centre at 45 minute intervals. The driver tester completed the scheduled 2.30 p.m. test at approximately 3.40 p.m. and conducted his next test at 4 p.m. I understand that the driver tester explained the reasons for not conducting the test to the candidate and that a further early test in either Tralee or Kilkenny was offered.</P>
      <P>The candidate accepted the offer of a test in Kilkenny on 20 May 2000. The person concerned does not appear to have been in communication with my Department following this latter test, which was passed. Some recompense for expenses can be considered by my Department in circumstances where a test is not conducted without fault of the applicant, provided the applicant submits a request.</P>

      <P>The compensation code for compulsory purchase of land, including land required for road development, provides for the payment of com<Col N="712" /> pensation by local authorities for lands acquired by them on the authorisation of a duly confirmed CPO. The amount of compensation payable is a matter for negotiation between the landowner and the local authority concerned or, in the event of a dispute, for arbitration. The basic rule applied by the property arbitrator under the relevant legislation is the market value of the land. There is also provision for compensation for disturbance, severance and &ldquo;injurious&rdquo; affection.</P>
      <P>I accept that in principle it is desirable for statutory procedures, including land acquisition, to be completed as quickly as possible. In this regard, the Planning and Development Act, 2000, tightens the time limits for dealing with CPOs which should lead to earlier completion of procedures in this area. I am also aware that issues regarding acquisition of agricultural land for major road and motorway construction have been raised by the Irish Farmers Association with the NRA and that dialogue between these parties is continuing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 13 of the Roads Act, 1993, road authorities are responsible for the maintenance and construction of public roads and may provide any amenity, structure or thing for the safety of road users. Under section 17 of the Roads Act, 1993, the National Roads Authority has a duty to secure the provision of a safe and efficient network of national roads and, for that purpose, it has overall responsibility for the planning and supervision of works for the construction and maintenance of national roads.</P>
      <P>An Garda Síochána is primarily responsible for the enforcement of road safety legislation and regulations. However, it maintains liaison with local road authorities and the NRA in relation to the condition and signage of public roads. The Garda and other road safety agencies also participate in the high level group on road safety which has a co-ordinating role in relation to road safety policies.</P>
      <P>Local road authorities and the NRA operate with the assistance of A Guide to Road Safety Engineering in Ireland, published by my Department in 1996. This work has been partly updated by specifications for road works published recently by the NRA and a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library. The NRA will also, in the coming months, publish a design manual for roads and bridges which will provide updated guidance on certain aspects of road safety engineering for the benefit of both national and non-national roads.</P>
      <P>Since 1994, the NRA has operated a programme whereby deficiencies at accident locations can be identified and remedied. Road authority proposals in this regard which are approved by the NRA are financed by grants paid by the authority from its road safety measures programme. Under the Government's road safety strategy the NRA is continuing to expand activity in this area with a view to treating a minimum of 400 additional high risk accident locations on national roads in the period 1998 to 2002. A similar programme has this year been extended to the non-national road network and the NRA is assisting road authorities in the identification of priority black-spots.</P>
      <P>The NRA also conducts road safety audits and checks, in conjunction with road authorities. In addition, it operates a programme of traffic calming improvements on the national road network and has published guidelines in relation to the application of such measures.</P>

      <P>When drafting the provisions of Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, on the supply of housing, a central concern was to ensure that the Act would apply in an equitable fashion to all developers of residential property. The Act provides that planning permissions granted on foot of an application made after 25 August 1999, which would otherwise have been subject to the requirements concerning social and affordable housing had a housing strategy been included in the development plan, will expire two years from the grant of permission or on 31 December 2002, whichever is later. This applies to so much of the development for which the external walls have not been completed. This provision is designed to ensure that the provisions of the Act could not be avoided by obtaining planning permission for a large number of residential developments in the interval before the Act comes into force. I have no plans to amend the provision.</P>

      <P>I have no powers to require mobile telephone operators to utilise one location for a telecommunications mast rather than a multiplicity of locations for individual masts. However, in July 1996 my Department did issue guidelines for planning authorities on telecommunications antennae and support structures. The purpose of those guidelines was to assist planning authorities, An Bord Pleanála, operators of mobile telecommunications services and the general public by providing guidance on dealing with telecommunications masts and base stations within the planning system. The guidelines include guidance on the sharing of facilities and specifically provide that all applicants for planning permission will be encouraged to share and will have to satisfy the authority that they have made a reasonable effort to share.</P>
      <P>I understand that under regulations made by the Minister for Public Enterprise, namely, the European Communities (Interconnection in Telecommunications) Regulations, 1998 (S.I. No. 15 of 1998), the sharing of telecommunications facilities is a matter in the first instance for commercial negotiations among telecommunications operators but those regulations empower the Director of Telecommunications Regulation to intervene to resolve disputes and impose conditions in relation to facility sharing.</P>

      <P>The disabled person's grants scheme is administered by local authorities in accordance with the legal framework laid down in section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979 and statutory regulations made under that Act. The framework laid down in the statutory regulations is, as far as practicable, designed to give an appropriate degree of flexibility to local authorities in administering the scheme and I have no proposals to amend the regulations in this regard.</P>
      <P>It is, accordingly, a matter for the local authority to decide the staffing resources to be made available, the level of grants in individual cases and the circumstances in which a grant may be paid.

    </Speaker>
    <P>When considering the nature of the works to be carried out in individual cases local authorities are required to take account of the longer term needs of applicants. This ensures that the need for further grant assistance should not arise in the future. While local authorities employ the services of health board occupational therapists to <Col N="721" /> ascertain the longer term needs of applicants, the regulations do not compel them to do so.</P>

      <P>The Reach agency is a cross-departmental agency established by the Government to implement a programme for the electronic delivery of integrated public services to citizens. The programme involves the development of a public services broker that will act as the common gateway to public services and will provide common services such as identity validation, storing and sharing of data and a secure environment for electronic government services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reach and the public services broker are about <Col N="722" /> providing the best possible service for customers, allowing them to conduct their dealings with the public service in the ways that best suit their needs. This will allow improvements in service through the traditional channels of contact in local offices and over the telephone as well as making services available through the new electronic channels.</P>
    <P>The Reach programme is a major undertaking that will take a number of years to develop fully and that will involve nearly all public service agencies.</P>
    <P>In terms of progress, Reach has conducted an intensive series of workshops and consultations with other Departments and agencies and external experts. The basic model of the public services broker has been validated and developed in greater detail. The high level design of the broker will be published shortly for the guidance of other Departments and agencies, and to initiate the public consultation process.</P>
    <P>The next step for Departments in moving forward the Reach agenda will be the preparation by next month of electronic service delivery strategies. The programme for integrated service delivery using the public services broker will be further developed in the light of those strategies.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is actively involved in preparations for the development of the broker system by helping other Departments and agencies to use the personal public services number as the common customer identifier. A publicity campaign &ndash; including the issue of a leaflet and other materials &ndash; has been staged to raise awareness of the number among members of the public and other public service agencies. Arrangements concerning the extension of the use of the PPS number have been worked out with several sectors &ndash; notably education and the General Medical Services Board.</P>
    <P>Oasis &ndash; a pilot self-service system for personal customers &ndash; is now live on the Internet for evaluation and feedback purposes. This system is being developed by Comhairle as part of the Reach programme. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is developing a similar system &ndash; called Basis &ndash; catering for the needs of the business customer.</P>
    <P>A timetable for the building and deployment of the authentication and core certification systems has been developed. This envisages the deployment of the live system to some agencies by the end of 2001.</P>
    <P>The other elements of the broker will be developed and implemented on a phased basis in accordance with the Government's overall strategy and timetable which will be announced as soon as the individual Departments' and agencies' e-strategies are finalised and co-ordinated.</P>

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme, a weekly supplement may be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to people in receipt of social welfare or health board payments.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to a supplement is determined by the health boards. Supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
      <P>Applicants are also required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate towards their rent or mortgage interest supplement. However, people participating in FÁS training courses may retain up to £25 per week of any additional income they receive while undertaking their training.</P>
      <P>In the case of people on the live register, their unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit payment ceases when they take up a FÁS training course. Instead, they receive a training allowance which is usually no more than £25 per week more than their previous unemployment payment. Consequently, there is no reduction in their rent supplement payment.</P>
      <P>In the case of people in receipt of one-parent family payment, that payment continues when they take up a FÁS training course and they also receive a training allowance from FÁS. In these cases, they retain the first £25 of the training allowance and their rent supplement is reduced by any additional amount over and above the £25 that they receive.</P>
      <P>Participants may subsequently move into employment<i> via</i> an employment programme such as community employment, back-to-work, or they can take up a full-time job under the revenue job assist scheme. These programmes and schemes provide vehicles for the retention of all secondary benefits, including rent supplement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 293 and 298 together.</P>
      <P>The free schemes, including the free electricity-gas allowance, free telephone rental allowance and free television licence schemes, are generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who meet the conditions of a means test. They are also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 years who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
      <P>Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 years whose late spouses had been in receipt of free schemes retain that entitlement in order to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlement following the death of a spouse.</P>
      <P>From October this year, the free schemes, including the free telephone rental allowance, have been extended to all persons aged 75 years and over, regardless of their income and household composition. There are currently almost 107,500 people aged 75 years and over in receipt of the free telephone rental allowance.</P>
      <P>The review of the free schemes, which was published by the Policy Institute, Trinity College Dublin in April this year, noted that the free schemes share a common set of objectives in the area of social inclusion. These are defined as: to provide assistance for those living alone by targeting them with specific benefits providing both income and social inclusion gains; to support older people and people with disabilities in their wish to remain in the community as opposed to institutional care; to support Government policy which seeks to acknowledge the value of older people in society.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the free telephone rental allowance scheme is to provide an element of protection and security in their homes for older people and people with disabilities who are either living alone or with people who would be unable to summon help in an emergency. A secondary objective of the scheme is to encourage social contact and to assist in the prevention of social isolation for those living alone. Extending the free telephone rental allowance to those who reside in nursing homes would not be in keeping with the objectives outlined above.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review also considered the issue of extending the free telephone rental allowance to include the cost of installing a telephone. In this regard, Eircom ran a promotion in 1996, with the co-operation of the Department, offering a reduced installation fee of £50 to 16,392 social welfare pensioners. This group was targeted on the basis of being in receipt of a living alone allowance but not in receipt of a free telephone <Col N="725" /> rental allowance. At the end of 1997, some 2,200 had availed of the offer and 1,962 had applied to the Department for a free telephone rental allowance.</P>
    <P>The review considered that the Government's policy of care in the community should support measures to ensure that pensioners are not deprived of a telephone because of inadequate income or perceived fear of costs. However, in view of the increased revenue which would accrue to Eircom, apart from any social obligation, the review considered that Eircom could provide free installation for the remaining group of pensioners.</P>
    <P>The recommendations made in the review will be examined in the context of future budgets and available resources.</P>

      <P>Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims and the insurability of employment must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment benefit from 8 February 1999 at variable weekly rates in accordance with her part-time employment. Following an interview the deciding officer decided that unemployment benefit was not payable from 24 February 2000 on the grounds that the person concerned was not genuinely seeking employment.</P>
      <P>The person concerned appealed this decision and the case was referred to the social welfare appeals office for determination. On 10 July 2000, the appeals officer concluded, based on the evidence before him, that the appellant was confining herself to part-time employment and upheld the original decision.</P>
      <P>The deciding officer, having reviewed her decision in the light of new evidence of efforts to secure employment, is satisfied that the original decision should stand. It is open to the person concerned to appeal the matter to the social welfare appeals office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Former public servants paid a modified rate of social insurance which gave coverage for widow's and widower's and orphan's pensions and occupational injury benefit. This arrangement reflected their occupational <Col N="727" /> pension position and general contract of service. Full PRSI coverage was extended to new entrants to the public service in 1995 with consequent changes in the occupational arrangements.</P>
      <P>There has been no change in the social insurance position of former public servants though a number of changes in relation to qualification conditions for old age contributory pensions are benefiting those with a mixture of full rate and modified rate PRSI.</P>
      <P>Special arrangements were introduced for old age contributory and retirement pension purposes in 1991 to cater for people with a mixture of full and modified rate PRSI. The revised arrangements provide for the payment of <i>pro-rata </i>pensions in proportion to the periods of insurance completed at the class A rate.</P>
      <P>More recently I introduced a special flat rate old age contributory pension, payable at 50% of the maximum personal rate, to benefit people with pre-1953 social insurance contributions who, due to the yearly average rule, failed to qualify for a pension. In order to qualify a person must have at least 260 contributions paid at the appropriate rate, one of which must have been paid before 1953. I understand that former public servants are one of the major beneficiaries of this special measure. Those who cannot qualify for an insurance based pension scheme may apply for the means-tested old age non-contributory pension.</P>
      <P>Payment of a social welfare pension also gives access to the full range of free schemes, including free electricity, television licence and free telephone rental. Measures introduced in budget 2000 extended coverage for these schemes to all people over 75 years of age regardless of income or household composition. This measure is therefore also benefiting former public servants.</P>
      <P>Despite the combination of insurance and means based schemes there will still be people who will not qualify for a social welfare pension. However, the social welfare system cannot be expected to provide all the solutions to gaps in pensions coverage generally. Given that former public servants were never insured for social welfare pension purposes, the issue for these people relates to their terms and conditions of employment at the time which is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>Under the means test associated with the one-parent family payment &ndash; OFP &ndash; all maintenance received, apart from an allowance of up to £75 per week of maintenance paid in respect of vouched housing costs, is assessed in determining a person's eligibility to receive the OFP. The review of the OFP, published in September 2000, proposed that recipients be allowed to retain 50% of any maintenance received from the absent parent in addition to the existing housing disregard. The review considered that such a measure would provide more of an incentive for OFP recipients to seek maintenance payments from the other parent of their child.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that it would cost £1.3 million in a full year to extend this concession to those currently on reduced payments because of maintenance received.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support for carers on low incomes who look after people, including children, who need full-time care and attention.</P>
      <P>Based on the research carried out in the review of the carer's allowance, which was published in October 1998, the current number of full-time carers is estimated to be around 50,000 people, covering carers of older people and adults and children with disabilities. There are currently 16,302 carers in receipt of carer's allowance. These figures show that 33% of full-time carers are in receipt of a carer's allowance payment which is an increase of 77% in the number of carers in receipt of the allowance since this Government took office. This large increase is reflected in the expenditure on carer's allowance, which was £36.5 million in 1997 and is projected to be £78.3 million this year, representing an increase of 115%.</P>
      <P>As with all other social assistance schemes, a means test in which the income of both the applicant and his-her partner is assessable is applied to the carer's allowance to ensure that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need.</P>
      <P>The means test has been eased significantly in the past few years, most notably with the introduction of disregards of income from employment and other sources. The effect of these changes means that a couple with two children could have a joint annual income in the region of £9,200 and qualify for the maximum carer's allowance while a couple with up to £19,500 could qualify for a minimum rate of carer's allowance, and also receive an annual respite care grant and the free schemes.</P>
      <P>The following estimates have recently been prepared using data supplied by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that increasing the income disregard by £25 for a single carer from £75 to £100 and by £50 for a joint income couple from £150 to £200 would result in an additional 2,700 new carers qualifying for payment and 2,800 existing carers receiving an increased payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This would mean that a single person with no children could be in receipt of income in the region of £6,000 and qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance or be in receipt of income up to £10,000 and still qualify for a minimum payment, plus free schemes and respite care grant. A couple with two children could be in receipt of a joint income in the region of £12,000 and qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance while a couple in receipt of £22,300 <Col N="731" /> could still qualify for the minimum carer's allowance, plus free schemes and respite care grant.</P>
    <P>This measure would cost in the region of £7.5 million. It is estimated that increasing the income disregard by £50 for a single carer from £75 to £125 and by £100 for a joint income couple from £150 to £250 would result in over 5,000 new carers qualifying for payment and 2,800 existing carers receiving an increased payment.</P>
    <P>This would mean that a couple with two children could be in receipt of a joint income in the region of £15,000 and qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance while a couple in receipt of £25,000 could still qualify for the minimum carer's allowance, plus free schemes and respite care grant. This measure would cost in the region of £16 million.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that increasing the income disregard by £75 for a single carer from £75 to £150 and by £150 for a joint income couple from £150 to £300 would result in an additional 6,600 new carers qualifying for payment and 2,800 existing carers receiving an increased payment.</P>
    <P>This would mean that a single person with no children could earn in the region of £8,600 and qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance or be in receipt of income up to £13,000 and still qualify for a minimum payment, plus free schemes and respite care grant. A couple with two children could be in receipt of a joint income in the region of £17,800 and qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance while a couple in receipt of £27,800 could still qualify for the minimum carer's allowance, plus free schemes and respite care grant. This measure would cost in the region of £24 million.</P>
    <P>The question of further improvements to the carer's allowance and for carers generally is being considered in a budgetary context, taking account of our key priorities in the care area, as set out in the review of our action programme.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether it is equitable that whereas the full married rate of unemployment assistance is payable where a claimant's spouse has net earnings of £70 for a full working week, a reduction of £8.50 in unemployment assistance entitlement is incurred where a claimant's spouse has net earnings of £77 for a full working week, that is, an excess of £7 over the earnings disregard incurs a loss to the claimant of £8.50; if he will take steps to remove such anomalies from the means test for unemployment assistance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Regulations provide for the tapered withdrawal of the qualified adult allowance for claimants &ndash; QAA &ndash; of certain welfare payments, including unemployment assistance, where the spouse or partner of the claimant is earning between £70 and £135 per week.</P>
      <P>In the case of unemployment assistance, the position is that where weekly gross earnings are between £70 and £90, the QAA is reduced by £2.50 for each additional £5 earned; between £90 and £135, the QAA is reduced by £3.50 for every £5 of  earnings.</P>
      <P>In addition, for the purpose of means-tested social assistance payments, including unemployment assistance, account is taken of the spouse's net earnings, that is, earnings net of income tax, PRSI, health insurance contributions, superannuation and union dues. Currently, an income disregard of £70, inclusive of travel costs, applies where such employment exceeds three days per week.</P>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern that the withdrawal of the QAA combined with the assessment of the spouse's earnings in the case of recipients of social assistance payments, can result in poverty traps. Indeed, it was in order to alleviate such effects that I increased the spouse income disregard from £45 to £70 per week and substantially improved the tapering arrangements in the 2000 budget. The revised arrangements substantially improve the situation, to the extent that poverty traps now only persist over small ranges of income, marginally above the income thresholds where different rates apply.</P>
      <P>I will continue to explore the potential for addressing such traps where they arise. However, any further measures of this nature would have to take account of factors such as equity <i>vis-à-vis</i> other categories of people who combine work with receipt of a partial social welfare payment and avoid any disincentives to the claimant to take up employment.</P>

      <P>In the case of long-term payments, such as pensions, child dependant allowances are payable where children are in full-time education up to the age of 22 years, or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday. At present, these arrangements do not apply to short-term payments such as disability benefit, unemployment benefit, short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that, in the lifetime of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, child dependant allowances will be extended to all social welfare recipients where the child is under 22 years and in full-time education. The timing of the introduction of measures implementing this commitment over the period will be determined in a budgetary context, having regard to Government priorities and the available resources.</P>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the situation of persons who apply for unemployment assistance and are living at home. In assessing a person's means for unemployment assistance purposes, account is taken of any cash income the person may have together with the value of any capital or property. In addition, the value of any benefit of privilege enjoyed by an applicant, such </P>
      <P>as that of free board and lodging in the family home, is assessed. The purpose of including this item in the assessment of means is to ensure that, by taking account of household circumstances, the available resources are targeted at those who are most in need.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 318, 349 and 350 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that fog lamps are intended for use only in fog or while snow is falling. I am further informed that to be correctly fitted such lights, must be between 20 and 48 inches above the ground and must be permanently deflected downwards and to the left.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Shatter will appreciate, the regulations he quotes are a matter for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. If he requires further information on the legislation in this area, and the restrictions applying to the various categories of vehicle lights, perhaps he would consult with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>I can inform the Deputies, however, that there were 5,617 prosecutions taken by the Garda under the lighting regulations in 1999. While it is not possible to break this figure down by offence type, I understand that the enforcement of the lighting regulations is given high priority by the Garda and the Deputies can be assured that this policy will continue.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Director General of the Irish Prisons Service that the last competition for recruitment of prison officers was held in 1998, and recruitment from this competition is expected to continue into 2001. The campaign, which is run by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission, was initiated to cater for the new prisons coming on stream, to fill shortfalls which existed and to cater for natural wastage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This competition, together with some extra recruitment from an earlier competition held in 1995, has, to date, yielded an intake of over 800 <Col N="739" /> prison officers. Given that competitions are in train to fill vacancies in the higher grades in the Prison Service, consequential vacancies will arise. The Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission is currently recruiting from the 1998 competition to cater for vacancies expected from this promotion campaign. Discussions will take place soon with the commission on the question of holding a new competition.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has applied in the United Kingdom for a transfer to serve the balance of his sentence here under the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. However, his formal application has not yet been received from the UK authorities. Officials in my Department contacted them last week to be advised that they are not yet in possession of all the documentation required to complete the application for submission to me for my consideration. When the necessary documentation and reports have been collated as required under the convention, I am assured his application will be forwarded for my consideration without delay.</P>
      <P>As I have explained in the past, the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons requires extensive documentation to be exchanged between both jurisdictions in order to allow an application to be fully considered. A three-way consent is also required to enable any transfer to take place, that is, from the authorities of both jurisdictions and from the person concerned. On receipt of those consents, assuming they are forthcoming, an application must be made to the High Court for a warrant authorising the transfer of the person concerned and his-her continued detention here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These procedures are required under the con<Col N="740" /> vention and must be adhered to in processing each application. Unfortunately, it is not possible to say how long it will take for this application to be considered. However, I can assure the Deputy that every effort continues to be made to complete this process as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that an application for a Garda CCTV system in Ardee town has been considered by the advisory committee that was established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate CCTV applications.</P>
      <P>Applications for Garda CCTV systems are assessed by the advisory committee on the basis of Garda operational needs and include the following criteria: crime-public order statistics in the area; population and level of activity there; the recommendation of local Garda management and any special circumstances-needs that exist.</P>
      <P>I am also advised by the Garda authorities that following consideration of all the available information in relation to the application for Ardee town, the CCTV advisory committee decided not to recommend the installation of a Garda CCTV system in the town.</P>
      <P>In this regard, I would like to say that I am conscious that some applications for CCTV systems relate to relatively small schemes which, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority. I have given careful consideration to how assistance can be provided for areas which are not rated as a high level Garda priority. To this end, I plan to introduce a grants scheme in 2001 to cater for those communities which would like to press ahead on their own with a local CCTV system. It will be up to the local interests to install and monitor the CCTV schemes. However, grant assistance will be provided. To qualify for grant aid, certain minimum standards will have to be met and the Garda will have to be allowed access to the system when and as it requires it. Local authorities will have an important role to play. The details of this new scheme are being finalised and full details of the scheme, including relevant conditions and grant levels, will be announced early in the new year.</P>

Those nationals who are subject to a visa requirement must first obtain a visit visa prior to travelling and all persons, whether a visa is required, require leave to land from an immigration officer upon arrival. Generally speaking, persons can be granted up to 90 days permission to enter as a visitor provided they can satisfy an immigration officer that they are a genuine visitor, that they have sufficient funds to support themselves, that they intend to return home following their visit and that they do not intend to breach Irish immigration or other laws during their stay.</P>

      <P>The objective of Garda overtime is to allow the Garda Síochána flexibility in responding to circumstances which require manpower resources over and above those available from gardaí on rostered duty. The nature of Garda work and the requirement that the Garda authorities respond at short notice to crisis situa<Col N="746" /> tions mean that overtime expenditure is sometimes unavoidable for the purposes of effective policing.</P>
      <P>The practice and policy with regard to the ratification and allocation of Garda overtime rest with the Garda Commissioner. The authorisation of overtime for operational matters is a matter for local Garda management.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on Garda overtime in 1997 was £43.89 million &ndash; the allocation for Garda overtime this year is £44.49 million. Garda overtime typically arises in the following circumstances: investigation and prosecution of serious crimes; high profile traffic and road safety measures; crime prevention measures; illegal immigration counter measures; and security operations against terrorists.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the rule of engagement in relation to pursuit of a suspect, either by vehicle or foot, differs by each incident discovered or reported. A driver of an official Garda vehicle has certain authority over the control of the vehicle unless otherwise directed. A member on foot pursuit is expected to deliver a professional service in resolving the situation that warranted the pursuit. I have also been informed by the Garda authorities that the issue of overtime in a pursuit situation is not a matter that would cause the pursuing member of the Garda Síochána to question his or her action on a motive of monetary gain.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Community service work placements arranged by the probation and welfare service for offenders who have community service orders imposed fall into two broad categories : (i) group projects and (ii) individual placements. Offenders placed on group projects in 1999 took part in the following range of activities which were to the benefit of their local communities: environmental <Col N="749" /> improvement programmes &ndash; for example, tidy towns, graveyard maintenance and maintenance or improvement works in social centres, youth projects-clubs, schools, hospitals, community facilities and centres &ndash; painting, decorating and renovating premises &ndash; for example, hostels, schools, youth and sports facilities &ndash; building maintenance programmes &ndash;  for example, homes of elderly people &ndash; making paper briquettes, toy making and furniture restoration.</P>
    <P>Individual work placements are arranged where appropriate. These include: charity shop work, personal service programmes for the elderly, cleaning services, charitable fundraising, school kitchen work, assisting at youth and sports activities and cookery training.</P>
    <P>During 1999 the service made 417 applications to the courts for summonses to be issued in respect of persons who were in breach of the terms of their community service order. Not all of these applications were in respect of community service orders made by the courts in the calendar year 1999. Persons on whom a community service order has been imposed have 12 months from the date of the order to complete the number of hours work specified in the order. Therefore, a number of summonses applied for in 1999 were in respect of orders made in 1998.</P>
    <P>The usual outcome in cases returned to court for non-compliance with a community service order is the imposition of the original custodial penalty. However, in a small percentage of cases the court varies the original penalty.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 343 and 344 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Courts Service, which now has direct responsibility for the provision of information for the public on the courts system, that court statistics are not compiled in such a manner as to provide the information sought by the Deputy. However statistics are available for the number of fines imposed by the District Court in the years ending 31 July 1995 to 31 July 1998 together with the number of warrants issued by <Col N="750" /> the District Court for the non-payment of fines and fine receipts in the years ending 31 December 1995 to 31 December 1998. This information is provided in the following table.  It should be noted that the number of fines warrants issued by District Court offices only indicates the number of fines which are not paid within the time allowed by the court and is not indicative of the number of fines imposed which remain unpaid at any given time. Statistics for the number of fines imposed by the Circuit Court in the years ending 31 December 1993 to 31 December 1997 also follow for the Deputy's information.</P>
    <P>Indictable offences are dealt with by the Circuit Criminal Court, Central Criminal Court and the Special Criminal Court. The District Court can also deal with indictable offences in certain circumstances and in fact the majority of indictable offences are dealt with at District Court level.</P>
    <P>Statistics for the number of fines imposed by the Circuit Criminal Court, for the years ending 31 December 1993 to 31 December 1997, follow. More recent information is not readily available. No fines were imposed in the Central Criminal Court in the year ending 31 December 2000. In relation to indictable offences dealt with by the District Court, the latest year for which complete statistics are available is the year ending 31 July 1999 and in that year a total of 3,926 fines were imposed by the District Court for indictable offences. However the statistics available for fines imposed by the District Court do not indicate the value of the fines imposed or the offences for which they were imposed.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that information on the number and value of fines unpaid at any given time together with an age analysis of unpaid fines will be readily available when the proposed computerised criminal case tracking and financial accounting packages are installed in all court offices. It is also envisaged that the new computerised systems will provide for a number of different payment methods, that is, credit card payments, payment on-line etc., which will make it easier for people to pay.</P>
    <P>Certain measures have already been taken to assist in the enforcement of fine payment. The Courts (No. 2) Act, 1991, section 1(1), provides that in all cases of summary jurisdiction, where a fine has been imposed by a court and has not been paid within the time allowed by the court, a warrant must issue within six months of the due date of payment. This provision has increased the efficiency of the issue of fines warrants by court offices.</P>
    <P>Work on the drafting of an attachment of earnings Bill is currently at a preliminary stage in my Department. It is proposed that the Bill will include provisions relating to the enforcement of fines.</P>

      <P>The latest figures in this respect which follow relate to 1994, 1995 and 1996. While the corresponding figures for later years are not available, as yet, steps are under way to ensure that statistics of the kind sought will become available on a more up-to-date basis in the future.</P>
      <P>A new £6 million information technology programme for the Prisons Service is well advanced. As part of the programme a comprehensive prisoner records database is in the process of being installed across the Prison Service. This programme will address the lack of up-to-date information about prisoners, provide management with necessary information and enable the automation of many existing functions. Prisoner related information generally will be much more easily accessible and up to date once this new system is in operation.</P>

    <P>It is very important to note that, at no time, are more than 1.5% of prison spaces taken up by persons committed for non-payment of fines. The courts are moreover required to take ability to pay into account when imposing fines on persons convicted of offences attracting monetary penalties. Many persons committed to prison for non-payment of fines, who are perfectly capable of paying these penalties, only pay up when actually in custody or at the point of being put in custody. It is interesting to note the significant decline in percentage terms in the overall number of committals to prison for non-payment of fines over the period in question.</P>

      <P>Since the High Court judgment on 28 April 1995, 7,109 applications under the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, have been finalised. Full remission of fines was granted in respect of six petitions, while a further 23 special applications from prosecuting authorities, originating from prosecutions in error, also resulted in the full remission of fines. The applications contained 38 fines totalling £2,805.</P>
      <P>In addition, offers of partial mitigation were made in response to 80 other petitions. However, an offer of partial mitigation does not involve the full remission of fines but rather that the outstanding balance is remitted if a nominated portion of the penalty is paid within a specified period.</P>

      <Quest>the number of prisoners who have been released in the latest period for which statistics are available before serving their full term; and the present policy in relation to such releases.</Quest>

      <P>Statistics are not maintained in such a way as to enable the precise information sought by the Deputy to be readily available. At present, the compilation and analysis of statistics must be done manually as computerised systems are still in the course of being installed in many prisons. This is an extremely time-consuming and staff-intensive process and it has not been possible to release staff for this work.</P>
      <P>A new £6 million information technology programme for the Prisons Service is well advanced. As part of the programme a comprehensive prisoner records database is in the process of being deployed across the Prison Service. This programme will address the lack of accessible information about prisoners, provide management with necessary information and enable the automation of many existing functions. Information will be more easily accessible once this new system is in operation.</P>
      <P>Since I took office as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have presided over an unprecedented investment in our prison infrastructure. In all, over 1,200 additional prison spaces have been provided with a further 700 closed spaces on the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall percentage of sentenced prisoners on temporary release has, as a result of this Government's building programme to date, been reduced from 19% in 1997 to a current figure of about 7%. It is important to bear in mind also that almost all prisoners on early release at present are on structured programmes, in many cases under the direct supervision of the probation and welfare service. Those not on structured programmes have been temporarily <Col N="754" /> released for valid compassionate reasons, ill health or family related circumstances.</P>
    <P>We now have a situation where for the first time in 25 years we can accommodate all those sentenced by the courts for the full duration of their sentences. The impact of this cut in unplanned temporary releases on the level of indictable crime in this jurisdiction is clear and irrefutable. The whole architecture of community sanctions depends on the custodial places being available to ensure that the sanction of last resort can be applied to offenders if they do not avail of the non-custodial options open to them.</P>

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy has made an application for citizenship by way of post-nuptial declaration. It was received in my Department on 5 September 2000 and is currently being processed. Due to the large volume of applications in hand at present, such cases are taking approximately 13 months to finalise.</P>
      <P>Section 8 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986, provides that a non-national can make a declaration in the manner prescribed by the Minister accepting Irish citizenship as post-nuptial citizenship, after three years of marriage to an Irish citizen, who is an Irish citizen otherwise than by naturalisation or by post-nuptial citizenship or by honorary citizenship, provided that the marriage is subsisting at the date of lodgement of the declaration and that the couple are living together as husband and wife. It should be noted that there is no residency requirement.</P>
      <P>Extra resources are currently being allocated to the immigration and citizenship division of my Department with a view to, <i>inter alia</i>, reducing the time involved in processing naturalisation applications. These resources will impact considerably on present delays.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year I launched a pilot marketing initiative, under which Bord Fáilte provided a budget of £300,000, targeted primarily at small accommodation providers with a view to increasing business overall, particularly in off-peak seasons and in rural areas. This year, Bord Fáilte has continued the initiative with an increased budget of £500,000 and the ambit of the scheme has broadened to include small family run hotels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by Bord Fáilte that over the past two years a range of practical promotional activities took place on behalf of the B and B sector as a whole, including co-operative attendance at trade and consumer fairs; advertising; off-season promotions with tour operators; participation in trade education programmes; direct mail cam<Col N="758" /> paigns; filming of a generic promotional video in June 2000 and publicity. Bord Fáilte also organised a series of workshops from November 1999 to May 2000 to assist providers in developing simple methods of promotion. A number of marketing seminars were also run to provide assistance and advice on more advanced marketing issues.</P>
    <P>On the question of grant aid for small family run hotels to expand and enhance their product, I refer the Deputy to the answer I gave to parliamentary Question No. 47 on 16 November 2000. Under the national developmental plan, the support for tourism product development referred to in my previous answer will be made available under the tourism measure within two regional operational programmes, the Border, midlands and western &ndash; BMW &ndash; regional Operational Programme and the southern and eastern &ndash; S&amp;E &ndash; regional Operational Programme. Under the programmes, project proposals will be assessed by Bord Fáilte Éireann and the decision-making in terms of grant approval will fall to two independent product management boards. As tourist accommodation projects will not be a priority for grant assistance under the regional operational programmes, there is no specific provision for grant aid for small hotels.</P>

      <P>The current situation is that the national educational psychological service agency &ndash; NEPS &ndash; does not yet provide a psychological service for the school named by the Deputy. However, I have appointed 26 additional psychologists to the agency since the beginning of September. As soon as they have completed their programme of induction training, they will begin visiting schools. This will be before the end of this school term. At least two psychologists will be joining the south-eastern team during the current school year in order to initiate a psychological service to primary schools in County Waterford. I am unable to say at present which schools in the county will be included in the next expansion phase of NEPS.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties that have been experienced by some schools in gaining access to psychological assessments, pending the appointment of the full quota of psychologists for NEPS. I have therefore asked NEPS to develop a short-term strategy to alleviate the situation and I expect this to be in place early in the new year.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the higher education grants scheme, operated under the aegis of my Department, financial assistance by way of a maintenance grant and a grant towards lecture fees, is provided for eligible students attending full-time post-graduate courses of not less than one year's duration in approved institutions, including those in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The amount of lecture fee payable under these schemes is subject to a maximum fee limit, approved by the Minister for Education and Science. The maximum fee limit for the 2000-01 academic year is IR£3,064. Where students, attending approved courses, qualify for assistance towards tuition fees, the fees are paid directly by the local authority to the college, on receipt of an invoice from the college. In the case of students pursuing their studies in colleges in Northern Ireland, the value of the grant towards fees is converted into sterling at the prevailing exchange rate and this amount is paid to the college. Any remaining balance must be paid by the student himself-herself.</P>
      <P>The full non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant, payable to students for the 2000-01 academic year, is IR£1,775. In December 1999, in response to a number of representations, local authorities were advised that grant-holders should be given the option of having their grant paid either in Irish punts or in the currency of the country in which they are studying, the value of the Irish punts having been converted into the currency of the country in question. This concession allows students studying in Northern Ireland or the UK to receive their grants in Irish punts rather than sterling if they so wish.</P>
      <P>My officials have made inquiries from the University of Ulster, Jordanstown, the university in question, and it is understood that the cost of tuition fees of the master of science degree in physiotherapy, for the 2000-01 academic year, is £2,740 sterling. This full-time course is an approved course for the purpose of the higher education grants scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department understands that the student, to whom the Deputy refers, will complete the bachelor of science degree in physiotherapy at Limerick University in the 2000-01 academic year and that she has been in receipt of a higher education grant for the duration of her studies. Under the terms of the higher education grants scheme, a grant-holder, who is in receipt of a higher education grant to pursue an undergraduate course, may have the grant continued in order to pursue an approved course at post-graduate level, subject to the terms and conditions of the scheme. Accordingly, the student should contact Leitrim County Council, in due course, for the purpose of having her eligibility <Col N="764" /> for grant assistance, in respect of her post-graduate studies, assessed.</P>

      <P>The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for means-tested higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the scheme, the candidate's reckonable income for the purposes of the means test is his or her gross income from all sources and the gross income of his or her parents or guardians where applicable. Certain social welfare and health board payments are not taken into account in the calculation of reckonable income.</P>
      <P>The terms of the maintenance grants scheme, which are uniformly applied, explicitly provide for assessment on the basis of gross income and do not allow for expenditure, such as that incurred on mortgage payments and house improvement loan repayments, to be deducted from reckonable income when assessing a candidate's application.</P>
      <P>In relation to reckonable income limits under the terms of the scheme, my approach has been to follow the practice of recent years and increase the income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. Accordingly, I approved an increase of 5% in the reckonable income limits for the 2000-01 academic year. This exceeded the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March 1998 to March 1999, which was 4.5%. I also increased by 5% the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.</P>
      <P>Similarly in relation to the value of the grant, the practice in recent years has been to increase the level of maintenance grants annually at least in line with inflation. Last June, in line with this policy, I announced increases of 5% in the rates of maintenance grant. The reference value for inflation is the annual percentage increase in the CPI to mid-February 2000. The increase of 5% in grant rates for 2000-01 was higher than the reference value, which was 4.3%.</P>
      <P>There are no plans at present to depart from these indices as a guideline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the present financial year expenditure on <Col N="767" /> student support, including free fees, is expected to be about £250 million. In view of the scale of expenditure involved and the representations being made by students and other groups, I announced, on 11 November, that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures. The project team is to report to me by the end of March 2001.</P>

      <P>The manner in which voluntary contributions are sought from local communities for optional extras over and above what is provided for in the general school programme is a matter for school principals and managements.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the demand for increased funding for second level schools. In this regard, I consider that the report of the steering group on the funding of second level schools represents a comprehensive review of the funding arrangements and is a valuable document in both its analysis and clarity of approach. It is my intention that this report will continue to inform policy on school funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I intend to address the issues of equity and transparency of funding, I want to emphasise that my priority is the adequacy of funding levels for schools in the second level sector. I have already shown my commitment and determination in this regard by establishing the school services support fund. I am satisfied that the introduction of this support fund is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. Schools will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £4 million to voluntary secondary schools each year. In addition, the schools will benefit from a further increase in the standard <i>per capita</i> grant. The grant was increased to £184 from £177 last year. It was further increased by £8 from September this year to £192 and will be significantly increased by £10 for the next school year. In addition, and in recognition of the cash flow <Col N="768" /> needs of schools, I am arranging to bring forward the payment of the next instalment of the <i>per capita </i>grant from January 2001 to later this month.</P>
    <P>My approach to date has clearly shown my commitment and determination to improve funding at second level and I intend to build further on progress to date.</P>

      <P>My Department has in place number of supports and schemes promoting information and communications technology &ndash; ICT &ndash; developments in schools.</P>
      <P>Since the inception of the schools IT 2000 programme in 1998, the ratio of computers to pupils in second level schools has decreased from 17:1 to 13:1 and I intend to decrease this ratio still further. My Department, through the National Centre for Technology in Education, is constantly reviewing ICT needs in education and will continue to provide funding for the best ICT available for education having regard to best practice in the field.</P>
      <P>All new second level schools recognised for grant purposes under the free education scheme are eligible for grant-aid under the technology integration initiative &ndash; TII &ndash; of schools IT 2000 to support the equipment and Internet connectivity needs of the career guidance service in the amount of £1,850 for schools with up to 799 pupils and £3,700 for schools with larger enrolments. A further grant of £2 per pupil was given for the development of school administration systems.</P>
      <P>Existing second level schools which establish a special class or classes are also eligible for a grant of £1,500 plus £20 per pupil in the special classes. A special fund is also in place to cater for the ICT needs of individual special needs pupils, including those who are fully integrated into ordinary classes.</P>
      <P>ICT equipment is also provided to support the work of each full-time teacher in the visiting teachers for travellers service. This scheme is being extended in the current year to cover the work of visiting teachers for children with disabilities.</P>
      <P>My Department also operates a grants scheme for the purchase of equipment, including computer equipment, for second level pupils with serious physical and-or communicative disabilities. The provision for this scheme is £370,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the above, the Department supplies computers, printers, peripherals and <Col N="769" /> software in all instances where a computer room is being provided as part of a new school or a school extension. The Department also responds to needs presented by schools generally for computer equipment based on priority of need.</P>
    <P>An amount of £640,000 has been provided under the school administration project in the current year for the purpose of assisting second level schools in acquiring information technology equipment and software for administration purposes.</P>
    <P>Grants up to a maximum of £22,000, which are mainly for the purchase of IT equipment, are available to schools on introducing the leaving certificate vocational programme and-or the leaving certificate applied. All second level schools running post leaving certificate &ndash; PLC &ndash; courses receive an annual equipment-materials capitation grant of £146 per pupil.</P>

      <P>The report of the tribunal on teachers' salaries, 1968, recommended graded pensionable allowances for principals and deputy principals based on the points rating of each school. The points rating was based on the attendance of pupils in each school in the previous school year. The pupils were classified according to their ages and each group was given a points weighting based on age.</P>
      <P>The issue of principals' and deputy principals' allowances was revisited during the Programme for Competitiveness and Work pay negotiations where it was agreed with the teacher unions that the grading of the allowances would be based on the approved number of teachers on the staff of the school. The categories for determining the level of allowance were designed to correspond with the existing points rating of the schools. It was also agreed that there would be separate revised schedules for primary and post-primary schools and that the cap on the allowances for post-primary schools would be raised. These agreed measures were implemented with effect from 1 September 1996.</P>
      <P>A copy of the allowances with the revised schedules follows for the Deputy's information.</P>

      <P>The chairperson of the commission to inquire into child abuse, Ms Justice Laffoy, announced at the second public sitting of the commission &ndash; 20 July 2000 &ndash; that the commission would grant the right of legal representation to each person appearing before the investigation committee to make an allegation of abuse, or who was accused of an allegation of abuse. The chairperson further stated that this right of representation would consist of one barrister and one solicitor per individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse <Col N="772" /> Act, 2000, provides that the Minister for Education and Science shall make a scheme to defray such legal costs &ndash; section 20. Officials of my Department are currently in discussions with legal representatives of those groups likely to appear before the commission in regard to the making of such a scheme. My Department is being assisted by the Attorney General's office in this exercise. It is my intention that any scheme of legal expenses should be adequate to meet the needs of those persons appearing before the commission. However, in saying this I must also take account of the deliberate design of the commission to inquire into child abuse, based upon an inquisitorial, rather than adversarial legal framework. Such a system reduces the need for extensive or ongoing legal representation, placing the onus of inquiry on the commission.</P>

      <P>School classroom accommodation needs are not determined solely by reference to the pre<Col N="773" /> vious September's enrolment figures. While current enrolment is a factor, the process of assessing the need for new or additional school accommodation at primary or post-primary level in any given area entails consideration by my Department of all relevant factors. These include enrolment and demographic trends over a number of years as well as housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet the demand for places.</P>
      <P>My Department is at present examining areas of major development and population growth with a view to identifying where the most urgent need for new or additional educational facilities exists or is likely to arise in the future. As part of this process, officials of the planning and building unit consult regularly with local authorities regarding development proposals and their implications. Liaison with existing schools is important, also, and the school authorities would usually alert my Department where, in their view, the need for additional accommodation is anticipated.</P>
      <P>In the event that the level of development and population growth in an area indicates a likely long-term need for primary or post-primary educational provision, a decision is made on the means by which that need should be met. Generally, this involves the provision of permanent accommodation in the form of a new school or an extension to existing facilities. High quality temporary or prefabricated accommodation is normally provided to alleviate short-term accommodation needs.</P>

    <P>The figure of £46 million referred to by the Deputy represents the cost of the number of CE participants employed in schools as secretaries, caretakers and classroom assistants, based on a FÁS audit of CE essential services in November 1999. Proposals for the transfer of funding equivalent to this amount are being prepared by officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and my Department at the moment. Once those proposals are finalised, consultations with the social partners, in accordance with framework IV of the Programme for <Col N="774" /> Prosperity and Fairness, will be arranged under the auspices of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

      <P>The national educational psychological service &ndash; NEPS &ndash; is an executive agency of my Department. It has responsibility for developing an educational psychological service for all children and young people attending schools and other educational institutions recognised by my Department.</P>
      <P>There have been no difficulties with the Department of Finance with regard to the appointment of new psychologists. In the last few months, I have appointed 38 new psychologists to the NEPS and a further ten are in process of being recruited. I also expect to be in a position to announce a further expansion of the service in the near future.</P>
      <P>The current situation is that the NEPS provides a psychological service for all post-primary schools and approximately 725 primary schools. The expansion of the NEPS is now well under way, with, at present, 75 psychologists serving with the agency. As soon as the newly appointed psychologists have completed their induction training, they will be deployed in schools.</P>
      <P>The NEPS psychologists are being deployed in ten regions corresponding to the health board regions. It is envisaged that, by the end of its development period, the NEPS psychologists will be providing an educational psychological service for every school in the country.</P>

    <P>In the case of Christian Brothers secondary school, James's Street, and in the case of St. David's in Artane, I understand that difficulties, outside of the control of my Department, have been encountered as a result of which halls at these schools cannot proceed. Consideration is currently being given to possible alternative locations for these two halls.</P>
    <P>In the case of the proposal to locate a hall at Senior College Ballyfermot, it emerged that a drainage pipe traverses the proposed site rendering the site unsuitable for development. City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee and Dublin Corporation are working to identify an alternative site in this general area.</P>
    <P>In the case of Firhouse community college, Collinstown Park community college and Pobalscoil Iosolde, planning applications have been lodged with the relevant local authorities. In each case, further information has been sought by the local authorities and this information is being reviewed and addressed by the design teams appointed to plan each hall.</P>
    <P>In the case of St. Vincent's secondary school, Cork, a planning application was lodged with the local authority. Currently, negotiations are occurring involving the school's design team and the local authority in this matter.</P>
    <P>Notification of a decision to grant planning permission has been issued in the case of St. Michael's secondary school, Finglas and Inchicore vocational school.</P>
    <P>A decision to grant planning permission has been issued in the case of Pearse College, Crumlin.</P>
    <P>The first phase of the hall for Killinarden community school has been built with planning of the second phase, largely ancillary accommodation, being incorporated into plans for an extension of the school. These latter plans are progressing through the architectural planning process currently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1996, my Department has provided funding through the Higher Education Authority for the universities for the targeted initiative aimed at widening access for young people from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>
      <P>This initiative involves links with second level schools designated as disadvantaged, involving liaison and outreach work. There are two aspects to the programmes: one involves assistance for students to meet the points requirement for courses, enabling them to obtain a college place through the standard CAO entry procedure &ndash; there are, for example, mentoring programmes and summer schools for potential students; the other aspect of the programmes is the special entry arrangements through which more flexible entry criteria are applied and various supports put in place for students entering by this method. In relation to initiatives focusing on the transition from second to third level and on the third level sector, many colleges have developed initiatives to promote disadvantaged access, through the targeted funding provided for the universities by the Higher Education Authority, and funding from within the overall financial allocations to the institutes of technology.</P>
      <P>Apart from the maintenance grant schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered by the third level institutions and provides direct financial support for disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college to complete their studies. I have recently increased the provision for this fund from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.8 million in 2000.</P>
      <P>In September of this year, I established an action group on access to third level education. This action group will advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote participation at third level by students in three target groups &ndash; students with disabilities, students from disadvantaged backgrounds and mature second chance students. Building on current initiatives, it will, <i>inter alia, </i>advise on the development of targeted interventions and actions at all levels. I have asked the group to provide a report to me within three months. The creation of this group is in line with a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="777" /> The need to target resources at those most in need is well recognised and underpins my approach to tackling disadvantage. In this regard there is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan, aimed at tackling under-representation by the three target groups. The objective of this measure is to facilitate and improve access to the labour market for the beneficiaries whilst improving their long-term employability through enhancing their educational qualifications.</P>
    <P>As an indication of the Government's support in promoting equity in access and as an initial step, pending the findings of the action group, I announced the introduction of a special maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders, targeted at those most in need. The full rate of the special maintenance grant will increase from £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college; and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college.</P>
    <P>Tentative indications are that up to 10,000 students may benefit from this measure. This is, of course, a tentative estimate and the actual number of students to benefit will depend on the outcome to the action group's work. The group's terms of reference specifically require that it advise me, <i>inter alia</i>&ndash; on the development of targeted interventions and actions and the identification and tracking of the target groups.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I announced on 11 November that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures. The project team is to report to me by the end of March 2001.</P>

      <P>The expansion of the NEPS is currently under way in line with a five year plan.

      <P>My Department has no record of any written application for recognition as a primary school teacher from the person referred to by the Deputy. However, I understand from my officials in the primary administration section in Athlone that, in a recent telephone conversation, she has indicated that she will be making such an application in the near future. On receipt of such an application, including the required supporting documentation, an assessment of whether her qualifications entitle her to recognition as a primary school teacher will be made.</P>

      <P>My Department currently operates a number of schemes targeted at the provision of equipment and software to serve the needs of students, teachers and administrators within education. All these schemes focus on putting the requisite infrastructure in place in schools and colleges to integrate information and communications technology &ndash; ICT &ndash; into the classroom. At present no scheme assists the purchase of equipment in a home situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The schools IT2000 programme seeks to further develop the integration of ICT into first and second level education, providing in this <Col N="782" /> regard a comprehensive ongoing capital equipment programme for schools and a training programme for teachers.</P>
    <P>In addition some 70 pilot projects have been put in place in first and second level schools by the National Centre for Technology in Education, &ndash; NCTE &ndash; under the schools integration project, SIP. The SIP programme is focused on the testing of a broad variety of ICT-related strategies for future general application in the education sector.</P>
    <P>A number of the SIP pilot projects are examining the efficacy of home-school linkages involving computers and the Internet. The SIP projects are ongoing and, when completed, will be evaluated with a view to best practice for the future.</P>

Under the terms of the scheme the school authorities make an application in respect of an individual pupil. Equipment provided under this scheme remains the property of the school.</P>
      <P>My Department also operates a scheme of reasonable accommodations for candidates with special needs at the certificate examinations. Applications for such accommodations are normally invited one year in advance of the examination concerned. These accommodations are granted on a case by case basis depending on the evidence provided in support of the application and include the use of tape recorders, readers and scribes.</P>

      <P>I have set the tackling of educational disadvantage as a priority and I will announce shortly the details of a new programme aimed at tackling educational disadvantage in selected primary schools over a three year period.</P>
      <P>The new programme will be based on the results of a recent survey that was conducted by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on behalf of my Department. Schools with the highest levels of concentration of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving will be allocated resources that reflect the levels of concentration and the relative needs of pupils at risk. A key feature of the new programme is that participating schools must agree, in advance, to target the additional resources being provided at those pupils identified as being at risk of educational disadvantage. Schools will also be given appropriate support for the development of holistic and integrated in-school and out-of-school supports for the pupils concerned, in collaboration with other statutory and voluntary services. The programme will cost in excess of £25 million over three years and will involve the allocation of 200 new teaching posts and financial assistance to selected schools.</P>
