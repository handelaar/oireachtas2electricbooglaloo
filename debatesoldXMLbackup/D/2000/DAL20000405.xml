    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 35, Children Bill, 1999 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed); No. 36, Insurance Bill, 1999 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed); and No. 5, Mental Health Bill, 1999 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage. Private Members' Business shall be No. 56, Road Traffic (Joyriding) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed) to conclude at 8.30 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that No. 5, the Mental Health Bill, is on the agenda after a long delay. Is the Taoiseach aware of the case of a young person who, in Trim District Court, had to be sent for treatment in a secure setting not in this jurisdiction but in Belfast because of disturbed behaviour because no place was available to which the young person could be sent for appropriate treatment other than Bridge House in Belfast? Is the Taoiseach satisfied that, in a country as successful as ours, we do not have adequate accommodation for young people with disturbed behaviour patterns?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be more appropriate to a question. I call Deputy Quinn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, as Deputy Quinn has family connections in Dundalk and since this young person was sentenced in Dundalk court, he would wish me to press this matter so that satisfactory treatment would be obtained. We do not want Mr. Justice Kelly condemning the Oireachtas from the bench every second week for our failure to provide secure accommodation. The Taoiseach should answer the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach reconsider the <Col N="686" /> Government's opposition to the Private Members' Bill in the name of Deputy Broughan and the Labour Party? It affects his constituency as well as others. An acceptance in principle and a referral to the appropriate committee would be a positive signal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter will be debated in Private Members' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of No. 93 on the Order Paper, now that the Taoiseach has returned from Cairo and has seen at first hand the level of poverty in what is one of the richest countries in Africa, would he agree to the technical motion being taken without debate in Government time to facilitate the Labour Party's Private Members' Bill to increase our overseas development aid to 0.7% given the wonderful set of budgetary figures announced yesterday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>For Deputy Bruton's information, the matter he raised is the subject of Question No. 54 today which is a priority question. I have already emphasised that we have asked the Department of Foreign Affairs to bring forward a multiannual programme showing how we will reach the UN target. In volume terms, our ODA budget has grown more quickly than that of anyone else. However, because of the growth in the economy, the percentage has decreased slightly. Nonetheless, we intend to increase our ODA in volume and percentage terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Our Bill would have the effect of an increase of £200 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>At the beginning of this session the Minister for Public Enterprise promised two Bills: one was to give a legal basis to the aviation regulator who was appointed many months ago and the other was an emergency e-commerce Bill. The Taoiseach promised they would be taken in March and we are now moving towards the end of this session. Will these two Bills, the Aviation Regulation Bill and the e-commerce Bill, be published in this session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The e-commerce Bill was cleared by Government yesterday and it is hoped it will commence in the Seanad next week. The Aviation Regulation Bill is on the Cabinet agenda next week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the Pollution of the Sea by Hazardous and Noxious Substances (Civil Liability and Compensation) Bill, I compliment the emergency services and the officials at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources for having averted a serious pollution disaster in Bray. I hope that is the end of the matter. Do I take it that the Taoiseach has been warned severely about the need for this legislation and when can we expect it? It is listed to be taken at an early stage but I want to know if it will be taken immediately given what we along the east coast have escaped. Furthermore, will the Coastal Zone Management Bill be brought forward in the same context given the enormous confusion in Portmarnock over the way in which the dunes have been treated? Can that be brought forward given the considerable concern in that area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not appropriate to make comments, merely to ask questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>These are two promised Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The heads of the coastal zone management Bill are not expected until early next year, so that will take some time. However, the Pollution of the Sea by Hazardous and Noxious Substances (Civil Liability and Compensation) Bill is still due before Easter &ndash; this month at any rate. The coastguard and the departmental staff did an excellent job yesterday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the timetable for the legislation which has been promised to give the Navy increased powers? Why was it not included in the White Paper on Defence? Why is there once again mismanagement of the Naval Service using an <i>ad hoc</i> and piecemeal approach?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Why was this legislation not included in the White Paper? Why was the Naval Service downgraded in the White Paper when the Minister announced new legislation today?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The preparatory work and discussions on the Bill were conducted in the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and not in the Department of Defence. That is why discussions are still under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government promised amending legislation on the national treasury management to provide for the management of the new pension fund. Have the heads of the Bill been <Col N="688" /> cleared? Is the Bill being drafted and when can we expect it to come before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The text of the Bill is expected this month and it is hoped to take the Bill before the summer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the position concerning promised health insurance legislation to allow insurance companies to insure in the area of primary care and other treatments not currently covered by health insurance? When will this legislation be published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two Bills involved. The Deputy is referring to the health insurance amendment Bill which will amend the Insurance Act, 1994. The text of the Bill will, I hope, be taken in the next few weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, when this issue was first raised in the House, it was promised that, following negotiations between the Minister's predecessor and the Parents for Justice, the terms of reference of the inquiry would be brought to the floor of the House so that Members could contribute to a discussion on the matter. Will that promise be kept? Will a statement be made in the House this week? Will Members be furnished formally with the terms of reference? Will Members be given an opportunity to contribute to the debate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out yesterday the good work health professionals and juvenile liaison officers are doing in difficult circumstances with scant resources. There has been a significant increase in the number of children in care in the past ten years, creating problems for those professionals and others trying to cater for a situation which arose in surprising circumstances. It is a contradiction that there should be a 52% increase in the number of children in care in the past ten years when the economy has become so buoyant over the same period. The number has increased from 2,614 in 1988 to 3,984 in 1998. It is estimated that 61% of those children come from "a lone parent" background. We should attempt to find out why so many children from one parent families end up in care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health boards are spending an enormous amount of money trying to place children with behavioural problems in suitable accommodation in Britain. Resources for the care of such children <Col N="694" /> should be provided at home if possible. It would be less expensive than having delinquent children placed in homes in England.</P>
    <P>Raising of the age for criminal responsibility from seven to 12 years is a positive element in the Bill. It is an outdated concept that a seven year old child can be a criminal. Deputy Currie tried to introduce legislation which raised the age of responsibility to ten years of age and this Bill goes two years further. Another positive aspect is the emphasis on community work, which is often more effective than a prison sentence. Those who have been involved in such work have done very good service to the community. This is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been anticipated for many years and it is good that we are discussing it at long last. It is essential that the resources are provided to ensure it is properly implemented. The situation for children will be improved by this Bill. </P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister and his officials on this comprehensive legislation. In his term of office to date, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has initiated more than half the legislation dealt with by the House. He is to be complimented on the workload he has undertaken and the comprehensive nature of the legislation he has brought forward.</P>
      <P>This legislation, which deals with a complex area, is no exception. In reading the Bill and its explanatory notes, many issues come to mind. Those will need to be addressed if the Bill is to be implemented successfully.</P>
      <P>I compliment Deputies Ring and Carey on the manner in which they outlined how the Bill will affect constituents who come to our clinics with various problems. As we debate this comprehensive Bill, it is essential to reflect on the issues with which we are confronted in our constituencies relative to the sections of the Bill to ensure we do not lose sight of the issues. While we will provide a framework for the working of the legislation, there is often a difference between how that framework operates and how it delivers in a tangible way the protection and assistance needed. Legislation is passed into law, but in some cases it might as well not exist because it does not address in a tangible way the needs of the people affected by it.</P>
      <P>As society is constantly changing, a comprehensive Bill such as this also needs to be reviewed on a regular basis. While it consigns to history the 1908 Act, we will need to constantly review this legislation because people's problems are also constantly changing and, for some, the changes in society always seem to be for the worst. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pressures of modern living experienced by family units are enormous and cause serious problems in households. Those pressures place further pressures on the children of those families and we should seek to protect them in the first instance. That is the function of this Bill. Rich and poor families are affected by the pressures of <Col N="695" /> life and when the dysfunctional aspect creeps into the lives of families it knows no bounds.</P>
    <P>My concern regarding such pressures and dysfunctional families is for the children of marginalised families, the children of families who have little or nothing to look forward to in their lives. Their parents may be unemployed or employed with no aspiration. Life for them may mean just getting up and doing the same thing day after day. That attitude can create problems for the children of those families. They may grow up without any aspiration in their lives which gives rise to a never ending circle of activity, with the children almost certainly following the same path as their parents unless we can help them to break out of the cycle of poverty, neglect, torment or the dysfunctional aspect of family life.</P>
    <P>While I do not want to categorise children, it is useful to examine how different groupings of children are affected by such pressures. The parents of some children do not care about life while the parents of others are divorced or separated. Some children are out of control because something is missing in their family units and other children quietly suffer through ill health or neglect. There are also children who are institutionalised in homes and looked after by others.</P>
    <P>Regarding children whose parents do not care, the Bill touches on many of the aspects of that problem. Within social welfare we have created a model in the family resource centres which can be of great assistance to the children of parents who do not acknowledge their responsibilities. It is necessary to constantly emphasise that parents must acknowledge their responsibility for their children.</P>
    <P>The family resource centre provides some support for such families and they have proven to be particularly successful in urban areas. While they continue to be funded and are relatively new, they could take on much more of the work done by the agencies and perhaps provide a more personal service for the families affected or for family units that are breaking down. The role of such centres in this regard should be examined by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In terms of implementing the provisions of the Bill, the centres should be examined with a view to their providing a support mechanism and in this regard they would require further financial support and education for their leaders.</P>
    <P>Families come together in those resource centres and give leadership to their communities. There is nothing like peer leadership from people in a community who have found a way out of the vicious cycle and who are prepared to give back to their communities by way of the benefit of their experience. The homework clubs within the family resource centres are working because the parents of the children who need it are being asked to participate. There is a two way process at work. The parents of the children are being re-educated and the children who have suffered through a lack of education are finding a support <Col N="696" /> mechanism to break the cycle. The parents and the children are now almost going back to school in the evenings and that has a very positive effect on the development of communities. To a degree, we do not acknowledge their input enough, otherwise we would allocate them more funding and further expertise. The family resource centres, the homework clubs and the home economic clubs advise parents on how to get as much as possible out of their limited resources to put food on the table. That has been a simple but very important component of the activity of those clubs. All of that helps to strengthen children's understanding and an understanding of the needs of children in the home. It helps to develop a bond between the parent and the child and to provide a learning curve for the family unit because an interest in education and learning has been renewed in the family as they begin to participate in the community.</P>
    <P>More qualified social workers in this area should be provided. Part 2 deals with family welfare conferences. Section 16 deals with children in need of special care or protection. It emphasises the new role the health boards will play as a support mechanism in this regard, but we must acknowledge that we are asking the health boards, which are already underfunded, do not have the necessary expertise and whose staff are overworked, to carry out the work in hand.</P>
    <P>While this is a good idea on which I commend the Minister, we must ensure a large amount of money is found to support the family unit, through the health boards, by way of family conferencing and intervention at an early stage, as proposed in the Bill. Many parts of the Bill refer to funding and providing proper professional staff to interface with the family unit which finds itself in trouble. Children who are not being looked after are part of a unit which is in difficulty.</P>
    <P>The second group are children of parents who are divorced or separated for one reason or another. In these modern times, we must all understand that separated parents or partners are part and parcel of life. We need to support the single parent, be it a mother or father, who finds himself or herself rearing children. Sufficient tangible support is not delivered by the health boards or other agencies to support the growing number of people who find themselves trying to look after a family while trying to work, keep a roof over their heads, give guidance and leadership and participate fully in the education of their children. Even with two parents, it is a difficult job to match every demand from primary or second level schools to assist in the education of children. We must give special consideration to those people who are separated and cannot devote time to ensuring good education for their children.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of separated parents is that more often than not the male partner is the one who finds himself out of the family home. Yet, once he keeps in constant contact and is supportive in rearing his children, he will not be given a <Col N="697" /> local authority home because the housing waiting lists are growing and his priority in terms of accommodation is way down the line. Men who are almost homeless and seeking accommodation to provide for family visits cannot achieve this. I find this heartbreaking because these men are making special efforts to participate in rearing their children and supporting their family from a distance. We should ensure that a parent at least has reasonable visiting accommodation to be able to take his children as often as the law requires or the partnership seeks through the intervention of the Department of the Environment and Local Government or the rent subsidy scheme of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. More and more of these people are coming on to the housing waiting lists and finding no support. The Bill caters for many aspects but other Departments should give support and ensure this problem is dealt with. The partner outside the home should be supported in finding accommodation so that family sharing can be accommodated.</P>
    <P>Homelessness for separated men or women, or the children of that family, can happen very easily. These people fall out of the education net, are not picked up by family resource centres, find themselves sleeping rough on the streets and almost go unnoticed until a neighbour or friend identifies the problem or the child becomes ill and turns up in a hospital. Then all the bells start ringing. However, in the course of the difficulties such children experience as a result of the break-up in the home, no bell rings because the infrastructure within the health boards is simply not adequate to find out about these children. These children do not come to public notice until there is a crisis. We should support that family, because it is basically a unit with participants willing to make it function, albeit from a distance. We cannot allow this situation to continue and I would like to see it addressed by way of the health boards, local government and this Bill.</P>
    <P>The other grouping to which I want to refer is children who are simply out of control. It is interesting the Road Traffic (Joyriding) Bill was debated during Private Members' business last night. Effectively, we are talking about teenagers and children as young as ten years of age, sometimes even younger, who are totally out of control and where no family responsibility is being exercised. These children are out on the streets and doing what they want. Perhaps at this point we should acknowledge the many members of the Defence Forces and the Garda who down through the years turned up at the local community centre after they left their barracks or Garda station and involved the young people in playing football and so on and gave them something to do. They gave these children a way of life other than crime into which so many young people are now entering. The voluntary contribution of these people to society and to the family unit was greatly appreciated. Part of the Bill deals with this issue and puts it on a statutory <Col N="698" /> basis. My concern is that we will train and put in place people who will function during working hours but when these problems emerge, generally speaking they emerge well outside working hours, we will be faced with a serious difficulty. I would like to see that part of the Bill married to the voluntary contribution being made by so many up to now and that effort being encouraged at community level so that there will be seven days a week care and trust for these people who find themselves in difficulty.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that those who quietly suffer, whether in the home or in institutions, no longer have to do so. We must find a way of reaching out to these children. I commend the Minister on bringing the Bill before the House and I hope the debate will unfold some way of ensuring that what happened in the past &ndash; I come from Kilkenny city where we have had a bad experience &ndash; will not happen in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister is in the House this morning and, lest he is replaced by someone else, I will begin with what should be the end of my speech. It may be difficult for the him to listen to all the contributions and take them on board. His mind may be wandering to blue seas around Cahirciveen. However, I will make a point about illiteracy. There is no relationship between illiteracy and intelligence. One of the main reasons there is so much juvenile delinquency is that many children are illiterate. The problem of illiteracy is not being addressed in school &ndash; I am aware this will offend many teachers. Many of my friends are teachers, as is my wife &ndash; because many teachers cannot identify it. If they are lucky enough to identify it, they cannot deal with it, and this includes remedial teachers. </P>
      <P>I have a video of a programme on Channel 4 which I said I would send to the previous Minister for Education and Science. I shall send it to the Minister's private secretary before the end of the month. Perhaps during the Easter period he will have an opportunity to view it. The research was carried out on a detention centre for juvenile delinquents south of Edinburgh. Prior to the survey it was estimated that in Ireland dyslexia affected 4% of the population some time ago; research shows it affects 8% or 10%. Before conducting the survey at the detention centre the researchers estimated it might be 15% or 20%. The results were startling. Some 50% of those in the detention centre suffered from dyslexia. Dyslexia is not a terminal illness. If discovered in time it can be addressed. The esteem of those in the detention centre was increased when the difficulty was addressed. In the past one-third of a class was considered average, one-third was intelligent and one-third was thick as their father and grandfather and were put at the back of the class. That is simply not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there is full employment, 200,000 are unemployed and each year there are 10,000 early school leavers. The 200,000 unemployed includes <Col N="699" /> those 10,000 early school leavers. The Minister will be familiar from his clinics in Kerry with the wife who comes to him and says her husband is due to finish his FÁS scheme in a few weeks' time and he is in a state of depression and asks if his FÁS scheme can be extended. He likes it and gets on great with his colleagues but cannot go out to find a job. The reason for this is that he has a set pattern of work which is not academic and does not involve paperwork. He does not want to go into a factory where there are signs stating one must wear a hard hat, wash hands, clock in and clock out, etc., because he cannot read and is afraid to admit it to his peers. I ask the Minister to bear that in mind and, with the Minister for Education and Science, to set up some research. It is available in the United States and in England and that may save us having to go back to invent the wheel.</P>
    <P>When we look at the Brinks Mat robbery a few years ago, and various other robberies, we ask how they were carried out. We must remember we are dealing with people who commit crime. They may be illiterate but they are intelligent. Their way of striking back at society is to go out and commit crime because society has failed them by not addressing their reading difficulties.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill which has been a long time coming. I note that the Minister in his opening paragraphs stated that he does not wish to take up the time of the House outlining the many twists and turns, over recent years, that have eventually culminated in the Bill and then goes on to do so. No matter what the background, it is important that this Bill has eventually reached Second Stage. It covers three areas of law &ndash; it provides the framework for the development of the juvenile justice system, it re-enacts and updates the 1908 Act and it provides for a family welfare conference and other new provisions for dealing with out-of-control non-offending children.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of how vulnerable children are and while many of us would like to think that Dickens and Fagin do not belong to our age, we are sadly very wrong. One does not have to walk over O'Connell Bridge to witness the exploitation of children; it happens in many other areas of this country and is manifested in many forms, be it in child prostitution in a public toilet or in the collection of glasses in a well established lounge. Many children are simply deserted by their parents. During the Christmas period I had reason to spend several nights in a children's ward in a hospital in Dublin and it was heart wrenching to discover a little three year old boy crying each evening for his mother having not received a visit for over a week. It is difficult to tune into such an existence. However, there is an onus on us to deal with such situations.</P>
    <P>Strangely enough in medieval times, the age of majority became fixed at 21 years but, for all but the upper classes, this was irrelevant since even the very young worked as soon as it became <Col N="700" /> physically possible. In this Bill a "child" means a person under 18 years of age. A child has a limited participation in its own decisions. Children cannot vote, sit on a jury, hold public office or own land. The Children Act, 1908, was the basis for the creation of our present juvenile system and the time has definitely come to revamp our approach and to establish and implement a system that serves our children and our time and causes them to stop and reflect how their actions can impact on victims. This is a theme that could easily be extended right across the criminal law area. Many difficulties have been experienced over the years in introducing comprehensive juvenile justice legislation.</P>
    <P>In the 1980s the Department of Health and Children made proposals, which included juvenile justice provisions, aimed at replacing the 1908 Act. In the mid 1990s the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform took over this work. The key factor which delayed, frustrated and blocked the progress was the difficulty in agreeing the respective responsibilities of the main Departments concerned, namely, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Education and Science. Under new legislation this was overcome when Deputy Currie was appointed Minister of State with responsibility for Children's Affairs at the three Departments and immediately took on the task of progressing this legislation. On his appointment he established under his chairmanship a co-ordinating committee of officials from each of the Departments.</P>
    <P>One of the first tasks of the committee was to break the impasse of responsibility that was holding up progress on a children's juvenile justice Bill. Agreement was reached that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform would be responsible for the detention of 16 and 17 year olds, the Department of Education and Science would be responsible for young offenders under 16 years of age and the Department of Health and Children would be responsible for disturbed non-offending children. Deputy Currie then brought forward the Children Bill, 1996.</P>
    <P>Ireland is not unique in thinking that we have difficulties with juvenile crime. It is a feature of developed countries that problems arise with juvenile delinquency and crime to a greater and lesser extent and many have more serious problems than Ireland. Juvenile crime has been always with us. After feudalism broke down in Europe, every succeeding generation of adults has considered itself to be in the middle of a juvenile crime wave, with some children effectively out of control and it was considered that things were better in the days of their youth.</P>
    <P>The reaction of legislators heretofore has been by and large to introduce harsh measures to deal with delinquency at times of particular concern. Opinion swings full circle when the harsh measures are not seen to work and a more liberal approach is then followed. When this does not work there is a return to the harsher measures <Col N="701" /> and a cycle of juvenile justice oscillation between the two traditional approaches, the juvenile justice delinquency model and the welfare model. It is accepted that this country and this Bill embraces, as did the 1996 Bill, that the most appropriate system for this country is a modified form of a justice model which incorporates suitable elements of the welfare model. This is the best way to break out of the cycle earlier described.</P>
    <P>It facilitates the individual child offender to be dealt with in a way that presents the best and most appropriate hope for rehabilitation while ensuring the common good of society generally, and also ensures that the feelings of the victims of juvenile crime are taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>We must examine clearly why there is such a high level of crime with juveniles at a time when the standard of living of most of the population has never been higher. Studies show that a high percentage of crime is committed by young males who live in the more socially deprived areas of our cities and towns. Drugs are a major factor in many areas but it is also the case that only a small number of children in deprived areas actually become involved in crime. We must learn to know why this happens and detailed studies must be completed to enable us to tackle and deal with the problem rather than dealing as we are in this Bill with the outcome of the problem.</P>
    <P>The juvenile who commits crime is usually a boy from a deprived background. The family is often dysfunctional with a strong possibility that one or both parents, or brothers or sisters, was previously involved in criminal activity. He often suffers from low self-esteem. He will also associate with people who are involved in juvenile delinquency and will be under intense peer pressure. He will have very little medium to long-term planning for his future or for a career. He may have a short attention span and have difficulty relating with other people. He may crave attention and acceptance by his peers through his behavioural activity.</P>
    <P>Most crime committed by children is petty. Larceny is by far the most common and the majority of crime, such as housebreaking, shoplifting and breaking into cars, are committed by boys in the 14-15 age group. For the Bill to operate the Department of Health and Children must provide substantially increased resources to the health boards to develop child and family support services. This difficulty is found in all areas of legislation. A great deal of legislation is being brought forward, perhaps too much, but we cannot implement it because of a lack of resources. While the financial resources may now be available, in many cases the human resources are not.</P>
    <P>More finance must be provided to help in the provision of services for families and children under stress. Residential accommodation facilities and support services for at-risk adolescents and young homeless people must be made available. Parenting courses, family resource centres and counselling and social education programmes <Col N="702" /> must be provided. All schemes must be available and aimed at disadvantaged areas, children in need and parents under stress or who lack parenting skills. Many groups and societies now provide courses in parenting skills. People of an older generation sometimes dismiss the need for them and say that parents should have these skills instinctively, but this is often not the case. Given that we have so many young mothers we must examine the concept of parenting skills courses.</P>
    <P>The objective of these schemes must be to prevent young people becoming involved in crime. It is accepted that young boys need role models. Many families today are single parent families and 95% of these consist of children with their mother whose father is absent. Society is changing fast and the State has a duty to ensure that a child has a right to know his father and to have his father's influence. Society must state that fathers have a duty and responsibility to take a parenting role. If a father is absent or inadequate and a mother is under pressure because of her personal circumstances, young boys look to their peer group to relate. If this group is comprised of young children in similar difficulties it will be easy to become involved in petty crime. With very low self esteem, very little sense of worth and no hope for the future, those young people can get satisfaction from breaking the law and ending up with the proceeds of their crime. They can also quickly learn that the justice system, in their circumstances, does not exist. They no longer fear the gardaí, judges or authority because they understand that nothing will happen them. They can then be influenced by more serious criminals who will use their vulnerability and recklessness to involve them in serious crime which often includes drug related offences.</P>
    <P>The approach of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to increase prison numbers, while welcome, should also include a deep examination of why people start committing crime, what brings them into crime and why they commence on the road which eventually leads them to prison. We must try to get to the root of the problem. Most of the reasons for youthful crime are environmental, educational or social. We must recognise that approximately 90% of prisoners left school before they reached their 16th birthday. This highlights the educational and environmental backgrounds which influence the development of criminal activity in a young person. In most cases it is shown that they are oblivious to the suffering and difficulties they inflict on their victims. They do not understand the trauma such victims go through. In fact, they do not wish to care about this. This must change and such people must be made responsible for the outcome of their activities and be sensitive to the hurt caused.</P>
    <P>The family has changed dramatically. When I was young the traditional family consisted of a mother, father, children and their children. In today's society the family comprises many types of units. It might be composed of a single parent <Col N="703" /> and children or a man and woman who have families from previous relationships as part of their family. This is not a very important issue. What is important is that parents take responsibility for the children in their care. More juvenile offenders are produced from dysfunctional families, particularly where there is a history of alcohol abuse, drug abuse, criminal activity and physical and sexual abuse. The services must assist all families, whether they are described as dysfunctional or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Our present approach is inadequate. It is not right simply to remove the young person and obtain another place for him in an overcrowded detention unit, whether in the short or long-term. The best place for a child to be reared is with his or her family. More emphasis must be placed on the responsibility and duty of parents to bring a child to adulthood and to prepare him to have a productive, happy and fulfilling future.</P>
    <P>Education has a key role. There must be a serious examination of our education system which does not respond to areas of underprivilege. Designed often by comfortable, middle class professionals, it is not accepted by, or relevant to the underprivileged. Juvenile crime must be seriously, comprehensively and radically tackled at its source. Parents have rights but they also have responsibilities and they must not be allowed to abdicate their responsibility for parenting their children. The best opportunity for a child to have a crime-free, drug-free and decent life opportunity is to have a background which is secure and supportive. Detention for child offenders must only be seen as a last resort. Alternative forms of sentencing must have a priority. Community service must be developed and better funded and monitored, with meaningful and productive projects and programmes to involve the child and to bring to the child a sense of contribution to the good of the community while under the supervision in the schemes.</P>
    <P>The combination of increased community service and the curfew provided for in the 1996 and 1999 legislation will have several benefits. It will keep the young offender out of prison and detention, thus having an effect on both those systems by reducing overcrowding. The work which is provided must be productive and designed to sow the seeds of community and civic spirit in the offender. The community will benefit from the work done. Community service must be suitable in terms of where it takes place, the length of time on the service and its value to the community. This approach, installing in the offender a sense of rehabilitation, must be the overriding factor with the punitive or humiliating aspect of such service being minimised.</P>
    <P>Adequate Government funding must be provided for community centres where young people are encouraged to keep active and occupied. Drug related crime involving juveniles must be closely examined. We must look at all types of <Col N="704" /> drug related crime such as possession, feeding the habit and crimes committed while under the influence of drugs. I call for more funding for drug treatment programmes for juveniles. These must be introduced as a matter of urgency and I compliment the former Minister of State, Deputy Flood, who has done Trojan work in this area. Young offenders might be given a choice of detention for the full statutory period or a reduced sentence with attendance at intoxication treatment programmes.</P>
    <P>Education is the way out of the difficulties experienced by many communities. The education programmes must respond to the difficulties experienced in these communities. In modern Ireland we emphasise the individual more than the group. In the more affluent areas young people are given the means to achieve their expectations, including a thorough formal education. In many families in such areas there is an automatic expectation that the child will attend a third level institution. In some less well-off families an interest and motivation is instilled in young people and the means are given to obtain a trade or skill.</P>
    <P>I cannot over emphasise the importance of literacy. The Minister could be the man to address this issue. Like Socrates he could adopt an idea, although I hope he will not come to a similar end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill and I welcome the opportunity to make this contribution to the debate.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Timmins's comments regarding literacy. Two years ago, this was the first issue selected for study by the Joint Committee on Education and Science. Literacy levels in Ireland and Great Britain are frighteningly low compared with other countries in northern Europe. This is why there has been such an emphasis on adult education which covers all areas of literacy. Green Papers and White Papers on this issue have been published. While people may be able to read words on a page, they may not be able, for example, to follow instructions on a medicine bottle. Frustration and even danger can follow from this inability. I am glad this issue has been mentioned and that funding is now being provided for adult and ongoing education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have recently had debates on the Children Bill, the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Bill and the Education (Welfare) Bill. The emphasis is on issues that affect children, of which literacy is one. One gets the impression in listening to debates on the subject that children are only interested in watching television. In many instances they are addicted to it. In this respect parents and the media have an important to role to play. I am critical of the level of violence depicted on television programmes. Many children have said to me that they would like to see more sports programmes on television. Perhaps this is one of the reasons Sky Television can <Col N="705" /> devote a series of channels to such programmes. This is a matter RTE should examine.</P>
    <P>While there may not be a swimming pool or games room in many small towns and villages, there is normally a sports field where games such as gaelic football, soccer and rugby are played. We must applaud community and voluntary organisations on the great efforts they are making to help children participate in sport. This is one of the areas which must be examined in the context of the White Paper on rural development which states that all policies must be rural proofed in considering new decentralisation programmes. At its meeting yesterday the National Economic and Social Forum highlighted the need for poverty and eco proofing. It should be clearly stated, however, that all policies should be child centred. This applies to the new national school curriculum in respect of which teachers are undergoing in-service training. National lottery funds should be spent on the provision of sports and other facilities for children in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs also has a role to play. Although the economy is performing well, many families encounter great difficulties in meeting the cost of school uniforms and school contributions. To reduce the size of local contributions in recent days the Minister for Education and Science announced an increase in school grants. While this is welcome, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance should be improved.</P>
    <P>Children in particular are hooked on advertisements, particularly in the run-up to Christmas when great pressure is exerted on parents. The major British soccer clubs seem to change their jerseys and shorts every few months. Children want to have the latest strip.</P>
    <P>I join the Minister and other Deputies in paying tribute to Deputy Currie on the work he put into the 1996 Bill. As the Minister said it had to be replaced by this more comprehensive Bill which repeals the Children Act, 1908, and deals with three main areas of law. It provides a modern statutory framework for the further development of the juvenile justice system, re-enacts and updates provisions in the 1908 Act protecting children against abuse by persons who have the custody, charge or care of them, and provides for family welfare conferences and other new provisions for dealing with out-of-control non-offending children.</P>
    <P>Several Parts of the Bill are the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Children, namely, the Parts that deal with family welfare conferences, children in need of special care and treatment and special residential services. There will therefore be an overlap. The health boards will be involved in family welfare conferences given that the child concerned is in need of care or protection.</P>
    <P>By reason of their age and level of maturity, young offenders deserve to be treated differently and more humanely than adult offenders. The juvenile justice system developed under the 1908 <Col N="706" /> Act is incapable of further development unless this is underpinned by new legislation. The Minister mentioned the new restorative justice measures. With modern thinking, which is reflected in the Bill, in time there should be a noticeable decrease in juvenile offending. The Minister stated that the objective of the Bill is to divert first-time and non-serious child offenders away from inclusion in the criminal justice system and that he wants to provide the courts with means under which they do not necessarily have to proceed to a finding, usually of guilt in more serious or persistent cases. Such cases may be referred to the health boards for the convening of a family welfare conference or to the probation and welfare service for the convening of a family conference.</P>
    <P>The issue of joyriding is being debated on Private Members' time. I have been frightened by some of the descriptions given. Some joyriders are known to be addicted to so-called recreational drugs and alcohol. This is one of the aspects to which the Minister has given some thought. The Bill provides for ten community based sanctions, of which eight are new. It also provides for the reintegration into the community of child offenders placed in detention as a last resort by the courts.</P>
    <P>The concept of restorative justice was pioneered in New Zealand and is now being followed in a number of other countries. The Bill gives effect to its most commonly known meaning &ndash; every action that is primarily orientated towards doing justice by restoring the harm caused by a crime. One way of doing this is to bring together all the parties involved to deal collectively with the aftermath of the offence and its implications for the future. </P>
    <P>On Committee Stage of the Education (Welfare) Bill there was reference to the fact that the Garda Síochána has been involved in early intervention by <i>ad hoc </i>committees where children leave school early. The attempts made in Tuam have been very successful. While such committees should not be placed on a statutory basis, by the same token they should not be excluded by way of actions taken under legislation. The gardaí concerned were effectively doing the work of school attendance officers which were located only in Dublin and other cities.</P>
    <P>The two examples of restorative justice in the Bill include the New Zealand model. We cannot directly transplant a country's model into the Irish system but the proposals are new and the Garda diversion programme in Part 4 is a good example of restorative justice. It is incorporated into the programme which may or may not be chaired by a garda, but it will provide a forum for the child, his or her parents and other family members, possibly other interested persons and, where appropriate, a victim to discuss the child's offending and the reasons for it. It will confront the child with the consequences of his or her actions and establish the basis for a lifestyle that does not include anti-social behaviour. It will <Col N="707" /> allow the child to apologise and possibly make reparation to the victim.</P>
    <P>There is also a unique provision called restorative cautioning in section 26 under which the victim may be present for the administration of a formal caution to the child. This allows for a less formal type of conference which will be suited to cases where the more structured conference might not be appropriate or justifiable. The courts will also be given the power to direct the Probation and Welfare Service to convene family conferences. These will be similar to the Garda conferences but they will be appropriate in cases where the Garda consider that it had no option but to prosecute, that is, where the non-enforceable aspect of the Garda conference might have led to compliance difficulties.</P>
    <P>The benefit and advantages of the court directed conferences are that there is an opportunity for the case against the child to be finalised without proceeding to a finding and all that would entail. The child and his or her family will have a say in finding a solution. It will not have been imposed by the court. The outcome of the conference will be supervised by the court and enforceable. It is not an easy outcome. The recommendations of a family conference may include making an apology to the victim, making reparation, restriction on the child's movements and participation by the child in supervised activities.</P>
    <P>The age of criminal responsibility is raised in the Bill from seven to 12 years. Children under that age will become the responsibility of the health boards and among their intervention options will be the convening of a family welfare conference. The Minister gave good arguments in favour of raising the age to 12 years. He stated that, after a thorough examination of the issues involved, a former Dáil committee on crime recommended the age of 12 years in its first report. He also stated that the UN committee on the rights of the child criticised the low age of criminal responsibility in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I understand the number of children under 12 years of age who come to the notice of the Garda is relatively small. The 1999 crime report shows that the number of children under 12 years of age reported to the Garda national juvenile office on suspicion of committing offences was approximately 1,000. Not all of those will require alternative intervention. Although raising the age to 12 years will mean that children under that age who commit offences will no longer qualify for admission to the Garda diversion programme, they will still have contact with community gardaí. This will be on a more integrated and co-operative basis with other agencies such as health boards.</P>
    <P>It would not be possible to raise the age in stages by means of regulations as proposed in the 1996 Bill. This is because of the Supreme Court decision in the Laurentiu case where it is likely that a power to raise the age in regulations would, if challenged, have been found to be unconsti<Col N="708" /> tutional. Regardless of the specific arguments, raising the age of criminal responsibility at this time to 12 years is the right course of action. It is the age below which we should not wish our children to be criminalised.</P>
    <P>I praise the work of health boards, particularly the Western Health Board of which I was a member, in helping children who are abandoned and have to be taken into care. In the Western Health Board region, on occasion it was necessary to find facilities for children outside the country. I hope funding will be provided to ensure that such centres and facilities can be established in health board regions in the future.</P>
    <P>The two new court powers mentioned by the Minister may result in cases not proceeding to finality. The first is the family conference while the second relates to the health boards convening a family welfare conference to ascertain whether the child's real problem is a need for care or protection. These are two important new additions to the Bill and highlight the greater emphasis on care and protection and restorative justice. Where the court proceeds to a finding of guilt, it will usually request a probation officer's report. The only circumstances in which a report will not be requested is where the court is imposing a minor penalty such as a small fine or where it already has available to it an up to date report on the child. The system of reports is central to the success of the Bill. They will not only contain information resulting from interviews with the child and, where practicable, other family members on the child's behaviour and willingness to make amends, educational circumstances and prospects, motives for the offence and likelihood of reoffending, but they will also give a view on what would be the best way of dealing with the child and what is available.</P>
    <P>A most important provision relates to the responsibility of parents for their delinquent children. The Minister said there are situations where action must be taken on this issue. Two existing provisions which require parents to pay compensation or to be bound over to control their children have been added to by the inclusion of a parental supervision order. The court will be empowered to impose this order on parents where it is satisfied that a wilful failure on the part of the parents to take care of or control their child contributed to the child's offending. This is a typical carrot and stick approach under which the parents will, for example, be given the opportunity to take part in a parenting skills course or get treatment for substance abuse. Failure to comply may result in them being in contempt of court.</P>
    <P>The protection provisions essentially update the provisions of the 1908 Act. They have not changed radically from the 1996 Bill, but there are two significant differences. First, the scope of the cruelty offence has been broadened to include a child's mental or emotional health or well-being. The 1996 Bill referred only to physical health or well-being. Second, the Criminal Law <Col N="709" /> (Sexual Offences) Act, 1993, is being amended to raise the penalty for soliciting a child for the purpose of prostitution. This is essentially a holding operation pending a more considered examination of the issue of child prostitution in the context of the analysis of the discussion paper on the law on sexual offences.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State on their work on the Bill. It is an improvement on work done in the past and I hope it will make speedy progress through both Houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate arises in the wake of a study by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions which shows that two out of three children in secondary education in the State are working part-time. Despite all the talk about education being the key to the success of our economy, school children are going out to work in increasing numbers. The trend continues where more children from lower income families are dropping out of education before the leaving certificate to enter the workplace. They often earn low wages and work in poor conditions. These statistics are staggering and they say something about the value placed on children in our market driven society.</P>
      <P>The National Minimum Wage Bill, which was enacted last week, contains provisions which discriminate against those under the age of 18 and those in training in terms of the application of the minimum wage. The long-term aspirations and expectations of many children from low income families continue to be low. The Bill addresses the problems arising for children where society has already failed them at the start of their lives. This is the immediate backdrop to this debate and it reminds us that while there is much in the Bill that is welcome, it is also overdue and necessary. The test will be its implementation.</P>
      <P>We must not only recognise the rights of children, we must also provide the resources to vindicate those rights.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the most overdue provision in the Bill is that which abolishes reformatories and industrial schools. These places exist now only in name and, thankfully, no longer resemble the dreadful institutions of the past with their disgraceful neglect and shocking abuse of children for which both Church and State were responsible. People who suffered in these prisons have only felt able to reveal the full truth of their horrific childhood experiences in recent years. Their stories demonstrate how lowly the rights of all children were regarded for decades in this State. We may have emerged from that dark age but we still have a long way to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides a new framework for the development of the juvenile justice system. It replaces the 1908 Act to protect children against those who have custody, charge or care of them and provides for family conferences and other measures to deal with "out of control, non-offending children". I am happy to record that I <Col N="710" /> welcome the general thrust of the juvenile justice provisions which place emphasis on the rights of the child and introduce new ideas. The concepts of family conferences, action plans and restorative cautioning have the potential to be progressive and constructive.</P>
    <P>For the first time in the legal system, the idea of restorative justice has been introduced and that has significance beyond this Bill. I would like to see it developed, monitored and introduced in other legislation as a real alternative to imprisonment. That opens up a whole new vista and gives rise to a debate in which I look forward to engaging. Such alternatives to imprisonment must be developed because the rate of committal in this State is disgracefully high. I have spoken in the House previously about the scandalous conditions in what I can only describe as the "hell hole" that is the male section in Mountjoy Prison. I would like the more enlightened aspects of this Bill which deal with imprisonment to be applied on the wider front.</P>
    <P>The raising of the age of criminal responsibility from seven to 12 is a central provision of the Bill. This is a welcome and necessary development. It means that children will be removed from the criminal justice system and placed directly under the care of the Probation and Welfare Service. That brings us to the vital question of implementation. While the reforms are progressive &ndash; I am pleased to have the opportunity to acknowledge that &ndash; the reality is that the probation service is grossly underfunded and understaffed. The majority of probation and welfare officers have a caseload of up to, for the want of a better description, 70 clients. If the provisions of this Bill are to be implemented in full, this caseload will inevitably increase. That is a major concern to me.</P>
    <P>In addition to an increase in numbers of clients, section 260 also makes provision to extend the duties of probation and welfare officers under the Probation of Offenders Act, 1907, to all cases under this Bill where a child is placed under the supervision of a probation and welfare officer. In 1998, probation officers were on the verge of taking industrial action due to gross underfunding and the massive caseload with which they were expected to cope. At the eleventh hour, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform gave assurances that staffing levels would be increased. Unless this actually happens, the provisions in the Children Bill, 1999, cannot be implemented. It is imperative to stress that point.</P>
    <P>The costs involved in establishing the special care units provided for are massive. I am conscious of the fact that a special care facility to cater for the needs of four health board regions is earmarked for construction in the town of Castleblayney which is situated in my constituency. While such facilities are necessary, the reality is that, unless provision is made for effective community based projects, early intervention and the full range of preventative measures, the problems to which I refer and the attendant costs of special care will continue to escalate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="711" /> The Bill is essentially an extension of the Child Care Act, 1991. However, many of the provisions contained in that Act have yet to be implemented in full. Inspectorates of residential homes are only up and running now, eight years after provision was made for their establishment. I ask the Minister to inform the House of the programme for implementation of the provisions in the Bill. How long will we be obliged to wait before sufficient probation and welfare officers are employed and before the restorative justice provisions are up and running? I pose those questions respectfully and I would appreciate if, in his reply, the Minister would address these pertinent and central questions.</P>
    <P>In shaping my view of the Bill, I had the assistance of a person who has worked at what can only be described as the cutting edge in the care of troubled children. The point he emphasised above all is the need for the earliest possible intervention to prevent children from coming within the ambit of the Bill. This means combating social, economic and educational disadvantage at the earliest age possible and providing pre-school services and every necessary and remedial assistance in the formal school system. As elected representatives with significant knowledge of cases referred in our constituencies, we must recognise that this advice, which was provided by someone who works at the coalface, makes eminent sense, not only in terms of the provisions of the Children Bill, 1999, but also across an entire gamut of the concerns which affect society.</P>
    <P>I wish to place on record the advice I received from the gentleman to whom I refer:</P>
    <P>Unless we have these programmes in place, then we are basically firefighting at a later stage. Many of the kids who end up in care or get involved in offending behaviour are identifiable at a young age. Residential and special care units while necessary are expensive to run and limited in what they can achieve as in many cases the damage has already been done. If you can get to them and to their family and community at an earlier stage they have a much better chance.</P>
    <P>That is good advice which I am happy to share with Members, the Minister and the Department. It is critical that we take it on board and act accordingly.</P>
    <P>The need for legislation such as this highlights how Irish society has failed children. I hope that when enacted, and with the necessary resources provided to implement it, the Bill can contribute to more just, humane and progressive treatment for the children who will come within its remit and, as a consequence, for all children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>How often have we scratched our heads, put our hands in the air, experienced sheer frustration and bewilderment and been aghast at the misbehaviour of juveniles? How <Col N="712" /> often have we asked who is responsible and whether we can make anybody responsible? Is it the parents, the school, the justice system or society in general? Is there proper co-ordination between State services in the provision of facilities and services for young people?</P>
      <P>What has become of the school attendance register, the first indicator of family dysfunction? Why is it no longer the feature of school life? Why are so many young people begging on the streets? Are they being forced onto the streets and who is responsible for doing that? Why are so many juveniles involved in pickpocketing and other petty crime? Have they been trained for it and who trains them? How many families have been affected by loitering and anti-social behaviour by juveniles? When they seek help from State services they do not get the response they expect. Look at the prevalence of bullying. What is the definition of bullying? This has never been tackled. There is also the problem of the emergence of gangs and the dangers this poses for other juveniles.</P>
      <P>These questions have been prioritised and to say they are being answered in this Bill would be an understatement. The Children Bill, 1999, is probably one of the most important Bills published in the last 50 years. If passed, it will affect the lives of thousands of children over many decades, as was the case with its predecessor, the 1908 Act. It is one of a number of fundamentally important initiatives in relation to children which this Government has brought to fruition. The Bill is also the culmination of work by previous Administrations, a fact that is not always acknowledged although the Minister did so in his speech. Other important initiatives include the recently introduced child abuse guidelines and the establishment of an inspectorate of social services.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a serious and necessary reappraisal of the 1996 Bill introduced by the then Minister of State, Deputy Currie. The emphasis is on the most up-to-date and sophisticated methods of dealing with juvenile justice and associated child welfare which take account of best international practice. It deals more progressively with parental responsibility and seeks to identify and correct the structural weaknesses in how services have been provided to young offenders and to disturbed non-offending children. For these and other important reasons, the 1996 Bill would have required hundreds of amendments so the Minister was wise to take the decision to introduce his own Bill, a better and more comprehensive measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of issues have been raised which demand comment. The interaction between education, health and justice is of paramount importance. I agree with Deputy Ó Caoláin that we must reach young children before they reach the coalface of offending. The decision of the Minister for Education and Science to reintroduce the attendance register for schools is vital. We must also realise how important self concept is for young people. We must be conscious of the ego <Col N="713" /> of the individual, the drive to succeed in life. Lack of that drive can be one of the causes of anti-social behaviour.</P>
    <P>The role of teachers has become more complicated. Not only must they deal with teaching and education, they must also deal with the social umbrella they encounter in the schoolroom. As chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, I was involved in procuring a report on attention deficit disorder. It is revealing that statistics in the United States show that 30% of prison inmates suffered from ADD. It is significant that the vast majority of these people went through their schooling without the condition ever being detected. Why would it be? Who was trained to detect ADD? Nowadays we realise that parents have to deal with the anti-social behaviour of children with this condition while they can be a disruptive force in the classroom. Often parents are unable to recognise the condition so it falls on teachers, in liaison with the social services, to ensure it is recognised at an early age.</P>
    <P>The problems of illiteracy and truancy are linked and the teacher and school have as great a role in dealing with them as parents. Often, however, due to the family circumstances, this role is not undertaken in a serious way by parents. Dyslexia, as Deputy Timmins pointed out, is another condition which teachers are expected to recognise at an early age in children. Everybody is aware of the difficulties associated with dyslexia, the disruption that can occur in the classroom and the lack of self concept for the children concerned, when the condition is not recognised by the teacher or the school.</P>
    <P>In drafting the Bill the Minister has recognised the serious role education plays in early childhood years, the importance of ensuring teacher training and setting aside school days for special training needs and ensuring there is integration in the approach of the schools, the health service and the justice system. Perhaps the most progressive and unique feature of the Bill is that is does not devise a system based exclusively on a particular approach to the problem of juvenile offending. That is welcome. It is based on many approaches to combating juvenile offending and is the right approach. The problem with the single based approach was that the system became more important than the needs and the misdeeds of the offender who could only be dealt with within the narrow confines of the system in favour at a particular time. I applaud the Minister's proposal to supplement rather than supplant the provision on which the system is based. It is essential in legislation such as this not to close off avenues for dealing with young offenders.</P>
    <P>While the Bill uses various approaches in dealing with juvenile offenders, many of its constituent parts are supported by a set of principles or objectives. That the Bill states clearly what it hopes to accomplish is an innovation. It has respect for those involved. It states: "to use as tools in combating juvenile crime." These sets of <Col N="714" /> principles and objectives allow for less confusion and more progress in dealing with juveniles.</P>
    <P>The philosophy that children do not belong in court is long overdue and is welcome. As Deputy Micheal Kitt mentioned, raising the age of criminal responsibility from seven to ten years was recommended by the committee on crime and also in the first human rights report on the rights of children. In line with those two recommendations, the Minister has adopted the right approach that 12 rather than ten years of age is the most appropriate age.</P>
    <P>There has been concern that children may have been criminalised in the past for many of the wrong reasons. There was a temptation for those involved to charge young offenders with a crime to ensure they received care and protection in an institutional setting. That was wrong but it was the thinking at the time.</P>
    <P>The family welfare conferences are important. Before this Bill was introduced, many people questioned the role, rights and responsibilities of parents relative to their under age children. There was a view that if families were made more responsible, a stricter regime in terms of control might be in place in the home and children might be made far more responsible.</P>
    <P>Family conferences will be good for a number of reasons. They will be good for families because they will establish straight away how dysfunctional a family is, the needs assessments of the family, the support systems which should be put in place and what holistic approach in terms of education, health and justice should be provided. </P>
    <P>Many parents who allow their children out to play with others feel their children have a sense of responsibility. However, they might often not be aware of the behaviour of their children in the groups which form. It is only after early correction that those families will become aware of what is going on, the places where disruptive behaviour occurs and the consequences for the other children and families who suffer at the hands of those children. The early warning signs are important.</P>
    <P>In the case of a dysfunctional family, the question arises as to how one gets them to attend a family conference if they do not want to. That is why it is important the Garda Síochána is involved in terms of liaison with the family conferences, that parents are made responsible, that support is given to parents who need it and that the services are in a position to provide the care which is important in these instances. </P>
    <P>Victims have been given a status in the Bill which is far greater than that given before. The toughest thing for anyone who has committed a crime is to see the person against whom the crime has been perpetrated. A sense of reality strikes at that stage. Looking at the human psyche, when victims of crime are faced with the perpetrator, many have a charitable instinct and wish to ensure that rather than any major retribution, corrective measures are put in place to ensure the juvenile who has become involved in that crime <Col N="715" /> would be given the support and help necessary to put them on the right path.</P>
    <P>In the case of crime by juveniles, it important, where there is an ability to pay compensation, that families are made face up to that responsibility. They have not been made face that responsibility until now. This is an extremely important feature in the Bill.</P>
    <P>On the question of curfews, how many people come to our clinics to say young people are loitering outside their houses, particularly if it is a corner house? The Garda are called but as there are so many avenues out of the area, it is possible to evade them. These conferences will be important from the point of view of the curfews they can put in place. They will be able to indicate clearly to the offender that he should not to be in a given location for the next six months and that he is not to associate with particular groups for a specific period. That will hang over the individual. It is also important that after three years of good behaviour, the criminal record of a young person who has had to go to a detention school is removed. That is an extremely important provision in the Bill and one I very much welcome.</P>
    <P>People have spoken about the resources and the time scale for introducing the Bill. I say pointedly that the most important thing is that legislation is in place. While the effectiveness of the Bill will depend on the resources available, everybody should recognise that by having such legislation in place, there is pressure to provide those resources. Whatever one might say about the Child Care Act, which was introduced on a phased basis, people can see that the resources put into child care have increased dramatically over the years of the implementation of that Act.</P>
    <P>Two difficulties arise with this Bill and I seek clarification. In regard to Mr. Justice Kelly, the High Court and the facilities available, is there a major difference between the type of facility Mr. Justice Kelly seeks to have available and that which would be available under the Bill? I understand there is and I would like that clarified.</P>
    <P>There is a problem in the era of the Celtic tiger with recruiting qualified staff. While massive additional resources are being put in place, it will not be easy to recruit the numbers of staff required to ensure the effectiveness of the Bill. Perhaps the Minister of State can recall the "Children First" review approach which had a three year lead-in. Is it proposed to have a similar phased approach to the implementation of the Bill in terms of resources and facilities?</P>
    <P>This is an excellent Bill in concept and content. I welcome it and it is timely. The length of time spent on its gestation was worthwhile because it is comprehensive and will be seen in time as a milestone in legislation concerning children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, who will have a huge input into what we aspire to do under this Bill. The Bill attempts to create inclusion, not exclusion, and to <Col N="716" /> bring together the dislocated parts of the system which do not work together and communicate with each other and which are not fully resourced.</P>
      <P>As I waited to make my contribution, I was reminded of the truth of the saying, which originated in Africa, that it takes a village to raise a child. That is a difficulty with which this society and other modern societies must cope. We no longer have enough villages caring for children because of the changes in society. I would like the Bill to focus on how we can create that community and sense of responsibility, both professional and voluntary, to allow for support not just for children but also for parents. The manner in which families develop, the resources at the disposal of parents and the power they have in parenting makes a world of difference to how children turn out.</P>
      <P>The pleasure in discussing the Bill is that it will be done in the knowledge that, while vast resources will be needed, for the first time in the experience of the State, resources can, must and will be available. A further pleasure is that £500 million more than was expected was received in revenue in the first quarter of this year. Imagine the difference it would make if that amount of money were invested in child care, in intervening to aid parents at risk, in poverty-stricken families and in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>I will have an opportunity as a member of the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights to discuss the Bill again on Committee Stage. I will not, therefore, bother dealing with the sections in detail now. A great deal could be done in making the Bill work and making it redundant in the penal area to give advantages and opportunities to children so they do not become involved in circumstances where there is talk of curfews and parents having to pay fines. We must start at the beginning. The Minister of State is aware of the value of access to good quality, professional child care from an early age, especially in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>The Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights studied a report from the expert working group on child care which examined the effect of good quality child care, especially on children in disadvantaged areas. Statistics in the United States of America showed a seven fold return on the investment made in child care in that there was less criminality and the children who received this opportunity of pre-school and good quality child care stayed in school longer and had greater career opportunities and earning potential. Statistics exist, apart from our own experience, which show that that type of investment in child care across the board at the same standard for all children is essential. It does a great deal to give them a head start and allow them enter formal education on a level playing field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A development in built-up areas which shows how our society has changed considerably, and to which Deputy O'Keeffe and others referred, is <Col N="717" /> children loitering at the sides of buildings or on waste dumps. We must invest in sports facilities for children. If children have good constructive leisure activities and a sense of the community coming together, competing and excelling, it would assist them to develop normally and outside the gang structure. We know that is part of the solution.</P>
    <P>National and international statistics repeatedly prove that if attention deficit disorder and dyslexia are not tackled and are exacerbated children drop out at an early stage, become excluded from the system and, consequently, from any type of career opportunity. Intervention is needed at an early age and I welcome the fact that we have an economy and a Department of Education and Science which will continue to invest at that level.</P>
    <P>It is always helpful to draw on models in other countries. They can be studied and their best features adopted. Much of the Bill concentrates on bringing together qualified personnel with a certain amount of voluntary input and the sharing of information through panels, family courts and the monitoring of children to prevent as many of them as possible from becoming subject to the penal system.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State and her staff may be aware of the model in Scotland which appears to have a higher rate of success than the systems used previously and which continue to be used in the rest of Britain.</P>
    <P>A fact sheet produced by the Scottish Office Information Directorate in August 1997 summarises Baroness Linklater of Butterstone who, speaking in the House of Lords on 24 March 1999 regarding this project, said:</P>
    <P>The setting up of the Medway Secure Training Centre was an initiative which was doomed to failure. Some young offenders are locked up without exercise or fresh air for 24 hours a day. Before Medway was built, we knew that community-based options had the greatest chance of success in terms of re-offending rates, as well as being significantly cheaper: it costs £2,400 per week to keep a child in Medway, whereas in a community-based project I know in Scotland called Freagarrach, it costs £330 per week. Strategies involving families, local agencies and programmes well focused on offending behaviour were the only ones that had some hope of effecting change. Medway was found to have a reconviction rate as high as 100% whereas in Freagarrach the reoffending rate is less than 40%.</P>
    <P>I was excited by this model and quite a lot of British and Irish politicians have visited Freagarrach and been very impressed. Much of the programmes this centre is developing are similar to the contents and aspirations of this Bill. For instance, there is an offenders groupwork programme dealing with attitudes to offending, drug and alcohol awareness and masculinity. The report states that:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="718" /> Due to the fact that almost 95% of referrals to the project are young men, the issue of masculinity in relation to offending was high on the agenda. The issues covered within the group included self-awareness, assertiveness, peer pressure, attitudes towards women and challenging stereotypes.</P>
    <P>We are all concerned about difficulties and alienation experienced by young men and this is an interesting part of the programme. The programme also concentrates on making offenders aware of victims and the effects of their behaviour on victims. Car related offences are addressed with young people attending a car theft groupwork programme and a video is used to highlight the consequences.</P>
    <P>This programme in very practical and also involves family network meetings and other measures to support families. Families are often powerless and feel totally unable to cope with the offending child and it must be very helpful for them to know that they have professional and group support. We must start from the premise that all parents want to be good parents. They want to bring up their children well and for them to be successful and happy. We must allow parents who do not have those skills or who did not have the privilege of a good family experience to obtain such skills. If the provisions of this Bill can be implemented, society and the penal system will save in the long run by having far fewer reconvictions and recidivism. It is very sad that people become so institutionalised by prison that they have no option but to return to an institution. The country is small enough and the economy is performing well enough to allow us to break that mould with legislation such as this.</P>
    <P>Scotland also brought about radical change by setting up the children's hearing system which is encapsulated in sections of this Bill. The principles underlying the system are that children appearing before the courts, whether they have committed offences or are in need of care or protection, have common needs for social and personal care. The committee on children and young persons considered that the juvenile courts were unsuited to dealing with those problems because they had to combine the characteristics of a criminal court of law with those of a treatment agency. Instead it set up hearings where a reporter had referrals made regarding children deemed to need compulsory supervision measures. Children's panels were set up. The report states:</P>
    <P>Members of the Children's Panel volunteer to serve and come from a wide range of occupations, neighbourhood and income groups. All have experience of and interest in children and the ability to communicate with them and their families. There is an approximate balance between men and women; panel members are recruited between the ages of 18 and 60. Members are carefully prepared for their task through initial training programmes and have continuing opportunities during the period of <Col N="719" /> service to develop knowledge and skills and attend in-service training courses. People are appointed to the panels by the Secretary of State for Scotland. The task of the selection is the responsibility of the Children's Panel Advisory Committee for the local authority area.</P>
    <P>This is an important provision because local authorities know the calibre, qualifications and commitment of the people involved. The report outlines that the initial period of appointment for a panel member is up to 5 years and is renewable on the recommendation of the CPAC. This approach combines professional and voluntary services and the support of the community. We should consider providing for such an approach in this Bill. The children's hearing system has been the subject of a considerable body of research, most of it carried out by researchers based at Scottish universities, sometimes with the support of funds from other countries. A review of the research has been published.</P>
    <P>In the consideration and implementation of this Bill, it is essential that there is independence, monitoring and research. There must also be an annual report. Many legal and other agencies will be established under this Bill comprising qualified social workers and a large input from the Garda. People designated to take on these important jobs will have to be remunerated for the extra work, qualifications, commitment and training involved. We will have to place financial importance on the value of their work if we are to attract highly qualified, committed and motivated people.</P>
    <P>There is a need for such agencies and for the urgent enactment of this Bill. Judges in the Children's Court are very frustrated by the lack of suitable alternative projects to which they can refer children who need special care and treatment. As legislators we are ashamed that judges have to send highly disturbed children who need support, understanding and resources to institutions which are totally unsuited to their needs. A recent case involved the recurring appearance of a 17 year old, highly disturbed young woman who needs much care and treatment. This woman was sent to the Central Mental Hospital, although it is unsuited to her needs. That is a matter of grave concern.</P>
    <P>I welcome the serious penalties which will be imposed on adults who are found to have introduced children to sexual abuse or who abuse them. The high levels of child prostitution and homelessness cannot be ignored. They have a horrifying impact on all those they affect.</P>
    <P>The new agencies and panels must be monitored and must operate in a transparent fashion. We must ensure such bodies do not become enclaves of professionals but remain accountable. There is concern about the family law courts. Once they became private, disturbing reports began to emerge from them. The people involved should be allowed to remain unidentified but the <Col N="720" /> conferences should be monitored and public reports should be allowed. The possibility of intervention by other qualified staff or legislators if they are concerned about the workings of these bodies should exist. </P>
    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn" hpid="Ms Cooper-Flynn Ms Cooper-Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. There is not a town or village which does not suffer crimes committed by children. Such crimes have caused distress to parents, schools and communities. It is timely that a Bill of this nature should come before the House. </P>
      <P>In my county there has been an increase in the number of crimes committed by children. There are many different reasons for that &ndash; lack of parental control, bullying in school, peer pressure, drug and alcohol abuse and family breakdown. Whatever the reasons, we must address this issue in a creative manner.</P>
      <P>This Bill seeks creative solutions to a difficult problem, children becoming increasingly involved in crime. The co-operation between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Education and Science in drafting the Bill was most welcome. These three Departments deal with children's issues and it was right to involve all of them in the consultation process.</P>
      <P>I welcome the philosophy that children do not belong in the courts or in prison. In keeping with that philosophy, the Bill raises the age of criminal responsibility from seven to 12 years. We must ensure that children do not offend or, if they do, do not continue to offend. It is vital that we put in place the facilities to ensure children get every chance to avoid a life of criminality. In many cases they are only looking for a second chance or seeking attention; many juvenile crimes are committed because children are ignored by their parents. If we sit down with those parents in an environment which is conducive to the children recognising that they are doing wrong, we will see a reduction in crime committed by children. The Bill gives us an opportunity to turn young people away from crime. </P>
      <P>It is important that victims have their interests protected. They have nothing to fear from any of the proposals in the Bill. It does not let children involved in crime off the hook, it makes them realise that what they are doing is wrong and that they must make recompense to the victims. The advantages of restorative justice are well documented and it is an innovative way of dealing with these problems. It is important that the child offender and his or her family is involved in arriving at an equitable solution and that the offender be made aware of the effect of his or her criminal behaviour on the victim, possibly in the presence of the victim. When a child is confronted with the victim of the crime, it can have a stark effect which can turn him or her away from crime permanently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Young offenders should be dealt with differently because of their level of maturity. This Bill attempts to ensure they do not get sucked into a <Col N="721" /> criminal way of life. Young people deserve to be treated differently because there is still time to persuade them to follow a different way of life. The juvenile justice system has developed from the Act of 1908 and a Bill of this nature is long overdue. With modern thinking, and the co-operation of all sides of the House in passing the Bill quickly, there will be a noticeable decrease in juvenile offending in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The objective of the Bill is to divert first time and non-serious juvenile offenders from the criminal justice system. We do not want to see young children with criminal records, we want to see as few "guilty" verdicts as possible. The Bill provides the courts with a means by which they do not necessarily have to proceed to a finding of guilt but can look at other alternatives such as family welfare conferences. These conferences can be organised by the gardaí or the health board. The health boards are already responsible for children under 12 years of age and now they will have greater responsibility in cases where children are not involved in serious crime. For more serious crimes there can be a court conference. It is important to bring the family together, the parents or guardians and the child, so everyone is involved in working out a solution. Experts should not lay down the law on parenting. We want children and parents to realise, in front of the victim, that they have done wrong and must change their ways.</P>
    <P>The community sanctions in section 115, eight of which are new, are welcome. The last thing we want to see is the imprisonment of a young child; that should be the last resort in all cases. If there is anything we can do before that happens then that option must be explored.</P>
    <P>I spoke to a number of garda in my county of Mayo who have dealt with child offenders in recent months. There has been a fairly significant increase in the number of offences by children in my town recently. It has become a major talking point. It has been a major issue in other areas long before now but it is beginning to trickle down to all areas. Every town and village is affected by it. The bottom line is that once the gardaí sit down with the parents, the child and the victim, that is sufficient in a large number of cases to ensure the child moves away from crime. Where this process and approach are working, we should promote them more. We are talking about reintegrating child offenders back into the community. The detention of the child offender should only be a last resort.</P>
    <P>Restorative justice refers to every action primarily orientated towards doing justice by restoring the harm that has been caused by crime. I welcome the Garda diversion programme which is a conference to discuss a child's offending and the reasons for it. It will confront the child offender with the consequences of his or her action and establish the basis for a lifestyle that does not include anti-social behaviour and allow the child to apologise and make reparation to the <Col N="722" /> victim. That is an important aspect of the programme in that children aged between 12 and 17 will be forced to confront their crimes, apologise for them and in some way make amends. That is a significant process and it will have a major influence on young offenders.The facilitation of communication between all the parties involved to address the problem is a most important aspect of the process. Such communication, particularly involving the parents, is vital because they have a major responsibility. Sometimes parents may not be aware their children are running wild along the streets or are involved in crime. When a garda calls to the door, in many cases that is the first indication the parents have that their child has been involved in a crime and it is a major shock for them. A process that facilitates discussing such crime is a major step forward.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the less formal method of restorative cautioning. In the case of a crime that is not so serious, a conference may not be a suitable way of dealing with it and a less formal caution by a garda to a child in front of a parent is a welcome move. In more serious cases court directed conferences will be held. They are appropriate in cases where the Garda consider they have no option but to prosecute. It still affords an opportunity for the case against the child to be finalised without proceeding to a guilty finding in court and for the child not to start off with a criminal record. Statistics show that children with one criminal conviction tend to reoffend and have many more convictions. The child and the family should have a say in finding a solution. The outcome must be supervised and under the Bill it will be supervised by the courts. Therefore, it will be enforceable under court directed conferences. That is welcome.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision that raises the age of criminal responsibility from seven to 12. I am sure no one wants a child aged between 7 and 12 to be called a criminal. This provision is long overdue and I am delighted it is included in the Bill. The UN committee on the rights of the child has criticised Ireland in the past for having a low age of criminal responsibility. There was pressure internationally for us to raise this age. Everyone recognises that a child under the age of 12 should not be called a criminal.</P>
    <P>As chairperson of the Western Health Board, I am aware that the health boards play a major role in dealing with children under the age 12 and their work in that regard will continue. It is not that there is no mechanism in place to deal with offenders between the ages of seven and 12. I am delighted that the number of children under the age 12 who come to the attention of the Garda is very few and long may that continue. Offenders under the age of 12 will still have contact with community gardaí. I welcome that my local superintendent has put in place a network whereby the Garda liaise with the families of children who have got into difficulty in the com<Col N="723" /> munity. That measure has been extremely successful. The Bill will enhance that position.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the Bill will create pressure in terms of staffing and resources. It will put pressure on the health boards which are put to the pin of their collar in dealing with problems of children at risk. They do not have enough social workers or the time to deal with their major workload. As the health boards will be involved in many family conferences, I ask the Minister to ensure they have adequate resources in terms of staff and funding. There will be no point in two to five years asking why the system did not work. The system is excellent if it is implemented properly and with adequate resources. I ask the Minister to bear that in mind when it comes to the implementation of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Garda will have a major role to play in terms of the Garda diversion programme, court conferences and family conferences . While some members of the Force have undergone training to prepare them for this work, it is important that such training should continue and if additional resources in terms of training are required that they be provided because we want the Bill, when enacted, which hopefully will be soon, to be a success.</P>
    <P>The same position applies to probation officers who are involved in community projects designed to divert young people away from crime. They have been doing that work successfully for many years. To ensure the success of the Bill when enacted, I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the probation service will require additional funding. The health boards will also require additional funding. While the health boards are always seeking additional funding, the provision of such funding would be well spent on the care of children and on preventing serious crime in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Regarding the court powers that will come into effect under the Bill, when a court proceeds to a guilty finding it will usually request a probation officer's report. While detention of a young offender will be a last resort, it is important that the Bill should provide credible alternatives. Such alternatives must be acceptable to the victims. The eight of the ten proposed community sanctions that are new are innovative and creative. I am sure the victims of child offenders would be happy to allow those community sanctions to have a chance to work. Nobody is demanding that a 13 or 14 year old be put into a detention centre. I am sure the victims would be happy if a child offender acknowledges the seriousness of his or her crime, that the parents are aware of it and that a community sanction is imposed. It is important that the victims are involved at every stage of the process because if they are left out and do not receive any communication they may be of the view that nothing is being done. I have experienced that sentiment in my community in County Mayo where communities have felt nobody was doing anything to address the prob<Col N="724" /> lem. We have a major responsibility, through the Garda, to make sure the victims are kept fully informed during the process.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measure in the Bill that places responsibility on parents for their delinquent children. There are two existing provisions that require parents to pay compensation. This is important because I cannot highlight enough the responsibility of parents for their children. If they do not control their children, the situation will get out of control.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of a parental supervision order in the Bill is a welcome development. The courts will be empowered to impose this order on parents where they are satisfied that a wilful failure on the part of parents to take care or control of their child has contributed to the crime. A lack of parental control has contributed to the situation in many of the cases that have come to my attention. If addressing that problem requires the placing of a heavy fine and sanction on the parents, I welcome it. </P>
    <P>The Bill is about rehabilitation as opposed to punishment and detention. For young offenders, rehabilitation is a crucial factor in deterring future criminal acts.I welcome the additional powers in the Bill and the resources being put in place which will be of fundamental importance. If the necessary resources are put in place for health boards, the Garda and the probation officers, we will have excellent legislation which will serve this country well for decades. It is long overdue but I congratulate the Minister on an excellent consultation process in drafting a Bill which will find approval among all parties in this House. I hope this will result in a reduction in the number of juveniles involved in crime and that will augur well for the whole community.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak on this important Children Bill, 1999. Whenever we discuss children in this House, we are dealing with one of the most important issues of our society because society depends very much on how we educate and rear our children to become the adults of the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides for a new juvenile justice system, which I welcome. It covers three main areas of law. It provides the framework for the development of the juvenile justice system. It updates the 1908 Act protecting children against persons who have custody, charge or care of them. It provides for a family welfare conference and other new provisions for dealing with out of control and non-offending children. Many of us wish there was not a need for this type of legislation. We would wish for an ideal society, giving everything necessary to parents or guardians to rear their children so that we would not require this Bill. However, we must be realistic. Sadly, there are juveniles who offend and people who will come within the ambit of this Bill. We must ensure that, as a result of it and any other legislation which may be introduced in this House, we will reduce dramatically the number of children <Col N="725" /> who will appear before the courts or who will need a Bill such as this.</P>
    <P>It has taken three years to introduce this Bill since the former Minister of State, Deputy Currie, introduced a Bill. I have no difficulty about the delay in introducing it. What is of much more importance to us and to the families and children who will be affected by the legislation is that we get it right. It is most important that every effort is made to ensure that what we aspire to will be the outcome of the legislation. Having read the Bill, I am thankful that the end result will be that children who find themselves in need of this Bill will be dealt with in a more humane and understanding way, a way more suited to the age of the child. It is harrowing for many of us to read in the newspapers about some of the agonising court cases relating to children. I find particularly harrowing the way in which judges have to try and find out how best to deal with the child's needs and requirements. Unfortunately, we had come to a stage where the aim was to get the child away at all costs and out of an environment where he or she could further offend. This is not how things should be. There should be in place different centres and resources to suit the needs of those who offend.</P>
    <P>We must remember that a child is not born a criminal; a child grows into criminal activity. Therefore, irrespective of what is included in the Bill, it does not deal with the kernel of the problem, that is, the reason young children resort to offending, to becoming non-conforming people in society and to becoming aggressive, violent and intolerant. These are not the attributes of a child. We think of children as being kind. Perhaps some may have a tendency to do things their own way but it is not in the nature of any child to be violent and cause trouble in society. The cause of children becoming offenders relates to the environmental, social and family background. We must deal with these issues, given that there is ample funding available. There are newspaper reports today that the Minister for Finance will have to cope with trying to spend an additional £500 million coming into the Exchequer's coffers since January. This money should be diverted towards the needs of children.</P>
    <P>The children about whom we are talking in the context of the Bill are generally deprived, vulnerable and of low esteem. Why are there such children? A few aspects of life today are fundamental to creating children who become non-conforming in society. We are all aware of the responsibility of parents but, unfortunately, too often we cannot speak of parents in the plural because nowadays there are so many single parent families. Every child has a father and we must consider closely how a father can so easily abscond from his responsibility as a parent. Anyone responsible for bringing a child into the world has a responsibility to rear that child. Whether these people are living on social welfare or working elsewhere in the economy, they should contribute towards rearing that child. We are far too lax in this regard. As a <Col N="726" /> member of a Dáil committee, I visited Sweden on one occasion to look into the welfare of children there. They have very tight restrictions on the responsibilities of absconding parents. They begin from the premise that every child &ndash; I am sure we would all agree with this &ndash; has a right to know who are his mother and father. They can track down the father and legislation is in place to ensure he honours his responsibilities. </P>
    <P>Can we blame single parents trying to rear families, very often in unsuitable circumstances, with lots of strain and stress and often in an environment which is most unsuited to them? This brings me to the role of local authorities. There are long housing waiting lists. The majority of people on these waiting lists are single parent families. The children are starting off with a disadvantage in that they do not come from families where there is a mother, a father and children. These people are in flats, awaiting local authority housing during the child's formative years. Very often the accommodation is very poor and unsuitable and in many cases they must climb stairs. They are without gardens in which to occupy their children or help the children create a sense of amusement or self-esteem. It is becoming a major social issue in our towns that we will end up with housing estates with predominantly, if not all, single parent families.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any direction from the Department of the Environment and Local Government to the local authorities to ensure there is a better mix. Life is about mixing the old with the young, the employed with the unemployed. Above all, children must have role models, but that will not happen if they live in an environment almost identical to their own where mothers struggle without resources to rear children. I ask the Government to look into this social issue. If we were geared towards a better social mix it would help eliminate some of the problems that emerge therefrom.</P>
    <P>Because of the crisis in the housing area, due to a shortage of development land, families are being put into areas where there are no green spaces, no community activities and no leisure pursuits or activities for children when not in school. It is when they are out of school they get up to mischief and learn a different way of life. They resort to going to the nearest railway and stoning trains, visiting car parks and cutting tyres and watching the elderly and stealing their handbags. One could say it is a way of filling their time. We have an obligation in this regard. We must hang our heads in shame in that so many of our young people do not have community facilities to give them an occupation and arouse their interests in whatever sphere of life they have a talent. No child is without some talents.</P>
    <P>I taught for many years in Clonmel Vocational School through which I came in contact with many disadvantaged families. For a period I also taught students in St. Joseph's school in Fairyhouse, a centre for offending children and the homeless. From dealing with those children on a <Col N="727" /> daily basis, whether from a disadvantaged background or from St. Joseph's, I found a goodness in each one of them that could be built on. They wanted to become proper citizens and to have a future but everything was stacked against them. The school system did not have the resources to cater for their needs. Children from stable families have advanced before starting school and may have had the advantages of playschool and kindergarten. From day one children from disadvantaged backgrounds are behind the other children in the class. We do not have the resources to help them to be on a par with their colleagues. As those children move into the senior classes, school becomes more difficult, they get into trouble and choose not to attend school. More often than not they stay up all night and in bed all day and their parents, or a parent, may lead a similar lifestyle.</P>
    <P>I could speak forever on the Bill because improvements in many areas would minimise the number of children that come within its ambit. A nation can best be judged on how it deals with its children. We cannot hold our heads high in that regard. We are taking positive steps but we must realise the difficult task and the immense challenges ahead. While the Bill is good and will make a difference, I ask the Minister to introduce the changes I have outlined so that fewer children will come under its remit. Let us look after our children. They are our future and our nation of the future.</P>
    <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Boylan. </P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ahearn for sharing time with me. I am delighted to see her looking so well and congratulate her on her contribution on an area in which she has great experience, being a teacher in earlier life. I am pleased to contribute to this important debate and compliment earlier speakers who have a constructive approach to the rearing of children. As Deputy Ahearn said, they are our future and how we rear them will have a bearing on the development of our country.</P>
      <P>The traditional family unit as we knew it when I was growing up consisted of the husband, wife and the children. The wife, being the mother, remained at home and the husband, being the breadwinner, went out to work and brought home the money and the children were reared. Generally it was left to the mother to look after the children and it was very successful. Marvellous and wonderful families were raised. In some families there were eight, nine and ten children. People managed by making sacrifices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That has changed in the past decade due to the pressures of modern day life. Nowadays both parents have to work. The wife has a job outside the home to help pay the mortgage and to make provision for the children. We must admire their courage in doing that because it is a great sacrifice. It means the mother has to get up early to get the children ready. We must ensure there are <Col N="728" /> proper facilities for babies who are minded outside their homes and that those looking after them are qualified. The ideal situation is where another mother, or another woman, takes care of three, four or five children. I do not like the commercial developments where large buildings are turned into crèche facilities and qualified young people brought in to care for the children. I doubt if it is the right environment for bringing up children and I wonder how they will turn out. Children are brought out into the wide open world very early in life.</P>
    <P>The number of single parents is a cause of concern. Young girls are becoming mothers when they are not aware of what is involved. It can happen in any home and in some case the girl will have the back-up of the family. In other cases, she will move out to set up in a flat or apartment away from home. The advice and facilities available to that child are vitally important.</P>
    <P>Young offenders can come from any section of society. Young people from good homes, for one reason or another, can turn out wild. If they are taken in hand in the early stages they can be dealt with. Some speakers said they should not be classified as criminals. Nevertheless, we must be strict because people have to be protected from vandalism. I listened this morning to Deputy Coveney on "Morning Ireland", in a relay from Private Members' business last night, speak about young fellows buying second-hand cars at knockdown prices of, say, £20 or £30 and driving through estates at speed and inflicting terrible injuries. These are young people of 14 and 15 years of age who have not yet left home. Their parents may not be aware of their involvement in this activity. While the parent is responsible, the State has a role to play in providing back-up services and ensuring that type of car is not available to them. </P>
    <P>In my county a new judge, Mr. Justice Mohan, has been appointed to replace the late Mr. Justice Donal McArdle who was a marvellous individual who knew how to implement the law effectively without going overboard. Mr. Justice Mohan's administration of justice in Virginia District Court last Monday has sent alarm bells ringing around the Cavan-Monaghan area. New Age Travellers appeared before him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>I published the Government's strategy for the development of the international financial services industry in March last year. The strategy sets out a vision for the development of the industry, building on the success of the IFSC. It seeks to maximise the level and quality of employment in the industry and enhance links with related sectors. It contains an implementation plan based around 19 priorities, one of which was that relevant Departments and agencies would nominate liaison officers where they did not already exist. These officers now meet regularly as an IFSC public sector group chaired by my Department to ensure the strategy is implemented. The group met for the first time in March 1999 and has met a total of six times since.</P>
      <P>The success we have achieved in implementing the strategy is evident from the progress report which was initially prepared by the public sector group and subsequently submitted to Government on 22 February. This demonstrates continued strong performance in relation to business growth, employment and redevelopment of the docklands. A copy of the report has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The IFSC public sector group will continue to meet regularly during 2000 in order to co-ordinate and monitor implementation of the strategy and address other appropriate issues. It will focus in particular on the key issues going forward identified in the progress report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not a considerable problem in recruiting appropriate staff in the centre at a cost that is considered reasonable in view of the housing needs of the people concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated before it is proving more difficult to recruit staff. Since last summer a considerable effort has been made by the centre to involve itself in courses with the universities and various schools to best explain what is on offer. The number of employees grew by 2,000 last year, not all of whom are Irish; people of many nationalities are working in the centre in different international banks. There are 80 participants in the parents in education initiative and 13 scholarships have been awarded in partnership with Reuters and the docklands authority. School leavers have been placed with IFSC companies under a job placement scheme. Jobs have also been created in the construction industry. The position will not change overnight but the steps which have been taken provide a good basis in creating a better undertanding of what the centre is doing and the kind of person who will be attracted to it in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to staff shortages is there not an office space shortage in the centre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the recruitment of staff, I do not want to give the wrong impression. At the start of last year there were 6,500 people working in the centre. This figure has increased to 8,500. A further 1,500 are employed on the adjacent 12 acre site on which Citibank and other businesses are located. It is projected that there will be 13,500 people employed by the end of the year when the site is completed.</P>
      <P>All the office accommodation will be full by the end of the year or early next year. The docklands authority is seeking to address the problem by marketing prior to Easter office development opportunities at Grand Canal Dock. New office developments are planned for Georges Quay, North Wall and Sir John Rogerson's Quay. Developments will be expedited by the section 25 accelerated planning process on what is a 92 acre site in the Grand Docks area. The planning process has been extended to the Custom House Docks area between the Point Depot and Spencer Dock. During the summer the docklands authority is to prepare a plan dealing with the entire area from the 12 acre site to the Point Depot which encompasses hundreds of acres of land. Other developments may well be under way by next year.</P>

      <P>Have the concerns vocally expressed by existing financial institutions in the IFSC with regard to compliance with the reporting requirements of the Revenue Commissioners in respect of non-resident accounts been addressed and the issue resolved whereby, by common consent, they would not be required to pay tax on behalf of depositors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that they have. The progress report emphasises that they must maintain high standards and the reputation of the industry. While the DIRT audit is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners, the concerns expressed by the financial services industry were addressed at a meeting with the Revenue Commissioners on 25 February following which a joint statement was issued. I understand there will be discussions prior to the completion of the audit. While I do not have the full details, I also understand that the Financial Services Industry Association and the Revenue Commissioners were happy with their exchange of views.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach's briefing material indicate whether it has been communicated in writing that there has been a satisfactory resolution or is it his understanding or that of his Department that the matter has been resolved? Has there been an exchange of correspondence between the Revenue Commissioners and the association that puts the matter to rest?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of correspondence from the Revenue Commissioners but the Financial Services Industry Association has written to me. My note states that the association and the Revenue Commissioners met for an exchange of views on the issue. The circumstances and concerns which apply in the case of the IFSC banks and on which the Financial Services Industry Association delegation elaborated were acknowledged by the Revenue Commissioners. It was emphasised that each institution will have an opportunity to discuss them with the findings of the audit in each case before conclusions are reached. That is the key issue for the FSAI which is happy with the position adopted by the Revenue Commissioners. The fear was that the sector would not be involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the Taoiseach's review of the International Financial Services Centre states clearly that the shortage of office space is a serious constraint on the expansion of the industry and that developments which would relieve this shortage at Spencer Dock have been blocked by planning objections? Is the Taoiseach of the opinion that his intervention with regard to the Spencer Dock office issue which is now on appeal was helpful in light of the manifest shortage of office space in that part of Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton is talking about the centre which is not under the control of the docks authority. That matter was subject to an oral hearing and I hope when the report is issued, that site will be considered. However, all the other sites are under the control of the docks authority. There is not an over-supply of office space anywhere in Dublin at present. It is a tight market but there is an enormous amount of space on the 12 acre site which will be taken up this year. As I said, all the other initiatives will be considered next year.</P>
      <P>It is not long since I and Deputy Quinn were in the position of Minister for Finance trying to get some of these developments started. All the initiatives which were discussed in recent years are now finished and in use. New developments are now being considered. If the plan goes ahead, 92 acres will be available in the Grand Canal docks area. The authority is currently considering that area which will accommodate many offices in the years ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the progress report submitted to the Taoiseach stated explicitly that the development at Spencer Dock of additional office accommodation, which is being delayed by planning objections, was a problem? Is it not the case that the report, which was presented to the Taoiseach by his people, said explicitly there was a risk that the current shortage of office space in that area will lead to a dispersal of activity around the fringes of Dublin which will undermine the docklands hub concept? In view of his publicly expressed objection to office development at Spencer Dock, is the Taoiseach in favour of the docklands hub concept? Does he want this development dispersed outside the current docklands centre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody has taken a stronger line on the docklands hub. Deputy Bruton pressed me strongly during similar questions previously on the issue of putting most of the accommodation outside the city. The Deputy will recall that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy about the back offices but I am in favour of the docklands hub and particularly the financial services hub which is the key issue. The report indicates that when the new rules come into operation, people can move out of the area and it outlines that this would undermine the financial services centre. Given that the companies are in the one area, they work together. They formed the six key committees which drive the centre. It is much better when they are all in the one location and that should continue.</P>
      <P>Related services, such as the legal services, have now developed and I am sure other services in the areas I mentioned will develop in the future. This will make use of derelict sites and also make the docklands area, where there was very little employment over the past 100 years, a centre of activity. I favour this development. The section 25 accelerated planning process will expedite the development of the 92 acre site. I do not wish to create controversy on the planning issues, but if people had worked with the docklands authority, they may not have encountered the difficulties they subsequently faced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the best way to expedite office and related development in the docklands hub area, which is otherwise known as the Dublin Docklands Develop<Col N="733" /> ment Authority area, is through the special provisions of section 25? Does he also agree that his comments were not constructive and were deliberate? I presume he knew what Charlie Bird would transmit in the colour piece. Will he lay in the Oireachtas Library the formal letter of retraction which he sent to An Bord Pleanála in respect of his comments regarding the oral hearing on that planning controversy?</P>

      <P>I have no problem putting the letters in the Library but they were made public by An Bord Pleanála. I ensured that was done after an exchange in the House on the Order of Business because, as the Deputy correctly pointed out, some people are very aware of legal issues.</P>
      <P>My views were well known. I took the view that all the land should stay within the area. The Deputy introduced legislation when he was Minister that covered the area, but this site is outside it. This is a pity and perhaps they should have followed the authority's brief.

      <P>The reply from An Bord Pleanála to that letter states:</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Board, I wish to thank you for your letter of 3 March about the planning appeals relating to the Spencer Dock Development. </P>
      <P>In considering a planning appeal, it is the practice of the Board to consider only written submissions on the file, submissions made at an oral hearing (where such a hearing is held) and the Inspector's report on the appeal. In the interests of natural justice, media reports on an appeal during the currency of the appeal are not considered by the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, in considering the appeals relating to the Spencer Dock Development, the informal comments attributed to you in the media in relation to these appeals will not be taken into account and will not in any way <Col N="736" /> affect the Board's independent judgment, in accordance with established practice.</P>
    <P>The terms of this reply have been endorsed by the Board. I am bringing the terms of your letter and the reply to the attention of the Inspectors conducting the oral hearing into the Spencer Dock Development.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the points made by Deputy Bruton are totally false.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos, 3 to 17, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As I outlined in my comprehensive statement to the House on 29 March, I attended the Special European Council in Lisbon on 23 and 24 March. In advance of the summit, I submitted on 6 March, to Prime Minister Guterres, Ireland's national response to the Presidency paper on the content of the European Council. I also copied it to our European partners and made it available publicly. The paper focused on our priorities for the summit. I also submitted a joint paper with Prime Minister Blair on 16 March highlighting areas of common concern for our two countries on which we wished to see progress during the summit. I have placed both our national response and the joint paper in the Dáil Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I do not propose to repeat my statement in full, it is important to restate that the summit set the Union a new strategic goal for the next decade, namely, to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge based economy in the <Col N="739" /> world capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.</P>
    <P>The summit focused on the Union's competitiveness across a wide range of areas but, more specifically, on harnessing the potential of Europe's greatest asset &ndash; its people and its innovation and knowledge base. The targets set for investment in human resources and a wide range of research and investment are fully in line with our goals under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and the national development plan.</P>
    <P>The Lisbon European Council marks an important step in closing the gap between the European and US economies. I am particularly pleased that the outcome of the summit reflected so much of the principles and values that underpin our approach at home. The conclusions demonstrate the Union's level of recognition for the potential contribution which the information society can make to the lives of everyone. In this context, I welcome the high priority that the Commission and the European Council are giving to rapid expansion of low cost, high speed Internet access. The availability of broadband and other advanced communications infrastructure and services at low costs is one of the prerequisites of an economy based on innovation and knowledge.</P>
    <P>I welcome the commitment given for the establishment of a European charter for small business which should commit member states to focus on small companies as the main engines for job creation in Europe and to respond specifically to their needs.</P>
    <P>As regards the Single Market, EU leaders gave a commitment to speed up liberalisation in areas such as gas, electricity, postal services and transport. Furthermore, it was agreed that the financial services action plan should be implemented by 2005. In addition, full implementation of the risk capital action plan by 2003 will be ensured.</P>
    <P>With regard to the key priority of social inclusion, the summit marked an important step in efforts to mainstream the promotion of inclusion in member states' employment, education and training, health and housing policies. The summit also acknowledged that the European social model needs to be adapted to ensure its long-term sustainability in the face of the Union's aging population, promote social inclusion and gender equality and provide quality health services.</P>
    <P>Importantly, it was also agreed that the European Council would assume a stronger guiding and co-ordinating role in relation to economic policy to ensure a more coherent strategic direction and effective monitoring of progress. The European Council will accordingly hold a meeting every spring devoted to economic and social questions.</P>
    <P>As I have reported separately, I met with Prime Minister Blair during the course of the summit. We discussed the latest developments in <Col N="740" /> Northern Ireland as well as the issues on the agenda of the European Council.</P>
    <P>As I indicated to the House on 29 February, following my visit to South Africa, I wrote to Commission President Prodi in January on the issue of HIV/AIDS in developing countries. My letter stressed the need for greater collective action and suggested that there was a case for reviewing the resources devoted to this issue both at Community level and in the member states. I also raised the issue of access for developing countries to medicines necessary for the treatment of HIV/AIDS.</P>
    <P>President Prodi has replied, outlining his shared concerns about the AIDS crisis and indicating that the Commission would welcome a discussion on the issue at Council level in the near future. Such a discussion might be based on the review of the implementation of the existing Council regulation governing Community expenditure on HIV/AIDS in developing countries. I have also received responses from Prime Minister Rasmussen of Denmark, Prime Minister D'Alema of Italy and Chancellor Schussel of Austria expressing strong support for my call for a strengthened international response to the challenges posed by HIV/AIDS.</P>
    <P>I understand that, following discussions with the Portuguese Presidency, the issue of HIV/AIDS will now be discussed by Development Ministers at their Council meeting on 18 May. Ireland is doubling expenditure on HIV/AIDS related activities in our bilateral aid programme to over £2 million. We have also more than tripled our contribution to UNAIDS to £250,000. We have mainstreamed the fight against AIDS into all of our development activities. Further national contributions to HIV/AIDS related activities are under consideration.</P>
    <P>The Africa-Europe Summit held in Cairo on 3 and 4 April under the aegis of the Organisation of African Unity and European Union was a unique occasion that brought together Heads of Government from EU and north and sub-Saharan African states for the first time. A total of 67 countries were represented at the summit. The holding of this summit was first proposed during our Presidency of the EU in 1996 and Ireland has always been supportive of the proposal. I was, therefore, particularly pleased to attend the summit and I was accompanied by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell.</P>
    <P>The primary concerns of the summit, which are reflected in the declaration and plan of action agreed at the summit, were economic co-operation and integration of Africa into the world economy, the challenges of achieving sustainable development, action to strengthen and support democratic principles of governance and health issues, particularly in relation to the ongoing struggle against HIV/AIDS.</P>
    <P>The Irish contribution to the development panel of the summit laid particular emphasis on the challenges faced by African countries in <Col N="741" /> achieving sustainable economic and social progress development in light of the very heavy burden of debt which they bear and the historical legacy of underdevelopment and the ravages wrought in recent years by the HIV/AIDS pandemic, the brunt of which has been borne by sub-Saharan Africa. In making these comments we highlighted Ireland's traditional and ongoing commitment to assisting in the continent's development through the Government's overseas development aid programme and through the work of Irish NGOs, both secular and religious. Throughout the summit my EU colleagues and I also sought to emphasise the importance of the role of civil society working with Government in achieving and securing economic and social progress.</P>
    <P>In the weeks leading up to the summit, officials from my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs were in constant contact with the Egyptian authorities, as hosts of the summit, and officials from other participating states. Arising from these contacts, during the course of the summit I met with President Mubarak of Egypt, Colonel Ghadaffi of Libya, President Obasanjo of Nigeria, President Chissano of Mozambique, President Mpaka of Tanzania, President Musevini of Uganda and President Mbeki of South Africa. I also held a number of short meetings relating to Security Council issues with representatives of other countries. During these meetings we discussed matters of mutual economic and political interest, the work of the summit and the prospects for deepening EU-African relations. All the leaders I met in the course of the summit expressed their interest and support for the peace process in Northern Ireland and I took the opportunity to update them on the situation.</P>
    <P>At all the meetings I took the opportunity to highlight Ireland's campaign for a seat on the UN Security Council and to seek support for our campaign. In addition to attending the various working sessions of the summit, I attended a dinner hosted by President Mubarak and a lunch hosted by Prime Minister Guetteres. I was accompanied at these functions by the Minister of State and the Irish Ambassador to Egypt. I am confident the summit will mark the beginning of a new era of co-operation in EU-Africa relations given the progress made in focusing on debt relief, developing a plan of action and the necessary framework for monitoring implementation.</P>
    <P>On a separate matter, the Prime Minister Mr. Blair wrote to me on 14 April 1999, seeking my support in opposing the proposed directive on <i>droit de suite</i>. I replied at that time indicating our support for his position in opposing the directive on the basis, <i>inter alia</i>, that decisions on whether to apply <i>droit de</i><i>suite</i> should remain with member states on the basis of subsidiarity. Since that time the matter has been extensively discussed at various levels in the Union, most recently on 16 March at the internal market council, where it was noted that agreement had been reached on a <Col N="742" /> compromise package which will allow a common position on the proposed directive to be adopted formally by Council in the near future. </P>
    <P>In keeping with the normal protocol on such occasions, I sent a letter of congratulations to President-elect Putin on Monday of last week. I took the opportunity to indicate to Mr. Putin that it will fall to him to consolidate and extend the democratisation of Russian society, to oversee the process of economic and social reform and to achieve a political settlement of the Chechnya problem.</P>
    <P>Finally, I met the Secretary General of the European Council and high representative for the common foreign and security policy, Mr. Javier Solana, on Friday, 31 March. Mr. Solana, in his new role, is conducting a tour of EU member state capitals. We had a useful meeting in which our discussions centred on the western Balkans, Russia, the Middle East, security and defence, development, enlargement and the Intergovernmental Conference. In particular, we discussed the current proposals regarding European security and defence.</P>
    <P>In this context, I reiterated that developments in this area should continue to be framed on the basis of the Amsterdam Treaty and that they should be focused on the Petersberg Tasks. I was grateful to be reassured by Mr. Solana that the current progress on this issue will not lead to consideration of the introduction of a mutual defence commitment into the EU context. The focus will remain crisis management and peacekeeping.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Taoiseach's communications with President Putin, is it true the Irish Government has decided not to support the suspension of Russia from membership of the Council of Europe notwithstanding the serious abuse of human rights by Russia in its military campaign in Chechnya?</P>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach made any protest to the Russian authorities about the way the UN Commissioner on Human Rights, Mary Robinson, was treated by the Russians during her recent visit? She was refused a meeting with President Putin and was described by Mr. Vladimir Kalamanov as having told a common lie when she said she had not been allowed to visit the places in Chechnya she wished to visit. It was further stated by Mr. Kalamanov that conversing with UN Commissioner Robinson was like conversing with the deaf and dumb. Will the Taoiseach join me in condemning these unjustified and offensive remarks by people who obviously have much to hide as otherwise they would not use such language?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy's last remarks. We support the work and the efforts of the UN Commissioner and the kind of treatment she received will be dealt with in whatever way is considered most appropriate. She will report in Geneva at the end of this week on the visit in which she attempted to examine the camps in <Col N="743" /> Chechnya from both perspectives. That would be an appropriate time for us to respond.</P>
      <P>Tomorrow there will be a discussion in the parliamentary session of the Council of Europe on two proposals. I am not up to date with what took place at yesterday's session as I have not yet received a report. However, it is unlikely that anything has changed from what the Minister for Foreign Affairs told me before I went away. There are two issues before the meeting tomorrow: first, the exclusion of Russia from the Council of Europe and, second, the suspension of Russia's voting rights. Two or three days ago it looked more likely that the second proposal would take effect. Ireland has the chair and that is the position the Minister was likely to take. However, what happens is subject to the discussions yesterday and today.</P>
      <P>That was the view a few days ago, which was prior to Mrs. Robinson's visit, and I assume it has hardened considerably in the meantime. It was considered that to exclude Russia altogether might weaken the council's influence and that suspending Russia's vote would be the better tactical decision.</P>
      <P>I should mention two other matters. There have been indications from the Russian side to the Council of Europe in recent days that it will agree to Council of Europe observers going to Russia at an early date and to giving them access to what they want to see. I do not know the strength of those indications given what has happened since Monday. The EU troika is also to go to Russia. I spoke yesterday evening to the high representative, Mr. Solana, who told me on Friday that he would go directly to Russia from Cairo today. However, given how matters developed for the UN and Mrs. Robinson's visit, he changed his mind and will now wait for a few days, probably until the UN Commissioner reports to Geneva on Thursday or Friday.</P>
      <P>Over the next few days the Council of Europe should receive some further contacts from the UN on its report and from the EU Presidency on its visit to Mr. Putin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the Russian authorities recently published a White Paper on Chechnya? It contains the following statement:</P>
      <P>Of course, not each Chechen is a robber, [just as] not each Russian is an upright person. But it is a historical fact that a 'source of infection', that is not quite clear even to modern analysts, has been smouldering in Chechnya for many centuries now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that this characterises an entire people as ethnically unsound? This is the type of ethnic comment that caused war in Europe for many years. It is most important that a strong stand is taken by the European Union against comments such as this which generate ethnic hatred. If the Irish Government is pre<Col N="744" /> pared to take what might be an excessively severe stand in regard to a small country, Austria, it must be seen to take a stronger stand against a large country such as Russia which is not just saying but doing the wrong thing in Chechnya.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already outlined the EU position <i>vis-à-vis</i> Austria. What is happening in Chechnya is wrong, regardless of Mr. Putin's position last September when terrorists bombed several hundred people in Russia and his decision to take military action to protect the states around Chechnya where there were terrorists and guerillas operating against his people. The Council of Europe, the EU and UN have made their views clear about the way he has gone about that.</P>
      <P>The European Union stated that it was looking to President Putin following the election to boost democracy, promote reforms, improve ties between the two powers and to sort out the position in Chechnya through proper laws. The concern is that everything that has been said and seen so far indicates that we are a long way from that position. I refer to the EU Commission, the Council of Europe and the troika meeting. The EU-Russian summit is on 17 May. It is still the intention that the EU will meet Russia and it is hoped there will be clear reports before that meeting to know the exact position. Needless to say, it is disappointing that the UN High Commissioner was not allowed to see what she wished and that the full examination which she wished to report to Geneva was not allowed, not to mention the fact the President did not see fit to meet her.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of time constraints, l would just like to say I support the thrust of the questions put forward by Deputy Bruton on Russia and Chechnya. I would like to ask the Taoiseach a separate but related question to those he has answered. I refer to the Taoiseach's speech in Cairo which I read and which is on his website. He stated that there is a compelling argument for additional assistance to be given to the African countries to combat the scourge of AIDS. I believe that is a fair and accurate paraphrase of what the Taoiseach said since I am not allowed to quote. </P>
      <P>If the Taoiseach decides not to give some portion of the windfall of an additional £700 million, which the Minister for Finance reported receiving yesterday, to the AIDS programme in addition to what he already referred to, his words are mere rhetoric. A windfall of £700 million was reported yesterday which is being set off against the national debt. Why can we not set off some of it against the African AIDS crisis? What is the Taoiseach going to do about it, and when?</P>

I am sure the Deputy will agree I do not claim any credit for the HIV-AIDS document &ndash; our strategy on it. The resources necessary to move on that have been provided. It is not a problem at this stage. The allocation of £190 million to agencies and groups is a lot of money and we are committed to increasing it. If we reach 0.7% by 2007, it will reach £600 million. We are talking about a considerable amount of money. It will have to be done on the basis of delivering properly focused programmes. </P>

In 1998, the last time political officials were here, it was stated, and has been since the changes in the regime and internationally, that if Libya requested to open an office here, it would be agreed to. However, we did not discuss it. I made no promises to Colonel Ghadaffi. I endeavoured to open up the live cattle trade again and to clear the considerable difficulties on the veterinary, agriculture and trade side which have existed for the past few years. I think we made some progress on that, although we have not resolved the issues. I subsequently spoke to their foreign affairs minister to see if we can move on the other issues. We have an enormous market in Egypt and 80% of frozen beef used there comes from Ireland. We are trying to open that market in Libya which would be of enormous benefit to our industry. </P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The replacement of medical equipment in the hospital is a matter, in the first instance, for the hospital, in conjunction with the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>
      <P>I am aware the x-ray equipment in the Coombe Women's Hospital's general x-ray room is old and is in need of replacement. Although the radiation doses required to achieve satisfactory images using this equipment are higher than with more modern equipment, I am assured by the hospital that its continued use is not exposing patients to excessive radiation doses. In fact, the hospital itself has publicly confirmed this and is adamant the equipment is safe and has been licensed by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. The ERHA is currently assessing all the hospital's proposals in line with regional care priorities and in the context of the national development programme. It is expected to conclude its assessment shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need to replace some of this x-ray equipment first arose in 1998 when a specific difficulty with the x-ray generator was identified. While repairs were effected in order to allow this equipment to function safely and without risk of excessive radiation doses, it was considered that <Col N="748" /> it required replacement with more modern equipment. I understand the cost of re-equipping the general x-ray room will be in the order of £70,000 at today's prices and that the hospital is in the process of obtaining quotations.</P>
    <P>As part of an ongoing programme to enable hospitals generally to update their medical equipment, my Department has provided specific funding for this purpose in each hospital's letter of determination since 1998. The Deputy will appreciate that it is the responsibility of each hospital, including the Coombe Women's Hospital, to determine its priority equipping needs and to ensure that equipment is replaced as required in accordance with these needs.</P>
    <P>The Coombe Women's hospital was allocated capital funding of £160,000, £170,000 and £170,000 in 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively towards the cost of replacing medical equipment and for minor capital works under this programme. The hospital has submitted a comprehensive list of replacement equipment proposals to the ERHA and has x-ray equipment as a priority for replacement.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister seen the report that confirms pregnant women and infants were subjected to excessive doses of radiation?

      <P>I am aware of correspondence between the medical physicists and the radiation protection adviser at the Coombe Women's Hospital to the Master in relation to the replacement of x-ray equipment in the above unit. He refers to his report of April 1998, which is perhaps the report to which the Deputy refers, indicating that the machine is unsafe and the nature of this equipment is such that if certain complex examinations were to be performed higher than usual exposures could occur. However, Dr. Dowsett, the radiation protection adviser, in correspondence to the Master in April 2000 stated, &ldquo;at no time are patients exposed to excessive radiation since remedial action was taken immediately after my report&rdquo;, and &ldquo;radiology procedures involving children are examined where possible using alternative portable equipment&rdquo;. That is what the hospital is advising me on this issue and the correspondence from the radiation protection adviser at the hospital to the Master makes the same point.</P>

Does he acknowledge that the hospital equipment in so far as it is substantially out of date and out of user time encompasses the neonatal intensive care unit, delivery suites and the special care baby unit? Will he agree that in this day and age with the resources that are available to the State, this equipment should have been taken out of the hospital and replaced?

      <P>The funding to replace it has been made available by the State. In terms of the service plan put forward by the hospital, it was the plan for 2000 that identified the need to replace it.

We have asked the ERHA, as the new authority in the Dublin, Wicklow, Kildare area, to make an overall assessment of equipment needs of all hospitals under its jurisdiction with a view to allocating significant capital funds under the national development plan capital framework for the replacement of such equipment. The cost of replacing it is not excessive, it is in the region of £70,000.</P>

      <P>Officials of the Health Service Employers Agency and officers of my Department have been in discussions with the Irish Medical Organisation for several months on a wide range of issues affecting the working conditions of non-consultant hospital doctors (NCHDs).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made on many issues, including the resolution of disputes at indi-<Col N="750" /> vidual hospital level. Some of the issues which affect NCHDs' working conditions cannot be resolved immediately. Among these are the twin issues of working hours and the restructuring of the medical career hierarchy. The working hours of NCHDs have been the subject of negotiations at European level in the context of the proposed extension of the 1993 EU Directive on Working Time to doctors in training. Deputies will be aware that different stances on this issue had been taken by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. I am glad to inform the House that agreement was reached on Monday on a formula which provides for a nine year transition period to apply the Directive to junior doctors. Ireland has always stated that it will reduce junior doctors' working hours to an average of 48 per week at least as quickly as required by any European legislation. I am confident that, with the full co-operation of the profession, we can achieve that objective in the nine years allowed.</P>
    <P>As part of our preparations for this eventuality we are conducting a major study of NCHD working hours on a joint basis with the IMO. The study is being undertaken at eight hospitals by PA Management Consultants. The report of the study will be available in June. Any increase in the number of doctors required to implement the Directive on Working Time will have to be considered in the light of the report of the Forum on Medical Manpower. We do not wish to worsen the existing unsatisfactory career structure for doctors by employing more NCHDs without long-term career prospects.</P>
    <P>I hope that continuing contacts between the two sides can avert any prospect of industrial action which would not be in the interests of patients and will not help in a resolution of the structural problems which affect Irish hospital medicine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister fully aware of the seriousness of the issue? The NCHDs are about to commence balloting on issues that are not directly related to the decision of the EU conciliation committee yesterday. What we are talking about, and what most aggrieves and concerns junior hospital doctors, are issues relating to previous contracts going back to 1997 in terms of the excessive hours that are driving some NCHDs beyond human endurance and putting patients at risk and also payment for overtime. I am sure the Minister is aware that, per hour, NCHDs were earning less than the minimum wage. Will the Minister deal with the current problems? If he does not do so they will lead to a most destructive industrial action in hospital services which is the last thing we need having just had a nurses' strike. Will he give a clear commitment now, in terms of the nine year time frame that has been agreed by the conciliation committee which allows for an extension in certain circumstances, that Ireland will not, under any circumstances, seek to extend the time beyond nine years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question mirrors my reply in terms of the two aspects she has identified, working hours and overtime. There are many wide-ranging issues and they are all under discussion between the Health Service Employment Agency, the IMO and the representatives of the NCHDs. I am well aware of the concern among NCHDs about difficulties they have had with their employers in terms of the 65 hour limit. We recently wrote to all health boards and hospital employers asking them to adhere to the existing agreements arrived at through normal industrial relations machinery. I have some sympathy with the position of NCHDs, and I am anxious to reach a resolution of all outstanding issues involving the application of the extension of the EU Directive on Working Time. I am in the process of issuing a statement committing the Government to achieving the reduction to 48 hours within the nine year framework. We do not intend to seek a derogation from that timeframe. It is a challenging timeframe which involves a commitment not just from the Government but also from the profession and other parties involved to ensure we achieve this essential change within that timeframe. Overtime issues, pay and the issues of training, education and career paths are essential if there is to be a proper future for non-consultant hospital doctors and if we are to prevent the brain drain which has been a feature of the system for many years.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, health-related support services for children with autism and their families have been greatly enhanced and expanded since 1998. The health boards have established a number of multidisciplinary teams comprising speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, psychologists, nurses and social workers to provide health-related support services to children with autism and, in particular, to the special classes for children with autism being developed by the Department of Education and Science. A sum of £4.6 million has been provided for the development and enhancement of <Col N="752" /> these services since 1998 increasing to a full year cost of £5.1 million in 2001.</P>
      <P>In the eastern region, two multidisciplinary Outreach teams were established in 1998 and 1999, each consisting of a psychologist, speech and language therapist, occupational therapist, nurse, social worker and secretarial support. This year a further £500,000 with a full year cost of £600,000 in 2001 has been provided for the expansion of the Outreach and respite services, bringing the total additional funding provided for these services since 1998 to £1.2 million in 2000. A third multidisciplinary Outreach team is being established to cover the western part of the region which will have a similar composition to the two existing teams.</P>
      <P>The establishment of this team will relieve some of the pressure on the existing personnel, thus enabling them to spend more time with the children within their designated areas. The question of the overall level of input from any particular therapist will vary in each case depending on the individual needs of each child. My Department will continue to endeavour to assist the authority to meet the health-related needs of these children.</P>
      <P>With reference to the provision of respite services, I understand from the Eastern Regional Health Authority that a social worker has been recruited and is to take up duty next month specifically to develop home support services for families of children with autism. The role of the social worker is to recruit and train home support workers, including families, to provide home-based respite services. The authority is also actively seeking a suitable property to expand the residential respite service. As an interim measure, the authority has made arrangements with a voluntary agency to provide respite services every second weekend.</P>
      <P>I understand that, in addition to recruiting the additional staff already mentioned, the authority is also seeking to fill two existing psychology posts which are vacant in the services. I am aware of the difficulties being experienced within the health services generally as regards the recruitment of health professionals. Following a Labour Court recommendation in 1997, an expert group was established to examine and report on various issues, including recruitment and retention of staff, relating to paramedical grades. The group is in the process of finalising its report which is expected to be published in the next few weeks. A review of psychology services is under way with manpower planning as one of its terms of reference.</P>
      <P>My Department is also working closely with other Departments, the health boards, voluntary service providers and the various professional representative bodies to facilitate in any way it can issues related to the short-term recruitment of additional nursing and paramedical staff to work in various areas of the health services.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister acknowledge that, based on the manner in which these teams are working, each child in the units to which he refers receives only ten minutes speech and language and occupational therapy per week? Does he accept that children who suffer from autism require much more intensive therapy, both in the speech and language area and in the occupational therapy area, than is provided? Will he agree to the recruitment of additional speech and language and occupational therapists to ensure these children receive the daily therapy of an intensive nature they require for their personal advancement?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty agreeing that children with autism and children with special needs in general should receive all the educational facilities and health-related services they require. Tremendous progress has been made in the area of autism in the past two to three years which has highlighted a historical deficit in the provision of services to children with autism. Until 1998 children with autism were not defined as a special category in terms of the receipt of educational facilities, which is hard to credit but that was the position. I agree we need more language therapists. I am concerned about the availability of such therapists and related paramedical grades such as occupational therapists. An issue exists in that regard which I am keen to address. While committing ourselves to increased services, and there has been an increase in services, there is a parallel issue of the supply of the requisite qualified personnel to take up these positions. That is an issue the report I mentioned will address and we can move on that agenda following its completion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>

If he is, perhaps he would indicate when advertisements were placed in the papers seeking additional therapists for these units. Does he accept the ratio of one speech and language therapist and one occupational therapist to 90 children is grossly inadequate? Does he agree a psychologist should be attached to each of these teams and that one psychologist serving the totality of the teams&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Each multidisciplinary team would have a psychologist. I indicated in my reply that the authority is seeking to fill two vacant positions for psychologists. As regards autism, we must also look at the context of the provision of education. Particular methodologies have been <Col N="754" /> employed to deal with autism, such as the Teach method, which use direct personnel. There is a ratio in classes in the eastern region of six pupils to one teacher and one classroom assistant and they adhere to a specific behavioural programme. A psychologist may not necessarily be needed in every group of six. What is required is a multidisciplinary team providing a service to the education context as appropriate. I do not know in what manner the Deputy is dividing the time, but stating the number of pupils per psychologist is not appropriate.</P>

      <Quest>the arrangements in place to ensure compliance by all hospitals with the setting of the standards prescribed by the Medical Devices Directive (93/42/EEC) and sterilisation protocols; and if he has satisfied himself that all surgical products, appliances and equipment in use in our public and private hospitals are properly sterilised and pose no risk to patients.</Quest>
      <QRef>[9775/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Medical Devices Directive (93/42/EEC) was transposed into Irish law <i>via</i> the European Communities (Medical Devices) Regulations, 1994, and became fully mandatory on 14 June 1998. The directive forms part of an overall drive to complete the single market in Europe and lays down essential requirements for the manufacturing of medical devices and the procedures for checking that all products comply with them. Devices meeting these requirements are entitled to bear the &ldquo;CE&rdquo; marking and may be placed on the Community market without further restrictions.</P>
      <P>The directive groups medical devices into three broad categories: low risk, medium risk and high risk, depending on the perceived risk associated with the devices. Manufacturers of medium and high risk devices, such as catheters or heart valves, must be assessed by what is called a &ldquo;notified body&rdquo; before they can place their devices on the market. Manufacturers of low risk devices which have a very small chance of seriously injuring patients, such as crutches or spectacles, can place their devices on the market without recourse to a notified body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The directive is primarily aimed at regulating the manufacture of medical devices. A manufacturer is defined in the directive as the person responsible for defined activities relating to a device with a view to it being placed on the market under his or her own name. The reason for the link with the placing on the market of the device is that the aim of the directive is to subject to its requirements the passing of a product from a manufacturer to a final user by way of change of ownership in a commercial transaction. In the normal course of events the medical devices <Col N="755" /> which are used on patients in our hospitals are normally purchased by the hospitals concerned after they have already been placed on the market by their manufacturers. Therefore, hospitals are not normally considered to be manufacturers of medical devices and the question of them complying with the directive does not usually arise, although there can be a small number of exceptions to this rule where, in certain circumstances, hospitals could be considered to be manufacturers of medical devices within the scope of the directive.</P>
    <P>For example, where a hospital sterilises a medical device and makes it available to another hospital, which is a separate legal entity, it is considered that this would be placing it on the market if a change of ownership takes place. </P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>In this case the hospital which sterilises the device would be considered as the manufacturer and would have to adhere to the appropriate provisions of the directive. On the other hand, where a hospital sterilises a device and it is used only within the hospital's environment, it would not be considered to have been placed on the market. Similarly where a hospital sterilises devices on behalf of a second hospital but no change of ownership takes place, the devices would not be considered to have been placed on the market and the directive would not apply.</P>
    <P>Regardless of whether hospitals which sterilise medical devices are within the scope of the directive, the management of the hospitals have an important role to play in ensuring the devices which are used in their hospitals are safe for patients. They can do this in the first instance by ensuring they purchase only medical devices which have been appropriately CE marked. If they are manufacturing or sterilising medical devices themselves, they should ensure their staff are appropriately trained, follow any relevant standards and that all equipment is properly installed and maintained.</P>
    <P>My Department has contacted all health boards and hospitals to inform them about the implications of the directive and, in the first instance, it is up to local management to assess whether any manufacturing activities within the scope of the directive take place in their areas. If so, they should comply appropriately.</P>
    <P>The directive is one of what are commonly called the &ldquo;new approach directives&rdquo;, which also regulate other areas such as machinery, telecommunications equipment and toys. The new approach directives contain certain basic concepts which are the key to their harmonised, effective application across the European Union.</P>
    <P>As a result of the decision by the European Union to use standards in the new approach legislation, standards play an important part in the conformity assessment procedures which manufacturers must follow before they can place their devices onto the market. The European standards <Col N="756" /> bodies, CEN and CENELEC, have been mandated by the European Commission to produce the relevant standards to support the directives and member states are obliged to adopt these harmonised standards once they are issued. Having said this, however, adherence to standards has always been voluntary and remains so despite the advent of the directive. That is, when a manufacturer is endeavouring to show that his devices meet the essential requirements of the directive, it is not mandatory to comply with any standard. However, in discerning what needs to be done to satisfy the essential requirements, a manufacturer's task will be quicker and easier if he or she shows prior compliance with certain standards. If the pertinent standards are not complied with, the manufacturer must be able to demonstrate an alternative method of showing compliance with the essential requirements of the directive.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the benefits to the health of patients which can be gained by our hospitals adhering to standards. The Deputy will be aware that I recently launched a pilot scheme for hospital accreditation. The accreditation programme will formalise standard setting and measurement across many aspects of a hospital's operations. A notable feature of the general accreditation programme is the relationship which has been established between the major academic teaching hospitals group and the Independent Hospitals Association of Ireland as the representative body for private hospitals in the State. The IHAI and the MATHs group began to develop an accreditation scheme at different times and from different standpoints but are now actively pursuing measures to bring about convergence of their respective endeavours. In this regard, both have agreed to work together on the establishment of a single accrediting body for the Irish health sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this Government took office in 1997 it has invested more than £60 million in the development of child care services, including new child and family support services such as specialised fostering and early intervention projects to allow health boards to provide a range of appropriate interventions which will place specialised residential care in an appropriate context. This additional funding has allowed health boards to increase the number of high support and special care places available from 17 in 1996 to a current total of 63 places, which <Col N="758" /> includes a number of individual high support packages.</P>
      <P>The Department has approved health board proposals to develop 110 additional high support and special care places nationally. As part of this programme of developments, seven additional places have already been created in the South Eastern Health Board and an additional eight place unit for girls has been opened and is being brought into operation on a phased basis in the Southern Health Board. These developments are included in the current total of 63 places.</P>
      <P>Plans are well advanced by health boards to develop other additional places nationally as part of this programme. In the Eastern Regional Health Authority area, the construction of a purpose-built special care unit providing 24 places at Ballydowd, Lucan, commenced in January 1999. It is anticipated that this unit will open in the summer of this year. The development of a 24 bed purpose-built high support unit which will be built at Portrane is at tender stage and it is anticipated that this unit will be ready by autumn 2001.</P>
      <P>The Midland Health Board, North Eastern Health Board, North Western Health Board and Western Health Board are co-operating to provide 12 high support places on a single campus. A site has been acquired and a project manager and project group have been put in place to develop the proposal.</P>
      <P>Places being developed in the other boards are as follows: twenty high support places and a special care facility with five places for adolescent boys in the Mid-Western Health Board; three high support places in the South Eastern Health Board and five high support places for boys and an additional two places in a special care facility for girls in the Southern Health Board. These places are due to become available during 2000 and 2001.</P>
      <P>The senior managers resource group comprising representatives from each of the health boards and the Department was established in October 1998 and continues to meet regularly to monitor the overall development of these services.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the matters referred to by the Deputy. While the recent judgment of the High Court concerning these matters is currently being considered by the Department in consultation with the Attorney General's office, the order of the court has not yet been perfected and I do not consider it would be appropriate to make any detailed statement on the comments referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, more generally, I will make a number of points on the speed at which the programme of development of high support and special care can be undertaken and put in place by health boards. Because of the public perception of these services and some opposition from local communities, I understand from health boards that sourcing suitable sites or premises has been difficult. This also complicates and lengthens the planning process. The current economic <Col N="759" /> climate makes the recruitment of staff difficult and some health boards have had to recruit staff from outside the State.</P>
    <P>Against this background considerable progress has been made by health boards in putting this programme of developments in place. However, I am conscious of the need to ensure that all developments are put in place as soon as possible and in line with the target dates set by the boards themselves.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I recently announced that a new interim body on special residential services for children convicted of committing offences and children who have behavioural problems and are in need of special care and protection, is being set up. This new body will advise the Ministers for Health and Children and Education and Science on co-ordinating the delivery of services and on the development and provision of educational and other programmes in health board special care facilities, and in those facilities run by or under the aegis of the Department of Education and Science, for offending children. The Special Residential Services Board provided for in Part 2 of the Children Bill, 1999, which is currently before the House, will take over the interim body's responsibilities when the Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of important measures for non-offending children who are in need of special care or protection. These include Part 3 which empowers health boards to apply to the courts for special care orders to detain non-offending children in need of special care or protection, and Part 2 which introduces the Family Welfare Conference on a statutory basis for the first time.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister of State accept that the Government has failed abysmally to address the needs of disturbed children? Would she also agree that the Government has been labelled as being bogged down in a bureaucratic and administrative quagmire? Would she further agree that she and her predecessors have virtually been accused of contempt of court and that no coherent plan with a time frame to provide high supports for disturbed young people was put in place until a court injunction was granted in 1999 ordering that such a plan be put in place in the Eastern Health Board area?</P>
      <P>In so far as the other seven health boards are concerned, would the Minister of State agree that a time frame was not put in place to deliver the required units until the High Court made an order in February 2000? Can she explain the Government's total and gross failure which is resulting in weekly court applications being made to find places for seriously disturbed young people?</P>

      <P>The basis on which the State provides secure places for children is the 1995 FN case. No progress was made in providing any <Col N="760" /> places for such children during the last Government's term of office between 1995 and 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only since 1997 with the provision of £60 million, plus a plan to provide these places, that the scheme came into being. The 1998 Laxton report identified the need for special care and high support units and, in 1998, the senior managers resource group recognised the need for 110 places. All of these places were approved immediately and finance was provided to each health board to proceed with the planning and provision of those places. Some 110 places identified as required by health boards are in the process of being provided this year and next year. Half of these places will be provided this year. We anticipate that this will respond to the needs of children.</P>
      <P>The High Court's ruling is a matter under discussion between the Department and the Attorney General. Irrespective of any legal responsibility, we have a moral responsibility to provide places for children, something which was not done between 1995 and 1997.</P>

Does the Minister agree that it is totally inappropriate that a 17 year old woman in need of care has to be placed in the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum due to the Government's failure to provide a secure support unit of the type required? Does she acknowledge that it is equally unacceptable that a 14 year old girl, who almost died after a drug overdose, who was allegedly raped while in the care of a residential home, should be placed in an adult psychiatric unit because of this Government's failure? Will the Minister assure the House that there will not be any more court cases in which any judge has to berate a Minister or the State for manifestly failing to comply with declarations made by the court in 1995? </P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 220 together.</P>
      <P>Quality is one of the key principles underpinning the 1994 national health strategy and continues to be a cornerstone of health policy. I have a strong belief in the value of developing and supporting system-wide quality initiatives which have as their principal focus the pursuit of continuous improvement of standards across the health service. I recognise that in health care, quality is not an option but a feature of the service which consumers have come to demand and expect. Quality improvement should be supported centrally but its implementation needs to be locally based and involve each member of the organisation. The overriding objective is to achieve real and measurable improvement for the consumer by putting the interests of the patient to the fore.</P>
      <P>I am supporting important initiatives across the health sector which focus on quality improvement in health care services. Examples of these initiatives include governance and management development, risk management, clinicians in management, clinical audit, patient advocacy, the development of hospital performance indicators and the introduction of a hospital accreditation.</P>
      <P>In the area of governance and management development, my Department has initiated a programme in collaboration with the major academic teaching hospitals in Dublin to strengthen the governance and management function at hospital level. Also, hospitals and agencies are being supported in the development of risk management programmes aimed at minimising all types of risk to which hospitals may be exposed and thereby ensuring the provision of a safe service to patients.</P>
      <P>Clinicians are increasingly becoming involved in the management function at hospital board level to facilitate the setting of and monitoring of quantitative and qualitative service targets, the design of care plans and the provision of a more patient focused service. Moreover, clinical audits involve a systematic review of clinical practice against local and external standards.</P>
      <P>My Department has invited proposals from health agencies for the development of patient advocacy structures to deal with patient dissatisfaction and complaints and hospital performance indicators have been developed by my Department for use in annual service plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another initiative which I was particularly happy to support since becoming Minister for Health and Children is the development of an Irish hospital accreditation programme. The development of a hospital accreditation programme should act as a support &ndash; and in some <Col N="762" /> cases a prompt &ndash; for a wide range of mechanisms which combine to improve quality in health care. The introduction of this programme represents a major advance in promoting quality improvement and presents an opportunity for providers to maximise and improve standards. As evidence of my commitment to the scheme, I am providing in excess of £1 million to advance the initiative. This represents a significant investment dedicated to the promotion of quality improvement in the hospital sector and represents tangible evidence of my commitment to support the improvement of standards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that quality control is the most important factor in the delivery of any service or product. However, we have a new problem in the health service which, frighteningly, is being generated within hospitals &ndash; MRSA. Is there a strategy in place in the hospitals for infection control? If so, who is responsible for taking the initiative to provide the service? Do we audit standards within the hospitals? The Minister said the Government is providing £1 million for hospital accreditation. Does he think that is sufficient in view of the difficulties there are for hospital management? Is there a project team reporting to the Department from hospitals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>MRSA is an issue of considerable concern to me, as it was to my predecessor. The National Disease Surveillance Centre has responsibility for developing a national strategy on MRSA which will involve the recruitment of a dedicated consultant microbiologist to head the strategy and to develop guidelines for all hospitals.</P>
      <P>The £1 million for the hospital accreditation programme is adequate to meet the development of the pilot programme involving the ten major teaching hospitals. The programme involves both private and public hospitals. It is essential that a proper system of standards and quality control is developed which uses peer review, external assessment and the establishment of objective criteria against which hospitals can be measured in terms of overall performance across a range of indicators. We will provide additional resources as required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Minister's response to recent reports in the media of cross-infection? Does the Minister have any figures for the number of patients who have suffered cross-infection in hospitals and the number of patients readmitted because of infections picked up in hospitals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister acknowledge that there are not sufficient microbiologists within the health service? Will he indicate if there are plans to ensure that each hospital has a microbiologist with specific duties to address issues of cross-contamination and MRSA? Does the Department intend to issue guidelines to <Col N="763" /> hospitals and health boards concerning a recent report which indicates that part of the problem arises as a result of nurses and physicians, in particular, not washing their hands frequently enough as they go from patient to patient? That is a source of disease and contamination in the hospital system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the figures the Deputy requested but I will supply them to him if I can get them. We need more microbiologists. That is an issue we are taking up with the various health board agencies. The Deputy is correct; to a great extent the spread of infection can be prevented by very simple procedures. Surveys indicate that a high incidence of infection in hospitals is occasioned by a failure on the part of physicians or nurses to wash their hands after dealing with a patient before moving to another. We should ensure there are adequate facilities within institutions so that can be easily done. It is a cause for concern but we have already issued guidelines to hospitals on the basic, simple processes which should be the norm in all hospitals.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>his views on a ban by the Blood Transfusion Service Board of 13% or 13,000 of its blood donors who lived in Britain between 1980 and 1996 at the height of the BSE scare to avoid any potential risk of contracting Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in line with the example already set by countries such as the US, Austria, Germany, New Zealand and Japan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[9923/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of deferring different categories of blood donors from donating blood is a matter for the Blood Transfusion Service Board. There is no proven instance of classical CJD having been transmitted through blood or blood products, but the theoretical possibility associated with variant CJD cannot be excluded at this time. There is currently no screening test to detect the presence of variant CJD. For my part, I will ensure the BTSB has adequate resources to introduce proven new technologies in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Experimental animal models suggest that the infectivity of Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies, which include variant CJD, may be associated with white blood cells in animal systems. White blood cells can be removed from <Col N="764" /> blood donations using special filters. This process is called leucodepletion, and the BTSB, as a precautionary measure to minimise the theoretical risk of transmission, introduced leucodepletion for cellular products in 1999.</P>
    <P>The BTSB's policy is to permanently defer potential donors who may be at risk of carrying CJD, including donors who have received a dura mater transplant, human pituitary derived growth hormone or have one or more blood relatives with CJD.</P>
    <P>The countries referred to by the Deputy recommend that potential blood donors who spent a total of six months or more in the United Kingdom between 1980 and 1996 be permanently deferred from donating blood. As part of the decision-making process, the countries in question assessed the likely effect of such decisions on their blood procurement policies. I understand the effects for those countries was in the order of a 2% reduction in supply whereas the effect in this country would be a 13% shortfall in donors.</P>
    <P>The Council of Europe's Committee of Experts on Blood Transfusion and Immunohaematology recommend that the balance of risk between maintaining an adequate blood supply and minimising a theoretical risk has to be considered in the decision-making process and it advises that care must be taken to ensure any precautionary measure proposed will not impact adversely on the donation, safety and supply of blood necessary to meet patients' needs. Furthermore, the populations of Ireland and other European countries differ from those of countries such as North America in the extent of their exposure to UK bovine-derived material. In countries with a higher historical exposure to BSE, measures to defer donors who have spent time in the United Kingdom may reduce donor supply without enhancing safety. European countries are actively evaluating this matter at present.</P>
    <P>The Irish Medicines Board, which is the regulatory authority, has indicated that it is anxious to consult more widely with national and international expertise and have more detailed discussions on the matter before recommending any change in the current position. It supports the BTSB's proposals to re-enforce guidelines on the optimal use of blood in hospitals.</P>
    <P>The strategy of ongoing monitoring of the emerging scientific data will continue as a matter of priority, involving the BTSB, the Irish Medicines Board, and the CJD advisory group, which is advising me on matters relevant to CJD. I am planning to have a series of consultations with these bodies to keep the matter under constant review. The advice and evidence from EU scientific and medical experts is also being regularly evaluated to assess whether current strategies ought to be revised and this will continue to be the case. I will ensure adequate resources are available for this purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his extensive reply though I am not sure how much <Col N="765" /> information he gave in reply to the question which asked for his views on whether a ban would be desirable and if plans should be made to impose one. As he pointed out, certain countries have imposed a ban against donors who spent time in Britain between 1980 and 1996. Presumably he would accept those are the countries that have very low numbers of such potential donors. Does he accept that in Ireland, where a much higher percentage of donors would fall into this category, the potential risk is higher? Is it the case that he, as Minister for Health and Children, will not impose such a ban and will depend on the BTSB to ensure nobody will be at risk from blood donations from sources who could potentially carry CJD or is he saying he is actively considering the possibility of imposing a ban? His view on this matter is not clear from his reply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>What is clear from my reply is that there is a responsibility on the Minister for Health and Children of the day to be in the position to take due cognisance of expert advice on this issue nationally and internationally and to assess all the issues involved. I met representatives of the BTSB to discuss this issue, as I am concerned about it and it needs to be thoroughly teased out. My view is that we should minimise all possible risks to the people here in terms of blood transfusions and so forth, and that would be everyone's basic principle in approaching this issue.</P>
      <P>However, the position here is different from that in North America. There are a number of other issues involved here, not least that the indigenous population has had considerable exposure over the years to British bovine-derived material through imported foodstuffs. How does one draw a distinction between those who lived in Britain between 1980 and 1996 and people who lived here who would have been exposed to food products manufactured in Britain during that period? </P>
      <P>The BTSB advises that one could increase the risks if it deferred 13% of donors from donating blood because it would have to draw from a younger population to replace that deferred group with new donors who could have had a high degree of exposure to bovine-derived material. I have no difficulty with this advice from the BTSB being made available to the spokespersons. I am also being advised by the CJD advisory group and we have to weigh up the issues involved.</P>
      <P>We also have to consider the immediate impact of the announcement of such a ban, which would be the responsibility of the Irish Medicines Board, the regulatory authority. If it were to announce tomorrow that a percentage of donors were excluded from donating blood, a significant number of patients would be put at risk in terms of surgical procedures, blood transfusions and so forth. It is a case of balancing the risks involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present there is a theoretical risk. As I said in my reply, no one can be certain there is no risk <Col N="766" /> involved. I am actively pursuing advice on the issue. I met representatives of the BTSB and I intend to consult the IMB, the national blood users group, who are advising hospitals and clinicians in terms of minimising the use of blood in various surgical procedures &ndash; something that is growing apace &ndash; and our European colleagues on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>There has been considerable development in the care and treatment of patients with cancer in the past number of years. Since the launch of the National Cancer Strategy in November 1996, and the announcement of the action plan for the implementation of the strategy in March 1997, considerable improvements have taken place in this area.</P>
      <P>The two underlying principles of the National Cancer Strategy are to take all measures possible to reduce rates of illness and death from cancer in line with the targets established in the health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, and to ensure those who develop cancer receive the most effective care and treatment and that their quality of life is enhanced to the greatest extent possible.</P>
      <P>Underlying these objectives is the need for a high quality, patient-focused service. One of the specific objectives of the strategy is to ensure all patients have access to an equitable, effective service with a uniformly high quality of care wherever they live.</P>
      <P>Since the strategy was launched, regional directors of cancer services were appointed in each health board area, with two co-regional directors of cancer services appointed in the North-Eastern Health Board area. The regional directors were asked to prepare plans for the development of cancer services in their area and these plans were then submitted to the Department. The National Cancer Forum and Professor James Fennelly, special adviser on cancer services to the Department, advised on appropriate developments in each area. The main areas of development included that of consultant appointments and in this context the North-Eastern Health Board has had additional appointments made in medical oncology and histopathology. On a national basis, some £41 million of dedicated funding has been allocated since 1997 for the development of cancer services. Dedicated funding for the development of cancer services has been allocated to the north east and since the launch of the strategy this has amounted to some £1.48 million. Funding is provided in this year's allocation for the appointment of a consultant in palliative care. </P>
      <P>The first phase of the national breast screening programme has commenced and this phase will include the North-Eastern Health Board area. At my request, a review of the symptomatic breast cancer services has been undertaken by the National Cancer Forum and I expect to receive the report of this group on the appropriate further development of this service when I attend the final meeting of the National Cancer Forum tomorrow. When I receive the report I will give it careful consideration and I propose to make funding available under the National Cancer Strategy to develop further symptomatic breast cancer services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is continuing to work with the National Cancer Forum and the regional direc<Col N="768" /> tors of cancer services in identifying priorities for the further development of cancer services in all regions, building on the major progress made to date.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply and for his commitment to additional funding and a better regional spread of cancer treatment services. Will he ensure the need to provide in the North Eastern Health Board area, breast cancer surgery and treatment services, haematology services and additional palliative care services is given urgent consideration? It is essential to provide such services at Cavan General Hospital, given that it is a new hospital with modern facilities which serves the catchment area of the North Eastern Health Board which is most remote and distant from Dublin, the centre to which people must travel at present for treatment? Does the Minister agree that a centre such as Cavan should have a range of cancer treatment services?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Tomorrow I will receive the national strategy from the National Cancer Forum in relation to symptomatic breast cancer. I understand from a number of Adjournment debate matters raised by Deputies that this has implications for all the regions and particular hospitals in the regions. I will take on board the advice of the forum, together with advice from Deputies. There have been a number of investments in the north east area since the cancer strategy was established amounting to 1.48 million. There is provision this year for the appointment of a consultant in palliative care. This was one of the issues identified by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I will consider the case of Cavan General Hospital in the context of the service plan which the health board will bring forward in relation to capital development in this region.</P>

      <P>Arising from Question No. 69 in the name of Deputy Smith and following on his reply to an Adjournment debate on the issue last week, will the Minister say what is the function of the chief executive officers of the health boards and the members of the National Cancer Forum? Will the report the Minister receives tomorrow include the relevant views expressed by these people in respect of the Western Health Board area, with specific reference to a meeting held in Mayo General Hospital last week on this matter? Is the Minister in a position to make up his own mind, irrespective of the views expressed by the National Cancer Forum or the chief executive officers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always free to make up my own mind in issues such as this. However, there is a responsibility on all Ministers to take on board advice they receive in terms of the maximum utilisation of resources. I have received representations from Deputies in Mayo about concerns in that area and it is important that there is regional <Col N="769" /> balance in terms of the provision of services. Deputy Smith outlined the need to be mindful of long journeys patients must make, particularly in relation to cancer treatment. This is an issue which concerns me and I will take all these balancing issues on board in order to arrive at a final decision in the provision of services.</P>
      <P>I recently established an expert group on radiotherapy services, moving beyond the agenda already established by the national cancer strategy in the three supra-regional centres for radiotherapy. I am mindful of the distance issue and the need to consider the further expansion of radiotherapy services so that the impact on patients who must travel very long distances from rural Ireland to secure such services can be reduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that. The National Cancer Forum was established by the Deputy's colleague, the former Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan. We must be careful in terms of discarding reports on a national strategy basis. Obviously I will assess the report which I have not yet seen. I am anxious to ensure there is a strong regional supply of services and that where existing good practices are in place this will be allowed to continue. </P>

    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>When travelling through the city approximately 20 minutes ago, I noticed a lady begging on the sidewalk with a baby in her arms who was no more than a couple of weeks old. This type of thing is prevalent in the city and it is an outrage and scandal that children are being used and abused in this manner. This should be dealt with immediately because there is no excuse and no need for it. If the person feels the need to beg, she should not use her baby to do so. Passers by informed me that the baby would be handed from one woman to another. This is taking place approximately 100 yards from this House and must be stamped out. I have been told that their minders, bigger boys, make these people beg and then take the money off them. This abuse of children is not acceptable in this day and age and must be stamped out.</P>
      <P>There should be support for sport and community recreation because there is no healthier activity for young people. Young people who are deeply committed to sport will not be involved in any wrongdoing. Present planning developments of large housing estates with no play areas will lead to many problems. Young people should be involved in indoor activities such as table tennis and snooker and outdoor games such as football, tennis, handball and so on. Coaches and others should be trained to work with these people and there should be financial support to ensure play areas are available. This would lead to a healthy young society and we would not end up paying the price in the future for neglecting these areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>When discussing the Bill, we must acknowledge the work and consultation which has gone into this in the past. We have been waiting for the Bill for a long time. If one looks back at the way in which the State dealt <Col N="771" /> with children at risk over many years, it was done in an unstructured and very fractured way. This is a very comprehensive Bill which was worth waiting for. When discussing legislation we have to acknowledge that resources are vital for its implementation. The aspirations and design of the Bill are positive and set out a statutory framework for dealing with juveniles. Until such time as a proper funding mechanism is put in place we are reneging on those whom we are trying to protect.</P>
      <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is responsible for publication of the Bill. Will the Minister explain who will provide the funding, given that the health boards and the Department of Education and Science are involved? We must not fall between stools as in the past when it comes to dealing with juveniles before the courts. In a much highlighted case recently a judge was requested to place a child in detention. However, no proper facilities were available. After the Bill leaves the House a proper funding mechanism must be put in place.</P>
      <P>The Bill covers four main areas of the law. It provides a modern statutory framework for the development of the juvenile justice system. It provides for a family welfare conference and other new provisions for dealing with out-of-control non-offending children. It re-enacts and updates provisions in the 1908 Act protecting children against abuse by persons who have the custody, charge or care of them. It provides for a special residential services board to advise the Ministers for Education and Science and Health and Children on policy matters relating to the remand and detention of children and ensures the efficient and effective co-ordinated delivery of services to children in respect of whom detention orders or special care orders have been made.</P>
      <P>The starting point for the Bill was the Children Act, 1908. That Act was the basis for the creation and development of a juvenile justice system that has, despite its many weaknesses, served the country well throughout the greater part of the 20th century. There have been many problems in dealing with juveniles through the justice system. Because of the number of agencies involved no clearcut decision could be made by one without consulting the others. That has happened too often in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A matter I have raised in the past is the enrolment of children in national schools. Until such time as that is addressed we will be always one step behind finding out children at risk. For example, if a child is enrolled in a national school and is taken out by a parent, nobody knows whether the child has been enrolled in another school. From a statistical point of view the Department of Education and Science assumes it has been enrolled in another school. A centralised enrolment mechanism must be put in place whereby, if a child is taken out of one school, the parent or guardian informs the principal that the child is enrolled in another school. There must <Col N="772" /> be a mechanism of checks to ensure the child is enrolled. Many children drop out of national school and fall away from the mainstream education system and are at risk at an early age. If a mechanism was in place and it was shown that the child was not attending any national school, educational services, such as the home-school liaison officers, could be availed of. In this way the immediate problem of children who are at risk could be addressed.</P>
    <P>Those in the education process say they can pinpoint at an early age the vast majority of children who will fall out of mainstream education and lean towards a life of crime. A computerised enrolment system which would show if a child is not in full-time education should be put in place. Now by the time it comes to the attention of the authorities the child is at risk. This issue which has been mooted by the Department of Education and Science will have to be addressed. There will have to be correlation between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science on a centralised computerised enrolment system.</P>
    <P>An issue about which I am concerned is that children are used for the specific purpose of begging on the streets. There must be hundreds of children on the streets day in day out who are used for begging purposes. We heard in the House previously that vans drive around and drop the children off at various points throughout the city where they have to beg, often in inclement weather conditions. That issue will have to be addressed immediately. Those children are at risk. Who profits from their begging on the streets? While there is poverty in the country, the abuse of children in systematic type begging is appalling and should not be allowed at the start of a new millennium.</P>
    <P>I welcome the family welfare conference system provided for in the Bill. If a child commits an offence and is brought before the family welfare conference and the parents or guardians come and discuss it in an open forum, without the pressure of the court and the confrontational type legal system, the child might accept it has done wrong and the parents might accept they have been negligent in their duty to look after and rear the child in a normal fashion. In that way it may be possible to resolve the problem without recourse to the legal system. The family welfare conference is an innovative idea but the health boards must have in place a stand alone fund for this purpose. Health boards must not shy away from their responsibilities due to a lack of funding. I have outlined cases where judges have been unable to put children into detention units simply because they do not exist. The family welfare conference can make a huge contribution to helping children at an early age. It will allow health board officers build up a knowledge of which children are at risk at an early stage. If that is put in place along with the centralised computerised enrolment system we may be able to pick out the <Col N="773" /> children before they move into a cycle of violence.</P>
    <P>The provision of special care orders is a positive step. There are children who have to be put into care. There have been cases where children were a threat to themselves and to others. A case was reported in Cork of a young child being placed in completely unsuitable bed and breakfast accommodation. If we are to build proper detention centres and use the special care order elements of this legislation, we must provide the necessary detention units and human resources to deal with children in a compassionate but firm manner, for their own good and for the good of society. This has not been done in a co-ordinated fashion in the past.</P>
    <P>The diversion programme makes huge advances in steering a child away from a life of crime. This programme was formerly known as the juvenile liaison scheme and is now to be put on a statutory footing. Section 19 sets out the objective of the diversion programme. This is &ldquo;to divert from committing further offences any child who accepts responsibility for his or her criminal behaviour&rdquo;. Section 20 establishes that the diversion programme shall be managed &ldquo;by a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent&rdquo;. The officer will be called the director and will be under the &ldquo;general superintendence and control of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Garda are trained to deal with adults. Juveniles who are involved in crime think differently and must be treated differently from adults. A proper training programme must be put in place to allow garda to update their skills in this regard. Dealing with a juvenile is very different from dealing with an adult and garda are trained to deal with adults. Resources must be made available to ensure that the gardá can implement this legislation in a caring and fair manner.</P>
    <P>Victims of crime are rarely consulted with regard to sentencing and the conduct of court cases. Section 26 provides for restorative cautioning. The section provides that a victim may be present at the administration of a formal caution. This will allow for discussions during which the child will have to confront the effects of his or her behaviour. The child will also be invited to apologise and to make some form of reparation to the victim. A child might commit an offence at an early age but for him to confront his victim and discuss his crime openly could be a very positive step. Most children, even those who have committed crimes, are remorseful. This facility, by which children can be made to understand the consequences of their actions, and the family welfare conference system are to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Part 5 sets a new age of criminal responsibility, places the <i>doli incapax </i>rule on a statutory basis, clarifies the duties of the Garda Síochána when dealing with an underage child and creates a new offence of aiding or abetting an underage child to commit an offence. Section 54 makes it clear that &ldquo;a person who aids, abets, counsels or procures a <Col N="774" /> child to be responsible for an act or omission which, but for the child's age, would be an offence can be indicted, tried and prosecuted as the principal offender&rdquo;. This is a very important provision. We have all heard of children who have been used by adults for criminal activity. We have heard of young children being used to climb through small bathroom windows to steal from houses. We must address this problem and it is important that this section is applied forcefully. The courts must make it very clear to people who have access to children that the use of children to commit crimes is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. An adult may encourage and help a child to commit an offence, knowing that only the child can be prosecuted. Sections 51 and 54 are very welcome.</P>
    <P>We must try to understand why children are becoming involved in crime at an early age. We have problems with regard to drug, alcohol and gambling addictions. These issues must be addressed in other fora. We must be responsive to children and try to understand how this involvement comes about. I hope the Bill will be seen as a caring and understanding piece of legislation. I hope it will deal firmly with adults who are in positions of responsibility and ensure they confront the consequences of their actions.</P>
    <P>The State has neglected its duties regarding the spiralling problem of drug addiction, alcohol abuse and gambling. People who deal regularly with children say that their involvement with crime is usually the result of a family problem or addiction. Until we deal with this aspect of the problem we will be using this legislation to fill detention units and to provide subjects for family welfare conferences. Resources must be targeted at areas where high unemployment is coupled with drug abuse and other social problems. We all know where these social black spots are and we must provide resources in the form of education, sport and recreation facilities and employment opportunities to confront this problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. Through the diversion programme and family welfare conference system, it will make an important contribution towards steering young offenders on a path away from crime. Until we deal with the underlying difficulties we will continually fill our detention units with children who should not be in them.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will clarify the question of an early enrolment system which would allow for an early check on children who are not attending school and the reasons for that. I cannot understand why children can be seen begging in the streets in front of the offices of local authorities and even of the national parliament during school hours. This is unacceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill, although it has been a long time in coming. The Children Bill, 1996, was before the House for quite some time and had reached Second Stage on 12 February 1996. If this Bill had been brought forward sooner we might have saved a number of <Col N="775" /> children from a life of crime. The most important point to be made, and it has been made by many previous speakers, is that if the necessary resources are not made available to implement the measures contained not just in this Bill but also the Child Care Act and other legislation, nothing will be achieved.</P>
      <P>The Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science, and Health and Children should indicate to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, the funding necessary to implement the Bill properly and deal with the hugely serious issue of children at risk and children who drift into crime. They should not get up from the table until they have pinned him down on the issue. It will be a difficult task given the attitude displayed by him in public statements. While he wants to cut the tax bill, it is clear that he does not want to spend money on these crucially important public services. If we fail to address the problem of children who drift into crime and who find themselves alienated from society, we will find ourselves in serious difficulty. The necessary resources should be made available to provide the extra staff required in the health boards and the Probation and Welfare Service to implement the measures contained in the Bill. I wish the Ministers well in dealing with the Minister for Finance who has demonstrated a lack of urgency in tackling the issue. More statements should be issued by the two Government parties supporting the spending of public money in these areas. They are not being issued from the top.</P>
      <P>We all know of children who are at risk. Those of us who are members of health boards are aware of the serious problems encountered in dealing with what are euphemistically described as out-of-control children. It is not the best term to use. It is not good enough that the health board of which I am a member had to send five children to Northern Ireland and mainland Britain to be cared for. There are many other cases where the health boards have not intervened.</P>
      <P>The age of those involved in crime seems to be falling continuously. They are being distanced from society and do not seem to understand the havoc they are causing to their families, relations and neighbours. As I drove along the canal last week on my way home from Leinster House there were youngsters throwing stones at cars. They had no understanding of the danger caused. About two days later in my city of Limerick a group of youngsters who looked to be no older than 12 years ducked across O'Connell Street through the traffic, one of whom threw something at the windscreen of a car. These incidents are relatively minor in comparison to the incidents that occur at the homes of elderly persons who, as Deputy Kelleher said, frequently have their windows broken by young people to terrify them. This is a huge problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="776" /> From talking to social workers and other professionals involved in child care, particularly in health boards, children are presenting problems at a younger age. This is a source of serious concern. I agree with Deputy Kelleher on the need for early intervention. There is a need to support the health boards and organisations such as Barnardos which are working with these children. Schools in areas with a high incidence of crime need greater support of the kind available under the Breaking the Cycle scheme. Sports clubs should also be supported. If children can be diverted away from crime at an early age we will do society a huge service. Deputy Cooper-Flynn said that the question was being asked, &ldquo;Is anybody doing anything about the problem?&rdquo; If there is anybody which should be doing something about it, it is her own party, which should display a greater sense of urgency.</P>
    <P>The Bill succeeds in providing a comprehensive legislative framework in which the serious issue of juvenile justice and troubled children can be addressed. This is long overdue and I am confident that following a detailed examination of the Bill on Committee and Remaining Stages it will amount to fine legislation. I welcome in particular the provisions dealing with family welfare conferences, special care orders to be issued by the health boards, restorative cautioning and non-custodial options, but they will only be effective if the necessary resources are provided.</P>
    <P>Section 13 sets out how the health boards, which are already short of funds, can give effect to the recommendations of a family welfare conference. Will the necessary resources be made available? This is crucial. The purpose of the restorative cautioning provisions is to ensure young people are forced to confront the consequences of their actions. I hope, however, they will not be separated and distanced from the community which has been affected and that their families will be directly involved. If implemented properly these provisions will make a big difference.</P>
    <P>Those who work in communities are aware that the Bill is only part of the solution in dealing with the crisis in child welfare. The provision of the necessary resources is critical to the success of the Bill in helping children at risk. The problem is getting worse every day. Staff shortages are critical. The determination needed to recruit the necessary staff to cope with current demand, let alone new responsibilities, is lacking. I was informed in reply to a parliamentary question on 7 March that a further 63 staff will be required in the Probation and Welfare Service alone to ensure implementation of the Bill. No timetable for the recruitment of these staff has been provided by the Minister. All he has said is that recruitment will be intensified over the next two years. He should address this issue seriously to ensure the Bill is effective. If the necessary resources are not provided the Bill will remain little more than an aspirational wish-list of how we think the system should work. This is not good enough. There is a need to invest resources to <Col N="777" /> ensure the Bill has an impact on young people. This cannot be over-emphasised.</P>
    <P>Crisis management has been the defining characteristic of child welfare services to date. Unless resources are provided that will remain the case. Early intervention in families experiencing difficulties and letting families know that support and help are available at the earliest opportunity is urgently needed. Often the families most in need of intervention are the hardest to reach. If one knows the family history and what the big brothers are at, it is possible to identify at the age of one or two the children likely to get into trouble. It seems State services only take notice when a child is at risk or comes in contact with the Garda Síochána. Intervention at this stage is often too late. Early intervention which focuses on the child and the family is urgently needed. In addition to the staff shortages, the chronic lack of proper residential units to deal with existing demand is a disgrace. This point was also highlighted during questions to the Minister for Health and Children earlier. In the High Court, Mr. Justice Peter Kelly has been forced to repeatedly call the Government to account for failing to vindicate the constitutional rights of troubled children in the face of official inertia.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year lawyers representing a number of children who were in need of urgent and specialised care had to seek an injunction forcing the Department of Health and Children to live up to the commitments it gave to provide additional secure units. The Department went to court, seeking to ditch the timetable it agreed to at an earlier hearing. Fortunately, the Department lost that case and has been required to build the agreed units. However, the fact that it took a legal injunction to force the Government to provide even the most basic number of secure units beggars belief.</P>
    <P>I tabled a question on 9 March to the Minister for Health and Children on the plans for these units. As a member of the Mid-Western Health Board, I am aware of the need for such units. In his reply, the Minister outlined a number of units which are planned in various health board areas, but the problem is that they are not due to be available until 2000 and, in some cases, 2001. In the meantime, there are no appropriate places for the children concerned. The Minister also announced that he intended to set up a new interim body which would pre-empt the body which will be established under Part 2 of the Bill. While that is welcome, there should be a sense of urgency about providing these places as soon as possible. Many children are in totally inappropriate units because appropriate places have not been provided. The fact that we are still waiting for these units is indicative of a Government which refuses to place the welfare of children at the top of its political agenda.</P>
    <P>A teenage girl came to public attention last week. She had not committed any crime but she was in need of care and support. She was sent to an institution for the criminally insane because no <Col N="778" /> other facility was available for her. There have been a number of similar cases over the past two years and there is an urgent need to address this issue. Over the past two to three years I have raised the cases of children who have been sent out of this jurisdiction by my health board and other boards. If the behaviour of children is causing serious concern to a health board, the children will inevitably end up before the courts and start a life of crime if there is not correct intervention. This matter must be given the urgency that Mr. Justice Kelly has forced the Government to give to such cases.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelleher raised the issue of children begging. Will the Minister clarify section 247 in Part 12 which contains a reference to this issue? The section re-enacts the offence of causing or procuring a child to beg. I understand that it will place a bigger onus on adults and be tougher on those who send out a child to beg. I support this provision and perhaps the Minister could indicate how it will work. It horrifies us all that children are still being sent out on the streets to beg. Often they are not dressed in warm clothes and they are sent out to beg when they should be receiving the type of education we all want for our children. Often the adult appears to get away with it and there does not appear to be proper intervention on behalf of the child. The Garda, the health boards and the education system do not appear able to intervene. If this measure can solve the problem, the Bill will be valuable in that area.</P>
    <P>I also welcome section 246 which deals with cruelty to or the neglect of children. It deals relatively well with the ill-treatment and maltreatment of children. I am glad it includes issues such as frightening, bullying or threatening a child because the issue of bullying has not been properly addressed in terms of adults and children up to now. This is a welcome move, but it is in contrast to the attitude of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform regarding the Statute of Limitations Bill which is being dealt with by the Seanad. He was not willing to include physical abuse in that Bill which I published and the Government accepted.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, that legislation has been watered down because the reference to physical abuse has been removed. If the issue of physical abuse in the present can be addressed, I do not understand why that problem in the past cannot be addressed. However, I welcome its inclusion in this Bill. I hope the problem of cruelty to and neglect of children can be addressed. Despite the progress that society has managed to achieve in some areas, many children are still neglected and cruelly treated sometimes by their parents and sometimes by whoever is looking after them. There is no point dealing with the problems of the past in this area if we are not also willing to deal with current problems. I welcome that aspect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>A policy on children does not appear to be a priority for the Government. One of the reasons for this is that at least three Departments, includ<Col N="779" /> ing the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Education and Science, have responsibility for this area. My party favours the creation of a Department and Minister for children so that this issue can be raised at the Cabinet table and placed centre stage. If that happened, the issues would not be in the remit of different Departments which pass responsibility for them from one to another.</P>
    <P>There may be difficulty getting the resources to implement the Bill because the issue is divided between a number of Departments. There is no single Minister who can go to the Cabinet table or approach the Minister for Finance and say that money is needed now to implement policies. If this does not change, there will be a continuation of a very disjointed society where some children are well nourished, looked after and educated and get a good start in life but, sadly, others are not. The Bill, in conjunction with the Childcare Act and other measures, should provide the type of start we all want for our children.</P>
    <P>The issue of resources is urgent and I hope the Minister will not wait long after the Bill has been dealt with by both Houses of the Oireachtas and enacted before sections are enforced. It appears to take years for some measures to come into force. I urge the Minister to enact the Bill as soon as possible. He should sit down with the Minister for Finance and secure the substantial funds which are necessary. The health boards, the probation service and other sectors involved in this area should be in a position to recruit the necessary staff and provide the necessary facilities and secure places so these children can have the possibility of a life other than one of crime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinBrady" hpid="Mr. M. Brady Mr. M. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is most welcome and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, and his officials should be commended on producing such comprehensive consolidating legislation. The Bill retains the good aspects of the old measures in the various Children Acts and supplements them with many new provisions, structures and institutions which, when implemented, will provide a comprehensive framework of advice and care for children in our community who are at risk, in need of care or require remedial and rehabilitative attention and treatment if they have offended against the law and society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My principal theme in welcoming the Bill is the concept of responsibility. The care and development of children involves many interlocking and overlapping responsibilities. As all adults, and particularly those with children, will appreciate and as Deputy O'Sullivan pointed out, parents and guardians have a responsibility towards children. The State also has a responsibility towards children, parents and guardians. The final aspect is the inclusion and acquisition of a sense of responsibility on the part of the child and its progressive development to a point where it is able <Col N="780" /> to take its place and play a full part in adult society.</P>
    <P>The Bill, which displays a caring ethos, is concerned with the rehabilitation of offenders rather than their detention and punishment. It has been proven that the latter do not work and they will not work in the future. The Bill is concerned with putting in place appropriate systems and structures which will permit assisted interventions by parents, community and social workers, Garda personnel, the Judiciary or other appropriate people in cases where a child, either through his own behaviour or that of those in whose care he is or with whom he is associated, is deemed to be at risk or to pose a threat to the security of himself or others.</P>
    <P>Sections 52 to 54 deal with the age of criminal responsibility. I am pleased the Minister has finally moved away from an essentially Victorian, if not medieval, concept of what constituted the age of reason in respect of criminal acts perpetrated by children. All those aiding and abetting or effectively putting a child up to committing what would, but for age, be criminal acts and who are, to all intents and purposes, corrupting the child, in the widest sense of the word, can be charged and tried as principal offenders.</P>
    <P>I welcome the various provisions which either enable or require parents or guardians to discharge their responsibilities to children through their participation in family welfare conferences, as detailed in sections 7 to 16 of the Bill, and also through the provisions in section 91 which oblige them to attend all stages of proceedings in court where a case is being heard against their child.</P>
    <P>Sections 111 and 112 are very important in that parents can now be issued with a court parental supervision order. This can be imposed where the court takes the view that the parents' failure to control their child or to neglect it have contributed to the behaviour which resulted in the child being found guilty of an offence. It is also good that the courts will be provided with discretionary power to oblige parents to undergo treatment for alcohol and substance abuse or to participate in a parenting skills course. This is evident in many sections of society where certain families exercise no control whatsoever over their children. As Deputy O'Sullivan stated, the residents of senior citizens' complexes are being harassed by children, ranging in age from 14 downwards, who should not be out late at night.</P>
    <P>Many Members will be aware of this problem from personal experience &ndash; for example, they may be familiar with it from incidents which affected their extended families. Behavioural problems in children can stem from addictive behaviour in adults. Such behaviour provides a bad example. There is a wealth of statistical and research evidence in this area. As public representatives, we are often approached by people in our clinics who are experiencing problems with their children.</P>
    <P>Section 113 of the Bill which enables a court to compel parents or guardians to pay compensation <Col N="781" /> to the victim or victims of an offence committed by their children is also intended to bring home to parents the fact that their responsibilities extend to the consequences of negative actions on the part of their children. This is a welcome development. Similarly, section 114 is designed to emphasise parental responsibilities and gives the courts power to order parents to enter into a recognisance to exercise proper and adequate control over their children. Such discipline is lacking in many homes.</P>
    <P>The taking of personal responsibility by the child for his or her behaviour and actions, in addition to parental responsibility, is being encouraged by means of the provisions in sections 117 to 132 of the Bill. These deal with such matters as community sanctions, community service orders, probation orders, day care centre orders, the provision of training or educational activities by the probation and welfare service, intensive supervision, residential supervision and suitable persons or mentor orders. As Deputy O'Sullivan pointed out, there is a need to provide adequate human and financial resources to implement these measures. The Minister has assured us that he will take the necessary steps to ensure that the resources which are required will be put in place.</P>
    <P>The measures provided for in sections 133 to 136 empower the courts to impose restrictions on movement orders on child offenders. These orders can result in the imposition of curfews or barring orders from premises or their vicinities or a particular locality. This is a welcome development which will go a long way towards eliminating the harassment of many senior citizens. If properly operated and enforced, these measures could provide a considerable measure of relief from some of the worst types of anti-social behaviour perpetrated by juveniles against the more vulnerable sections of the community such as old people living alone, widows or single parents who may be unaccountably singled out for harassment by groups of inadequately supervised children.</P>
    <P>Section 137 gives the courts, as they see fit, the power to mix and match, in individual circumstances, restriction orders with probation orders or day care centre orders. In keeping with the tenor of the Bill, this power is specifically designed to provide caring and law enforcement authorities with a flexible and sophisticated range of responses. It will enable them to design and tailor individual rehabilitation programmes to individual children's domestic, educational and developmental circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 247 re-enacts the offence of causing or procuring a child to beg. Deputies O'Sullivan and Kelleher referred to this problem which has become very prevalent. On any day of the week, regardless of the weather conditions, one can see children as young as six and seven years of age begging on O'Connell Bridge. The adults responsible for them come along, collect the money they have been given and proceed to buy take-aways or go to a pub for a drink. That behaviour is unacceptable and there is no need for it. A casual <Col N="782" /> observation of what happens on our city's streets shows that this practice is endemic and, in these better times, can only be explained in terms of being an organised, calculated and completely unnecessary activity.</P>
    <P>The placing of the evidential burden on the appropriate adult, usually the parent of the begging child, to show that he or she did not send the child out to beg should go some way towards the elimination of this practice, which is a particularly repellent form of child abuse. The long-term negative effects this may have on children can never be measured. It may destroy their confidence or place them at a disadvantage when they enter adult life and try to participate in society.</P>
    <P>Section 259 provides a limited &ldquo;clean slate&rdquo; in respect of most offences committed by children. This is also consistent with the Bill's emphasis on rehabilitation and the giving of a second chance.</P>
    <P>The institutional provisions relating to family welfare conferences and the revitalisation of the juvenile liaison scheme, which will be restructured and renamed the diversion programme, are positive steps forward. The provisions relating to children in custody and court proceedings are comprehensive and well thought out. The abolition of reformatories and industrial schools and their replacement by children detention schools, under the care of boards of management, and the establishment of a special residential services board to oversee the provision of care for children in detention are all evidence of the State's willingness and ability to shoulder its share of the responsibility for troubled children in our society.</P>
    <P>We must learn from our past mistakes and oversights and enshrine in legislation the necessary safeguards for children in care or detention to ensure their wellbeing is protected at all times and that those to whose care they are given are conscious of their responsibilities in this area. That is most important.</P>
    <P>Legislative provisions are important but steps must also be taken to ensure appropriate human and financial resources are committed to the new institutions so they can work properly. Shameful incidents like housing troubled children in wholly inappropriate facilities such as the Central Mental Hospital should become a bad memory. We have the resources to do things properly. Let us do that and protect our children.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I commend the Minister and his officials on introducing it. A great deal of work and thought went into it. If the human and financial resources are provided and the necessary steps taken, this will be one of the most important Bills to be discussed in the House for years. Our children and young people are the most important members of society. We have a responsibility to ensure that they are confident and able to fend for themselves and that they are not disillusioned by bad experiences or bad example as a result of being abused or used in the wrong way. In some cases children are aided and abetted in begging and other criminal activities <Col N="783" /> by parents and extended families. They might see little else from morning to whatever time they go to bed, although some are wandering the streets all night. I have been told of children who do not return home until 6 a.m. Whose fault is that? Who is responsible? The parents are responsible.</P>
    <P>This Bill will go a long way towards eliminating such practices and behaviour and ensuring that parents are made more responsible. I commend the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is good to see this Bill before the House at last. The present situation, which gives no support or comfort to the victims of the misdeeds of children, is unacceptable. The Bill is a step forward and, while it is described as radical, it must be open to ongoing scrutiny.</P>
      <P>The current difficulties whereby young people who are disturbed non-offenders are mistreated by the justice system must stop. The Bill gives some relief to those unfortunates. Indeed, in many instances, it is not only the child who is badly treated but also the parents. The manner in which those who are guilty of criminal misdeeds are treated is also about to change.</P>
      <P>Since the evolution of a more open society where the strong arm of the law is no longer accepted, a growing difficulty has existed. In the past many would have received an enthusiastic reprimand from the local garda for anti-social behaviour but for the past 20 to 30 years social behavioural problems have slid away from society's control. The system was not equipped to meet the challenge which these young offenders presented to the structural conformity of enforcement facilities. The problem of young offenders being housed with hardened criminals or those who have established anti-social tendencies meant that instead of being reformed the young offender was encouraged and, in many cases, taught to breach further the ground rules of society.</P>
      <P>The issue of juvenile offenders is complex and, as such, deserves the focused support of the justice system. Young offenders must be taken seriously and dealt with in an appropriate manner. The change in the age of criminal responsibility is a good development which will generate respect for the law. When the age is too low the issue of responsibility is blurred and allows those who have responsibility to sidestep it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many children who have a pattern of disruption and anti-social behaviour are also non-offending. These young people and their families must be afforded the support which will give them the opportunity to conform with and accept the norms of society. They and their parents and guardians need the structured support of society in facing their problems. The concept of the family conference which will involve all players is a positive step forward. Young people whose characters are in the early stages of formation must be given the supports and structures to lay the foundations for a good adult life. In many <Col N="784" /> cases the deviant behavioural pattern is a response to factors outside the control of the child.</P>
    <P>The family conference facilitates a full review of the social and cultural environment together with the other influences which may contribute to the malconformity in which the child engages. It is attended by the child, fellow family members, social and care workers, gardá and educationists. Understanding the scale of the problem enables a critical path of recovery to be found. It is most important that when, as a last resort, these young people are taken into care they are not included in the correctional detention system. They should remain separate from those convicted of criminal offences to minimise the prospect of corruption.</P>
    <P>I trust that, where appropriate, the family welfare conferences will be open to the positive players in the life of the children &ndash; the gardá, social workers, parents, teachers, sporting club volunteers and whoever might be capable of reaching out to the young person to bring him or her back into the community. It must be recognised that when society fails, everybody fails. I am heartened to note the Minister's clear focus on the desire to have young offenders reintegrated into community and society. Dealing with a problem, even a criminal problem, in a reasonable and realistic manner which takes account of the young age of an offender is the correct approach.</P>
    <P>Many of us might have become young offenders but for the correctional habits of our parents. Where issues are dealt with sensitively causing the offender to own up to their responsibility for the offence and to appreciate the scope and impact of their actions on the victim, the community, their families and themselves, they have been able to adjust their behavioural pattern and go on to make a valuable contribution to society.</P>
    <P>While I support the approach detailed in the Bill, I am concerned that it is not viewed as an easy way out. I do not want a situation where the culprit simply says, &ldquo;Let us put up with the grief even for five minutes and get back to our old ways&rdquo;. The process must have respect for the seriousness of a situation. It must not be used by any of the players as the easy option. If used correctly, it might not be the easy option but the best one.</P>
    <P>The victim's participation in such conferences causes me some concern. It is important that the victims who attend receive psychological support and counselling to ensure it is a positive experience and that they are not further victimised by the process. In rare cases it is possible that the victim might not be a positive force at such conferences. In some rare situations, it is also possible that the victim may not be a positive force at these conferences and some guidance must be given to the facilitator as to the appropriateness of the attendance of the victim. The capacity of the facilitator to draw up the contract of action is very important as is his or her ability to ensure it is realistic and appropriate and that all have the <Col N="785" /> ability to live by it. State agencies must have the capacity to service the contract in the same way as the offender must be able to meet his obligations. The facilitator's role is extremely important and can be the making of the process. To this end, I trust the Minister has plans in place to enable all those who are envisaged as chair facilitators to be given first class training to enable them transform the problem into a success story.</P>
    <P>The opportunity to have the victim present when formal cautioning is applied is a good early deterrent. It shows the seriousness of the situation and yet does not blow things out of proportion. The Children Court will enforce the action plan formulated after the family conference. It is important and desirable in ensuring the contract is respected. The benefit is that no criminal record will exist while society as a whole will benefit from the change in the behaviour patterns of the young.</P>
    <P>There is a recognition that, on occasions, young offenders who are before the courts might best be dealt with by the intervention of the health board. That the court can direct the health board to organise a family welfare conference and report back with its proposal is truly positive. </P>
    <P>The role of the parent in the life of the child is also recognised and the facility to hold the parent responsible in certain situations is welcome, but does it go far enough? Is it not too vague as to have real meaning? There are, as the Minister recognises, some parents who have a totally irresponsible attitude to the well-being of their children and take no responsibility for the control of their off-spring. Parents in such situations share in the negative outcome of their neglect of their responsibility.</P>
    <P>The issue of payment of compensation should be enhanced making it a debt against the parent, irrespective of ability to pay. Failure to carry out parental duties has been a source of cost and parents should repay that cost irrespective of the amount of time it takes to recover it. If a parent claims inability to pay, the option is a community service order against him or her. Parents must be forced to take their role seriously.</P>
    <P>The obligation on health boards to apply for a social care order in respect of children found in their care and who are in need of special care and protection is a good thing as is the establishment of special residential service boards charged with the co-ordination of residential services, whether detention schools or special care units. The Minister must ensure sufficient places are made available suitable to meet the needs of the young community. It is not good enough to introduce radical legislation and clap oneself on the back if young people are passed from Billy to Jack and forced into a life of anti-social behaviour at best, if not downright criminal activity. Money needs to be spent to support this Bill.</P>
    <P>I refer to disturbing events affecting my constituency and on which Deputy Martin Brady commented, that is, the presence of gangs of youths roaming in estates and causing mayhem <Col N="786" /> for the elderly, their neighbours and everyone living in the area. The problem is that when residents report these matters to the local Garda station, the gardá arrive but they export the problem to another estate. On the northside of Dublin and elsewhere in the city, youths roam the streets until 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. without parental control. Elderly people and others must live in a state of fear. Their homes are like prisons, they are afraid to go out and they cannot lead a proper life.</P>
    <P>I have written to the Minister on several occasions and he has helped by getting in touch with the local garda who visit these people, which is of some comfort to them. However, we are not coming to grips with the problem which seems to be getting even worse. Local authorities provided excellent open spaces but have had to remove them because they were providing cover to these youths who sit outside people's homes drinking, taking drugs and engaging in anti-social behaviour until the early hours of the morning. They are creating mayhem and are making life difficult for law abiding residents in these areas.</P>
    <P>I get telephone calls daily in my office informing me of such behaviour. A lady telephoned me today and told me that in an open space in Sutton youths pulled down a wall and broke into her back garden, which they were using. There was no way she could get rid of them. This behaviour has to stop. Parks are not there to give cover to people engaged in anti-social behaviour. Each day youths gather in our parks. People look forward to summer evenings but if they live near a park, they do not look forward to them. In the long evenings, youths gather in parks and make life unbearable. This must be tackled at an early stage.</P>
    <P>I know there is a Private Members' Bill before the House, but I would like to touch on the issue of joyriding on the northside of the city and in the city generally. Youths are buying old bangers for £20 or £30 and are causing mayhem in estates. They are driving around at speeds which will kill people. They must be taken to task. We must face up to this problem. The garda must tackle this problem. I know they are doing their best, but perhaps they are not fully equipped. They must be given the wherewithal to tackle this problem and ensure the city is free for people to use and enjoy it. </P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this important Bill. It has been recognised by all speakers that this Chidden Bill was overdue. I am glad, however, the Minister did not rush in and cobble together a Bill which would not have met the needs of the country in this day and age. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we are aware, the Children Bill, 1999, will repeal the Children Act, 1908, which is from a different century. It is modern comprehensive legislation which will cover three main areas of the law. It provides the framework within which the juvenile justice system can continue to develop. It re-enacts and updates provisions in <Col N="787" /> the 1908 Act protecting children against abuse by persons who have the custody, charge or care of them. It provides for a family welfare conference and contains other provisions to deal with out of control non-offending children.</P>
    <P>There are several parts to this Bill and the responsibilities of the Minister for Health and Children include the family welfare conference, children in need of special care and treatment and the special residential services board. It would have been a mistake not to have taken an holistic approach to this matter as the care of children falls within the remit of the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Education and Science. It is only right that the Minister should draw those threads together.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, there is an overlap, given the integrated nature of the Bill. Under section 78, for example, the court may direct the health board to convene a family welfare conference for a child before it on a criminal charge if it is of the view that the child's real problem is the need for care or protection.</P>
    <P>A number of sections deal with the juvenile justice aspect. One of the reasons for the Bill is that young offenders, by reason of their age and level of maturity deserve to be treated differently from adults. The juvenile justice system that developed under the 1908 Act was incapable of further development unless underpinned by new legislation. Any legislation that dates from the beginning of the century has run its course and needs to be updated. With modern thinking reflected in the Bill, in time, there should be a notable decrease in juvenile offending. The objectives of the Bill are to divert first time and non-serious child offenders from inclusion in the criminal justice system. It is important that young children are not stigmatised before they become teenagers, as happened under the old system. I am glad the Minister has included this. Another objective is to provide the court with the means under which they do not necessarily have to proceed to a finding in more serious or persistent cases. It is important that the courts have options rather than being limited to one course of action.</P>
    <P>A third objective is to deal with children found guilty of offences through the imposition of a community sanction. The Minister has provided ten community sanctions, eight of which are new. This gives great scope to make decisions that will not criminalise young children. Another objective is to reintegrate child offenders into the community where the court, as a last resort, orders detention. This is one of the most important aspects of the Bill as it will help prevent such children re-offending. It will be an enormous task but we must face up to it.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned restorative justice. It is a new concept. New Zealand has pioneered many new ideas, this one among them. It has several meanings but the Bill gives effect to the most commonly known one, every action that is pri<Col N="788" /> marily orientated towards doing justice by restoring the harm that has been caused by crime. One way of doing that is to bring together the parties who have a stake in a particular offence to resolve collectively how to deal with the aftermath of the offence and its implications for the future. The Bill provides two examples of restorative justice and while these have been influenced by the New Zealand model, in practical terms they are quite different. It would not be possible to transplant one country's method of dealing with juvenile crime because of cultural differences, crime trends and so on. While it is necessary to acknowledge differences, the idea should be taken on board.</P>
    <P>The first example of restorative justice is given in Part 4, the Garda diversion programme. Incorporated in that is a conference that may or may not be chaired by a garda. It will provide a forum for the child, parents, other family members, the victim and possibly other interested persons, where appropriate, to discuss the child's offending and the reasons for it. It will confront the child with the consequences of his or her actions and establish the basis for a lifestyle that does not include anti-social behaviour. It will allow the child to apologise and possibly make reparation to the victim. This concept is very important. It goes back to the notion of the extended family that used to be part of our society but which has broken down not only here but throughout western society. Affluence takes over, the nuclear family is affected and the extended family ignored. Involving the whole family in the development and control of the young members of the family is an excellent idea.</P>
    <P>Section 26 provides for restorative cautioning under which the victim may be present at the administration of a formal caution to the child. This allows for a less formal type of conferencing which will be suited to cases where a more structured conference might not be appropriate or justifiable. The courts are also given the power to direct the probation and welfare service to convene family conferences. These will be similar to Garda conferences and will be appropriate to cases where the garda consider they have no option but to prosecute, that is, where the non-enforceable aspects of the Garda conference might have led to compliance difficulties. The benefits and advantages of the court directed conferences are that there is an opportunity for the case against the child to be finalised without proceeding to a finding, with all that would entail. Second, the child and his or her family would have a say in finding a solution, it would not have been imposed by the court. Third, the outcome of the conference will be supervised by the court and will be enforceable. Fourth, it is not an easy outcome. The recommendations of a family conference may include the making of an apology to the victim, the making of reparation, restriction on the child's movements and participation by the child in supervised activities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="789" /> I welcome the change in the age of criminal responsibility which is being raised from seven to 12 years. Children under that age will become the responsibility of the health boards and among their intervention options will be the convening of a family welfare conference. The arguments in favour of raising the age to 12 years is that, first, the former Oireachtas Select Committee on Crime, after a thorough examination of the issues involved recommended the age of 12 years in its first report. Second, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child criticised our low age of criminal responsibility. The 1996 Bill recommended that it be raised to ten years. Third, the number of children under the age of 12 who have come to the notice of the Garda is relatively low. The 1998 crime report shows that 1,000 children under the age of 12 were reported to the Garda national juvenile office on the suspicion of committing offences. Fourth, although raising the age to 12 years will mean that children under that age who commit offences will no longer qualify for admission to the Garda diversion programme, they will still have contact with community gardá. This will be on a more integrated and co-operative basis with other agencies such as health boards. Fifth, it would not be possible to raise the age in stages by means of regulations as proposed in the 1996 Bill. Sixth, regardless of the specific arguments, the fact is that raising the age of criminal responsibility to 12 years is right. It is the age below which we would not wish to see our children criminalised.</P>
    <P>The court will have two new powers that may result in cases not proceeding to finality. First is the family conference and, second, the convening of a family welfare conference by the health boards to ascertain if the child's real problem is the need of care or protection. These are two important new additions to the Bill highlighting the greater emphasis on care and protection and restorative justice. Where the court proceeds to a finding of guilt, it will usually request a probation officer's report. The need not to do so will only arise where the court is imposing a minor penalty, such as a small fine, or where it already has an up to date report on the child available to it. The system of reports is central to the success of the Bill. Not only will they contain information resulting from interviews with the child and, where practicable, other family members, and information on the child's behaviour and willingness to make amends, educational circumstances and prospects, motive for the offence and likelihood of reoffending, they will also give a view on what would be the best way of dealing with the child and on what is available.</P>
    <P>Since it is a principle that detention will be a last resort, it is important that the Bill provide credible alternatives. The Minister has provided ten community sanctions of which eight are new. The courts are thus given extensive new powers to impose appropriate sanctions on child offenders which can be served in the community and do not involve institutional detention. The <Col N="790" /> varied nature of the sanctions should ensure that, for every child found guilty of an offence on whom the court wishes to impose a community sanction, a suitable and appropriate sanction will be available no matter what the child's problems or needs. The community sanctions were also included in the 1996 Bill and few significant changes have been made to them. The suitable person order has been renamed the mentor order to emphasise the mentoring nature of the order. Otherwise it is similar to that contained in the 1996 Bill.</P>
    <P>An important new provision is that concerning the responsibility of parents for their delinquent children. Two existing provisions which require parents to pay compensation or to be bound over to control their child have been added to by the inclusion of a parental supervision order. The courts will be empowered to impose this order on parents where they are satisfied that a wilful failure on the part of parents to take care of or control their child contributed to the child's offending. This is a typical carrot and stick order under which the parents will, for example, be given the opportunity to partake in a parenting skills course or receive treatment for substance abuse. Failure to comply may result in being in contempt of court.</P>
    <P>This is very important. Many years ago, when I worked on a building site, I noticed that some children came home to empty houses and they became what is known as &ldquo;latchkey kids&rdquo;. It was not long before those of us in the area noticed that these were the children who were getting into trouble because no one was there between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. or 7 p.m. to control them. Parental responsibility must be highlighted. If it cannot be done by use of the carrot, then the stick must be used. If children are not directed on to the proper course when they are young, they will move in circles which will cause them to get into trouble.</P>
    <P>The detention provisions are largely similar to those in the 1996 Act, although they have been substantially redrafted. There are some important changes. First, because of the fear of a revolving door syndrome developing in the schools of detention for children run by the Department of Education and Science, it is made clear that a court cannot order the detention of a child under 16 years of age unless a place in such a school is available. The alternatives for the court in such circumstances are to defer making the order until a place is available or to impose a community sanction as an alternative. The latter provision is new in the 1999 Bill. The second change is the introduction of a detention and supervision order for 16 and 17 year olds and this will allow the court to split the sentence equally between detention and supervision in the community thus allowing for better aftercare and integration.</P>
    <P>The protection provisions are essentially an updating of the 1908 Act and, while they have not changed radically from the 1996 Bill, there are two significant differences. First, the scope of the <Col N="791" /> cruelty offence has been broadened to include a child's mental or emotional health or wellbeing. The 1996 Bill only referred to the physical health or wellbeing. One of the components of cruelty is being expanded to include frightening, bullying or threatening a child. These changes give effect to recommendations of the former Select Committee on Social Affairs in section 246 of its 1997 report on non-fatal offences against a person in respect of children. Second, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, 1993, is being amended to raise the penalty for soliciting a child for the purposes of prostitution. This is a holding operation pending a more considered examination of the issue of child prostitution in the context of the analysis of the discussion paper on the law on sexual offences.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and congratulate the Minister on bringing forward balanced legislation which has met the desires and wishes of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I welcome the Bill. Although the Minister described it as a flagship in terms of new legislation, it has taken him a long time to raise the flag in this instance and all involved have been under starter's orders for a long time. Much of the Bill is similar to that introduced by Deputy Currie when he was Minister of State with responsibility for this area in the previous Government. I compliment him on his endeavours in taking a welcome initiative at the time. This Bill is comprehensive and has two new and welcome major components. As the Minister said in his opening remarks, it is hoped the Bill will last for many years.</P>
      <P>Juvenile justice is a difficult area and we all recognise that. The fact that we repeatedly see references to many other Departments and agencies is an indication of the difficulty which will be encountered in implementing the provisions of the Bill. However, where goodwill and co-operation exist between Departments and other agencies, voluntary and statutory, the Bill, which is to provide for the welfare of children, especially those in the area of juvenile justice, will be well provided and catered for. That is what I welcome.</P>
      <P>The issue of resources has arisen repeatedly during the debate. Enacting legislation and putting in place the necessary personnel is of little value unless the requisite finance is provided. If it is not provided from the beginning when the legislation comes into force and if the Bill does not operate or is found wanting in any area because of lack of finance, the exercise will be useless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="792" /> The increase in the age of criminal responsibility from seven to 12 is welcome. There has been little comprehension until recently that children between the ages of seven and 12 benefit very little from the court context. Therefore, I hope the new provisions the Minister has included in the Bill will be of major benefit to them. However, they will be only if the properly trained personnel are available to the health boards and the Garda. We will be in further difficulty if they are not trained to adapt to the sensitive issues involved in these cases. The Minister indicated that gardaí are in training for this great change in their role. They will have to deal with young people in comparison to their previous dealings with the elderly, adults and crime.</P>
    <P>As a member of a health board, I am concerned about the ability of health boards to take on the additional tier of responsibility unless adequate funds are provided. Over the years, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform provided valuable resources to vocational education committees to provide Youthreach, outreach and other schemes so that minor offenders could be kept within the education system. Many children who become involved in crime at a young age come from broken families, whether due to the dissolution of marriage or because they are reared by a lone parent. The children of a violent partnership are the most vulnerable and those who do not benefit from a formal family structure in their early years inevitably end up in the category with which we are trying to deal.</P>
    <P>Children are lost if, for whatever reason, they fall foul of the formal education system at an early age. In the long run we would save resources if we target additional resources towards children in their formative years. We must bring together all the agencies established under this legislation to help regularise young offenders. In consultation with agencies and Departments with responsibility for this area, I hope the Minister will secure additional resources to eliminate many of these problems before they start.</P>
    <P>I was amused to read some of the definitions in the Bill. A school is defined as &ldquo;a children detention school&rdquo;. This phrase eliminates any prospect of providing a learning environment for any child committed to such an institution. Some people used to call such places industrial schools and changing the name is easy. However, we need to do more than just change the name. The ethos within these detention centres and schools has to change. The Bill lacks a clear intention that these detention centres will be anything more than holding centres for people who will be pushed on from the various agencies and the courts. If this happens then the problems we hope to eliminate under this Bill will be compounded. I hope this does not happen, but, if it does, it will be the beginning of the slippery slope back to the past and our hopes and wishes for rehabilitating juvenile offenders and leading them back into society will fail. We need something more mean<Col N="793" /> ingful than a change of name from industrial schools to detention schools. Nothing will happen unless there is a root and branch reorganisation and reorientation of the traditional customs in these institutions. They were established in a different era and we need something more fundamental than a change of name.</P>
    <P>The family welfare conferences are a welcome provision. There is also the introduction of the concept that children will be made responsible by having to apologise for their actions. However, I am not sure what an apology from a seven year old will mean to a victim. Children may view it as vindictive if they are brought before a group at an early age and forced to apologise. I am not sure if there is a benefit to such a practice.</P>
    <P>The other provisions are aspirational in that we are asking parents to undergo retraining and reassessment courses and so on. Compelling people to attend these courses is the wrong approach. It would be preferable if we asked them to do so in good faith, conscious of the fact that a crime has been committed and that parents have a responsibility to request their children to take responsibility for what has happened. Requesting people to attend these courses may be preferable to demands and directives. Young offenders will benefit from their appearances at these family conferences. The situation will no longer exist where a District Court judge will have to release a young offender because there is nowhere to detain or rehabilitate him.</P>
    <P>Will the Government put in place the resources to upgrade existing facilities or will there be new facilities to replace institutions such as St. Patrick's? We must replace them because of the experiences of so many who went through such institutions in the past. They were breeding grounds for further crime. If there is to be a new beginning it is important that there should be new institutions which can house and develop the courses necessary for the rehabilitation of young people.</P>
    <P>It is up to the health boards to decide when a young offender should be detained. Where do the health boards have facilities to provide for young offenders?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill although I am disappointed that we had to wait three years for it to be introduced. The current Minister was critical of Deputy Currie's work in the area. He hoped that if he left it long enough, we would not recall what was in the previous Bill. We remember, however, that 90% of what was in Deputy Currie's Bill is contained in this Bill. I introduced two Private Members' Bills to the House and the Minister did not accept them. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform now publishes the rules and regulations contained in those Bills on its website. The Minister will have to repeat himself when he legislates for the private security industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the provisions for early intervention in the juvenile justice system and the holding of <Col N="794" /> family welfare conferences for children at risk. Allegations can be made wrongly and it is important that all sides involved are given a fair hearing. I have been involved in cases in which I had to ensure that both sides of the story were heard positively.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill for courts to be able to impose curfews on offenders. If a curfew is imposed, we must ensure that the place to which the person is restricted is not the place where his or her problems began. The place of curfew should be favourable to the person upon whom it is imposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is wide ranging and important legislation which will have many implications for children. It is extraordinary that it takes so long to get child centred legislation on the Statute Book. That has been the case for many years and it is clear that the rights of children have never been at the heart of policy. Only recently have we become sensitive to children's rights. Even the Constitution protects the family above the child.</P>
      <P>In discussing the Bill we should present the reality of life for Irish children at present. Who will this Bill affect? Who are these children who will end up before the courts and from where do they come? What is their experience of life before they started offending?</P>
      <P>There is a need to tackle the broad issues in relation to children as well as the specific issues which confront those who appear before the juvenile justice system. The most recently available figures confirm that child poverty is a serious problem in the State, with between a quarter and a third of Irish children at risk living in poverty. There are many people who do not believe this; they have a mistaken idea that current economic success has touched everyone when it has not. The stark reality is that an extraordinary number of children still live in poverty and Ireland has the second highest level of child poverty in the EU. Dealing with this poverty must be a priority for the Government. If it is not, even more children will appear before the courts and this legislation will have to be used again and again instead of preventative services being made available to children at risk.</P>
      <P>We are good at talking about human rights in other countries but there are serious human rights issues in relation to children in this State. In that context, the appointment of the new human rights commission presents an important opportunity. It is important that the group is chaired by a very experienced chairperson and that the Minister engages in all party consultation on its development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know children who grow up in poverty are less likely to do well at school and that they have few recreational, social and cultural opportunities, as the Combat Poverty Agency has pointed out many times. These children are more at risk of becoming involved in crime and anti-<Col N="795" /> social behaviour. It is clear that poverty damages the health of children and their opportunities.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in truancy. The road to delinquency starts with truancy. Initiatives are needed to identify children who play truant, or who are at risk of playing truant, at an early stage and to make services available to those children.</P>
    <P>In March 1999, there were 340 people under 20 years of age who were alone and homeless in Dublin with a further 900 children being homeless with a parent. One in ten children have been found to be in consistent poverty measured in terms of relative income and the denial of basic necessities. Infant mortality among Traveller children is two and a half times the national average. Reported cases of physical and sexual abuse number more than 4,000 per year, which has increased more than 50% in four years. The number of pregnancies that end in abortion continues to grow and it is now equal to more than one in eight live births with more than 1,000 teenage mothers having abortions each year. That is a frightening statistic which must be addressed. There is also growing evidence of child prostitution among young people. In a 1997 study it was found that 50 children under 18 years of age were found working in prostitution in Dublin, and no doubt that number has increased in the past few years.</P>
    <P>In deprived areas 25% of children are regularly absent from school and half of those are chronically absent. Those children will need access to the provisions of the Bill unless we can reduce those numbers. A total of 10% of primary pupils have a serious reading difficulty, which is much higher than in other countries, and the figure is more than 20% in deprived areas. A total of 17% of Irish people aged 16 to 25 are at the lowest level of literacy. For example, they are unable to read an Aspirin packet and comprehend it. The list goes on. There are an estimated 33,000 children with a disability at school-going age, but we do not collect enough information about how they are doing. More than 20% of young people have abandoned school by the age of 16, 80% of them among the Traveller community, and in some deprived areas less than 5% progress to third level. The benefits of the tiger economy are not reaching many of these children.</P>
    <P>Substance abuse by young people has grown to such an extent that we have moved from the bottom of the European league in the 1980s to the top of it in the 1990s. More than 60% of young Dubliners aged 14 to 15 have been offered illicit drugs and one third have used them &ndash; 17% have used them in the past month. The typical age at which children first use drugs is 12 and a half and, according to Garda records, nearly 30% of hard drug users are under 20 years of age. In many ways we are beginning to stand out from our European neighbours in regard to access to drugs. People find it difficult to believe that and for us, as legislators, it raises questions as to the initiat<Col N="796" /> ives we need to take to reduce the supply of drugs on the streets. which have many implications, one of which I mentioned to the Minister this morning as I know he is also concerned about it.</P>
    <P>I refer to the apparent random attacks on young people, which are often linked to drug or alcohol abuse. We do not want to frighten parents about this problem, but many young men almost expect to be the target of a random unprovoked attack on the street. That raises major questions about video surveillance, the availability of gardaí to police the streets, what we are doing to address the problem of access to drugs in nightclubs in Dublin and if we are doing enough in terms of security to maintain standards in those clubs.</P>
    <P>The previously downward trend in terms of young people smoking has increased. In the 15 to 17 age bracket, 31% of boys and 36% of girls &ndash; that rate is accelerating &ndash; are current smokers.</P>
    <P>Time and again judges report there is no suitable place to send children who display seriously disturbed behaviour and I do not need to go over that area, as Deputies Neville and Shortall highlighted the ongoing position arising in our courts regarding the shortage of places for disturbed teenagers. Each weekend accident and emergency departments of our hospitals have to deal with young people who should be in residential care. They turn up at accident and emergency departments because they have nowhere else to go. Serious pressure is being put on registrars in our paediatric hospitals to deal with these young people who should have access to a service at a much earlier stage.</P>
    <P>We have a serious problem regarding our children. I gave those statistics because the Bill must be considered in that context and against that backdrop. We need to address the broader issues regarding children as well as the specific issues covered in the Bill. We need to address the co-ordination of policy on children at Government level, as there is a serious problem in that regard at the highest level within Government. While various Departments have done a good deal of work in this regard, the co-ordination of policy in this area needs to be addressed, and I hope the national child strategy will go some way towards addressing it.</P>
    <P>We need an enforcer to implement the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The convention is a powerful instrument, but if it is to become meaningful we need a mechanism to enforce it. It is no good having rights if we do not enforce them and monitor and evaluate whether they are being fulfilled. Fine Gael proposes that the appointment of a strong and independent commissioner on children's rights would be a way to address this issue. Such a commissioner should be established by statute, be independent of Government, have an ombudsman type role in terms of dealing with complaints and procedures, have a monitoring role on implementing the UN convention, have independent powers of investigation, the opportunity to child proof legislation and ministerial proposals, an advocacy role for <Col N="797" /> children and a research arm and could make an input into the work of committees of the House. Those kinds of initiatives must be taken in addition to the provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill covers a critical area and its success or failure will depend to a large extent on the resources put in place to implement it. I would like the Minister to address the issue of resources. There is a lot of good thinking in the Bill and it provides many opportunities to look after the welfare of children, but if we do not have the resources in terms of staff to implement it, it will fail. Some pertinent questions were asked about the recruitment of probation and welfare officers. What will be the timescale for their recruitment? It will also be necessary to recruit social workers. There is a shortage of those professionals at present and the waiting lists for their services are increasing. What Government initiatives will be taken to ensure appropriate staff will be in place to implement this Bill? It is not an easy problem to tackle as there is a shortage of professionals. It is akin to the problem regarding nursing. When the provisions of the Bill come into effect, if it is to be a success, additional staff will be needed in the health boards, the probation service and the Garda juvenile liaison section.</P>
    <P>I want to raise the issue of the sharing of information between personnel who work with children who appear before the law and children or families in difficulties. A number of professionals have told me recently that the sharing of information has become a problem following the implementation of the Data Protection Act in regard to the issue of confidentiality. Often a number of people call to see families, which highlights there is not enough co-ordination or sharing of information between the professionals who are trying to help the families. The Data Protection Act has become a barrier to sharing information. I ask the Minister to respond to the issue of sharing of information between professionals. The easiest way to address this problem would be to get the agreement of the family, but professionals working with these families have said that they have experienced problems regarding the sharing of information.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers raised the question of families not having information about services. It is difficult to believe that today this could be a problem. One would imagine families would know what services are available, but often they do not. This question of ensuring that basic information reaches families experiencing difficulties needs to be addressed. We need new initiatives to address this problem at community level. Health boards and local authorities need to be more proactive about ensuring such families get such information. It is a catch 22 situation in that if one does not have the staff to provide the services, giving more information about the services can lead to even more demands being made. This is a difficult issue. Some time ago major demands were made on the services provided by the Eastern Health Board. It had a list of 500 cases to be <Col N="798" /> dealt with by its social workers. I do not know what the current figure is and perhaps the Minister will give us that information. In many areas it is difficult to provide anything other than a crisis intervention service. That issue points to the need for additional resources and staffing to enable us to break that cycle.</P>
    <P>In relation to the welcome development of family case conferences, these will need resources and good guidelines on how to function if they are to work. One could have a high quality or poor quality case conference. We need to ensure that good procedures are put in place and that the resources are available so that families, children and professionals can participate in order to achieve a good outcome. These will need to be resourced because minutes will have to be taken and information will have to be distributed following the conference. If they are to work effectively, resources will have to be made available to ensure the best services.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that where possible children should not be held with adults in Garda stations. I ask the Minister to look again at this provision to see if it can be strengthened or if regulations can be introduced to make sure children are dealt with in the way the Bill envisages. There is a very good section in the Bill which deals with how children who come into contact with the gardaí and the criminal justice system should be dealt with and how their dignity should be respected. If this section is to be meaningful, the Minister should spell out how this will be done at local level. It will not be easy in terms of resources but it is a worthwhile objective and should be considered seriously.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shortall referred to the term &ldquo;detention schools&rdquo;. I ask the Minister to consider this because the existing term &ldquo;special schools&rdquo; seems to be preferable to the concept of &ldquo;detention schools&rdquo;. I ask the Minister to address also the issue of an inspectorate of child care and how this will relate to some of the facilities being set up. Will they have a remit in relation to these facilities because we do not need to be reminded of the scandals that emerged in the past in institutional care and the need in the future to be rigorous in our monitoring of how these institutions will work? Obviously the new inspectorate of child care has terrific potential in this area and is already being praised for the work it can and is doing. I would like to know whether it is feasible for the inspectorate to have a role in the various facilities mentioned in the Bill.</P>
    <P>On the question of what works for children and the importance of continuing to research and evaluate the different services which are being delivered to children and the different efforts we are making, we do not have to reinvent the wheel in relation to interventions at an early stage to help children. I must mention the research being carried out in the United States which highlights the importance of early start and early initiatives in child care to ensure that children do not go down the road of juvenile crime. It is important <Col N="799" /> to try to target services at the children who are likely to end up before the courts. It is clear from research here and in other countries that many of these children can be identified at a very early age. Putting resources into child care such as preventative services, family resource services in communities and targeting children at risk of disadvantage from an early age will pay dividends. This will mean that fewer children will come before the courts.</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome, even though it is overdue. It is comprehensive legislation and increases the age of criminal responsibility, which is welcome. Unless we tackle the broader child poverty issues which I have outlined and which are very prevalent in this Celtic tiger economy, unfortunately, more and more children will come before the courts. I conclude by asking the Minister to ensure a comprehensive policy is put in place to tackle the range of issues that affect children. When enacting the legislation, he should address the issue of resources because the legislation cannot help the children who come before the courts unless the resources are put in place to support families and children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the delay in coming to the House and missing my slot. I thank the Acting Chairman and the Minister for their accommodation. Unfortunately, with the many demands on Members' time, I was chairing the Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, which is debating the Copyright Bill, and I was not able to get to the House earlier.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Children Bill, 1999. It is probably one of the most important pieces of legislation this House will deal with for a considerable period. I am pleased that during his Second Stage speech the Minister indicated the Bill will affect children's lives for the better, which is important. He indicated it has been a long time in gestation and that is for the better also. I pay tribute to the Minister, his officials and staff who contributed to bringing the legislation before us, including those who worked on other legislation, such as Deputy Currie and others. This is much improved legislation and I have no problem with the fact that it was in gestation for a long time.</P>
      <P>Four main areas of the law are indicated in the Bill &ndash; the juvenile justice system, the family welfare conferences and other new provisions, the protection of children against abuse and the special residential service board to advise the Minister. These are four very important areas. The Bill clearly identifies and recognises, as we all do, the importance of early intervention and the benefits accruing from case conferences. This is a serious attempt to have detention as a last resort. It highlights the importance of parental and guardian responsibility in relation to the actions of children and the whole area of rehabilitation and education. There are many important aspects in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="800" /> I concur with some of Deputy Fitzgerald's comments on resources and staffing which are important issues. Given my experience as chairman and member of the Eastern Regional Health Authority and my previous experience as a member and former chairman of the Eastern Health Board, there are serious problems in relation to resources and staffing. Much of this relates to the tremendous changes which have taken place over the past number of years. Things are developing at such a rate that people who come into the area of child care are trained, they take up positions, get experience and then move on to other positions, leaving vacuums in certain areas. This is a result of continuing changes in the area of child care and relates particularly to social workers and others who work in the front line, move on and create difficulties and vacuums because of promotions and developments in the area of child care.</P>
    <P>Concerns have been brought to my attention in relation to child care orders and the manner in which a member of a board or a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas can obtain information about such care orders.</P>
    <P>A number of cases have been raised here which draw to our attention areas of deep concern and warrant a special review of the information available to elected public representatives whether board members or Members of the House, including the Minister. I understand a case was before the House where the then Minister had certain difficulties when he wanted to find out some relevant information to assess, evaluate and adjudicate on the case put to him. We should recognise that issues of this nature should be under regular review and the Minister should have the authority to obtain the relevant information.</P>
    <P>This Bill together with the Childcare Act, 1991, results in a significant overhaul of the legislative provisions in relation to children. That must be welcomed cautiously. Given our experience to date, I ask the Minister in conjunction with his colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to review the areas of concern brought to their attention.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of family welfare conferences. A pilot project on family welfare conferences has been in place in the eastern region since last year. It is being evaluated by UCD and the initial findings will be available in June. It is important to incorporate the findings into the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 8 which deals with family welfare conferences seems to put the emphasis on care and supervision orders. It is important that the Bill reflects one of the basic principles of this model, that of empowering families.</P>
    <P>Section 14(1) states: &ldquo;No evidence shall be admissible in any court of any information, statement or admission disclosed or made in the course of a family welfare conference.&rdquo;  As worded this section is too wide and could restrict <Col N="801" /> the health board in its work. I ask that this be looked at again.</P>
    <P>Part 3, which refers to children in need of special care or protection, is an amendment to the Childcare Act, 1991. When enacted, will it replace the current High Court orders placing restrictions on the liberty of children? It is important that the criteria for placing children in a unit where their liberty is restricted are clearly laid down. Section 23<i>(b)</i> specifies some of the criteria. Will the Minister consider expanding the criteria to include the words &ldquo;where the child has a history of absconding&rdquo;? As a member of the committee which considered the Childcare Act, that is a matter that was brought to my attention. It is important that detailed regulations are introduced in regard to the implementation of this section.</P>
    <P>Part 5, section 52, raises the age of criminal responsibility from seven to 12 years. That is welcome. Section 53 provides that if a child under the age of 12 years is found by the Garda to be engaged in an activity which, if the child was over 12 years, would constitute criminal activity, the Garda must take the child to his or her parents or, if not practicable, to the health board. This will have significant resource implications for health boards in terms of extra demands and hours of service. Also section 78 will have resource implications for health boards. It provides that if a child over 12 years of age is before the Children Court on a criminal charge, the court may refer the matter to the health board to consider whether a care order or supervision order is required. This will have a tremendous impact in urban areas, particularly Dublin. I ask that special recognition be given to the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the three area boards under its remit for appropriate support and funding.</P>
    <P>As chairman of the Eastern Health Board I am aware, having been involved in the launch, that the Eastern Health Board got a relatively large amount of funding, which was much appreciated, from the Department of Health and Children in preparation for the Children Bill. This is the first time funding was provided to a board prior to the enactment of a Bill. I acknowledge there appears to be a commitment to provide resources.</P>
    <P>This is a significant Bill and introduces fundamental changes in the legislative provisions for children. It requires detailed planning and includes manpower planning which should involve interdepartmental and inter-agency representations. Additional resources on a planned basis are required. I cannot overstate the importance of prior and ongoing training for all personnel involved. I pay tribute to Brid Clarke, programme manager, in the former Eastern Health Board. She has moved to the post of assistant chief executive and I wish her well. She will be an important tool in ensuring the new structures have the knowledge and expertise required in the ever challenging child care area. I acknowledge and pay tribute to all others involved in child care <Col N="802" /> for their commitment and dedication. It is important that regulations are issued in respect of special care orders. I look forward to further debate on this issue on Committee Stage.</P>

        <b>: </b>What a sorry figure Ireland cut in Geneva in January 1998 when the Government was forced to admit it could not raise the age of criminal responsibility to 12 years because to do so would place &ldquo;an intolerable burden on our social services&rdquo;, as stated by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell. The document presented to the UN committee examining Ireland's record in implementing the UN Convention on Human Rights and on the Rights of the Child admitted that the practice of having a single Minister of State involved with children's issues in the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform had been dropped. Plans announced by the Government over a year previously to appoint an ombudsman for children had been dropped.</P>
      <P>In the five years from 1992-6 only seven cases of cruelty or neglect of children were reported to the Garda. Elsewhere the document stated that 2,276 reports of child abuse were confirmed in 1995. The drugs problem is &ldquo;a manifestation of wider problems of economic and social deprivation that contribute to a sense of exclusion for some sectors of society&rdquo;. It is small wonder that the Children's Rights Alliance was outraged at the Government's decision to abandon its ombudsman for children proposal. It was the Rainbow Government that funded the research project, by a group representative of the Children's Rights Alliance and Departments, which recommended that such an ombudsman be appointed. The recommendation was accepted and a decision to create the post was announced by the then Minister of State, Deputy Currie. The Children's Rights Alliance was also critical of the Government's failure to make the public aware of the provisions of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The reality is that our performance as a nation, in terms of the development of child services and child protection, has been pathetic.</P>

    <P>It is incredible to reflect that 20 years ago the task force on child care services opposed an increase in the age of criminal responsibility on the basis that getting into trouble with the law was, for many children, their only chance of drawing attention to themselves and of getting help. It is small wonder that members of the United Nations committee expressed their amazement at the persistently high levels of child poverty in a country which is apparently so economically successful. That was in 1998, but as we enter the new millennium things have not changed. <i>The Sunday Business Post </i>last Sunday reported that Ireland comes a close second to Britain as the worst EU country in terms of child poverty, with 28% of Irish children living below the poverty line. In <Col N="803" /> Britain, at least, the Prime Minister has pledged to end child poverty and has set firm deadlines, dates and targets. In Ireland we have no firm target although we have aspirations for reducing child poverty in general.</P>
    <P>There needs to be a significant increase in child benefit, targeted at those most in need. The Combat Poverty Agency, for example, is calling for a guaranteed minimum income of £30 to £40 per week for all children, depending on age. Giving children a proper upbringing does not come cheap. There are more than a million children in this country, representing 30% of the population or eight percentage points above the EU average. It is unacceptable that as many as 270,000 Irish children are deemed to be living in poverty at a time when the economy is growing at a double digit percentage rate each year.</P>
    <P>I vividly recall a comment made by the then Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Currie, when he insisted that civil servants from the Departments of Justice, Health and Education should have regular meetings to synchronise and co-ordinate their activities in respect of children's welfare policies. He was absolutely amazed that there were civil servants in the room who did not know each other. This was a striking illustration of the failure of these Departments to co-ordinate and streamline their activities. Nevertheless, the farcical situation of no Government Minister having overall responsibility for children continues. Children's educational welfare is the responsibility of the Minister for Education and Science, as are the detention centres for children envisaged in this Bill.</P>
    <P>One would imagine that the Minister for Health and Children would be responsible for sponsoring this Bill in view of the fact that he is the Minister for Health and Children and of the central role the health boards will play in triggering various aspects of the Bill, including family welfare conferences. The Bill specifically vests powers, such as the power to institute special care orders, in the Minister for Health and Children. Like so many other measures dealing with children, for example, those dealing with child sexual abuse, this Bill is being sponsored by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>The cosy perception of the Irish family as a safe haven for children has been severely damaged over the past decade, as light has been penetratingly shone into the dark corners of society and children have begun to cry out. The revelations are shocking. While institutional violence, both sexual and physical, has managed to attract the bulk of the publicity, there is not a day when court cases are reported that two or three cases are not splashed across our newspapers giving the most graphic and frightening details of incest inflicted on children by their nearest and dearest. The skeletons emerging from the cupboards of the hidden Ireland have shocked us all and have rocked the long-held belief that there was some<Col N="804" /> thing uniquely warm, safe and protective about the Irish family.</P>
    <P>What is shocking is not merely the lurid details of the reported cases but also their sheer volume. Only a huge systems failure could have allowed such depravity to continue for so long and to such an extent, undetected and unpunished. The statutory provisions for protecting children at risk were contained in the Children Act, 1908, under which a child could be removed from the custody of his or her parents and placed in the care of a relative or other fit person, in specified circumstances. An order could only be made if it appeared to a District Court judge on the basis of the information sworn, usually by a social worker, that there was reasonable cause to suspect that the child had been assaulted, ill treated or neglected or that one of the offences listed in the Act had been committed. After the child had been taken to a place of safety the District Court conducted a full hearing and could make an order committing the child to care until the age of 16 years.</P>
    <P>However, one of the major drawbacks of the law as it then stood was that a social worker, public health nurse or any child care employee of a health board had no right to enter a child's home to investigate whether a child was being abused, if such reports were received. Another fundamental deficiency was that a health board did not have the right to have a child medically examined without the permission of his or her parents. The Child Care Act, 1991, made a number of important changes in the law relating to the protection of children, notably defining a child as a person &ldquo;under the age of 18, other than a person who is or who has been married&rdquo;. It also gave each health board a statutory duty to promote the welfare of children in its area who were not receiving care and protection and specified measures which should be taken to make this duty a reality.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Act, however, did not come into operation automatically on the enactment of the legislation but required a ministerial order to be brought into operation. As a result, many of the most important sections remained to be brought into operation, notably those dealing with children at risk. A glaring example of the results of the deferral of important parts of the Act was the case of the late Kelly Fitzgerald in my county of Mayo. A fundamental problem with this legislation, as with the 1908 and 1991 Acts, is that it lays down no express duty for any person to report child sexual abuse or suspected child sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>The Constitution is of overriding importance in considering the law in relation to the protection of children. Articles 41.1 and 42.1 stress the rights of the family and of parents with regard to their children. Power to remove a child from the family home is given by Article 42.5 which provides for such in exceptional circumstances where the parents, for physical or moral reasons, fail in their duty towards their children. While one would like <Col N="805" /> to see the constitutional rights of the child set down in crystal clear terms in the Constitution, one takes some comfort from the fact that the rights of children have been confirmed and asserted by the High Court and Supreme Court in a number of cases. In general, however, the courts have held that the child's rights are to be found within the family rather than specifically against the family or the parents. Courts have also interpreted the rights of the child as the right to be brought up and educated by his or her parents. However, it would seem impermissible to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration in any dispute between parents and a third party, such as a health board, without bringing into consideration the constitutional rights of the family.</P>
    <P>I welcome the annual Garda report as an annual monitor and gauge of how the system is coping with crime. However, one vital component is missing from the Garda report, that is, an age profile of criminals. A survey published by the<i> Irish Independent </i>some time ago addressed this issue. The survey determined that people under 16 are to blame for 33% of all crime. It also concluded that half of Irish 14 year olds are regular drinkers and that boys as young as 11 and girls as young as 12 have little problem in getting access to alcohol. The survey also confirmed that truancy is particularly bad in Dublin, with as many as 6,000 children mitching from school each day. When one adds the growing drugs culture to the alcohol culture it is obvious that the childhood of many children is severely under threat.</P>
    <P>While the Minister may contend that overall crime figures have dropped over the past few years, juvenile crime figures have increased significantly. In September 1998 Chief Superintendent Joe Dowling confirmed that while overall crime figures were down by 10%, he was very concerned at the juvenile crime figures. Total referrals to the force's national juvenile office had risen by 5.5%, referrals for burglaries were up by 11% and referrals for serious assault were up by 32%. There was a total of 15,075 referrals for all types of crime to the national juvenile office the previous year. Eight out of ten referrals were male.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which is long overdue. It replaces the outdated legislation which has governed the juvenile justice system for more than 90 years. Credit must be given to Deputy Currie as the Bill is a redraft of the Children Bill, 1996. It introduces a long overdue restructuring of services for children who come in contact with the juvenile justice system.</P>
    <P>Commendable though the Bill is it will not work unless it is adequately resourced. The resource implications are considerable. I welcome, for example, the increase in the age of criminal responsibility from seven to 12 years. This means that there will be a significant additional burden on the health boards which will now deal with children who up to now have been the responsibility of the Garda Síochána. The <Col N="806" /> resource implications for the health boards are obvious and must be addressed. All one has to do is look at health board waiting lists for hospital out-patient services and the number of bed days lost to discover that the additional statutory responsibility involved in the Bill will involve considerable additional costs. What is the estimate for the additional resources required to meet the additional responsibilities imposed on health boards by the increase in the age of criminal responsibility? What estimate or projection has been worked out between the Minister sponsoring the Bill and the Minister for Health and Children who will have a large part to play in enforcing some of its most important aspects?</P>
    <P>There is considerable concern that the Bill does not state how often detention centres for offending children who are the subject of special care orders will be inspected. Given the sorry experience for children in former State institutions children who are subject to civil detention must benefit from care, education and treatment provided in special care units and have their rights upheld.</P>
    <P>I welcome the concept of family welfare conferences, a fundamental part of Deputy Currie's Bill. Recently I had the pleasure of visiting Scotland and witnessing at first hand the children's hearing system which has been in operation for the past 25 years and is working well. I wish the family welfare conference enshrined in the Bill the same degree of success.</P>
    <P>Children's detention schools are to replace industrial and reform schools and to be used by the courts where detention is considered the only suitable way of dealing with a child. The directors of such schools are not in a position to refuse to admit children from the courts. Given the totally inadequate provision for such children unless adequate accommodation is provided we will end up with two problems, the mixing of children with different needs &ndash; the implications in terms of cross-contamination, to put it crudely, are obvious &ndash; and the inevitable overcrowding. One could easily end up with a situation which has characterised the prison service, the revolving door syndrome, where children will be released from schools because of pressure on accommodation before they complete their planned programmes. That would be disastrous.</P>
    <P>The Children Bill, 1996, stipulated that inspections were to be carried out &ldquo;at least once every six months&rdquo;.  The Bill does not go that far, it merely states that regular inspections will be carried out. It must specify defined dates by which inspections will be made.</P>
    <P>I welcome the diversion programme which will place the juvenile liaison scheme on a statutory basis. Working through solutions is the only way to proceed. I am particularly impressed by everything I have read and studied about the principles of restorative justice as they operate in New Zealand. We owe a debt of gratitude to the Irish Penal Reform Trust which has forged ahead and pioneered the concept here. I had the pleasure of deliberating at its conference in April 1999 at <Col N="807" /> which this principle was fleshed out in considerable detail.</P>
    <P>I welcome the manner in which the Bill imposes responsibilities and obligations on parents to participate in their children's welfare. The concept of parental supervision order which instructs parents to undergo treatment for drug and alcohol abuse and/or attend a parenting course is a good one. The welfare of the child is of paramount importance. Every child is entitled to his or her childhood. Nothing and nobody can get in the way of that primary right or objective.</P>
    <P>The Children Bill, 1999, provided for interviews of suspects in Garda stations at which &ldquo;other adults reasonably named by the child can be present&rdquo;.  This provision is mysteriously deleted from the Bill and should be considered by the Minister on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the concepts and principles of the Bill. I wish it well. For too long we have uttered pious platitudes and hid behind the Constitution which cherishes all the children of the nation equally but the experience for thousands of children has been a sad and sorry one. I hope this Bill marks the first step in a major recovery of the paramount position of the child in society.</P>

      <P>Tréaslaím leis an Aire agus leis an Roinn as ucht an méid oibre atá déanta acu ag ullmhú an Bhille seo. Tuigim ón méid a dúirt an tAire nach raibh sé so-dhéanta Bille na bliana 1996 a úsáid agus a leasú. Is léir go raibh gá leis an am ó shin chun an Bille nua seo a chur ar fáil. Bheadh sé deacair a rá go bhfuil ábhar ar bith níos tábhachtaí ná cúram leanaí. Cuireann sé iona orm gurb é Bille ón bhliain 1908 atá á chur i leataobh agus á achtú ag an am seo. Tá sé thar am é sin a dhéanamh. Tá athraithe bunúsacha in ár ndearcadh ar an cheist seo agus i dtaobh leanaí go ginearálta atá faoi choimirce an Bhille seo.</P>
      <P> In replacing the 1908 Act the Bill, not before time, heralds a new system of juvenile justice. It shows considerable changes from the Children Bill, 1999, which was also far-reaching. Deputy Currie is to be congratulated for the work he put into it. Society's view has altered radically in recent years. We have become more aware of the difficulties encountered by children, particularly those at risk as victims or as perpetrators of crime which is frequently drug related. It can also take the form of random attacks, as a result of the effects of alcohol or other substances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has sought to learn from best practice worldwide in the area of juvenile justice. The Bill seeks to be balanced and comprehensive and provides sophisticated measures to address child welfare issues. The family welfare conference should deal with the area of parental responsibility in a more modern and effective manner. There is a huge need for such intervention. One can sometimes learn more from the failures of existing systems here and in other jurisdictions than from their successes. It is clear that poor procedures and inadequate staffing <Col N="808" /> have militated against the efficacy of the systems in place here and abroad. With the best will in the world many parents have failed to meet what society perceives as their responsibility in this area. Many others have made no attempt whatsoever. It is a difficult area for the professionals to intervene effectively and professionally.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the Bill protects children against abuse by parents, guardians or other carers. Recent high profile cases have underlined the difficulties which many children have encountered. Some have expressed amazement that such abuse could have taken place unnoticed. One of the lessons we have learned is that it is very difficult, even for those in regular contact with children, to be aware of what exactly is going on within the family circle. The added constitutional protection of the family seems to have created further difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill because it gives us an opportunity to highlight this important issue and provide solutions to this growing problem in many disadvantaged communities. The 1998 road statistics show that 92 people were involved in joyriding accidents and five joyriders were killed.</P>
      <P>Joyriding is a most inappropriately named crime, which is never far from the headlines in many communities. Many people are trapped in their own homes as soon as these cowboys go on the prowl at night. To many of these young people, until damage or personal injury is caused, the term may seem inoffensive. To suggest joyriding is simply having a laugh is a gross underestimation of its impact on communities. Having to explain to parents why their dead child was mown down is no laughing matter or a cause for any joy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most tragic aspect of joyriding and car crime in recent years has been the significant number of deaths and injuries caused to innocent pedestrians and car users. Garda reports show that almost 14,000 cars are stolen nationally each year. This has been compounded by the introduction of the new national car test, which has provided an unprecedented number of vehicles in which young people can joyride. Rather than incur the cost of necessary repairs for the NCT, <Col N="809" /> some unscrupulous owners and dealers have off-loaded their vehicles to youths who have vandalised them or used them for joyriding.</P>
    <P>These cars &ndash; company cars &ndash; are purchased for as little as £15 or £20 and they are completely unroadworthy. It is a strange turn of events that the Government initiative to remove bangers from our roads is encouraging the proliferation of these company cars. The Government must take strong and swift action in the immediate future if these urban rallies are to be combated. The Government claims it is impossible to control the sale of these cars and the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, has tried to wash his hands in terms of making any intervention.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister answer the following question? There are 9 million cattle in this country, 400% more cattle than cars, yet the controls and movement of cattle is strictly regulated. Why can we not implement a similar system for cars? All cars sold by a car dealer or individual should meet the NCT requirements and should be certified as such, otherwise the car should be sold to a licensed dismantler for scrappage. If a vehicle ends up as a company car, the last registered owner must be liable to prosecution unless he or she can prove that he or she fulfilled this requirement. This simple initiative would resolve the current problem with company cars and the issue of abandoned cars in estates.</P>
    <P>Joyriding is a more fundamental problem which should be tackled in the context of the Children Bill which is currently before the House. There is a need to develop diversion programmes for young people who engage in joyriding and to provide facilities for communities that have been ravaged by the problems of drugs and crime. Many of the young people involved in joyriding have a genuine interest in driving and the maintenance of cars. We should, therefore, take an approach similar to projects for young people to deal with the issue of stray horses.</P>
    <P>Projects should be established which would send offenders to a driving school. Perhaps some of the newly abandoned Army barracks could be used for this purpose. The Government should establish a traffic school for offenders who would attend classroom sessions in training centres where they would receive driving and attitude training. This would include group sessions on behaviour and car maintenance for youths who have been caught joyriding. Funding for this proposal could come from the £15 million collected annually in road traffic fines.</P>
    <P>Offenders would have to successfully complete the driver education course. Classroom topics would cover rules of the road, how motor cars work and driving behaviour, with emphasis on courtesy and the importance of safety on our roads. The current penalties are not feared by joyriders; to the contrary, they look forward to the challenge of avoiding arrest by the Garda.</P>
    <P>The situation where one person is killed on our roads every 18 hours is unacceptable and radical alternatives to this problem are needed. The <Col N="810" /> Government has been planning for the last two and a half years to introduce road safety and driver behaviour training to the second level curriculum, but it has yet to implement this plan. The only road safety education provided at present is teaching pupils how to cross the road safely. This programme could be initially introduced to the transition year curriculum. It would be similar to the current initiative being undertaken by the Donegal Road Safety Working Group. Its programme involves the Garda, driving instructors, health board staff, driver testers and insurance companies who provide an input to the transition year course over a 12 week period.</P>
    <P>In common with drug related crime, car theft and joyriding are symptoms of alienation and despair among youths who have dropped out of the education system and have been poorly resourced in terms of youth, leisure and sporting facilities. One of the main reasons there is so much juvenile delinquency is that many children are illiterate. The problem of illiteracy is not being addressed in school. Schools are unable to identify the problem and if they are lucky enough to identify it, they cannot deal with it. This includes remedial teachers. Research has shown that the esteem of young people in detention centres was increased when this difficulty was addressed. Their way of striking back at society is to commit crime because society has failed them by not addressing their reading and other social difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Government can continue to turn a blind eye to these social problems but they are coming home to roost. It is time the Government shaped up or shipped out. The public is seeing through the smoke screen surrounding the Government. They are not prepared to accept a<i> laissez-faire </i>attitude to social injustice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill introduced by the Labour Party. I wish to concentrate on the problem of the large number of cars which are being abandoned particularly since the introduction of the national car test. This may not be causing joyriding but it is increasingly contributing to and facilitating it. My colleague, Deputy Naughten, mentioned cars being sold to youngsters for £50 or £60. However, this problem creates an unending supply of free cars to youngsters. These cars are often driven into private housing estates and left there for the taking. It is an almost irresistible invitation to potential joyriders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is incredible and it defies understanding that people can act in such a selfish manner. They have no reservations about littering other people's estates even though they have moved on to newer and better cars. In the past this problem only involved old cars. However, since the introduction of the test, it involves relatively new cars which are by no means clapped out old bangers. These cars still have the potential to speed and kill. It is only the start of this problem. If it is not stamped out now as more and newer cars become <Col N="811" /> eligible for testing, it will become a greater problem.</P>
    <P>Other methods of car disposal are available to people. For example, in the Dublin area, there is a free take away service. One only has to send the local authority the tax book and ask that a vehicle be removed. This service needs to be widely advertised. It should be part of this week's anti-litter campaign. Some local authorities outside the Dublin area charge for this service but that should be scrapped if the entire country is not to become littered with abandoned cars that are rusted or burned out in every scenic spot.</P>
    <P>The sad factor is that the motor car is almost entirely recyclable. Almost uniquely for any product, a recycling infrastructure is in place for cars. An EU directive will be introduced shortly which will impose an end of life tax on cars so there is no reason to charge for this service now. The real problem is that if a car is legally parked and has its number plates but the owner does not request removal, there is no way to move it. We must address the fact that there is no legal way to move cars that are legally parked and still have their number plates. Enforcement has worked in other areas, particularly that which applies under the Control of Horses Act. The Bill, if we enact it and enforce its provisions, will be successful.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Broughan and those who assisted him in bringing forward the Bill, which may not be perfect in that it does not provide all the answers.

The introduction of legislation is often seen as the ultimate solution when political will and decisiveness are often all that is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="812" /> The Bill gives us the opportunity to discuss and focus on what is a very real problem. Passing the Bill may not help the Garda Síochána enforce the many laws at its disposal.

      <P>I was disappointed with the Department's response last night. That response was obviously theoretically and factually correct but it was rather simplistic and it did not appear to address the problems which obtain in Deputy Broughan's area and mine. To that extent, I express my disappointment with the official response to the Bill.</P>
      <P>A number of weeks ago many Members used the opportunity provided by Fine Gael's Private Members' motion on the national car test to discuss the matters with which the Bill deals. I am disappointed the Department did not, during the intervening period, take on board Deputies' suggestions and take appropriate action. The Department of the Environment and Local Government, whether its traffic section, Traveller section, environmental section or NCT section, is responsible for dealing with many aspects of the problem of joyriding. Of course the Garda Síochána has a role to play, but a great deal of responsibility lies with authorities which come under the control of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. It is a pity the various sections of the Department could not come together during the six weeks since we debated the NCT to address this very real problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps a reshuffle is needed. The Government should promote the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the various sections of the Department will get together to resolve this problem.</P>
      <P>Many of the points the Minister made are valid and true, particularly those giving legal recognition to the term &ldquo;joyriding&rdquo;. However, I was amused by his assertion that the Garda Síochána had stated that there are adequate legal provisions in place. That may be the case but the Garda cannot deal with the problem. Quite senior members of the force operating at local level have thrown their arms in the air in desperation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a large Garda compound situated in my constituency but it is completely full. As soon as a space becomes available following the removal of a car for transport to Hammond Lane, it is immediately filled. The law needs to be amended because it is ridiculous that a person must keep an old banger for six weeks before they can get rid of it. The law should be changed so that if a car is under three years of age it should be kept for six weeks but if it is over eight <Col N="813" /> or ten years of age it should be removed within three days. It is ludicrous that people are obliged to wait so long to dispose of these vehicles.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Garda Síochána has a role to play in this area but the main responsibility lies with several sections within the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Joyriding is not a new problem, it has been with us for many years and it tends to happen in waves. The current wave is probably partly related to the booming economy and the fact that people are buying cars like Smarties. However, it has also been caused by the introduction of the NCT. It was wrong for the Department to introduce the NCT without considering the problems its implementation would create.</P>
    <P>Children aged ten, 12 and 14 are buying old cars for £30 or £40, not exclusively but mainly from Travellers. Nobody is prepared to put a stop to this behaviour and it appears that the law applies to some of the Travellers to whom I refer. Every citizen is entitled to their rights and we should all respect the law. The law should, if necessary, be used against every citizen, regardless of identity.</P>
    <P>I hope the Department will not adhere to the position outlined in last night's response. This is an enormous problem and I hope the Minister will listen to the Deputies whose constituencies are afflicted by this problem. I accept the Minister's advice that the Bill has a number of faults. However, that should not be the end of the matter because this problem must be addressed in a co-ordinated way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>

      <P>I hope that, following this, the various sections of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, in conjunction with the Garda, try to address this problem. Deputy Olivia Mitchell referred to the need for an advertising campaign. There is no doubt that many people are driving to halting sites and simply abandoning their cars. If people knew that local authorities provided a removal service or that they could drive their cars to Hammond Lane to have them demolished, they would do so. We can begin to address this problem by advertising services, providing further compounds for the Garda Síochána and amending the stupid law that obliges people to keep their old bangers for six weeks.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has shown a great ability to tap into the popular feeling among the people in his constituency and the broader constituency that is Dublin. It is instructive to note the constituencies that those who are contributing to this debate represent. Present are two of my colleagues from my constituency of Dublin South-West and there are also representatives from Dublin North-East, Dublin North Central, Dublin North-West and Cork North Central. All the areas to which I refer have, in one way or other, been affected by the terrible problem of car theft.

We want stronger powers to be given to the Garda and the introduction of mandatory sentences. We are seeking radical action from the Government on this issue. It seriously affects the most disadvantaged communities which we have the dubious privilege of serving. I use the word &ldquo;dubious&rdquo; because we would prefer if those levels of disadvantage were not there.</P>

      <P>I welcome the overnight change of plan. Some of the heavier ministerial guns will come to the House later tonight to outline what they and their Departments are doing.

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept the principles underlying the Bill but we beg to differ on the detail. As people say in relation to the vexed matters north of the Border, the devil is in the detail. It is the detail in the Bill that we question.</P>
      <P>The level and adequacy of Garda activity in combating this problem and the existing law is widely questioned by the communities with whom we work. They wonder why there are not any responses and why the law is unable to deal with the problem. I do not criticise the Garda Síochána but there is a perception that its members do not respond to the calls from street level to address this issue.</P>
      <P>The South Dublin County Council area offers an instructive example of the problem. In the six months to February 1999, there were 580 car theft incidents. In the six months to February 2000, there were 1,461 cases. That is a threefold increase over one year. That is unacceptable. It represents a car theft rate of up to 300 cars per month.</P>
      <P>There are about four litter wardens and almost all their time is taken up with recovering stolen or burnt out cars. The burnt out car is a familiar media photograph, particularly in the local newspapers in my constituency. I am sure that is also true of the northside. It is an image that must be eliminated. It represents a stain on the communities, most of whose members are law abiding and hard working. It acts as a disincentive for people considering investing in or developing the areas and discourages new residents from moving into them. Finally, this type of car theft seriously endangers lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much discussion of this issue recently but I am not convinced that the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, has moved far enough. I look forward to hearing his response because he has in the past advocated a policy of zero toler<Col N="816" /> ance. He tells us it is still Government policy and I look forward to it being applied in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

      <P>In addition to concentrating on legal remedies and punishments to fit the crime, we must look at the deterrent factor and how we can invest in and develop the communities where this issue arises. We should also look at the diversion programmes which the gardaí already have in place. They require more investment.</P>
      <P>Let us be honest about the problem. I will not admit to having been a joyrider in my youth but we got up to certain things that probably all young people get involved in.</P>

      <P>I commend the county council in my constituency on trying to devote more resources from local government to this difficult issue which afflicts disadvantaged communities already suffering as a result of drug abuse and criminal anti-social activity.</P>
      <P>Most Deputies would agree that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform needs to move further to deal with not just car theft and joyriding but with anti-social activity. It should be pointed out that there is also anti-social activity, such as people congregating around shopping centres at night, in the middle class areas of the constituency I serve. This activity indicates the need for a tougher and stronger Garda presence and a tougher response to crime.</P>
      <P>These are crimes against the community. The response of the community is to lose its respect for law and order and to lose faith in the locality. When that happens the results can be catastrophic. There is a corresponding decrease in respect for the law and the Garda Síochána which leads to a decline in the area and the loss of investment and other opportunities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is well meaning but one sided and incomplete. The upsurge in joyriding activity is causing great anger in affected communities, often the most disadvantaged communities.</P>
      <P>People in my constituency have come to me about the problem. One of them gave me the authority to mention his name in this debate. He is Liam Burke who lives in Ard na Gréine, which would be regarded as a good community. His car was stolen three times in a three month period. His daughter bought a car which was then stolen. She replaced it but that car was stolen within two months. It is a serious problem.</P>
      <P>Deputy Broughan is my constituency colleague and we work well together for the good of the community. I am surprised he is so out of touch with the depth of feeling about this problem in our constituency. I do not call it joyriding. There is nothing joyful about stealing cars.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying the Deputy called it that. There is nothing joyful about stealing cars and devastating people, often young people who need their cars to get to work. They save hard for their cars and are paying the repayments. In some instances they pay up to £3,000 for insurance.</P>
      <P>Insurance is another issue that must be tackled. As far as I am concerned, the insurance companies are operating a cartel and are turning decent young people into criminals. They are actually advocating that they drive uninsured cars. That is something we must look into. There is no doubt that they are operating a cartel. My daughter got a quote from an insurance company in Dublin last week. I told her to ring the company back later. When she did so she was told: &ldquo;We cannot give you a quote&rdquo;. She asked why she was given one earlier. The manager said he would have to question that. When he did so he said, &ldquo;the person who gave you that quote is a junior member of the staff who should not have given you a quote&rdquo;. That is very serious situation into which we must look.</P>

      <P>Convicted so-called joyriders should be detained in boot camp regimes in locations like Spike Island. Joyriders are detained, brought to court and convicted but because of the revolving door, they are let out at Christmas and other times of the year. No serious attempt has been made by the Judiciary or anybody else and the issue is treated in a half-hearted way. When these people are let out, they rob again and cause mayhem in the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Lenihan said, the perceived degree of complacency and Garda response to this leaves a lot to be desired. It is not treated as a serious crime and the response is, &ldquo;So what, we got a complaint about a car.&rdquo;  There are burned out cars all over my constituency. I get calls about burned out cars in football fields morning, noon and night. They are even using the car parks at shopping centres as race tracks.</P>
      <P>We need a comprehensive action plan on this type of anti-social activity. There should be some support for disadvantaged communities. This brings us back to the Children Bill and parental control. Statistics show that the majority of people involved in stealing cars &ndash; I do not want to call it joyriding &ndash; are kids below 14 years of age. This happens in Foxhill and other areas, as Deputy Broughan knows well. Where is the parental control? The Children Bill is interlinked with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need alternatives for disadvantaged youth. There is no doubt but that there are disadvantaged youths in many areas. For example, we need funds for stock car racing programmes to give them the means to break out of this cycle. That is very important. There are a number of stock car enthusiasts in my area who came to me with proposals which I gave to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. That is something at which we should look because it is an alternative. When one asks why they steal cars, they will say there is nothing for them to do and they like driving cars. This would give them an alternative. Any commendable approach would seek increased resources from central Government for community and recreational facilities in affected areas given the <Col N="819" /> extremely large youth population in socially disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>Communities are calling for action but, with all due respect to my colleague, Deputy Broughan, what is in this Bill is an inappropriate and insufficient response. There must be a deterrent. If somebody believes they can harass and terrorise a community, it is not good enough to say &ldquo;up to five years&rdquo;. We should put these people away and should not leave it to the discretion of the Judiciary. There should be a mandatory sentence and people should know that if the steal my car or someone else's, they will be put away for at least ten years on Spike Island where there would be no comfort zone. There is a comfort zone at present. One of Deputy Broughan's colleagues in the Seanad, who is involved in prisoners' rights, defends these people. He says it is not right that they should be in prison because they only stole a car; he asks what is the big deal about that and says we should get them out of there. Deputy Broughan should get his act together.</P>

      <P>This is a subject about which I find it very hard to speak in a detached and clinical manner. In my constituency and in many others, this horrendous practice has affected many lives. I have seen instances of the havoc wreaked by joyriding on innocent third parties. I was deeply involved in one joyriding incident which shocked the community. The people in the area were devastated and shocked by the taking of two young lives by the mindless action of a so-called joyrider. These people should be called killer drivers, which is what they are. I cannot even use the word &ldquo;joyrider&rdquo; without feeling I am using a word which seems to imply that those who kill or maim people while driving stolen cars are bringing some form of joy to someone. They certainly do not bring it to the homes they destroy by their thoughtlessness and cruel <Col N="820" /> actions. I doubt that even they themselves on reflection find any great joy in the pain they have inflicted on innocent victims and on the families who face a lifetime of grief and loss.</P>
      <P>I have spoken to the parents of children who lost their loved ones shortly after the dreadful event and to their friends and neighbours in the intervening years. The parents' pain has not been alleviated by time. How can I speak dispassionately on this issue and listen to those who plead it is an impulsive and thoughtless act gone tragically wrong? How can I believe that the stealing and misuse of a person's car is not a deliberate, cruel and selfish act? What car owner deserves to have his or her car stolen? Who will replace an article for which the owner has saved so hard to purchase? Has anyone ever heard of a case in which the joyrider made retribution to the person he had robbed? How many learn a lesson from the dreadful havoc wrought when they snuff out a life? How can I listen to those who plead that the people involved come from a deprived background, as not all of them do? Some would allege that joyriders are the victims of society and state that their illegal and deadly activities are really not their responsibility. I do not subscribe to that line of logic. I am here to tell Members what joyriders have done to my constituents. They have sentenced parents, brothers, sisters, relations and friends to a lifetime of grief and loneliness.</P>
      <P>There are many activities promoted and controlled by community gardaí in Cork. The role of the community garda should be supported and enhanced. We have had an outstanding service from those members of the force. Their guidance helps many young people who are not involved in community and sporting activities. In one part of the city, a garda, Garda O'Connell, has set up activities which involve many young people at risk in sport, community activities and interaction with the gardaí. This is supported by senior gardaí, community leaders and politicians. Community gardaí put in many of their off duty hours helping young people, particularly in disadvantaged areas. Their work is productive and is evidenced by the sharp fall in crime in Cork by 12% or 9% in the past 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Joyriders know no bounds. Joyriding is not confined to disadvantaged areas only; it is a nationwide problem. Those who participate in this deadly sport &ndash; I use that word without inverted commas &ndash; must be taught a lesson. Their punishment must fit the crime they commit. If one of those law breakers killed a person in a brawl, they would face a manslaughter or murder charge. Why should the punishment for using a car as a lethal weapon not be as severe? Those people put the lives of our people at risk every time they joyride. They do not carry insurance cover and can kill or maim members of the public. They put at risk the lives of the gardaí who must enforce the law by seeking to apprehend <Col N="821" /> them. Let them face the full rigours of the law as it stands. The legislation is in place and the Minister outlined it last night. Let us continue to enforce it. I commend Deputy Broughan for bringing this matter before the House. On Friday next a new business park will be opened. It is not quite completed but last Sunday a number of people drove a car around the asphalt surfaces. An hour or so later the same car was found crashed. This problem is not confined to Cork, it is nationwide.</P>

      <P>Deputy Noel Ahern is an expert at ducking, weaving and bringing both sides of the road with him but he came up with a new one tonight. He said he was very disappointed with the response of the Department last night. I thought this House was run on the basis of Ministers coming in and taking responsibility for policy and for their Departments, but now, according to Deputy Ahern, it is the Department that is responsible and he is very disappointed with it. That is some attempt at washing his hands.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lenihan thinks &ldquo;conceptually&rdquo; the Bill is correct. What does that mean? Then he thinks we have a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who is committed to zero tolerance. The Minister apparently does not know the dimension of misery that is being inflicted on communities in urban Ireland. Zero tolerance? It is zero activity from this Minister, the man who made his name in cranking up a crime psychosis. Any given morning that one wakes up there is likely to be another fatal killing in this country or some serious criminal offence and there is no sign of the policy of zero tolerance.</P>
      <P>I missed the Order of Business today because of a meeting in Killinarden in my constituency on joyriding. It lasted until lunch time and was quite apart from the Labour Party Bill. A number of concerned citizens came together because they were frightened by the element of brazenness and bullyboy tactics that has now stolen into car theft. They are not all company cars. Cars are being stolen out of driveways. Where householders stand up to the thieves they come back at night, some as young as ten years, and burn the cars in the driveway.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ahern is right; it is probable that senior civil servants do not know anything about this side of urban living but they do not have to take responsibility. The responsibility is the Minister's and his response last night, for a Minister who should know as he represents Dublin North Central, was such that he ought to be ashamed. The other Deputies came in here tonight and read out scripts designed for the local newspapers because they believe people will not make out the difference on where they stand on the Bill. They gave us a heart rending account of joyriding but they will vote down the Bill.</P>

      <P>That will not get us anywhere. This problem must be dealt with. It reminds me of when my colleague, Deputy De Rossa, introduced the Bill on wandering horses. Many Members thought it very funny. However, it was not one bit funny and they learned why. We are in the middle of a wave of so-called joyriding <Col N="823" /> which has been identified by my colleague, Deputy Broughan. He is not suggesting that his Bill is the be all and end all of tackling this problem. We know there is greater investment needed in these communities in terms of education, school attendance, upskilling, training opportunities and getting these youngsters back to work. Everything Deputy Coveney said last night is right.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a modest measure. It is a beginning and after all the Fianna Fáil speeches tonight supporting the sentiment of the Bill, it will vote it down. We have not seen one Minister. Neither the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, nor the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, has any idea what this problem is about. Both have a legacy of shambles to show for their three years in office. For the man who promised us zero tolerance, people in my constituency are besieged in their homes because it is not safe to set foot outside. There is inadequate policing. Deputy Ahern dealt with that matter and I agree with him. There is no sign in the ministerial contribution to the debate so far that there is any appreciation of this problem on that side of the House. It is shameful.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Broughan on bringing forward this Bill. He has shown remarkable resilience in pursuing an issue that, up to now, has neither received the publicity nor the attention it deserves. Like everyone who has spoken on the Bill so far, I object to the use of the term &ldquo;joyriding&rdquo;. It is such a misnomer in relation to the consequences of this activity that it is a travesty to use the word. I understand that, for the purposes of the Bill, there was little choice but to continue to use this terminology because it is recognisable. However, the activity and its consequences are represented much more accurately by the inclusion of words such as &ldquo;grief&rdquo; and &ldquo;death&rdquo;, as Deputy Broughan indicated yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to acknowledge the presence in the Visitors' Gallery of some of my friends and colleagues in my constituency in Dublin South Central. Some of them are here because they are involved in community work where they are regularly exposed to the disharmony, destruction and grief caused by so-called joyriders. In one area where they work senior citizens have been forced to become prisoners in their flats. The elderly are virtually barricaded in. There are bollards surrounding the complex in an attempt to prevent cars driving through the grass and lawns surrounding the residences. The bollards are there of necessity to protect the inhabitants. Coincidentally, they also prevent emergency services getting through, the ambulance, doctor, fire brigade, <Col N="824" /> are all excluded so the senior citizens are at risk in two different ways.</P>
    <P>Another colleague of mine is here I regret to say because a member of his family died as a result of his car being hit by a so-called joyrider. He is hoping that as a result of the Bill he may be able to see something resembling justice for his family. The death of a young man who leaves a wife and four small children is a tragedy in any circumstances and that tragedy is compounded because it should never have happened. Here was a man going about his business, working hard, looking after his family and he died as a result of being hit by a stolen car. The young man who caused his death was given a five year jail sentence. Most likely it will be reduced to a token one year. The victim is dead. He has no chance to rebuild his life and his family will suffer on account of his death.</P>
    <P>Yesterday in his reply to Deputy Broughan, the Minister for State provided many facts and figures on road safety. He told us how effective the Government's road safety strategy has been. Breath testing, wearing seat belts, engineering measures and so on were described at length. All these measures are to be welcomed but they have little or nothing to do with joyriding. So-called joyriding is a vitriolic type of anti-social behaviour prevalent in disadvantaged areas. It is carried out by people who have no regard for the law or for life, either their own or anyone else's. The paltry sentences which have been handed down to the perpetrators of these crimes are offensive to those who have been victims, directly or indirectly, of the joyriding menace. Clearly the sentences are not a deterrent to others to participate in the same type of behaviour.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a specific accident reduction measure at known accident locations on the national network. Does he seriously believe when we speak of joyriding that routine measures for speed reduction have any relevance? These measures will simply present a further challenge to those who participate in this life-threatening activity. Joyriding is not concerned with the rules of the road, wearing seat belts or speeding. It is concerned with getting a buzz and with rebellion and is an invitation to challenge the system. It is concerned with recklessness, indifference and an expression of aggression and is not concerned with routine or responsibility. It is outside the conventional values to which the vast majority of citizens adhere.</P>
    <P>What must be tackled are the underlying reasons young men &ndash; it is almost always young men &ndash; participate in this destructive, anti-social behaviour. It is concerned with disadvantage, lack of facilities and education and providing an environment where the negative and destructive attitudes that lead to joyriding can be overcome and replaced by positive and constructive patterns. <Col N="825" /> Never before was there such opportunity for investment in those areas, for example, in educational and leisure time facilities, to deal with the underlying problem of disadvantage. It is time for the Government to face up to the fact that there is a need for a radical overhaul of the services and facilities for youths who are at risk. A positive climate must be fostered so that those who are marginalised and disadvantaged will be given the chance to have some positive and constructive life experiences.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to Robert O'Connor of City Motor Sports who turned around the negative environment and attitude for a few young lads. In a controlled and safe environment he allowed them the chance to understand the mechanisms of a car, to drive a car safely and to have a say in how things are done. This project is a prototype which could be developed and expanded so that others might have a chance.</P>
    <P>The Garda has a difficult task in attempting to curb joyriding. Attempts to track down a joyrider often end in disaster, and a failure to contain the offender can result in undermining the role of the Garda in a locality. To be effective, the Garda needs to be supported within the community and needs to be properly resourced. Controlling and reducing joyriding is made even more difficult by the ready availability of old cars which are accessible to anyone who wants to find one, and most of my colleagues who have spoken have addressed this issue. Cars which are no longer road worthy must be taken out of circulation and scrapped.</P>
    <P>We need a range of effective policies and measures to tackle joyriding. The Bill sets out a few constructive and straightforward measures which would go some way towards alleviating the problem. Too many people have suffered and continue to suffer because of the delinquent, irresponsible and indifferent behaviour of certain individuals. It is not good enough to say the Bill is well intentioned but unworkable. What will it take to make it workable? Will it take more carnage, destruction and tragedy for those who have been affected? The Bill is a welcome step forward and I hope it is accepted by the House.</P>

      <P>In the almost 20 years I have been a Member of the House I have not encountered a debate in Private Members' time during which so many people on all sides of the House spoke so favourably and in support of a Bill and yet intended to vote against it. I hope between now and the time the vote is taken they and the Minister will reconsider their stance. How can it be that everyone who has spoken supports the Bill and yet some of them intend to vote against it? It must be a record, and I congratulate Deputy Broughan that he has effectively succeeded in having everyone on all sides of the House speak in favour of his Bill, in spite of which the Govern<Col N="826" /> ment parties will vote against it. I hope they change their minds between now and 8.30 p.m.</P>
      <P>Lest anyone might get the impression that this is a Dublin phenomenon, while it may have begun in Dublin, it exists in Donegal, Louth, Monaghan and all towns, especially in Border areas, as much as it does in Cork, Limerick and elsewhere. It may have begun in Dublin, but we normally inherit the bad things which begin in the capital city and, unfortunately, joyriding is no exception. However, it is double-barrelled, so to speak. Not only do joyriders from Dublin go joyriding in our county, so too do those from Northern Ireland. Such people have two bites of the cherry because, not only can they illegally buy cheap cars or rob them in the South, they can also do likewise in Northern Ireland and cross the Border and cause the same carnage as happens in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and other cities throughout the country. We have a double problem in Border areas. Not only that, but drug dealers go there from Belfast and Dublin and some of them sell drugs to these so-called joyriders, so we must also endure that. That is why Border areas have the highest level of road deaths and carnage in the country. That is a fact and I am sure the Minister will acknowledge that.</P>
      <P>What is the cost of the road carnage apart from the terrible situation of families who lose their loved ones because of these so-called joyriders? They are not joyriders; they are common criminals of the worst type. The illegal organisations, North and South, give people guns with which to go and kill other people. What is the difference between giving them an automatic weapon and giving them an automatic car for £20 or £30 with which to kill people? There is no difference except that, if they do it using guns, the crime is more serious than if they do it with a car. That makes no difference to the people or families who must bury their dead or who must wheel around those who are crippled or maimed for life as a result of the actions of these common criminals. They are not joyriders; they are common criminals who have created and will continue to create terrible grief in communities the length and breadth of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure my colleague, Deputy Broughan, would agree that it is no longer a Dublin problem but exists in every county and constituency. That is why we heard Deputies from all areas of the country who are members of different parties supporting the concept of the Bill. Nonetheless, some are not prepared to vote for it. Under parliamentary democracy as I have known it for the past 20 years, if a Private Member's Bill is presented on Second Stage, the Government and the Minister in charge of the relevant Department can introduce the necessary amendments to that Bill to strengthen it. Deputy Broughan did not say his Bill was perfect. No Bill is ever perfect. I have seen Bills having 100 to 200 amend<Col N="827" /> ments made to them before they were finally passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas. If everyone agrees with the concept of the Bill as initiated by my colleague, why can the Minister not propose amendments on Committee Stage? I am sure Deputy Broughan and the Labour Party would accept them, if they were reasonable,</P>
    <P>Not since the foundation of the State has the motor industry been in a better condition. Motor industry representatives accept it and we read daily about it. We should encourage the industry to put some money back into this area if only to initiate programmes in schools, as outlined by Deputy Broughan, and to support programmes initiated by the Garda Síochána? The industry should make a contribution in the same way the banks contribute to the security given to the transport of their money.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, has been a member of a local authority, as I have been, and he knows someone must pay the bill.</P>
    <P>Burnt out cars have to be dealt with in terms of manpower and finance. It is costing a huge amount of money to dump these cars. How much is it costing taxpayers to dispose of these weapons of destruction which are used by criminals who are prepared to kill and maim innocent people? </P>

      <P>The problem of joyriding and company cars is one of the most serious issues facing urban areas and one of the most common problems raised with public representatives at public meetings. This is particularly the case in recent months.</P>
      <P>The problem mainly manifests itself in local authority estates where people are afraid to let children out at night for fear they will be mown down by one of the many cars travelling at speed through their estate. People in many parts of Dublin are afraid to invite visitors to their homes in case someone in a company car ploughs into the visitors' car. This is a frequent occurrence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Members have been requested by residents associations to provide additional traffic calming measures to tackle this widespread problem. The Minister of State's response last night seemed to indicate that there is little appreciation of the scale of the problem in urban areas. It is possible that senior officials in the Department do not know that this problem exists. In recent weeks I spoke to senior officials in two Dublin local authorities and was shocked that some of them did not know what the term &ldquo;company car&rdquo; meant. It is likely that senior officials in the Department never come across areas where there is a problem with company cars. They certainly do not live in <Col N="828" /> these areas and they may never have to travel through them so they are not aware of the problem. However, public representatives from urban areas are only too familiar with this problem because our constituents are only too familiar with it and they are bringing it to our attention time and time again.</P>
    <P>This is not just the case with Opposition Deputies. The Minister of State's backbenchers are saying the same thing. Government Deputies such as Deputy Noel Ahern from my constituency are dealing with the same problem on a daily basis. I plead with the Minister of State to believe us when we tell him that there is a very serious problem which needs to be tackled urgently.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State's response to this Bill was extremely disappointing. He simply closed his mind to the fact that there may be a problem of which he is not aware and suggested that the problem does not exist.</P>

I hope the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, has a more open mind to this problem and that he gives the rest of us some credit for having genuine concerns about a very real problem which seriously affects many constituencies and urban communities.</P>
      <P>The problem is twofold. The Waste Management Act is the legislation under which most cars are collected. At present, approximately 500 cars are picked up per month by Dublin Corporation. I am trying to get the Minister's attention.</P>

      <P>In addition, about 1,200 are picked up by the gardaí in the Dublin area under section 41 of the Road Traffic Act. Both Acts are inadequate to deal with the scale of the problem. I am asking the Minister to consider the genuine points made by Members on both sides of the House before there is more carnage. There have already been serious incidents, some fatal, and others in which people have been hurt and maimed. Damage has been done and there is great fear in many urban communities. This is a very real and serious problem and I plead with the Minister to give it his urgent attention. He should at least accept the principles underlying the Bill. He can amend the Bill if he wishes but he should accept that there is a serious problem which needs to be tackled without delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only when one has direct personal experience of a problem like this that one appreciates the true depth and reality of what is called joyriding. A few months ago, a Labour Party activist who had been treasurer of my constituency party for many years was killed with his daughter in a joyriding accident. I was deeply affected by this accident as was everyone who knew the family. One had to see the hurt and the damage done to the family. There was a confused feeling of anger and a desire and a need to do something about this problem. There was also the need to know that others were going to do something about it and that the people responsible were going to be made amenable to the law.</P>
      <P>If I presented a copy of the Minister of State's speech to that family I do not think they would be satisfied. I do not wish to comment on this individual case and I do not know who the individuals involved were. However, it is not sufficient to say that, because 15 year olds cannot get a driving licence, the current law is sufficient to deal with this issue. The law is not sufficient to deal with it.</P>
      <P>We have stated that this Bill is an effort to deal with one net point &ndash; the disposal of cars by garages and others to underage individuals. However, it is an increasingly important point and the Bill is a valiant effort to deal with this one issue. I do not understand why the Minister cannot accept the Bill as a valiant effort so that we can improve it at a later stage if necessary.</P>
      <P>We have to try to understand and remove the reasons young men take, buy or use cars effectively as weapons which, on occasion, kill. It is no coincidence that such people tend to come from local authority estates or areas which are disadvantaged or deprived. We have to deal with this issue and the Government has been slow to give the building of facilities in these areas the sort of priority required.</P>
      <P>We also need to deal with this problem through the education system. We have to try and educate before the event and stop young men getting involved in this kind of activity. We have to educate them about cars and, if necessary, about the consequences of what they and their friends do. Frankly, we have to confront them with the evidence of the destruction caused by joyriding.</P>
      <P>The issue of scrappage must also be dealt with. We have to be able to say that a car no longer exists and is not going to be used for purposes for which it was never intended, such as being used as a weapon. The notion of a death certificate for a car when it is finally consigned to scrappage is a positive idea on which we can build.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very disappointed by the tone of the Minister of State's reply to the Bill. I genuinely do not understand why the Minister could not take this on board and I hope some of my colleagues from the northside of Dublin on the Government side will, after tonight, prevail upon <Col N="830" /> the Minister to look again at this issue and do something about it.</P>

      <P>The Government recognises that all possible resources must be targeted at this unacceptable and dangerous practice and is conscious that a strong signal must be sent to the perpetrators as well as to those people affected, that joyriding is not and will not be tolerated.</P>
      <P>The issue of the disposal of cars at the end of their useful life was raised by Deputies in the course of the debate. In late 1998 my Department invited the Society of the Irish Motor Industry to submit proposals for a producer responsibility initiative in relation to scrapped cars which would take account of the objectives and targets outlined in the proposed EU directive on end of life vehicles. I will shortly respond to the SIMI on its initial proposals on an ELV management system for Ireland and will seek an early discussion to make progress in the area. It is my objective to secure agreement on an acceptable vehicle recovery scheme in the near future. In that context the point made by Deputy McDowell about &ldquo;death certificates&rdquo; for vehicles is being taken on board.</P>
      <P>The issue of how local authority estate management can help deal with anti-social behaviour has also been raised. It is recognised that better management of public housing can make a significant contribution to tackling problems, including anti-social behaviour, in local authority housing estates and flat complexes. My Department, in conjunction with local authorities, has taken a number of steps and spent a considerable amount of money in these estates and we are making progress.</P>

      <P>Even the Leas-Cheann Comhairle must have become used to the arrogance and incompetence of this Administration. We have just seen a wonderful example of it from the southern region. Seldom, however, have we come across the hypocrisy we heard in the past hour. I listened to Deputies Conor Lenihan, O'Flynn, and the Minister and it was with disbelief that I read the speech made by the Minister of State, <Col N="832" /> Deputy Dan Wallace, yesterday. No one who has been in this House for any length of time could believe the rubbish that civil servants, who do not even know of the existence of this problem, wrote for him. He parades himself as a democrat, as someone close the people. The speech he read last night was unbelievably insulting in its lack of content.</P>

      <P>When the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, was on this side of the House, on the occasions he came forward with good ideas &ndash; and he did, his only problem was implementing them when he entered office &ndash; they were taken on board by the Government and legislated for, as were ideas from other parties. Why is it impossible that a brilliant idea put forward by Deputy Broughan, accepted by all concerned in the House, cannot be accepted in principle and then amended with all the wonderful expertise that exists in the Customs House and St. Stephen's Green? That is all we ask, that the Minister would buy into the idea and let the committee of the House do the rest of the work. Is that too much to ask? Is the Minister incapable of doing that? Does he not want to do it? Does he not know how to do it or is he too arrogant to accept that other people might be able to do it better than him?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the leader of Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, and all the members of the Parliamentary Labour Party, for their strong support in raising the issue of joyriding through the Bill before us tonight. I also thank my Fine Gael colleagues for their valuable and forthright support.</P>
      <P>While the issue primarily affects urban areas, the speeches of Deputies on all sides of the House highlighted a deep concern which is often neglected in the media and, so far, has failed to secure a serious response from this Government. The Government's careless neglect of the problem is a fair reflection of its uncaring ignorance of the growing social problems in the areas of greatest deprivation.</P>
      <P>The negative &ldquo;cannot be bothered&rdquo; reactions of the Taoiseach and the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Environment and Local Government to this simple but important Bill reflects their contempt for communities largely untouched by the booming economy, communities which are under siege from car and youth related crime. Let us hope their continued inaction on this serious problem does not come back to haunt them when another joyriding tragedy is brought to the attention of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies on all sides recognise the desperate effects of joyriding crime on the community. Like <Col N="833" /> others who have listened to the debate, I found Deputy McDowell's recollection of the tragic victims of this plague to be very moving and poignant. The major efforts made by local residents and development bodies to raise the living standards and improve the physical environment of our most deprived urban communities have been hampered at every turn by the continual upsurge of joyriding and car related youth crime. A Fianna Fáil Deputy who spoke last night told me after the debate that following the car related mayhem in his constituency on St. Patrick' Day and last weekend, he and the community he tries to represent are at their wits end trying to cope with this problem. I invite him and his other urban Fianna Fáil colleagues who spoke tonight who may feel the same about this problem to vote for this Bill. It is not too late for the Minister to accept it.</P>
    <P>While I have a warm regard for the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, I was disappointed last night that neither the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, nor the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, came into the House to respond to the Labour Party's presentation of this Bill. The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, effectively reneged on a commitment he made to me before Christmas that he would seriously and carefully examine the provision of Government time to expedite legislation through the House to curb joyriding crime. I raised the issue of youth car related crime on behalf of the Labour Party on approximately 20 occasions with the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, and the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, in the 28th Dáil. While I asked for an adequate car scrappage scheme in terms of the idea of a car death certificate proposed by Mr. Conor Faughnan of the AA and for the type of legislation we are discussing, I accepted these measures on their own would not do enough to curb youth car related crime. I have, therefore, requested a comprehensive multi-agency approach to this problem along the lines of the local drug task forces comprising education, youth and community centre provision, staff resources, well supported local estate management, proper and sustained provision for our sports clubs and extra resources for the Garda Síochána who have battled, often heroically, with joyriding crime over the past decade.</P>
    <P>The response to this Bill drafted for the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dan Wallace, last night was breathtaking in its vacuous negativity and ignorance. He rambled on about the Government's road safety strategy and its 20% target for 2002, blithely ignoring the imminent massive danger to families and children endured nightly by the people affected by joyriding crime. The authors of his speech in the Department of the Environment and Local <Col N="834" /> Government would do well to take a reality check by visiting those areas on many afternoons to witness parents grabbing their children off the footpath and running inside the nearest garden for safety when the tyres of a robbed vehicle or company car screech around their suburban streets and open spaces.</P>
    <P>This modest Bill seeks to provide for two new driving offences. Section 1 attempts to come to grips with the phenomenon of so-called company cars, cars given or sold very cheaply to youngsters who proceed to joyride them and then burn the vehicles often on amenity open spaces or very close to residents' homes. That section seeks to introduce severe penalties for unscrupulous dealers and owners who transfer these vehicles to children and teenagers. Rather than accept this simple provision, the Minister of State lamely spoke last night of legislation on the supply of goods, as if this crisis in urban estates was a mere matter of packaging or consumer law. In effect, he did not give us any credible reason section 1 could not have been accepted. His facile reasoning is unimaginative and factually incorrect. The Road Traffic Acts are primarily concerned with the safety of members of the public on the public roads. It is precisely because the Minister of State is concerned with the safe use of vehicles that he should be equally concerned with the manner of their supply. Cars supplied in an unregulated way may and do result in unsafe use. That is why the Road Traffic Act, 1968, at section 8 deals with the control of supply of vehicles. That section sets out all manner of matters the Minister is entitled to specify by way of regulation dealing with the supply of vehicles. Its primary thrust is to ensure that vehicles are supplied by dealers in a road worthy condition. &ldquo;Supply&rdquo; for the purposes of that section is interpreted nearly identically to the definition proposed in this Bill as including supply by way of sale, hire, loan or otherwise. Because of the seriousness which we attach to the supply of so-called company cars, we decided not to simply amend section 8 of the 1968 Act but to deal with the matter separately in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 is directed against the ringleaders of joyriding and car related crime in our estates. Anyone who organises, directs or participates in taking a mechanically propelled vehicle without the consent of the owner for the purpose of that vehicle being driven in a dangerous manner in a public place shall be guilty of an offence. The Government's response was to argue that the practical enforcement of this section would be very difficult, but surely underlying that view is a reluctance to recognise and confront the crime of joyriding. It is the Labour Party's view that the issue is so serious and deadly that we should create in law the offence of joyriding. We anticipated the Minister of State's argument against section 2 regarding the intention to steal a car for the purpose of joyriding. That is why we propose <Col N="835" /> in the section that an evidential presumption should be created. Once the facts establish unlawful taking, then we propose that it should be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that the vehicle was stolen for the purpose of dangerous driving. Such a presumption, common enough throughout the criminal law, is designed to assist the prosecution of the case. Once primary facts are established the onus of proof is reversed and it becomes a matter for the defence to prove that an offence was not committed. The Minister of State failed to deal with this aspect of our proposal last night, which fully meets his reservations.</P>
    <P>He did not make a convincing case last night for the effectiveness of the existing provisions and penalties relating to joyriding and car related crime. As the Labour Party spokesperson on social and community affairs, I make no apology for the tough penalties in section 3. It is laughable that a constituency colleague, Deputy Brady, said he cannot vote for the Bill because the penalties provided are not severe enough. It is remarkable that some urban Fianna Fáil Deputies who called for similar type of penalties in the local media will tonight vote against this measure. I hope this will be well remembered by our constituents.</P>
    <P>I referred at length last night to the responsibility of the motor industry and to the powers that the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, has under section 29 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, which was steered through this House by my colleague, Deputy Howlin. Section 29 allows the Minister to introduce regulations for the safe disposal of any product for which there is no further use. As on so many issues affecting his brief, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, seems to have been overwhelmed by events that he should have foreseen, especially with the introduction of the car test.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party views this Bill as only one of a comprehensive range of initiatives which should be undertaken on a multi-agency basis throughout the districts affected by car and youth crime. I suggested last night that the county and city development boards might co-ordinate the efforts of local bodies such as the Northside Anti-Joyriding Task Force and the Finglas Crime Task Force. Among the most important elements of that approach are additional resources for education in deprived areas to engender an attitude of responsibility towards vehicles and the community perhaps along the lines of the successful Neilstown project. Given the genuine interest of many youths in cars and vehicle maintenance, about which a Fine Gael colleague spoke effectively last night, projects like the City Motor Sports of Mr. Robert O'Connor could be developed and replicated in many areas of Dublin, Cork and Limerick. In previous Dáil inter<Col N="836" /> ventions on this issue, I pleaded with the Government to allocate decent resources to the youth service, local community and recreation centres and to local sports clubs. The contrast between the lavish ambition of the Taoiseach in relation to the proposed new national stadium and sports campus and the poverty of resources allocated to local sports projects points to amazing hypocrisy. If the Taoiseach and the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, get their way, the children of the north and west sides of Dublin will still be changing under a hedge for football or athletics events while he and Mr. McManus will be watching professional sport in corporate boxes nearby.</P>
    <P>Last night I saluted the courage of the Garda Síochána who have wrestled with and often risked their lives in combating car crime over nearly two decades. I witnessed their work on many occasions. I again warmly note the contribution of Assistant Commissioner, Jim McHugh, and his team of officers and call for additional staff and other resources to be allocated to the affected districts. We still need a dedicated anti-joyriding unit to be overseen by senior Garda members. Valiant officials of local authorities have also battled with the menace of car related crime for many years, but we need a more pro-active programme of estate management in our local authority estates with personnel available, if necessary, in the late evening or early morning hours when estates are traumatised by sprees of joyriding crime.</P>
    <P>The comprehensive approach I briefly outlined combined with this Labour Party Bill would bring this dreadful problem of joyriding and youth car related crime under control. As Deputy Rabbitte noted earlier, there is a precedent in this House in relation to the plague of urban horses, which for several years were a terrible nuisance to many people. When the rainbow Government at last legislated to deal with this problem in the Control of Horses Bill, a strong signal was sent from this House to the troublesome horse owners, the local authorities and, above all, the suffering residents in our most deprived estates that this state of affairs would not longer be tolerated. As several Deputies said last night, we need to send another similar signal to these areas in relation to youth car related crime. The arrogant refusal of this Government to do this by its decision not to accept this Labour Party Bill tells our disadvantaged urban communities that the Government does not care about their suffering and the fourth pillar proposals put forward in the new national programme only pay lip service to the problem. Let any further tragedies and mayhem as a result of joyriding crimes be on the heads of the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate I am being given the respect I deserve. The reason I seek to raise this matter on the Adjournment is that I am concerned at what is happening in the Western Health Board in relation to the orthodontic service. In 1999 children in the Western Health Board area were told they would have to wait two years for orthodontic service. By the end of that year they were told they would have to wait three years. The most recent letter from the health board has indicated it will be three and a half years before any child will be seen in the Western Health Board area. In 1999 not one child was taken off the orthodontic service waiting list. That is a disgrace.</P>
      <P>In 1997, when the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, appointed two orthodontists to the health board, he said he hoped these appointments would deal with the waiting list problem. Nothing has happened since. In the Belmullet region the last permanent full-time dentist was appointed in 1994. That person left in 1995, a temporary replacement was appointed in January of last year and that person left in August. There are 23,907 children, nationally, waiting for orthodontic services. In 1996 there were 1,367 on the Western Health Board list, in 1997 there were 3,036, in 1998 there were 3,838 and in 1999 the waiting list had grown to 4,438. It is disgraceful that a waiting list should be allowed to grow to such an extent in four years of such prosperity. There are two full-time dentists and one part-time dentist working in the orthodontic units and there is no consultant orthodontist in the Mayo area. Something is very wrong.</P>
      <P>The health board recently advised parents to use private orthodontists and avail of tax relief for those costs. Does the Minister realise that most of the people concerned are on low income? Some are on social welfare and hold medical cards. These people cannot afford to pay up to £3,000 to private dentists. Many are not liable for tax and cannot avail of tax relief. I ask the Minister to stop the health board from writing to parents with this advice. A further large number of children are waiting to be assessed for treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children must discover why the health board has allowed the waiting list to grow to such length in such a short time. He must recruit orthodontists, if necessary from <Col N="840" /> outside the EU. He must bring orthodontists from the other health board areas or, if necessary, from Northern Ireland to places such as Belmullet where there is no orthodontic surgeon. The orthodontic service has collapsed. It is not right that young children should suffer ridicule at school because they have prominent teeth. The Minister must deal with this crisis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ring for allowing me this opportunity to discuss the orthodontic services in the Western Health Board area.</P>
      <P>Orthodontic treatment services continue to be developed in accordance with the dental health action plan. The action plan provides for the development by each health board of a consultant led orthodontic service which ensures a service of high quality and high service levels. My Department has made additional resources available to the health boards to assist with the development of their orthodontic services in accordance with the action plan.</P>
      <P>The Western Health Board with the assistance of funding by my Department has established a regional orthodontic unit at Merlin Park Regional Hospital . The unit is headed by a consultant orthodontist. Three full-time staff and three sessional orthodontists currently provide services under the overall direction and supervision of the consultant. My Department has given approval for an additional £150,000 in the year 2000 for the further development of the board's orthodontic servcices.</P>
      <P>The demand for orthodontics is much greater than can be provided in any developed country. The provision of fixed appliance orthodontic treatment is very expensive. It is important, therefore, that resources be used as efficiently as possible for those patients most severely affected. Accordingly, the Western Health Board, in line with the other health boards, assesses patients for treatment in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department in 1985 and, where appropriate, places individuals on waiting lists. I am concerned at the size of the waiting lists nationally and I have asked my officials to review the situation in relation to this issue.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the Western Health Board, in line with other health boards, is experiencing difficulty in filling orthodontic posts. The problems encountered in the recruitment and retention of appropriately qualified orthodontists has resulted in an inability on the Western Health Board's part, despite its best efforts, to provide the desired level of service. The board has held inteviews on a number of occasions over the years in an effort to fill vacancies as they arise and staff from other countries, including Britain and Germany, have been employed at various times. The board has also experienced a high turnover of staff who reached specialist level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="841" /> As yet, there is no recognised specialist grade of orthodontist in the public health sector. However, quite recently my predecessor gave consent to the Dental Council for the speciality of orthodontics to be recognised for registration purposes and I am confident that once the specialist register is up and running this will help to improve recruitment and retention issues and, consequently, help to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the orthodontic sevice. The existence of a recognised specialist orthodontist grade should increase the attractiveness of employment within the health board service.</P>
    <P>One of the main contributory factors why targets are not being met in health board orthodontic units is that the majority of support staff available to consultants have been trainees and are, therefore, not capable of treating the target number required of a specialist. At present, two of the staff in the regional orthodontic unit in Galway are pursuing a specialised qualification in orthodontics  &ndash; M.Orth. I applaud the Western Health Board staff in their efforts to improve the service. I am optimistic that the service provided will improve immeasurably due to the additional expertise acquired by the staff once they have completed their specialist training.</P>
    <P>I understand that the total number of children on the treatment waiting list at 1 January 2000 was 4,438 and that the current average waiting time for treatment under the orthodontic programme in the Western Health Board area is two and a half to three years, with all patients being taken off the list in strict order of priority in accordance with my Department's guidelines. I have been assured that a delay in providing orthodontic treatment does not in any way impact on a successful clinical outcome. My Department's target is that no child should be more than two years on a waiting list for teatment. The Western Health Board is committed to reducing waiting times progressively over the next few years. However, this is dependent on the recruitment and retention of appropriately qualified staff. It should be noted that in respect of urgent or priority cases in the Western Health Board area no delay whatsoever is occasioned and treatment is provided immediately for such patients.</P>
    <P>The Western Health Board's year 2000 service plan provides for the appointment of additional senior dental surgeons and necessary support staff, together with plans for the development of the oral surgery unit. The board intends that an audit will be undertaken to assess the impact of new technologies on orthodontic treatment practices, waiting lists and waiting times. I am reassured that the Western Health Board is striving to bring its orthodontic service to optimal levels and I will continue to monitor progress with interest and give any additional support I can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for this opportunity to raise this matter with the Minister for Health and Children. Nothing explains better why the Lindsay tribunal must take place and why haemophiliacs must be present at it than the story of 13 year old John Kelly. As a baby he was diagnosed as haemophiliac and with modern medical treatment there was no reason John could not have lived a normal life. Instead he died of AIDS. He was infected with the HIV virus by contaminated Factor 8 injections. The product designed to keep him alive was his death sentence. John Kelly's father, Ray, wants to know why his son died. He is entitled to that much. Having lost his son, is he now going to have to run the risk of paying for the privilege of finding out why he died?</P>
      <P>That is what the Irish Haemophilia Society is facing and that is why the society has formally requested the Minister for Health and Children to make an application to seek a postponement of the tribunal. This request has not been made lightly. It is made for genuine reasons and it follows the failure of the Minister to deal with the concerns of the IHS about costs. These concerns forced the society to instruct its solicitors to cease preparations for the tribunal in February. In the absence of a resolution of the financial issue, the society was unwilling to instruct its solicitors to resume for fear the executive might become personally liable for costs.</P>
      <P>More than anyone, haemophiliacs and their families want to see the full hearings of the tribunal begin because of the uncertain future of those affected by HIV and hepatitis C. This stark urgency is evidenced by the sudden death of another member in the last fortnight. His death has brought to 63 the number of haemophiliacs who have died so far from contaminated blood products. The society has limited resources and is desperately worried about the implications if the tribunal fails to award all costs. For four months they have sought to resolve the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may well be a prisoner of his officials and the Attorney General, but he holds the key to resolving the impasse. The society has asked for an assurance from him. Some progress has been made in the latest offer on costs built up before the tribunal began. However the society's fundamental concern about a potential shortfall when the tribunal is over has not been addressed. The Minister tried to muddy the waters in interviews I heard early today. He repeatedly suggests that the society wants a blank cheque but it is more than willing to build in safeguards and I understand has informed the Minister of this. Even if a fraction of the costs were refused the Irish Haemophiliac Society would be bankrupt and John <Col N="843" /> Kelly's father and others like him would be exposed to liability.</P>
    <P>The society initiated court proceedings to challenge the tribunal's decision not to award the society its costs. I understand the State waited until today to lodge a defence and the society is forced to lodge a motion for discovery against the Attorney General. This court action could be avoided if the Minister provided the society with the letter of comfort it needs. No other player in this tragedy is exposed to costs in the way the innocent victims and their families are. I urge the Minister to replace the contempt with which these people have been treated with the compassion they deserve.</P>

What has happened to haemophiliacs is a tragedy, a personal tragedy for individuals and a family tragedy for those who have seen relatives die or who are taking care of relatives who are desperately sick as a result of infection with HIV and hepatitis C.</P>
      <P>It is important that people with haemophilia and their families tell their story to the tribunal of inquiry. It is vital that through the tribunal we find out if this tragedy could have been avoided. It is crucial that we get to the truth and learn a grim lesson for the future. Nothing like this can ever happen again. I, therefore, have no choice. I must be concerned about anything which would prevent the discovery of that truth or hamper people in establishing in public the full implications of what has happened to them.</P>
      <P>Because of that concern I have met the society, listened to, worked and made real progress with it towards resolving the issues that might prevent it participating in the Lindsay tribunal of inquiry. At all times my priority has been to do all in my power to ensure the society can and will participate in the tribunal. Therefore, when Judge Lindsay ruled in December that the tribunal did not have the jurisdiction to make an interim order for costs in favour of the society, my Department immediately indicated that we would consider providing remuneration to legal representatives of the society appearing at public sittings of the tribunal. Just three days later my Department took the initiative and made an offer of exceptional financial assistance to the society to which it did not formally respond. It had instituted legal proceedings against the tribunal, Ireland and the Attorney General in relation to the chairperson's ruling on costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 15 February the society asked for an urgent meeting with me to discuss its financial position. I agreed to meet it immediately. The society outlined its situation to me. Its accountant had advised that he believed the bill for the outstand<Col N="844" /> ing legal fees and costs from its solicitors would exceed its assets. Without an undertaking from a third party to fund those costs, estimated by the society to amount to approximately £1 million, the accountant's opinion was that the society, a limited company, was insolvent. I had further meetings with it on this and on 1 March came through to it with a revised offer of financial assistance that took into account its financial position; in other words, it dealt with historical costs.</P>
    <P>The offer of 1 March went further. It also took into account the society's request for funding to retain medical and scientific personnel to provide expert advice during the course of the tribunal. This offer removed the immediate threat of insolvency. The society acknowledged this. However it then raised the issue of possible future financial exposure if there was a shortfall in costs awarded by the tribunal at the end of the inquiry. It is a matter for the tribunal to award costs in whole or in part and it has already indicated that the society can have a considerable expectation of being awarded its costs at the conclusion of the inquiry. Because I am committed to ensuring the society participates in the tribunal I went further and presented it yesterday with the following offer.</P>
    <P>The society may claim its historical legal costs incurred in negotiations with my Department on hepatitis C related issues. I have agreed that in the event of any failure to agree on legal costs I will execute a requisition to tax these costs, which would mean £300,000 for the society or perhaps more. I offered £150,000 in respect of preparatory work undertaken by the society's legal advisers prior to the establishment of the tribunal of inquiry. I offered to advance funds to the society to allow it pay 75% of the brief fees and 75% of the refresher fees in respect of retaining two senior counsel and two junior counsel for the duration of the tribunal. I offered to advance funds to the society to pay a daily fee of £500 in respect of the attendance of its solicitor at sitting days of the tribunal. I offered to establish a fund of up to £150,000 to allow the society to retain expert medical and scientific personnel.</P>
    <P>The total package, excluding ongoing legal fees, comes to £600,000. Taken in the context of the society having a considerable expectation of being awarded its costs at the conclusion of the inquiry, it will be clear that I have been at pains to remove its real fear of insolvency. I have been and continue to be accessible, open and sympathetic to the society. I am aware of public concern about legal fees related to tribunals and while I must take that issue into account, my priority continues to be and has always been to find ways to ensure haemophiliacs and their families bring their truth to the tribunal and are heard by the nation. I am <Col N="845" /> very anxious that haemophiliacs should participate in the tribunal. It remains for the society and the Department to find a mechanism which will ensure the full participation of the society in a tribunal which will be the key to establishing the truth and preventing future tragedy. I am committed to finding such a mechanism and I have no reason to doubt that the society is equally committed.</P>

      <P>I am delighted that the Minister is present to hear my plea on behalf of St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel which serves the people of County Tipperary, which has a population of more than 100,000. My plea is a simple one. I am asking the Minister to help us acquire a CAT scanner. In the newspapers this morning I read that the Minister for Finance will have to revise his budget day tax revenue forecast by more than £500 million due to the fact that the economy is progressing at an alarming rate.</P>
      <P>There is no CAT scanner in south Tipperary. As a result, seriously ill patients have to be ferried by ambulance to other centres in Waterford, Cork and Dublin. Because of the overloading of services in those centres, there is a waiting list. The medical profession is very concerned at the lack of such a facility in the locality. As a result people's lives are often put at risk.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be pleased to learn that resulting from the tremendous interest expressed by medical staff in St. Joseph's and other hospitals in south Tipperary and with the support of local people, a huge fundraising campaign has commenced. We are determined to acquire this important resource. Last Sunday in my local hall we handed over £800 raised by way of a whist drive. To what I am sure will be an outstandingly successful campaign, the Minister can provide the impetus it needs by giving a commitment to provide a certain amount of money towards the cost of a CAT scanner. We are working hard on behalf of those who are prepared to do something for themselves. The campaign has been launched in all the major towns in south Tipperary for which it has been declared the millennium project. The question that is most often asked is, &ldquo;What about all the money the Minister for Finance has at his disposal and how will the Department of Health and Children co-operate with us?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My plea is a passionate and fair one. I ask the Minister to join our efforts to get this necessary facility for the people of the Tipperary area. I ask the Minister to give a commitment that he will back us and provide a certain amount of finance for this facility. This would give tremendous impetus and encouragement to the people who are prepared to work until the necessary funding <Col N="846" /> is secured. It would also give the Minister a good image. Much is expected of him because, unfortunately, over the past 20 years Tipperary has been in the wilderness in relation to health services. There was little investment, although the former Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, made a start by providing almost £13 million for improvements in hospital services.</P>
    <P>We are determined to ensure the hospital has the facilities to enhance patient care and ensure that people's lives are not put at risk. As I said, we are prepared to co-operate with the Minister. Everybody is prepared to work at every fundraising activity that can be imagined. Our agenda in south Tipperary is to get the CAT scan for St. Joseph's Hospital. The Minister could give us the best impetus possible by committing himself to supporting this campaign. My request is reasonable. We want to join the Minister in partnership and ensure enhanced health services for the people who badly need this resource.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the medical staff who were prepared to initiate this campaign. They could continue working with the existing facilities but they are prepared to give up their free time and use their resources and energy, in conjunction with a hardworking local committee, to raise funds for a CAT scan for St. Joseph's. I hope the Minister will give them the big push they deserve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity afforded to me by Deputy Theresa Ahearn to address the House on the issue of the use of a CAT scan at St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel.</P>
      <P>The provision of services at St. Joseph's Hospital is a matter for the South Eastern Health Board in the first instance. As the Deputy is aware, a major phase one capital development is under planning at the hospital to provide for the transfer of surgical services from Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel, in line with the south Tipperary hospital agreement. In view of the projected overall increase in activity at St. Joseph's that this major development will entail, the health board has also developed separate plans for the enhancement of the existing radiological capacity at the hospital in order to meet anticipated increased demand. To this end, the board has recently developed and equipped a second radiology room at the hospital at a capital cost of £113,000. Additional staff, including a radiographer, are being recruited to operate this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, in March this year, as part of the ongoing development of radiology services at the hospital, I approved a capital grant of £317,000 for the purchase of a new fluoroscopy imaging system at Clonmel. With these developments, St. Joseph's Hospital will have state <Col N="847" /> of the art radiological and ultrasound equipment available to support clinical needs. I am confident that these measures will enable the radiology service at the hospital to continue to respond to needs as the overall development of services as St. Joseph's Hospital proceeds over the coming years.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the South Eastern Health Board has also been giving consideration to its overall CT scanning needs, to build on the service currently available at Waterford Regional Hospital. In this regard, it has identified the provision of new CT services at Wexford General Hospital and St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, as the first priorities and plans are in train to commission these new services this year, facilitated by local fundraising efforts and revenue support from my Department.</P>
    <P>Any further development of the region's overall radiological capacity would have to be considered by the board in the first instance in the context of its overall competing development priorities and available funding. In this regard, I understand from the board that it is prepared to consider a business case for the provision of a CT service at Clonmel on the basis of clinical need and economic viability. It is satisfied, however, that the current arrangements for the provision of this service are adequately meeting patient needs and there is no question of patients being put at risk. In that context, it is important for the Deputy to ensure that the health board is on side and giving this matter priority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That has not come across yet. It has other developments in the region and this also needs to be prioritised. The Department takes on board the development plans which the health boards submit.</P>
      <P>In terms of the overall development of services at St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel, tenders are now being considered for the major phase one development with a view to enabling work to commence in the middle of this year at a cost of approximately £13 million at January 1997 prices. This landmark development in the history of the health services in south Tipperary will involve the provision of a new accident and emergency department, ward accommodation, operating theatres, ICU, a day care unit, a central sterile supplies department, a physical medicine department, an education centre and consulting rooms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will agree that this development will represent a hugely significant advance in the quality of services that will be available to south Tipperary hospital patients. The development of services in the area has been impeded in the past by disagreement on the preferred organisational <Col N="848" /> arrangements. The final settlement of that issue, through the signing of the south Tipperary hospital agreement in 1996, has paved the way for this development and concurrent developments at Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel, and in Tipperary town.</P>
    <P>The overall objective is to ensure that the services available to the people of south Tipperary are responsive to their needs. I trust that the developments in planning and under way there will be seen as tangible evidence of my commitment in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. J. McGuinness Mr. J. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>Since my election to the House in 1997 I have tabled parliamentary questions on the trauma being suffered by the families of missing persons. While I appreciate the endeavours of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the matter is still not being dealt with adequately.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to radically reappraise the procedures used to investigate the cases of missing persons. When a person is first reported missing, the response time should be reduced. A plan of action should be put in place involving skilled people. The investigators involved in the case should be experts in the field and use knowledge obtained from other agencies throughout the world so that there is a swift response.</P>
      <P>Regarding the six ongoing cases, I accept that Operation Trace was a move in the right direction in terms of filtering information on each case. However, the response has been inadequate. My view is that new full scale investigations of each case are necessary. Each disappearance should be reconstructed. The case of Jo Jo Dollard, a Kilkenny woman who has been missing since 1995, should be used as a pilot in this area. Operation Trace should be extended so that a search can be conducted again from the scene of the last sighting of Jo Jo Dollard.</P>
      <P>The necessary funding should be put at the disposal of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure there can be a reconstruction and the operation can start all over again. All the sources of information should be filtered again and all the land from where Jo Jo Dollard disappeared to Kilkenny should be re-examined. New technology which is now available should be used in this case to find a body, if one is buried, and to ensure that every possible avenue is explored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The families of these missing persons have not been included in investigations. There is deep misunderstanding between the families of the missing persons and the authorities. There is also a feeling that not enough is being done <Col N="849" /> by the Government and the Department to ensure these six cases are investigated thoroughly. The families are not sufficiently involved so that they can feel they are doing something to track the last days of the member of their family who has gone missing.</P>
    <P>In all these cases, the State has been remiss in the manner in which the families have been treated. In the case of Jo Jo Dollard, little counselling was offered to the remaining members of the family in terms of how they could cope with the trauma, the feeling of helplessness and the fact that there is no end to their grief. They have no place at which they can mourn because they do not have a body. There is no ongoing communication between the Garda, the Department and Operation Trace. There is a sense that no one really cares.</P>
    <P>The recent death of Sean Pender underlines the extent of the trauma felt not only by parents whose children have gone missing but also by their extended family and circle of friends. As a result, there is an onus on the Government to extend Operation Trace, to make it more meaningful and put in place an investigation which does not merely involve the shuffling of paper and which is not just another act of bureaucracy. Operation Trace must represent a definite and tangible attempt to search the final route taken by each of the missing people to whom I refer.</P>
    <P>Jo Jo Dollard's family has undergone a never ending trauma. They have searched every day for some trace of Jo Jo since she went missing. The parliamentary questions asked and the answers given do not reflect what is happening. I appeal to the Minister and the Department to take more tangible action and to extend Operation Trace so that it focuses on tracing the final steps taken by those who have gone missing. The Garda should use every piece of technology and information available and remain in constant consultation with the members of families in question in order to discover what happened to the six people to whom I refer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to extend the apologies of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who could not be present due to a prior engagement.</P>
      <P>I know that this debate takes place against the background of the tragic death of Sean Pender. I know that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would like me to express his deep condolences to his family and, of course, I would also like to extend my sympathy to them at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed the Minister that the effectiveness of the working methods and procedures employed in missing persons cases are continually reviewed. As a result of this, substantial changes were made in 1998 such as the introduction of new guidelines and pro<Col N="850" /> cedures which place a particular emphasis on keeping the families of missing persons informed by a liaison officer. The Minister understands that the Garda liaison officer deals with a designated family member. Where the missing person is under the age of 18 year a juvenile liaison officer is also involved.</P>
    <P>The question of having a centralised Garda national missing persons unit is one which is suggested from time to time and which is kept under continuous review. Obviously, there are arguments for and against such a proposal. The Minister understands from the Garda authorities that the current arrangements are that local Garda management take direct responsibility for missing person cases and that special investigation teams are appointed as necessary. The Minister also understands that the Garda Commissioner considers that investigations of missing persons are more effective when they have that particular kind of local focus and knowledge. Local Garda officers have available to them, as required, the services of all the specialist units and manpower which are part of the overall Garda organisation structure though it must be remembered that on occasions almost the entire force is involved in the search or lookout for missing persons.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, Operation Trace, which is headed at assistant commissioner level, has been in operation for some time. This unit was established in 1998 by the Garda Commissioner with the express purpose of examining a number of missing persons cases. The Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that each of the cases currently under review by Operation Trace was investigated in depth by the Garda Síochána in the locality of the disappearance. The Minister understands that all information and leads relating to any of these separate cases is systematically and vigorously pursued and he is further informed that Operation Trace has comprehensively reviewed the cases of six missing women and has yielded new lines of inquiry that have been pursued in conjunction with the original investigation teams. Furthermore, a unique database has been devised which facilitates cross referencing of detail and highlighting of similarities between cases. The Minister understands that there are ongoing lines of inquiry in relation to these cases and that many searches have been conducted and further searches will be based on the available information and intelligence.</P>
    <P>In relation to supporting the families of those who have gone missing, the Minister has asked me to inform the House that there are a number of voluntary groups and organisations which assist in tracing persons who have gone missing and who offer valuable support to the families of missing persons. I will convey to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the views articulated by Deputy McGuinness in relation to <Col N="851" /> the lack of counselling supports on offer to the people to whom he referred.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform recognises the desperately harrowing circumstances families find themselves in when loved ones go missing, particularly in circum<Col N="852" /> stances of the kind referred to here this evening. The Minister assures the House that there has never been, nor will there be, any lack of determination on the part of the Garda Síochána to pursue these cases relentlessly.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 6 April 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 to 22, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>In replies to previous questions over the past two years or so on the possibility of convening further meetings of the forum, I have indicated that while this is a matter for the chairperson of the forum and the parties participating in it, the Government would be open to one or more such meetings if this seemed likely to advance progress in the political and peace processes and if support for this course of action was the predominant tendency among the participants in the forum. I also indicated that, since the last meeting of the forum on 5 December 1997, the predominant tendency on the part of the forum participants was to concentrate their time and energy on, first, the negotiation and, subsequently, the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. As I indicated in my reply to questions previously, the latter remains the focus of the Government's policy and efforts. In that context, I envisage that there will be further round table meetings of the pro-Agreement parties such as took place earlier in the current process of intensive consultations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I arranged with the chairperson of the forum for soundings with parties participating in the forum as to their views on an early meeting. <Col N="854" /> At the moment the strongly preponderant view is that it would not be opportune to hold a meeting at this time.</P>
    <P>If there were to be a change of opinion in favour of such meetings, this could provide a context in which consideration could be given, perhaps by the co-ordinating committee of the forum, to finalising outstanding reports of the forum. The draft reports involved were comments of the forum on two consultancy reports which were published in 1995 and a draft report of the forum's Sub-Committee on Obstacles in the South to reconciliation. It may be doubtful as to what would be the value now of finalising comments on studies published almost five years ago. The draft report of the obstacles sub-committee is in a different category as it represented the primary follow-up on the undertaking given by my predecessor, former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, in paragraph 6 of the Downing Street Declaration of 15 December 1993. However, while the preparation of the sub-committee's report was well advanced at the time, early in 1996, when forum meetings were deferred, a great deal of water has flowed under the bridge in the meantime in regard to the matters dealt with in the draft report. Thus, if the broad issue were to be taken up again, it might not be a matter of finalising a report but rather of very substantial reconsideration of the issues and extensive redrafting of the draft report.</P>
    <P>There have also been calls, in the context of current efforts to overcome obstacles to the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, to take forward establishment of the Civic Forum in Northern Ireland and the possible independent North-South consultative forum as envisaged in the Agreement. The relevant provisions of the latter involve roles for the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in Northern Ireland and for the Northern Ireland Administration. However, if it were felt to be helpful in the absence of other institutions, the Government would be open to proceed with some form of civic consultation arrangements.</P>
    <P>In previous replies I have said that, in the context of implementation of the Agreement proceeding successfully, the Government would envisage that the role played by the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation would be discharged by the joint parliamentary forum and North-South consultative forum envisaged in paragraphs 18 and 19 of Strand Two of the Agreement.</P>

      <P>The private donation of £50 million from Mr. J. P. McManus towards the financing and development of Campus and Stadium Ireland has been given effect by way of a letter of assignation between Pictet &amp; Cie, Geneva, the "Bank", and the Department of the Taoiseach, "Beneficiary".

      <P>The document was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 25 February 2000.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to place on record the Government's appreciation of Mr. McManus's most generous donation.</P>

      <P>The print run for the action plan on implementing the information society amounted to 7,000 copies. Some copies were sent to other departments and agencies for distribution. For this reason, I cannot say exactly how many copies of the action plan have been distributed but I understand that most of the print run has been circulated by now. The action plan is also available from my Department's website. While data is retained on the overall number of hits to the site, the information cannot be broken down to the level of individual publications. As a result, it is not possible to identify the number of hits to the action plan.</P>
      <P>A progress report on the implementation of the action plan was published on the website last July. Another progress report will be published within the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>To increase the visibility of initiatives being undertaken under the auspices of the action plan, a dedicated "eIreland" web page has been set up on the website. This page provides background information on the implementation of the action plan and reports progress on key initiatives and related issues.</P>
      <P>Regarding design principles for Government websites, the action plan provided for the adoption of service-wide guidelines on the content, format and presentation of websites and for an interdepartmental group to be established to deal with these issues. On foot of this action point, an interdepartmental group &ndash; Web Publications Group &ndash; was established to progress this. The group started work in June last and the guidelines were ready in October. I launched the guidelines last November at a seminar for webmasters in the Civil Service. The guiding principle set out in the guidelines is that websites should be customer friendly and designed with the needs of users in mind. Information should be up to date, relevant and easy to find. Other topics covered in the guidelines, include content, presentation of websites, promotion of user friendliness, accessibility guidelines, and Irish language and bi-lingualism. The guidelines are available on my Department's website.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 to 39, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The very strong endorsements by ICTU and IBEC of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness represent a very welcome step in the continuance of social partnership. These followed on from the equally welcome support given by farming and community and voluntary organisations. The way is now clear for the relevant Ministers and Departments to put in train the necessary arrangements for implementation of the many ambitious aims set out in the programme.</P>
      <P>Part 3 of Framework V of the programme sets out the overall monitoring mechanisms which will apply. These include quarterly meetings with the four pillars under the auspices of my Department, including one meeting each year to be chaired by myself. It is envisaged, at this stage, that three meetings will take place this year and the dates will be fixed shortly.</P>
      <P>In the area of social inclusion, the programme contains a very significant and comprehensive range of measures which are designed to address social exclusion and inequality urgently and effectively. As well as providing for a substantial increase in the resources allocated to social inclusion, amounting to £1.5 billion in 2003, the programme also sets out a process to ensure that everyone is involved in the development of the economy and society. The overall aim is to enhance the social, working and living environment of all citizens, especially those who through no fault of their own have not yet felt the material benefit of our economic success.</P>
      <P>Frameworks III and IV of the programme set out the range of measures to address poverty and social exclusion. I do not propose to go through the list as Deputies will no doubt be aware of the contents of these frameworks. Some of the key components include commitments on income adequacy, social and affordable housing, health care, tackling educational disadvantage and policies to promote equality and eliminate discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the particular provisions in paragraph 3.6 of the programme, the clarification relates especially to the identification of measures that will be speedily implemented as part of the targeted investment programme in disadvantaged areas, once selected. Having regard to the holistic approach which will be required to tackle the complex social issues in these areas, the scoping exercise to be done is necessary to ensure the <Col N="859" /> effective targeting and co-ordination of resources. It is not, as seems to be implied in the question, that the social inclusion measures in the national development plan lack clarity.</P>
    <P>The processes and criteria to be used in identifying the designated areas and delivering these measures will be pursued in the early period of the programme involving, as necessary, consultations with the social partners. The criteria will have regard to established precedent and good practice in the use of objective indicators of social disadvantage.</P>
    <P>With regard to the progressive introduction of social inclusion measures over the period of the programme, these will form part of the normal budgetary process over the next three years in consultation with the social partners and will be announced in that context. The social partners have already indicated priorities within the framework of the programme.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness covers budgets 2001 to 2003, inclusive, and provides that there will be increases in net take home pay, including pay increases, of up to 25% or more. The effects of budget 2000 will, in addition, produce significant increases in take home pay during the period of the programme but these are not part of the programme's terms. While a specific tax package is not set out in the programme, in light of experience under previous agreements and the prospects under the new programme, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions judged that the average taxpayer would receive increases of 10% in take-home pay arising from tax changes in the next three budgets. The Government responded that this judgment is reasonable, having regard to the considerations which I have just outlined.</P>

      <P>The current role of the National Centre for Partnership, as described in Partnership 2000, is the promotion of the partnership approach in both the public and private sectors through the organisation and facilitation of seminars, workshops and training programmes. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, recognising the progress which has been made, proposes a new approach signalled by a new title and role for the National Centre for Partnership and Performance. It is envisaged that the centre will work with IBEC and ICTU in supporting the deepening of partnership including through deliberation, consensus building and dissemination, monitoring, research and analysis and training and facilitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="860" /> This will enable the centre to contribute to a more effective tackling of the challenges of ensuring that enterprises, both public and private, are better equipped to adapt to change, including new forms of work organisation, underpinned by effective arrangements of lifelong learning.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to initiate discussions with IBEC and ICTU on the detailed arrangements now that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness has been ratified.</P>

      <P>The Revised Estimates for Public Services, which were published on March 22, set out the provisional outturn for 1999 expenditure and the estimate for 2000 expenditure for my Department.</P>
      <P>The provisional outturn of £19.8 million for 1999 shows that my Department was well within its overall budget for the year, with savings on a number of subheads. In the cases of millennium celebrations and the Moriarty tribunal, some expenditure was deferred to this year.</P>
      <P>With regard to the millennium, expenditure in 1999 was lower than was originally anticipated, mainly because there is a significant capital element involved. There is a longer lead time on capital projects and the millennium office ensures that grants are not made until satisfactory progress has been made on such projects. </P>
      <P>With regard to the Moriarty tribunal, the ongoing work of the tribunal has meant that the bulk of the legal costs, which will arise following completion of that work, have not yet arisen.</P>
      <P>The Revised Estimate for 2000 for my Department is £85.294 million. This is an increase of £48.908 million on the abridged estimate, which was published last November.</P>
      <P>The increase arises for the following reasons: the administrative budget has increased to reflect the carry-forward of savings which my Department made in 1999; subheads which include a pay component have been adjusted to take account of the increases agreed in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness; the allocation for grants under the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Act of 1988 has been increased by £150,000; the additional allocation represents expenditure deferred from 1999; the allocation for commemoration initiatives has increased by £70,000, to reflect an additional allocation made by the Minister for Finance in the context of the budget; the allocation for the millennium celebrations has been increased to £23.2 million &ndash; this represents the balance of the £30 million allocation made by the Government to cover the years 1999 and 2000; £300,000 has been allocated to a new subhead which will cover the administration and other costs of the independent commission of inquiry being undertaken by former Chief Justice Hamilton into the bombings in Dublin, Monaghan and Dundalk; £31 million has been allocated for multi-media developments, including the development of a new research and development institution, MediaLab Europe, and a multi-media village in Dublin and £10 million has been allocated for the initial development costs of Sports Campus Ireland.</P>

I expressed my appreciation to them for the keen interest which they have shown in the process and I thanked them for their ongoing support for our efforts.</P>
      <P>I met separately with Mr. Gerry Adams and with Mr. David Trimble on Friday, 31 March. The meetings were part of an intensification of engagement with the parties in order to overcome the current difficulties. In this regard, I will have further meetings this week with the Women's Coalition and the Progressive Unionist Party.</P>

This included presentations on e-commerce developments in Ireland and the related European MediaLab initiative. This project, which will be developed in partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is expected to contribute to improving Ireland's e-commerce capability, not least by increasing research and development activity in this area. The members of the board seemed to feel that this was an important and worthwhile initiative. </P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 111 together.</P>
      <P>Since this Government came to office in 1997 it has invested more than £60 million revenue in the development of our child care services including new child and family support services such as specialised fostering and early intervention projects to allow health boards to provide a range of appropriate interventions which will place specialised residential care in an appropriate context.</P>
      <P>This additional funding has allowed the health boards to increase the number of high support and special care places available from 17 in 1996 to a current total of 63 places which includes a number of individual high support packages.</P>
      <P>My Department has approved health board proposals to develop 110 additional high support and special care places nationally. As part of this programme of developments, seven additional places have already been created in the South Eastern Health Board and an additional eight place unit for girls has been opened and is being brought into operation on a phased basis in the Southern Health Board. These developments are included in the current total of 63 places.</P>
      <P> Plans are well advanced by the health boards to develop other additional places nationally as part of this programme. In the Eastern Regional Health Authority area, the construction of a purpose built special care unit providing 24 places at Ballydowd, Lucan, commenced in January 1999. It is anticipated that this unit will open in the summer of this year. The development of a 24 bed purpose built high support unit which will be built at Portrane is at tender stage. It is anticipated that this unit will be ready by autumn 2001.</P>
      <P>The Midland Health Board, the North Eastern Health Board, the North Western Health Board and the Western Health Board are co-operating to provide 12 high support places on a single campus. A site has been acquired and a project manager and a project group have been put in place to develop the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following places are being developed in the other boards: 20 high support places and a special care facility with five places for adolescent boys in the Mid-Western Health Board; three <Col N="864" /> high support places in the South Eastern Health Board; five high support places for boys and an additional two places in a special care facility for girls in the Southern Health Board. These places are due to become available during 2000 and 2001.</P>
    <P>The senior managers resource group comprising representatives from each of the health boards and my Department was established in October 1998 and it continues to meet regularly to monitor the overall development of these services.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the matters referred to by the Deputy Spring. While the recent judgment of the High Court concerning these matters is currently being considered by my Department in consultation with the Attorney General's office, the order of the court has not yet been perfected and I do not consider that it would be appropriate for me to make any detailed statement on the comments referred to by the Deputy. For the same reason, I do not propose to comment on the matters raised by Deputy Shortall.</P>
    <P>However, more generally, I do wish to make a number of points in relation to the speed at which the programme of development of high support and special care can be undertaken and put in place by health boards. Because of the public perception of these services and some opposition from local communities, I understand from the health boards that sourcing suitable sites or premises has been difficult. This also complicates and lengthens the planning process. The current economic climate makes the recruitment of staff difficult. Some health boards have had to recruit staff from outside the State.</P>
    <P>Against this background considerable progress has been made by health boards in putting this programme of developments in place. However, I am conscious of the need to ensure that all developments are put in place as soon as possible and in line with the target dates which have been set by the boards.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I announced recently that a new interim body on special residential services for children convicted of committing offences and children who have behavioural problems and are in need of special care and protection is being set up. This new body will advise the Ministers for Health and Children and Education and Science on co-ordinating the delivery of services and on the development and provision of educational and other programmes in health board special care facilities and in those facilities run by or under the aegis of the Department of Education and Science for offending children. The Special Residential Services Board provided for in Part 2 of the Children Bill, 1999, which is currently before the House, will take over the interim body's responsibilities when the Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>I should add that the Bill contains a number of important measures for non-offending children who are in need of special care or protection. These include Part 3 of the Bill, which empowers <Col N="865" /> health boards to apply to the courts for special care orders to detain non-offending children in need of special care or protection, and Part 2, which introduces the Family Welfare Conference on a statutory basis for the first time.</P>

      <P>The administration of the registration system, including the services and facilities provided at Joyce House is statutorily a matter for An tArd-Chláraitheoir &ndash; Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages and for superintendent registrars and registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the planned development of registration services. The special project to capture the records of births, deaths and marriages and associated indexes dating back to 1845 in an electronic format has been ongoing in Roscommon for some time. This is a major project involving the creation of an electronic data base of four million register pages, 20 million separate entries, and the scanning of the associated printed indexes to provide a machine readable index. When completed, this project will provide for a more efficient and flexible access to the archival records and the associated indexes and will provide potential for the development of a range of services, which would not be possible in a system reliant on printed indexes. This initiative will benefit all customers of the registration service. The estimated cost at completion is £6.225 million and the projected completion date is mid-2002.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware of the major ongoing review of the registration service involving my Department, the Department of Social Community and Family Affairs and the General Register Office. This review is examining the entire registration system including its structure and procedures, the legislation governing the system and the potential for the use of information technology in the registration of births, deaths and marriages to bring about the changes necessary to provide a modern and effective service. The estimated cost of this project is £7.3 million and the completion date is 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the interim a number of measures have been taken to maintain the services in the General Register Office. The Registration of Births and Deaths Acts 1863 to 1996 and the Marriages Acts of 1844 and 1863 provide, <i>inter alia, </i>that An t-Árd Chláraitheoir &ndash; Registrar General of Births Deaths and Marriages &ndash;  shall compile and make available an index to records of births <Col N="866" /> deaths and marriages held at his office. Persons are entitled to search these indexes, which are in printed and bound format, on the payment of the approved fees and to obtain certified copies of entries &ndash; certificates &ndash; identified form the index. In addition, persons engaged in family research who do not require certificates may purchase photocopies of the entries which contain all details in the register at a lesser cost. There are more than 600 such index books, which are maintained through a programme of repair and replacement.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that the growth in interest in family research has resulted in an increase in the number of users of this particular facility and an increase in the demand for copies of entries. It has been necessary to allocate resources to meet this additional demand through the mechanism of overtime and the redeployment of staff. Additional space was provided in the public reading room in Joyce House in July 1999 which significantly increased the number of seats available. A tender has been approved for additional improvements to the environment of the reading room and this work is due to commence shortly.</P>

      <P>At the outset, I extend my sympathy to the family of the person concerned. The provision of medical treatment in this case is the statutory responsibility of the Midland Health Board in the first instance. However, I understand from the board that the person concerned was seen in the casualty department of Portlaoise General Hospital on 5 December 1999.</P>
      <P>A written complaint, concerning the care of the deceased at Portlaoise hospital, was received by the board from the family of the deceased on 11 January 2000. The Midland Health Board's policy is to investigate fully any complaint received. Hospital personnel met as part of the process for responding to this complaint with representatives of the family on 21 February 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that meeting, all matters relating to diagnostic tests carried out in casualty prior to the deceased being discharged home were outlined in detail to the family. The family were also advised that if they had any other issues which they <Col N="867" /> wished to raise or have clarified, the hospital would facilitate a further meeting.</P>
    <P>Issues raised both in correspondence to the board and at that meeting are still being investigated by the hospital complaints officer. The chief executive officer of the Midland Health Board has undertaken to refer the details of this investigation to the working group which is currently reviewing the board's accident and emergency services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in relation to complementary and alternative medicine in Ireland is that currently it is not regulated. Practitioners are not employed within the public health services and the dealings of practitioners with their clients are regulated by civil law.</P>
      <P>A resolution was put before the European Commission in 1997 to consider carrying out a research study with a view to introducing regulation in the area. However, despite the comprehensiveness of this resolution, the EU Commission was unable to develop a harmonised policy regarding the regulation of alternative medicine, on a pan-European level. More recently, an EU Parliament resolution of June 1999 repeated this call for an European approach to non-conventional medicines and suggested that member states promote official recognition of alternative medicine in medical facilities and its use in hospitals.</P>
      <P>I am endeavouring currently to implement a system of statutory registration for allied health professionals which when introduced, will provide a registration &ldquo;model&rdquo;, addressing complex areas of concern &ndash; finance, protection of title, professional representation, fitness to practise, etc. &ndash; as well as the legal implications of establishing registration boards for each member of the profession to enforce these functions. This should indicate in broad terms the type of framework which might be put in place in respect of practitioners of alternative medicine.</P>
      <P>Some of the issues surrounding the current situation regarding alternative medicine have been raised at meetings I have had with a number of interests in the health services. I am conscious from these discussions of the complexities associated with any formal regulation process. My Department is engaged in preliminary discussions at European level to explore what options might be appropriate to progress this issue further at national level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, my Department's policy has been to encourage the various branches of alter<Col N="868" /> native complementary medicine to establish their own regulatory structure and to develop mechanisms to inform the general public about the availability of services from reputable therapists. Practitioners in this area are free to provide services to the public as long as they do not represent themselves as being registered medical practitioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62, 77 and 201 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply of 24 February 2000, there are two nursing degree courses on offer at the National University of Ireland, Galway: a one-academic year course and a part-time course that can be undertaken over 18 or 24 months. Following the recent Government meeting in Ballaghaderreen, the Taoiseach and my predecessor met a delegation of nursing students wishing to undertake the former course who are seeking to have their fees paid. In response to representations made to my predecessor by the students, an undertaking was given that the Department of Health and Children would investigate whether anything could be done for them.</P>
      <P>I should explain that the students concerned have successfully completed the three-year nursing diploma programme and are entitled to register as nurses with An Bord Altranais. While undertaking the diploma programme, their third-level fees were paid by the relevant health agency and they also received an annual non-means tested maintenance grant and other supports. The difficulty with the one-academic year degree course is that it is outside the scope of the funding arrangements agreed between my Department and the Department of Finance in respect of pre-registration nursing education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that in 1997, when the college authorities in Galway indicated to my Department that they were proposing to introduce the degree <Col N="869" /> course, my Department made it clear then that it would not be in a position to provide funding for the course and that the approach favoured by it was the provision of part-time degree courses which would be open to graduates from the diploma programme as well as existing registered nurses. I understand the Higher Education Authority expressed similar views to the university. Notwithstanding this, the university unilaterally proceeded to introduce the degree course.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that I am absolutely committed to working closely with An Bord Altranais and the nursing unions to implement the recommendations of the Commission on Nursing relating to nursing education, including the introduction of a new four year nursing degree programme. It is important to note that the Commission has recommended that no third-level institution should introduce a pre-registration nursing degree programme before the start of the academic year 2002-2003. Since a degree in nursing is not currently a requirement for registration as a nurse and subsequent employment, it is regarded as an optional post-registration qualification. Members of the nursing profession wishing to undertake a degree programme are, in the same way as any other public service workers, responsible for making their own arrangements, including the payment of course fees. It is, however, open to nurses who are employed by health agencies to apply to their employers for financial support towards the cost of undertaking such courses. Most health agencies have a continuing nursing education budget and funding from this budget is used to help nurses wishing to undertake further education.</P>
    <P>My Department has given further consideration to the position of the Galway students wishing to undertake the one-academic year degree course. Unfortunately, it is not possible to deal with these students in isolation. There are currently some 3,100 nursing students participating in the nursing diploma programmes at various third level institutions around the country, and it is expected that there will be an additional 1,500 students next autumn. It would be inequitable to meet the fees of the students who have enrolled for the degree course being provided by NUI Galway but not make similar provision for all the other nursing students.</P>
    <P>The concession being sought by the Galway students, if granted, would also give rise to a legitimate expectation on the part of registered nurses undertaking degree and other courses on a part-time basis that they should also have their fees paid in full. In this context, it is important to bear in mind that there are currently in the region of 1,000 nurses undertaking such courses.</P>
    <P>A further factor that must be taken into account is the importance of newly qualified nurses who have successfully completed the three-year nursing diploma programme entering the workforce as soon as they are registered. If students were to delay their entry by a further year in order to undertake a degree course on <Col N="870" /> a full-time basis, then this would exacerbate the difficulties that some hospitals are experiencing in recruiting nurses.</P>

      <P>The latest figures obtained from the hospital inpatient inquiry system, in which 61 public hospitals including acute, paediatric and maternity hospitals participate, indicate that a total of 11,039 patients died in hospital in 1998 and a post-mortem examination was performed on 12.9% of these patients. The system reports that 9,518 patients died in hospital in 1999 with a post-mortem examination being performed on 11.6% of these patients. It should be noted that figures for 1999 are provisional and that the hospital inpatient inquiry system does not differentiate between coroner and non-coroner post-mortem examinations.</P>
      <P>Although there is a marginal drop in the number of post-mortem examinations performed in 1999 compared to 1998, this does not constitute a dramatic decrease.</P>
      <P>In December last year, my Department issued instructions as to the need to obtain informed consent from next of kin in cases where hospitals performed non-coroner post-mortem examinations. There is some indication that, since then, there has been a reduction in the number of these type of post-mortem examinations at some hospitals and in the longer term this would be a cause for concern.</P>
      <P>I have already announced an inquiry into issues causing concern in this area and I have no doubt that this inquiry is necessary to allay public concerns and to assist in restoring public confidence in the necessity for such post-mortem examinations.</P>

      <P>In July of last year the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, launched the cardiovascular health strategy group report &ndash; Building Healthier Hearts. This report showed that our premature death rate from coronary heart disease in Ireland is twice the EU average. The report is very comprehensive and its recommendations are far reaching. In the implementation of these recommendations my Department has set a medium term objective to bring our levels of premature deaths from cardiovascular disease in line with the EU average at a minimum and a long-term objective of reducing our rates to those of the best performers in the EU. This strategy document, which contains 211 recommendations, is designed to achieve these goals in a systematic and sustained manner.</P>
      <P>Additional funding of £12 million has been made available in 2000 to commence the implementation process, and this funding will be the foundation for the implementation of some of the more immediate recommendations across the health services. It is expected that progress will be achieved this year in health promotion, primary care, pre-hospital care, hospital care, and in the area of audit and evaluation.</P>

      <P>I met the president, the registrar and a number of members of the Medical Council on Tuesday 28 March. Among other issues, I discussed the need to bring in a new Medical Practitioners Act. I have asked the council to present its own proposals for reform in this area. I hope to be in a position to produce the heads of a Bill by the middle of the year. At the meeting with the council it was agreed that a liaison arrangement would be established with the council to deal with reform of the Act and other issues. The first meeting with the council under the arrangement will take place on Monday next.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66, 80, 86, 89 and 214 together. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health boards maintain central databases of primary childhood immunisations and general practitioners keep detailed records of the individ<Col N="873" /> ual vaccinations which they administer. My Department's health promotion unit has produced a Child Health Record booklet, which is intended to help parents to keep a record of their child's development and health/illness events and as a record of the child's health history for health professionals. This booklet, or other parent-held vaccination records involving manual recording of vaccinations, is in use in several health board areas. However, the boards' experience has been that such an arrangement does not always operate effectively, as some parents do not bring the record with them when having their children immunised and so the record does not accurately indicate the immunisations which children have received.</P>
    <P>As a result of the identification of the need for a review of child health services in the health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, the chief executive officers of the health boards initiated a review of the services in question. One of the recommendations in the recently produced report, Best Health for Children, is that serious consideration should be given to the development of a parent held child health record, PCHR, in Ireland which would be used for all children. It was further recommended that prior to its introduction it should be subjected to a pilot phase, followed by a full evaluation.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the Mid-Western Health Board was chosen to carry out a demonstration project on the PCHR, an important component of which will be a timetable for and record of the vaccinations received by children. My Department has allocated £290,000 to the Mid-Western Health Board in 2000 for the first year of the project. The duration of the project is two and a half years and it is envisaged that, following its evaluation and refinement, it will be extended to the other health boards.</P>
    <P>The current level of uptake of the MMR vaccine leaves Ireland vulnerable to an epidemic of measles. The Eastern Regional Health Authority has indicated to my Department that up to 31 March there have been 315 cases of measles in its area of responsibility, compared to 27 cases in the region in the equivalent period in 1999. Almost 80% of the cases occurring since the beginning of the year have been in the Northern Area Health Board area of the ERHA.</P>
    <P>The situation is a cause for concern and the ERHA has indicated that a range of control measures have been implemented. A programme of MMR booster immunisations for the primary school population in the region is being initiated, concentrating first on schools where cases of measles have occurred. Other measures include the alerting of general practitioners to the situation and stressing to them the importance of children being offered measles immunisation; the promulgation of information through the media about the risks associated with measles infection and the advisability of immunisation; communication with parents whose children are not recorded as having received MMR vaccination <Col N="874" /> and alerting pre-school facilities to the occurrence of the outbreak. The situation is being monitored by the ERHA on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>While the current outbreak has so far been concentrated in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area, since MMR uptake in all health board regions is below 95%, there is a risk that outbreaks will occur elsewhere also. I would, therefore, like to take this opportunity strongly to urge parents in all areas of the country to ensure that their children receive the MMR vaccine, which is available free of charge from their family doctor. This will ensure that individual children and the population generally have maximum protection against measles, mumps and rubella.</P>
    <P>With regard to an alleged link between the MMR vaccine and the development of certain conditions or disorders, I would also like to reiterate that my Department has reviewed the available evidence and is satisfied that the MMR vaccine is a very safe and effective one. There is no evidence to support any link between the MMR vaccine and the subsequent development either of chronic inflammatory bowel disease or of autism and recently published studies in the UK and Europe have further confirmed this. Neither is there evidence that giving each of the component vaccines separately has any greater benefit than the combined vaccine.</P>
    <P>In view of the current primary immunisation uptake levels generally, my Department has asked the Office for Health Gain, which was established by the chief executive officers of the health boards to undertake health promotion activities, to consider the most appropriate means of heightening public awareness about the importance of childhood immunisation. The office will be developing a new campaign in this regard in the coming months.</P>
    <P>In addition to considering public information measures, my Department has recently written to all of the health boards, requesting them to make every effort to achieve the national targets in this programme this year, and to make particular efforts in relation to MMR. Among the issues which boards have been asked to address are the need to undertake an analysis of the reasons for the unsatisfactory level of uptake, to ensure that immunisation databases are regularly validated, to address low uptake in the traveller population and to follow up unimmunised children. Boards have been asked to make every effort to devise strategies tailored to local needs, employing innovative approaches if considered necessary, in order to achieve significant improvements in uptake.</P>

      <Quest>the way in which he will pilot four different methods of primary care services to explore the way in which to move towards a 24-hour seven-day primary care service; the location of these pilot schemes; the way in which they will be evaluated; the way in which social partners will be consulted on the evaluation; and if he will make a statement on the Government commitment on this matter in paragraph 3.10.19 of Framework III of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to developing the health services as is evident from the increasing levels of funding being provided. The provision in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness on developing 24 hour seven day primary health care models is a further indication of that commitment and also reflects the value attached to partnership in achieving progress in this area.</P>
      <P>Consistent with the proper implementation of such a significant project, my Department will approach the implementation in consultation and conjunction with the health boards and ERHA with a view to establishing the precise models to be utilised and their individual locations.</P>
      <P>I should add, however, that I was already mindful of the need to develop a 24 hour primary healthcare service which would meet the requirements of the public for appropriate primary care and reduce demand on A&amp;E hospital services. In that regard, my Department is supporting a number of initiatives aimed at providing an out-of-hours general practice service, most notably DUBDOC in the Dublin area and CAREDOC in the Carlow-Kilkenny area. Later this year, a region wide out of hours general practice service will commence in the North Eastern Health Board area. Those initiatives are likely to provide the base for the extension of the general practice arrangements into a wider and more inclusive primary care service as envisaged in the programme.</P>
      <P>All pilots projects are subject to proper monitoring and evaluation in order to ascertain their efficiency and effectiveness and the precise nature of the pilot project frequently indicates the best monitoring and evaluation format to be adopted for that particular pilot model. When I have concluded my consultations with the health boards on the 24 hour primary care pilots to be established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness I will determine the models to be used and establish, at that time, how best the social partners can be involved in their monitoring and evaluation.</P>

      <P>Early in 1999, the chief executive of the Eastern Health Board set up a multidisciplinary group to identify gaps in services for homeless people and to make recommendations for a comprehensive co-ordinated service. The group formulated a plan which constituted its submission to the Cross-Departmental Team on Homelesseness set up by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion. The plan was adopted as policy by the Eastern Health Board and funding was sought from my Department to enable it to be implemented. The Deputy will be glad to know that £0.7 million revenue funding was allocated to the Eastern Health Board by my Department this year to enable the board to begin implementation of the plan.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 212 together.</P>
      <P>The Structures Working Group met five times between July and December 1998 &ndash; on 29 July 1998, 8 September 1998, 13 October 1998, 12 November 1998, and 15 December 1998. The organisations represented on the structures group are also represented on the Medical Manpower Forum. The structures group considered a number of reports which identified issues relating to the provision of hospital services and the organisation of the medical workforce. The structures group agreed &ldquo;that there should be a significant increase in consultant numbers. Such an increase will enable significant changes in work practices in particular an increased complement of consultants working shift systems&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this time the forum had begun to focus on issues similar to those being addressed by the structures group and at the December meeting of the Structures Working Group the Department of Health and Children, which provided secretariat support to the forum, indicated its intention to produce a paper on these issues for submission to the Medical Manpower Forum in the <Col N="877" /> new year. On 15 January 1999 the secretariat wrote to the members of the Structures Working Group, informing them that further meetings of the group were to be postponed until after the Department's paper was considered by the forum. The forum continued to address the fundamental issues contained in this paper over its following meetings through 1999 and has not yet come to a final determination on them. Should the forum decide to refer any matters back to the structures group this could still be done but, as the process has now developed this is unlikely.</P>
    <P>The Medical Manpower Forum is now at an advanced stage in agreeing its first report and has taken account of the deliberations and work of the structures group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71, 191, 192 and 194 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most comprehensive survey on nursing vacancies was carried out by the health service employers agency (HSEA) and related to thepos<Col N="878" /> ition at 30 September, 1999. It found there were 1,180.46 vacancies in gross terms but, when adjustments are made for the utilisation of agency nurses and overtime working, the net figure is 428.16.</P>
    <P>The results confirmed again that there is not a nation-wide problem regarding the availability of nurses and that difficulties largely relate to the greater Dublin area. Indications are that the level of applicants for nursing posts outside the Dublin area far exceeds the number of positions available.</P>
    <P>While some nurses have always moved from Dublin to other parts of the country, investment in hospitals and the development of regional specialities over recent years have increased demand for nurses outside the Dublin area. Within Dublin, issues such as housing costs, traffic problems and lack of car parking facilities have been cited as disincentives to the recruitment and retention of nurses. However, these issues are not unique to nurses or to the health service.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that nurse recruitment is carried out on an ongoing basis in most hospitals, and the level of vacancies fluctuates accordingly. At any given time, significant numbers of nurses would be in the process of being appointed by employers or moving from one employment to another. This has been borne out in a recent survey carried out by the HSEA of nursing vacancies in the Dublin area, at March 2000, which indicates that while the overall number of vacancies has increased, St. James's Hospital, Beaumont Hospital and the Mater Hospital reported improvements in their nursing levels.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to introduce an additional quality of working life payment for nurses working in Dublin. It would not be possible to ring-fence such a payment to nurses. The Irish Nurses Organisation rejected the concept of a &ldquo;Dublin weighting&rdquo; at its 1999 annual conference. </P>
    <P>While the recruitment and retention of nurses is primarily a matter for individual employers, initiatives have been taken or are being progressed with a view to stabilising the situation and, where possible, improving it. These initiatives include the following:</P>
    <P>(1) New arrangements have been introduced to give better starting pay to nurses taking up employment by giving full recognition for previous experience at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>(2) A significantly improved regime of allowances in respect of nurses working in specialised areas such as operating theatres and intensive care units has been introduced.</P>
    <P>(3) Discussions with the nursing unions are continuing in relation to the introduction of more flexible working arrangements for nursing staff.</P>
    <P>(4) Standardised overtime working arrangements have been introduced following agreement with the nursing unions.</P>
    <P>(5) Health service employers have been asked to examine the possibilities in relation to the <Col N="879" /> introduction of term time working as an option for staff with family commitments.</P>
    <P>(6) Some 11 hospitals around the country provided &ldquo;back to nursing&rdquo; courses in 1999 for nurses wishing to return to the workforce. Some 304 places were available. The expansion of these courses is another factor in maximising the available nursing workforce.</P>
    <P>(7) During 1999/2000 sixteen new post-registration programmes have been developed. This year there will be 660 places on post-registration courses in specialised areas of clinical practice. In response to an identified need, eleven of the sixteen new programmes will be located outside the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>(8) An anti-bullying policy document, prepared by the HSEA and agreed with the nursing unions, was published in December 1999 and has been widely promoted within the service.</P>
    <P>(9) The promotional structure within nursing, including the introduction of a clinical career pathway, is being significantly improved on foot of the recommendations of the Commission on Nursing.</P>
    <P>(10) A &ldquo;Study of the Nursing and Midwifery Resource&rdquo; by the Nursing Policy Division of the Department of Health and Children commenced in 1998 with the primary purpose of forecasting future nursing and midwifery resource needs. Following on from this, a national study on turnover in nursing and midwifery has been commissioned by the Department through the Health Research Board and awarded to the Department of Nursing Studies, NUI, Cork;</P>
    <P>(11) On-going discussions continue with the relevant Departments and with An Bord Altranais regarding entry visas/work permits for nurses recruited from outside the European Union or European economic area. These discussions are aimed at ensuring that there are no unnecessary barriers to entry. I am pleased to report that agreement has been reached on a procedure for fast-tracking immigration clearances and work permits for non-E.U. nurses.</P>
    <P>In this context, data maintained by An Bord Altranais indicates that in recent years there has been a net inflow of nurses to Ireland. Provisional inflow figures for 1999 show a dramatic increase to 3,171 in the number of nurses seeking to register here. This pattern has continued during the first three months of this year.</P>
    <P>Employers have stepped-up their recruitment from abroad with significant success. For example, the Mater Hospital, Dublin has just finalised arrangements for the recruitment of 75 qualified nurses from the Philippines in addition to on-going recruitment within Ireland.</P>
    <P>Further funding totalling £400,000 has been made available to the various schools of nursing throughout the country to enable them undertake local marketing campaigns aimed at promoting nursing as a career.</P>
    <P>The number of applicants for nurse training places this year has not declined by 1,000 over last <Col N="880" /> year. The newspaper which published a report to that effect subsequently published a retraction. More than 5,000 applications have been received by the Nursing Career Centre this year. This means that there are more than three applicants for every available training place. This is most encouraging bearing in mind that the total number of training places is being increased by 25% over last year and the reduction in the volume of applicants for public service positions generally.</P>
    <P>(13) The annual maintenance grant for nursing students, which is not subject to a means test, has been increased to £3,325 with effect from 1 April 2000. The grant now is almost double the maximum grant for which other third level students may qualify.</P>
    <P>In addition, allowances for external clinical placements, books and uniforms are also being increased.</P>
    <P>(14) The range of Leaving Certificate subjects that may be presented by an applicant for admission to the Nursing Diploma Programme has been expanded.</P>
    <P>(15) The requirement to have a foreign language in the leaving certificate has been removed.</P>
    <P>These initiatives represent a very significant effort on the part of my Department to improve the situation. In the longer term, it is hoped that the substantial increase in the number of student places will provide enough registered nurses to fill all vacancies.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Durkan's questions, the total number of nurses employed in the public health service on 31 December, 1998 was 31,266, 26,695 whole-time equivalents. This compares with 51,212 nurses on the active register of An Bord Altranais in March, 2000. The Department's annual personnel census is the principal source of data on employment levels among nurses. The most recent census available is 31 December, 1998 and shows the number of nurses employed in the greater Dublin area and Kildare is 10,366.72 whole time equivalents.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to be definitive as to the total nursing complement required to provide adequate staffing for hospitals. The Commission on Nursing recommended that the Department of Health and Children, health service providers and nursing organisations examine the development of appropriate systems to determine nursing staffing levels. The need to address skill mix issues was also highlighted in the Commission on Nursing report. Both of these recommendations are included in the priority action plan agreed with the Nursing Alliance as part of the settlement of the nurses' strike. It has been agreed that these issues will be addressed by a joint committee representative of nursing unions and health service employers. This committee is in the process of being established.</P>
    <P>The medical staffing of hospitals is currently being addressed by the Medical Manpower Forum. With particular regard to non-consultant hospital doctors the forum is seeking to redress the imbalance between career posts and training <Col N="881" /> posts, the need to improve postgraduate medical training to keep more Irish medical graduates in the country, and the need to look at the position of women in medicine in Ireland with a view to redressing the number who leave medicine.</P>
    <P>The Medical Manpower Forum is due to publish its first report shortly.</P>

      <P>The Health Promotion Unit of my Department has run a very successful Annual National Healthy Eating Campaign since 1995. This year, £250,000 has been allocated for the year long campaign which will commence with Healthy Eating Week &ndash; 7-13 May. The theme of this year's campaign is Help your heart &ndash; Go for Low Fat Healthy Eating and will target the lower socio-economic groups in society.</P>
      <P>The Health Promotion Unit is also involved in a number of developments in the area of child nutrition. A nutrition education at primary schools (NEAPS) programme has been developed by the Unit in conjunction with the Department of Education and Science and the North Western Health Board. This programme, which is aimed at 3rd and 4th class levels in primary school, is available for distribution to all primary schools through the health boards. The aim of the programme is to improve the level of nutritional knowledge in children and to develop the skills necessary to enable them to use that knowledge to implement change with respect to their own wellbeing. An evaluation of the NEAPS programme has found it to be very successful.</P>
      <P>The Health Promotion Unit, in conjunction with the Eastern Health Board, has developed a peer led nutrition education project among low income groups called &ldquo;Food &amp; Health&rdquo;. The programme uses a peer-led community development approach and is aimed at low income women who are primarily responsible for food shopping and cooking within the home. Following evaluation of the project it is planned to make the programme available nationally.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 210 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, substantial developments have taken place throughout the country in recent years in the care and treatment of patients with cancer. Since the launch in November 1996 of the National Cancer Strategy and the action plan for its implementation in March 1997, some £41 million of dedicated funding has been allocated to develop cancer services nationally. Significant developments have taken place in the area of specialist consultant appointments with appointments being made in the areas of medical oncology, haematology, histopathology and palliative care. The National Breast Screening Programme has commenced and the pilot cervical screening programme is at an advanced stage of development. I intend to build on the developments in the area of cancer treatment and care which have been achieved to date. In this context, the National Cancer Forum, established by one of my predecessors, Deputy Noonan, has carried out a review of symptomatic breast cancer services throughout the country. I understand the review is complete and I am scheduled to meet the National Cancer Forum tomorrow when I expect to receive the report of this specialist expert group. Until then, I am not in a position to speculate on any aspect of the report.</P>

      <P>Following its publication in September 1999, the Green Paper on Abortion was referred to the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution for consideration. The question of whether there should be a further referendum and, if so, its nature, are matters which the committee is considering in the course of its work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the De Borda Institute has made a number of submissions to the All-Party Oireachtas Committee. The institute promotes inclusive voting procedures and believes that the democratic process should facilitate the identification, from a broad range of options, of that policy proposal which has the highest average preference score of every vote. It sees the Borda preferendum as the relevant voting procedure to achieve that. The institute has, among its sub<Col N="883" /> missions, made one that proposes a non-binding multi-option Borda preferendum vote prior to any binding two-option referendum, in the event of a referendum on abortion. The All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution will examine this in its consideration of the abortion issue.</P>
    <P>The Government will await the outcome of the committee's deliberations before further considering the issues discussed in the Green Paper.</P>

      <P>There are no proposals by the Medical Manpower Forum to establish a sub-consultant grade.

Accordingly, some further work is required in order to achieve a consensus.</P>

      <P>I am currently reviewing progress to date in the implementation of the wide-ranging measures of a short, medium and longer-term nature recommended in that report. In attaching a serious priority to tackling lengthy waiting lists and times, I believe that there are a number of practical steps that can be taken to accelerate progress, including achieving more flexible use of available capacity and closer collaborative arrangements between the different parts of the system. Taken together with longer-term measures associated with the investment of resources available under the national development plan, my aim is to achieve real progress in addressing the underlying causes of poor accessibility to certain services.

    <P>Second, there is an increased consumer awareness of food poisoning which is due to the focused campaigns carried out by public health departments of the health boards, the food unit and the health promotion unit of my Department and by the FSAI.</P>
    <P>Third, a change in the lifestyle of Irish consumers has led to an increase in the market for convenience foods which has resulted in the rapid expansion of fast food outlets. Some staff working in this area are untrained and inexperienced in food hygiene practices. While the responsibility for good hygiene practices rests firmly on the owners of these food businesses it is imperative that employees know the causes of food poisoning and what they must do to prevent it.</P>
    <P>The FSAI, which was in existence on a non-statutory basis since 1997, was formally established by this Government in January 1999. In July last year the FSAI took over responsibility for the enforcement of all food safety legislation which, prior to that date, had been the responsibility of a range of State agencies. The primary function of the FSAI is to ensure that food produced or marketed in Ireland meets the highest standards of food safety and hygiene. The FSAI also has a statutory function to foster at all stages of food production, from primary production through to final use by the consumer, the establishment and maintenance of high standards of food hygiene and safety. In this context, it places great emphasis on the creation of a culture of food safety in Ireland. In this regard, we must be conscious that the responsibility for food safety lies at all levels, producer, retailer and consumer. While it is not possible to completely prevent food poisoning, the work of the FSAI should help to minimise its incidence in the future by developing a food safety culture and I am satisfied with its work to date.</P>

      <P>The fluoridation of the public piped water supplies is an important programme for the protec<Col N="888" /> tion of dental health and is subject to the provisions of the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960, and various regulations made under the Act. The safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation as a public health measure has been evaluated frequently by the World Health Organisation and other reputable authorities, such as the Health Research Council of the United States, and concerns about adverse health effects have not been substantiated. In October 1999, The Faculty of Public Health Medicine of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland issued a report which endorsed the safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation. All of the reputable scientific evidence confirms the safety of fluoride when it is available in public piped water supplies at the optimal levels. These levels are the same as those required under the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960. A survey of adult dental health carried out in 1991 found no significant difference in regard to general health status between fluoridated and non-fluoridated areas. The Eastern Regional Health Authority, on behalf of the Department of Health and Children and the eight regional health boards, has awarded a contract jointly to Trinity College, Dublin and University College, Cork, to advise health boards on an up-to-date status report on all aspects relating to fluoride use including water fluoridation. When advice and recommendations are available from these bodies appropriate consultation will take place to inform future policy on fluoride use for this country. </P>

      <P>At a meeting between officials of the Department and the chairman and director of the National Disease Surveillance Centre on 12 November 1999, it was explained that, in line with the Government's commitment to decentralisation, it was the Minister's intention to relocate the centre outside Dublin to the midland region. It was also pointed out that the high cost of accommodation in the Dublin area was a factor in his thinking. A further meeting on this issue took place between the Department and representatives of the National Disease Surveillance Centre on 30 November 1999.</P>

      <P>The Office for National Statistics, London, has <Col N="890" /> indicated to my Department that statistics on the number of abortions carried out in the final quarter of 1999 will not be available until the end of May 2000. Provisional figures for the period from 1 January to 30 September 1999 indicate that 4,621 women who gave Irish addresses had abortions in England and Wales in that period. This figure is equivalent to 11.3% of the provisional number (40,813) of births in Ireland in the same period. The comparable figures for the same period in the previous two years are 4,006 in 1997 and 4,473 in 1998, equivalent to 9.8% and 10.9%, respectively, of births in the nine month period concerned.</P>
      <P>When the Green Paper on Abortion was published in September 1999, the Government indicated that it had decided to prepare a programme of measures which it is hoped will address many of the issues which have been identified as contributing to the number of Irish women who have abortions in Britain each year. Additional funding of £1 million in 1999 and a further £1.6 million in 2000 has been provided to the health boards to enable them to fund measures aimed at addressing the issue of unwanted pregnancy. Health boards are undertaking a range of initiatives in this area. The type of issues on which boards are being asked to concentrate when developing policy include the provision of services which are accessible to young people and which meet their needs in relation to issues such as confidentiality and hours of operation. Educational-promotional activities should focus on such issues as the need for responsible sexual behaviour of young people at risk, increased awareness of pregnancy counselling services and the cultivation of more responsible attitudes to alcohol, with particular regard to alcohol and sexual activity. </P>
      <P>Where pregnancy counselling services are supported, boards have been asked to ensure that these are available on a drop-in basis without any waiting period and that a choice of service provider is available. Steps to increase women's awareness of post-abortion counselling and of the need for medical check-ups are also being considered. Such check-ups also provide an opportunity for women to obtain advice on appropriate contraception for the future and thereby reduce the incidence of further unwanted pregnancies.</P>
      <P>In addition to measures which are being developed by health boards, my Department is at present planning a public awareness campaign which will aim to encourage sexually active young people to be responsible in their attitudes to relationships and to inform and educate them about the issues involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of cases of bacterial meningitis, including meningococcal septicaemia, notified to my Department in each of the past five years is as follows: 1995, 382; 1996, 410; 1997, 508; 1998, 491; 1999, 614 (provisional)</P>
      <P>The age-standardised incidence of laboratory-confirmed bacterial meningitis is Ireland is the highest in Europe, at 7.1 cases per 100,000 population in 1997-8. The European average is 1.5 cases per 100,000. By way of comparison, the age-standardised incidence per 100,000 in other EU countries, where available, is as follows:Austria, 1.2; Belgium, 2.3; England &amp; Wales, 3.2 (estimated); France, 0.6; Germany, 0.5; Greece, 1.0; Netherlands, 3.3; Northern Ireland, 3.1; Scotland, 5.5; Spain, 1.4.</P>
      <P>My Department has funded the establishment of the Meningococcal Reference Laboratory at the Children's Hospital, Temple Street. The diagnostic service provided by this laboratory, using PCR techniques, has had a significant impact on case ascertainment and confirmation of the diagnosis of invasive meningococcal disease. As a significant proportion of meningitis cases in Ireland are now laboratory-confirmed using PCR, which is not the case in all countries, the incidence figures for other countries may understate their position.</P>
      <P>Given the high incidence of meningitis in Ireland, a range of measures has been adopted in order to ensure that the best systems are in place for the surveillance, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of this disease. The working group on bacterial meningitis, which was established in 1996 under the chairmanship of my Department's Deputy Chief Medical Officer and which published reports in 1997 and 1999, includes among its members a range of medical experts who are closely involved in dealing with meningococcal disease in Ireland. The group has prepared and issued detailed advice on the surveillance, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of meningitis and it continues to monitor developments, including the outcome of research, at national and international level, so as to ensure that its advice is in line with best practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years surveillance systems in relation to meningitis have been significantly improved. Health boards are required to notify details of cases to my Department within 24 hours of them occurring and these arrangements are operating effectively. The development of the National Disease Surveillance Centre, which was established in 1998, will enable a much improved level of surveillance of infectious disease in Ireland and the centre will assist in the continued development of strategies to control communicable diseases, including meningitis. The centre has already developed a meningococcal disease database, <Col N="892" /> which will enable the pattern of this disease to be analysed in detail.</P>
    <P>Planning is under way for the introduction of a vaccine to protect against Group C meningitis, which represents approximately 40% of meningitis cases in Ireland. This will be a major development in relation to the prevention of meningitis, involving the incorporation of the vaccine into the primary childhood immunisation programme and also a phased catch-up programme for older children and young people up to 22 years of age. At my Department's request, a national group has been established by the health board chief executive officers to co-ordinate the process and project teams have been set up at health board level to develop detailed plans for the introduction and delivery of the vaccine.</P>
    <P>Before being introduced into use, the vaccine must be licensed in Ireland. The statutory licensing agency is the Irish Medicines Board and it must satisfy itself as to the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine before a licence can be granted.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that a Group C vaccine will be licensed in Ireland during the summer of this year. The Government has provided £25 million in the current year for the Group C meningitis vaccination programme, which will begin after the vaccine has been licensed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 101 together.</P>
      <P>When the Women and Crisis Pregnancy report was published in 1998 the view of my predecessor as Minister was that it would not have been appropriate to publish a major report containing recommendations while the consultation process leading to the preparation of the Green Paper on abortion was under way. The report as published did not contain recommendations but did contain detailed findings and conclusions, based on the research undertaken. The research team which had undertaken the study was invited to make a submission to the interdepartmental working group which was preparing the Green Paper, and such a submission was made. Along with other submissions received, this was taken into account in the drafting of the Green Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="893" /> The Green Paper on abortion contained a detailed discussion of the social context of abortion as it involves Irish women and identified a range of issues regarding the availability of family planning and related services as well as the attitudes of young people to sexual behaviour, which impact on the incidence of unplanned and unwanted pregnancy.</P>
    <P>Additional funding of £1 million in 1999 and a further £1.6 million in 2000 has been provided to the health boards to enable them to fund measures aimed at addressing the issue of unwanted pregnancy. Health boards are undertaking a range of initiatives in this area. The type of issues on which boards are being asked to concentrate when developing policy include the provision of services which are accessible to young people and which meet their needs in relation to issues such as confidentiality and hours of operation. Educational-promotional activities should focus on such issues as the need for responsible sexual behaviour of young people at risk, increased awareness of pregnancy counselling services and the cultivation of more responsible attitudes to alcohol, with particular regard to alcohol and sexual activity. </P>
    <P>Where pregnancy counselling services are supported, boards have been asked to ensure that these are available on a drop-in basis without any waiting period and that a choice of service provider is available. Steps to increase women's awareness of post-abortion counselling and of the need for medical check-ups are also being considered. Such check-ups also provide an opportunity for women to obtain advice on appropriate contraception for the future and thereby reduce the incidence of further unwanted pregnancies.</P>
    <P>In addition to measures which are being developed by health boards, my Department is at present planning a public awareness campaign which will aim to encourage sexually active young people to be responsible in their attitudes to relationships and to inform and educate them about the issues involved.</P>

    <P>The principal factors identified by the health boards as militating against a higher uptake rate are the lack of awareness among some parents as <Col N="895" /> to the potential dangers of infectious diseases and some parental concern about the safety of vaccines.</P>
    <P>In view of the generally unsatisfactory primary immunisation uptake, my Department has asked the office for health gain, which was established by the chief executive officers of the health boards to undertake health promotion activities, to consider the most appropriate means of heightening public awareness about the importance of childhood immunisation. The office will be developing a new campaign in this regard in the coming months.</P>
    <P>With regard to parental concerns about vaccine safety, I would like to stress that the vaccines used in the primary childhood immunisation programme are safe and effective. They are subject to rigorous testing before being licensed for use and there is ongoing monitoring after licensing. In particular, my Department has reviewed the available evidence concerning the MMR vaccine and is satisfied that this vaccine is very safe and effective. There is no evidence to support any link between the MMR vaccine and the subsequent development either of chronic inflammatory bowel disease or of autism and recently published studies in the UK and Europe have further confirmed this. Neither is there evidence that giving each of the component vaccines separately has any greater benefit than the combined vaccine.</P>
    <P>In addition to considering public information measures, my Department has recently written to all of the health boards, requesting them to make every effort to achieve the national targets in this programme this year, and to make particular efforts in relation to MMR. Among the issues which boards have been asked to address are the need to undertake an analysis of the reasons for the unsatisfactory level of uptake, to ensure that immunisation databases are regularly validated, to address low uptake in the traveller population and to follow up unimmunised children. Boards have been asked to make every effort to devise strategies tailored to local needs, employing innovative approaches if considered necessary, in order to achieve significant improvements in uptake.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 222 together.</P>
      <P>The replacement of medical equipment is a matter, in the first instance, for the hospital concerned, in conjunction with the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>
      <P>I am assured by the management of the Coombe Women's Hospital that all infant incubators currently in use in the hospital comply with their manufacturers' safety and performance specifications and, therefore, are safe and perform satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>As part of an ongoing programme to enable hospitals generally to update their medical equipment my Department has provided specific funding for this purpose in each hospital's letter of determination since 1998. The Deputy will appreciate that it is the responsibility of each hospital, including the Coombe Women's Hospital, to determine its priority equipping needs and to ensure that equipment is replaced as required in accordance with these needs.</P>
      <P>The Coombe Women's Hospital was allocated capital funding of £160,000, £170,000 and £170,000 in 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively, towards the cost of replacing medical equipment and for minor capital works under this programme. The hospital has submitted a comprehensive list of replacement equipment proposals to the ERHA and has identified a number of incubators as a priority for replacement.</P>
      <P>The ERHA is currently assessing all of the hospital's proposals in line with regional care priorities and in the context of the National Development Programme. It is expected to conclude its assessment shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The acute hospital system delivers a service that is ever growing in terms of its volume and complexity. The rapid pace of medical and technological change, growing expectations and an increasingly important focus on quality are notable features of the environment in which this service is delivered. More people are benefiting from services in our acute hospital system now than ever before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very aware that the issue of access to these services for those who are not deemed to be an emergency or in immediate need of care remains a focus of dissatisfaction. The length of time that <Col N="897" /> many people have to wait for access to elective procedures in many specialties is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The multi-faceted nature of the issue of waiting lists was considered by the expert review group which reported to my predecessor in 1998. I am currently reviewing progress to date in the implementation of the wide-ranging measures of a short, medium and longer-term nature recommended in that report. In attaching a serious priority to tackling lengthy waiting lists and times, I believe that there are a number of practical steps that can be taken to accelerate progress, including achieving more flexible use of available capacity and closer collaborative arrangements between the different parts of the system. In this context, a review of bed capacity is currently under way having regard to the trend in demands for health services in recent years. Taken together with longer term measures associated with the investment of resources available under the national development plan, my aim is to achieve real progress in addressing the underlying causes of poor accessibility to certain services. I intend to address these issues and am confident of achieving real progress in the area of waiting lists and more importantly waiting times.</P>

      <Quest>the number of adults and children on waiting lists for cardiac operations; if his attention has been drawn to the concern expressed (details supplied) that seriously ill people on waiting lists in need of heart surgery are dying; the steps, if any, he is taking to deal with this situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Adult cardiac by-pass surgery in the public health sector is currently carried out at three centres, the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Dublin, Cork University Hospital and since September 1998, St James's Hospital, Dublin. Paediatric cardiac surgery is carried out at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin.</P>
      <P>Public patient waiting list statistics are collected by hospitals and furnished to my Department on a quarterly basis. I can confirm that at the end of December 1999, the most recent period for which information is available, there was a total of 816 adults awaiting cardiac surgery over 12 months and 298 waiting for three to 12 months. There was a total of 67 children awaiting cardiac surgery over six months, and 21 waiting for three to six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1998, I allocated funding of £2.3 million under the Cardiac Surgery Waiting List Initiative, with the specific aim of reducing the national cardiac surgery waiting list for adults and children. In 1999, I made provision for the allocation of £4 million under the Cardiac Surgery Waiting List Initiative and a further £4 million will be made available in 2000. I am confident that this funding <Col N="898" /> will build on previous years' success in reducing the total number of adults and children on the waiting list. The Cardiac Surgery Waiting List Initiative has had, and will continue to have, a positive impact on the public cardiac waiting list. The total number of public patients awaiting cardiac surgery has reduced from 1619 in September 1997 to 1202 in December 1999, this represents a reduction of 25%.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health and Children, my priority is to address the existing cardiac surgery waiting lists and the ultimate objective is to achieve an average six month waiting period for those on the lists. I am confident that the development of additional adult public cardiac surgery facilities at St. James's Hospital, Dublin, and the proposed new cardiac surgery developments at University College Hospital, Galway, will help reduce the waiting lists which exist at present. Target activity levels are in the region of 450 procedures annually at St. James's Hospital and 300 procedures at UCHG. This additional activity will increase existing adult public cardiac surgery capacity by over 50%. I am also developing additional children's cardiac surgery capacity at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin in association with the National Cardiac Unit, Mater Hospital to provide for up to an additional 100 cardiac procedures for children. This additional activity will increase existing paediatric cardiac surgery capacity by up to 40%.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 and 203 together.</P>

      <P>You will be aware that my predecessor, Deputy Cowen, announced on budget day last year that additional funding would be made available from 1 January 2000 to support the application of the domiciliary care allowance scheme, introduced by way of Circular No. 24/73 dated 23 September 1973 to eligible children under two years of age.</P>
      <P>This modification to the scheme was confined to the age eligibility criterion only. Other criteria, as outlined in Circular No. 24/73, have not been altered. It should be noted that the circular points out, <i>inter alia</i>, that:</P>
      <P>The fact that a severe handicap is present does not automatically justify the payment of an allowance .  It is not intended that the Scheme should apply to short-term illnesses or disabilities &ndash; the handicap must be present at the time of application, have been present for at least six months prior to that date, and be likely to continue to last for at least a year. It is not visualised that any particular condition should be debarred from consideration &ndash; each case can be considered on its merits.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate the demanding role facing parents and guardians of children of all ages with a disability. Officials of my Department are in consultation with the health board chief executive officers and their senior area medical officers about the issues raised by the Deputies. The process has not yet reached a conclusion.</P>

    <P>The overall incidence of AIDS is decreasing. However, national figures are small so we must be careful not to make assumptions based on figures in any given year. Figures indicate that there is a general downward trend in relation to the number of cases of AIDS, which is at least partly due to the use of effective antiretroviral treatments. These treatments slow down the progression of HIV, hence people infected with HIV do not develop AIDS as quickly as before. However, in some cases patients do not respond to the new treatment regimes and therefore we can expect that a number of new cases of AIDS are likely to occur each year.</P>
    <P>We must not become complacent about this condition and my Department will continue to give priority to HIV and AIDS through initiatives aimed at preventing people contracting HIV in the first instance. The National AIDS Strategy Committee has undertaken a review of all aspects of HIV-AIDS, and its report with recommendations for action will be published in the coming months.</P>

      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that I am acutely aware the life expectancy gap for Irish people aged over 65 is widening when compared to our European counterparts. This fact was highlighted in both the report of the cardiovascular health strategy group &ndash;<i>Building Healthier Hearts</i> 1999 and in the Annual Report of the Chief Medical Officer 1999.</P>
      <P>Cancer, cardiovascular diseases and accidents are the major causes of premature death in Ireland.

      <P>When the cardiovascular health strategy was launched in July of last year, my Department set a medium term objective &ndash; to bring our levels of premature deaths from cardiovascular disease in line with the EU average at a minimum. Our longer-term objective is to reduce our rates to those of the best performers in the EU. At age 65, Ireland has the lowest life expectancy in the EU with the single biggest contributor being heart disease. There is room for major improvements before we attain the average life expectancy enjoyed by our European neighbours. Our overall goal is to achieve life expectancy which at a minimum compares with the EU average. The challenge now is to implement the recommendations of the cardiovascular health strategy group by developing structures and mechanisms which promote cardiovascular health, reduce inequalities, ensure a high quality of service provision and reduce variations in access to and quality of services.</P>
      <P>A sum of £12 million has been provided to commence the implementation process in 2000. I am confident that over the coming years the necessary funding will be provided to allow us to achieve our goals particularly in relation to life expectancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although there is no specific research in relation to the life expectancy for people aged <Col N="902" /> over 65, the Health Research Board is funding a five year research project, which commenced in late 1999, on the health status and health gain of disadvantaged groups. Its area of work includes an assessment of the differences in mortality among socio-economic groups and social classes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The efficacy of the child care services is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Under section 8 of the Child Care Act, 1991, each health board is obliged to submit an annual report on the adequacy of the child care and family support services available in its area. Health boards are also obliged to outline the services which they propose to provide in an annual service plan and to account for the expenditure of development funding received.</P>
      <P>The Child Care Act, 1991, was implemented in full on 31 December 1996. Since 1991 additional revenue funding of the order of £102 million, over and above the cost of inflation and pay awards, has been invested to develop child care and family support services and to strengthen the capacity of the health boards to meet the demands of the Act. In addition, extra capital resources are being allocated in the national development plan for investment in residential services and community facilities and for the development of management information systems. Indicative figures of capital to be provided under the national development plan have issued to health boards and the details are being worked out between the health boards and my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government's commitment to the further development of child care and family support and prevention services has been demonstrated by the wide range of initiatives which have been undertaken in the past two years. My predecessor established a working group on foster care to examine all aspects of foster care. The Springboard initiative was launched to develop pilot family support projects for children at risk and their families. This Government has also introduced the Children Bill which will reform the law in relation to juvenile offenders and children with behavioural problems. In addition, there has been a range of other initiatives such as the implementation of Children First: National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children, the launch of the homelessness initiative, the establishment of the social services inspectorate and the establishment of the special residential services board on an interim basis. Proposals are also being developed to establish a children's <Col N="903" /> ombudsman and a national children's strategy is being drafted.</P>
    <P>These initiatives underline the Government's commitment to the further development of child care services as indicated in the Government programme An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may wish to note that at St. James's and St. Vincent's hospitals an attending general practitioner is a feature in the provision of accident and emergency services at these hospitals. The extension of the use of general practitioners to work in conjunction with accident and emergency departments in other hospitals will be considered based on an evaluation of the pilot schemes already in place.</P>
      <P>In addition, a number of initiatives are under way in the general practice area to address the out of hours situation, with reducing the demand on accident and emergency departments by the provision of appropriate general practitioner services as one of their objectives.</P>
      <P>My Department has provided significant additional funding for the enhancement of services in accident and emergency departments including additional funding of £2 million provided in 1999 for accident and emergency services in major acute hospitals, including those in paediatric hospitals. This extra revenue was used to fund measures to free up beds for emergency admissions and, where appropriate, allowed for the provision of enhanced staffing levels, the development of rapid diagnostic systems for common emergency presentations, continued development of treatment-observation areas in accident and emergency departments and an improved access for general practitioners to urgent specialist opinion.</P>
      <P>My Department provided a further £2 million of extra funding to hospitals in 2000 to enable them to implement measures aimed at reducing pressure on their accident and emergency departments. These measures include minor capital works to improve accident and emergency facilities, new equipment and enhanced non-consultant hospital doctor, nursing and clerical staffing levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition my Department has funded a comprehensive action plan aimed at providing an additional 235 step-down places for patients who have finished the acute phase of their treatment and require a level of care more appropriate to their needs. Ninety five of these are to be pro<Col N="904" /> vided on the campuses of acute hospitals with a further 140 sourced from private nursing homes.</P>
    <P>By the end of December 1999, 195 of the beds had been provided and the balance of 40 will be in place in the near future. Additional funding of £5 million has been provided in 2000 to continue this bed resource. Part of the extra funding was allocated to another national public education campaign to increase general awareness regarding the appropriate use of accident and emergency departments.</P>

      <P>The study referred to is part of a wider international study. A paper on the Irish study, which was carried out by the Department of Health promotion, NUI, Galway, was recently published in the <i>Irish Medical Journal.</i></P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>It should be noted that the study did not make any recommendations on standardising prescribing. It found, overall, that there were no significant variations in prescribing patterns with age, as might be expected, but there were some differences with gender. For example, female GPs were more likely to have reservations about the risk of breast cancer reflected both in their caution about prescription in the case of a significant family history and their greater likelihood of routinely sending their patients for mammography screening both before prescribing HRT and at regular intervals while on HRT.</P>
      <P>However, the study did not, in any way, conclude that women doctors take fewer chances with their patients' health than male doctors. In fact, while the authors of the study referred to some possible reasons for differences found in their study, for example, that increased sensitivity to breast cancer by female GPs as women themselves might be relevant, they concluded that it was beyond the scope of their present research to speculate on any such possible reasons.</P>

      <P>This Government is providing unprecedented resources for the development of the health services. A total of £4 billion will be spent this year, just two years after the total net expenditure in the sector passed the £3 billion for the first time. Funding for specific service developments in the acute hospital sector this year stands at over four times the level provided in the final year of the last Government's term of office. This is facilitating a number of substantial initiatives with a view to ensuring that the acute hospital services are reformed, re-organised and properly geared to meet the need of our population. They include the recently launched cardio-vascular health strategy including developments in cardiac surgery; the continuing implementation of the national cancer strategy which is improving the <Col N="906" /> availability of cancer treatment services throughout the country; the development of renal services which will involve an investment of £20 million over the next three years; the establishment of a medical manpower forum to review the key aspects of medical staffing in public hospitals and a range of other initiatives in such areas of acute hospital governance and management developments, clinicians in management, hospital accreditation, laboratory accreditation and health technology assessment.</P>
      <P>The availability of skilled professionals to lead these developments is essential.</P>
      <P>I am committed to addressing any staff shortages in the health area. A number of initiatives are continuing in this regard. The medical staffing of hospitals is currently being addressed by the Medical Manpower Forum. With particular regard to non-consultant hospital doctors the forum is seeking to redress the imbalance between career posts and training posts, the need to improve postgraduate medical training to keep more Irish medical graduates in the country, and the need to look at the position of women in medicine in Ireland with a view to redressing the number who leave medicine. The medical manpower forum is due to publish its first report shortly.</P>
      <P>In relation to other grades, the expert group report on allied health professions is due to report within a number of weeks and it will address manpower planning issues for the ten allied health professionals with which it is dealing. With regard to social workers, the National Social Work Qualifications Board has undertaken a manpower planning study of social workers. A new grade of student medical laboratory technician has been created to produce additional qualified technicians. Twenty additional student places have also been funded in the existing courses. A review of psychology services is under way at present, with manpower planning as one of the issues on the agenda. Talks are ongoing with the heads of the schools of psychology regarding increasing the number of places for graduates. Terms of reference for a manpower planning study for occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and physiotherapists are being finalised by my Department at present.</P>
      <P>In relation to nursing, the most comprehensive survey on nursing vacancies was carried out by the Health Service Employers Agency and related to the position at 30 September 1999. The survey found that there were 1,180.46 vacancies in gross terms but, when adjustments are made for the utilisation of agency nurses and overtime working, the net figure is 428.16 .</P>
      <P>The results confirmed again that there is not a nationwide problem regarding the availability of nurses and that difficulties largely relate to the greater Dublin area. Indications are that the level of applicants for nursing posts outside the Dublin area far exceeds the number of positions available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="907" /> It is not possible to be definitive as to the total nursing complement required to provide adequate staffing for hospitals. The Commission on Nursing recommended that the Department of Health and Children, health service providers and nursing organisations examine the development of appropriate systems to determine nursing staffing levels. The need to address skill mix issues was also highlighted in the Commission on Nursing report. Both of these recommendations are included in the priority action plan agreed with the Nursing Alliance as part of the settlement of the nurses' strike. It has been agreed that these issues will be addressed by a joint committee representative of nursing unions and health service employers. This committee is in the process of being established.</P>
    <P>While the recruitment and retention of nurses is primarily a matter for individual employers, initiatives have been taken or are being progressed with a view to stabilising the situation and, where possible, improving it.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 211 together.</P>
      <P>A common list of reimbursable medicines is in place for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme to ensure equity in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. In order for a product to be included in the list of reimbursable items, it must satisfy a number of criteria, including that it is ordinarily supplied to the public only on foot of a medical prescription and that the product should not be advertised or promoted to the public. As nicotine replacement therapies belong to a category of products that do not satisfy these criteria, in that they are generally available over-the-counter, and may be advertised directly to the public they are not included in the list of items reimbursable under the list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will wish to know, however, that I have asked the advisory forum to the heart health <Col N="908" /> task force to bring forward proposals in regard to nicotine replacement therapy and the less well off sectors of the community. Decisions on the availability of nicotine replacement therapy will be made in the light of the forum's recommendations.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that Department's health promotion unit conducts national multi-media anti-smoking campaigns to encourage smokers to give up and non-smokers to refrain from taking up the habit. The most recent anti-smoking campaign Break the Habit for Good was launched in December 1998 and this campaign takes a slightly different approach to previous campaigns. It emphasises the positive effects which quitting smoking can have on the individual and offers support in the form of an advice kit which in turn offers the support of the Irish Cancer Society's helpline. The campaign continues, by a series of national and local initiatives, to offer help and support for those people wishing to give up smoking.</P>

    <P>Two baseline surveys of health related behaviours among adults and school-going young people were carried out across the Republic of <Col N="910" /> Ireland in 1998 by the National University of Galway on behalf of my Department. This was the first survey of its type and is to be repeated on a three year cycle. The major results of these surveys were published in 1999 under the title The National Health and Lifestyle Surveys.</P>
    <P>As is common practice in other EU countries, health information surveys are used together with existing sources of national health data to obtain an overview of the health of the population. These sources include, among others: the hospital in-patient inquiry which records data on all in-patient cases from publicly funded hospitals; the National Cancer Registry which records all incident cases of cancers nationally; vital statistics data published on my behalf by the Central Statistics Office which provide mortality data as well as enabling the calculation of life expectancy; perinatal statistics which provide information on maternal and infant health.</P>
    <P>Most of these sources are included in the public health information system which provides a common minimum dataset for the evaluation of health status at national and regional levels.</P>
    <P>For the first time, the Census of Population, 2001, will include questions on disability that my Department will use to obtain population based measures of health.</P>
    <P>It is the objective of my Department to measure and monitor the health of the population through the optimum use of health information. Where gaps in information exist, these are being addressed through improved and extended data collection systems with the aim of achieving a comprehensive and integrated national health information system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 of the Child Care Act, 1991, provides that "it shall be the function of every health board to promote the welfare of children in its area who are not receiving adequate care and protection". In carrying <Col N="911" /> out this duty the health board is obliged to have regard to the rights and duties of parents, to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration and to have regard to the principle that it is generally in the best interests of a child to be brought up in his or her own family.</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the Act enables health boards to take children into voluntary care, with the consent of the parents, where the parents are unable to care for them due, for example, to serious illness, bereavement or family breakdown. Sections 12 to 19 of the Act enable the Garda or health boards to intervene quickly where there is an immediate and serious threat to the safety and welfare of a child. Under section 12 of the Act, the Garda may remove a child to safety pending the making of an application by a health board to a court for a care order.</P>
      <P>Under section 16 of the Act, a health board has a statutory obligation to apply to the court for an emergency care order, an interim care order, a care order or a supervision order as appropriate.</P>
      <P>Except in a case of emergency, an intervention by a health board to procure a care order under the Child Care Act, 1991, is always taken as a last step, having exhausted all other avenues to promote and protect the child's welfare including the provision of family support services or access to voluntary care arrangements.</P>
      <P>I understand from the health boards that in the small number of cases where issues of concern relating to court orders are raised that these usually relate to situations where children are taken into care other than on a voluntary basis. The Deputy will appreciate that because of the emotional nature of the issues involved in placing a child under the care of a health board, in such circumstances, there will not always be acceptance of the outcome of the court process. However, it is important to note that an order made by a court under the Child Care Act, 1991, may be varied or changed by that court or appealed to a higher court.</P>

      <P>There are 2,528 designated private acute beds in public acute hospitals at present. The level of charges in respect of these beds is set by the Minister for Health and Children. Under present arrangements, these charges vary only in relation to category of the hospital and whether private or semi-private accommodation is used while day care charges are set as a percentage of the overnight charge applicable to the particular hospital. <Col N="912" /> The current charges are set out in the following table.</P>
      <P>The charges are not explicitly related to the real costs of maintaining and providing services to private patients and are intended only as a contribution to the cost of care in public hospitals. The different rates applied to different categories of hospitals are primarily intended to reflect the fact that there are varying levels of costs between major tertiary and teaching hospitals and general hospitals. The current level of charges does not cover the full cost of private care in public hospitals. The White Paper on private health insurance estimated the annual cost of the public subsidy involved at £35 million.</P>
      <P>Private hospitals have their own budget arrangements with insurers, which are more closely related to actual costs than the centrally determined charge currently applied in the public hospitals. The White Paper states that it would be appropriate to implement a charging system which recognises the real costs in the public hospitals and, to this end, the Government is committed to make arrangements for the phased introduction of economic pricing over a period of five to seven years. My Department has established a group which will consult with agencies and insurers on the best approach to adopt in this regard. The main beneficiaries from the introduction of more realistic costing will be the major teaching and regional hospitals where the gap between current charges and non-capital costs is most apparent.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, yesterday, I outlined the details of the format of the inquiry to review post-mortem examination, policy, practice and procedure in the State since 1970 and, in particular, as it relates to organ removal, retention, storage and disposal by reference to prevailing standards both inside and outside the State. The inquiry will essentially be conducted in two phases. The first phase of the inquiry will be headed by an eminent senior counsel.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference for the inquiry provides that the inquiry will make its final report within six months. On receipt of this report I will table a motion that the report be presented to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.

I fully recognise that all affected are anxious that a professional inquiry be conducted which will allow for the full facts to emerge. I am confident that the inquiry <Col N="914" /> as outlined above will provide a new context in which all relevant issues can be dealt with and will assist everybody concerned in moving forward in a spirit of co-operation and mutual respect between patients and service providers to the benefit of all those who rely on our health services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>General practitioners, under the GMS scheme, are independent contractors holding contracts for services rather than employees operating under contracts of employment. As part of the contractual arrangements operated since 1989 there is a general practitioner pension fund managed by the <Col N="916" /> Irish Pensions Trust with a 10% of capitation contribution by the health board and 5% by the GP concerned. Under the fee per item arrangements which existed prior to 1989, the fees paid to GMS scheme doctors contained an acknowledged proportion intended to be invested by the GP for superannuation purposes. Accordingly, in that scenario, the responsibility for adequate pension investment, in any individual case, was solely a matter for the individual involved.</P>
      <P>Prior to the introduction of the GMS scheme in 1972, there were pensionable salaried general practitioners called permanent district medical officers and when the scheme was introduced such persons, who chose to enter the new scheme as independent contractors enjoying the same rights as all other GMS doctors also brought with them certain guarantees, including in relation to pensions. In 1998, those pension arrangements were the subject of a specific agreement with the Irish Medical Organisation which saw the introduction of a notional salary for superannuation purposes which significantly enhanced the pensions position of those persons. These doctors also benefited from the pension arrangements in place from 1989 and additionally from any particular pension arrangements they might have made under the fee per item arrangements between 1972 and 1989.</P>
      <P>In relation to rural general practitioners, it should be noted that dispensing fees paid to them are calculated for superannuation purposes and that in the case of salaried rural general practitioners rural practice allowance is also superannuable. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the general arrangements relating to pensions for doctors participating in the GMS scheme are adequate and proper.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 and 216 together.</P>
      <P>The long-term illness scheme entitles persons to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a specific schedule of illnesses. The illnesses covered by this scheme are mental handicap, mental illness, for persons under 16 years only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukaemia.</P>
      <P>The long-term illness scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to extend it, having regard to the other schemes available to help people with the cost of drugs and medicines. For example, people who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the local health board has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis. </P>
      <P>Non-medical cardholders can avail of the drug payment scheme, which was introduced on 1 July 1999 with a threshold of £42 per individual or family unit. The primary aim of the scheme is to bring about improvements over previous schemes and it is designed to be user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, health related support services for children with autism and their families within the Eastern Regional Health Authority's area of responsibility have been greatly enhanced and expanded since 1998. Two multi-disciplinary outreach teams were established in 1998 and 1999, each consisting of a psychologist, speech and language therapist, occupational therapist, nurse, social worker and secretarial support. This year a further £500,000, with a full year cost of £600,000 in 2001, has been provided for the expansion of the outreach and respite services, bringing the total additional funding provided for these services since 1998 to £1.2 million in 2000. A third multidisciplinary outreach team is being established to cover the western part of the region, which will have a similar composition to the two existing teams. The establishment of this team will relieve some of the pressure on the existing personnel, thus enabling them to spend more time with the children within their designated areas. The question of the overall level of input from any particular therapist will vary in each case, depending on the individual needs of each child. I understand that, in addition to recruiting the additional staff already mentioned, the authority is also seeking to fill two existing psychology posts which are currently vacant in the services. My Department will continue to endeavour to assist the authority to meet the health related needs of these children.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties being experienced within the health services generally in relation to the recruitment of health professionals. Following a Labour Court recommendation in 1997, an expert group was established to examine and report on various issues, including recruitment and retention of staff, relating to paramedical grades. The group is in the process of finalising its report, which is expected to be published in the next few weeks. A review of psychology services is under way, with manpower planning as one of its terms of reference.</P>
      <P>My Department is also working closely with other Departments, the health boards, voluntary service providers and the various professional representative bodies to facilitate in any way it can issues related to the short-term recruitment of additional nursing and paramedical staff to work in various areas of the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to the provision of respite services, I understand from the Eastern Regional Health Authority that a social worker has been recruited and is to take up duty next month specifically to develop home support services for families of children with autism. The role of the social worker is to recruit and train home support workers, including families, to provide home based respite services. The authority is also actively seeking a suitable property in order to <Col N="920" /> expand the residential respite service. As an interim measure, the authority has made arrangements with a voluntary agency to provide respite services every second weekend.</P>

      <P>I understand from the health boards that the boards have been involved in 66 judicial review cases before the High Court following on from the FN case in 1995. The majority of these cases involve the former Eastern Health Board. Ireland, the Attorney General and the Minister for Education and Science are invariably a party to such proceedings and the Minister for Health and Children is usually a party to such proceedings. My Department is not aware of the health boards or the State parties concerned failing to comply with High Court orders made in such proceedings.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the national programme of development of 110 additional high support-special care places by the health boards, including the three area health boards in the eastern region, which has been approved and is being funded by my Department and the enactment of the Children Bill, 1999, Part 3 of which will provide for the detention of a non-offending child in need of special care or protection by a health board on foot of a court order, will obviate the need for judicial review proceedings in respect of such cases.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 133, 183 and 213 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government, and in particular my predecessor, has taken a number of significant initiatives in the acute hospital sector to ensure that services are reformed, reorganised and properly geared towards the needs of the population. Specific initiatives include the preparation of a cardiovascular health strategy, including targeted funding for cardiac surgery; continuing implementation of the national cancer strategy; a plan for the development of renal services; the establishment of a medical manpower forum; the opening of a new hospital at Tallaght; the <Col N="923" /> development of a hospital accreditation programme together with a range of initiatives in areas such as acute hospital governance and management development, clinicians in management, laboratory accreditation and technology assessment.</P>
    <P>In addition, the recent establishment of the Eastern Regional Health Authority, which came into operation on 1 March, will provide for major structural reform in the management and co-ordination of acute hospital services in the eastern region. I expect that this initiative which involves 50% of the country's acute hospital services will have a significant positive impact on the provision of these services. On the capital side, the Government is investing an additional £1 billion to remedy existing infrastructural deficiencies across the acute hospital sector, including in particular the promotion of a continuing shift to day care and the development of appropriate links with community based services. Taken together, these initiatives will serve to significantly enhance the level and quality of existing hospital services. However, much more remains to be done.</P>
    <P>One of the key tasks to be undertaken is the need to review the whole area of hospital bed capacity. Deputies will be aware that the Government is committed in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to a review of bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute settings. I am pleased to inform the House that this review has now commenced and will be conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and the social partners. The review is of critical importance in the context of assessing the capacity of the hospital system to manage periodic surges in emergency admissions and the reduction of waiting times for elective treatment. I am anxious that the review be conducted as a priority and it is my intention that the findings will inform discussions in the context of the Estimates for 2001. I have already had discussions with the chief executive officers of the health boards in relation to the scope of the review.</P>
    <P>Key components of the review will include: an examination of the effectiveness of existing measures in place to ensure appropriate use of accident and emergency departments and the scope for further measures to improve the management of the demand for acute beds; the development of a quantitative profile of capacity utilisation throughout the acute system and in particular the scope for improved management of the existing in-patient workload and increased use of day care facilities; and a review of the measures currently in place to ensure timely discharge to appropriate care for patients who have completed the acute phase of their treatment.</P>
    <P>The assessment of existing and future capacity will also need to have regard to a number of fundamental principles which need to underpin the future provision of services: equitable access to care for public patients; availability of prompt treatment within a reasonable period; the pro<Col N="924" /> vision of the most appropriate form of care in the correct setting; the organisation and delivery of a patient centred and flexible service; the comprehensive integration of services across traditional boundaries; and an emphasis on measurement of outcomes and the appropriateness of treatment.</P>

In addition, under the national development plan, additional capital funding is being made available for child care services, including provision for high support-special care units and accommodation for community and preventive services. This investment will be required to ensure that the special care units are only used as a last resort</P>
      <P>My Department is involved in ongoing discussions with the health boards in relation to the additional resources, both personnel and financial, which will be required under the legislation.

      <P>MRSA is not a statutorily notifiable infectious disease and so statistics on its occurrence are not routinely compiled by my Department. In 1995 a survey was carried out to ascertain the number of times MRSA was isolated in acute hospitals in each health board area over a defined time period. The objective of this survey was to obtain an indication of the MRSA problem in Ireland prior to introducing national MRSA guidelines. A survey of all microbiology laboratories in Ireland was carried out over two weeks in spring 1995. MRSA was isolated from 448 patients during the two week period. The prevalence of MRSA during this period was 16.5 in every 1,000 discharges. A repeat all Ireland study was undertaken in 1999 under the direction of the Department of Public Health in the Eastern Health Board. The results of this study are expected to be available shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance of infection control has been recognised for some time and was specifically addressed by my Department in 1995. At that time, detailed guidelines in relation to the control of MRSA were developed and circulated by my <Col N="926" /> Department. While the guidelines dealt specifically with the control of MRSA, the principles set out in the guidelines are equally applicable to control of hospital acquired infection in general. The guidelines draw attention to such issues as the need for education and training of staff and for infection control structures and procedures. In particular, the guidelines emphasise that hand washing is the most important factor in preventing the spread of MRSA, stressing that consultants and nurse managers must insist on good hand washing procedures. I fully endorse the approach set out in these guidelines which emphasise the importance of implementing appropriate infection control procedures and practices in line with the guidelines with a view to ensuring that hospital acquired infection is kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>In addition to the guidelines already published, my Department also intends to establish multi-disciplinary and cross-sectoral policies to reduce the threat that anti-microbial resistance poses and has requested the National Disease Surveillance Centre to convene an expert group to advise on this matter. Among the range of issues on which the NDSC has been asked to consider is the development of principles in relation to infection control in the hospital and community settings. The NDSC is currently preparing a report on these issues and the problem of anti-microbial resistance generally.</P>

However, the Deputy will be aware that under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, it was agreed to conduct a review of bed capacity in both acute and non-acute settings. Integral components of this review of capacity will be examinations of the day work carried out in hospitals with a view to establishing the adequacy and appropriateness of day care facilities, given the 9-10% per annum increase in day activity in recent years and the organisation and use of operating theatre facilities, with a view to possible increased efficiency in the area.</P>

      <P>Under the Voluntary Health Insurance Acts, 1957 to 1998, the board is required to obtain the consent of the Minister to proposed health insurance plans. To date the board has not submitted a plan of the kind referred to by the Deputies for approval under the Acts. My officials have been made aware by VHI management that, as a result of demand from corporate and individual customers, it is working on the development of an insurance plan to cover members' primary care expenses.</P>
      <P>The Government stated in the White Paper on Private Health Insurance that the further evolution of private health insurance should include steps to promote the position of primary care in the system. The proposals regarding changes to the private health insurance framework will not impact upon the existing eligibility arrangements in place for health services which ensure that all persons have access to primary care services on the basis of need.</P>
      <P>Where people do not qualify for a medical card under income guidelines drawn up annually by health board chief executive officers, who have statutory responsibility for the determination of eligibility, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that a family's medical needs or other circumstances justify it. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction's 1999 report on the state of the drugs problem in Europe was published last November. The main points of the report were that cannabis is still the most commonly used illicit drug across the EU. The next greatest problem is caused by amphetamines, Ecstasy and other synthetic drugs. The misuse of heroin occurs mainly in large cities across Europe, but this drug is responsible for disproportionate health, justice and social costs due to the anti-social behaviour, crime and mortality associated with its use.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a comprehensive range of structures has been put in place in Ireland to address the drugs problem. Fourteen local drugs task forces have been established in the areas where the drugs problem is most acute and over 200 projects are under way in local task force areas. In addition, through the youth services development fund a range of initiatives are under way aimed at children and families at risk.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet Sub-committee on social inclusion and drugs works to co-ordinate activities on an inter-departmental basis to address the problem. The national drugs strategy will be further reviewed this year with the aim of ensuring that properly co-ordinated and integrated structures and services are being put in place.</P>
      <P>In the Eastern Regional Health Authority area services are provided through 53 treatment locations. Ten education officers have been recruited to work with schools and local communities on the development and delivery of drug prevention programmes. Three rehabilitation co-ordinators are creating links between drugs treatment services and the range of agencies who provide rehabilitation options for drug misusers. The authority will also continue to provide support to the voluntary and community groups whose work complements that of the statutory services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In areas outside the task force areas the major problems relate to cannabis and ecstasy use. The main strategy in these areas is education and prevention. Drugs co-ordinators are employed in all health boards and boards are also taking steps to <Col N="929" /> strengthen co-ordinating structures to ensure that there is an integrated approach to addressing the drugs problem. Boards are also in a position to provide an appropriate response should any problem of heroin misuse arise.</P>
    <P>I accept that we must continue to have drug misuse as a priority area for attention and that further work is needed to prevent young people turning to drugs in the first instance while working to ensure that appropriate treatment and rehabilitation facilities are provided for those who need them. My Department will continue to work in a co-ordinated fashion to tackle the problem and to halt the upward trend in drug misuse.</P>

      <P>The blueprint for the implementation of the information society is the Government action plan, Implementing the Information Society in Ireland, published last year. As the Deputy may be aware, the action plan sets out our objectives for the implementation of the information society, including the implementation of Government. It adopts a three stranded approach: strand 1 deals with information provision on-line. Strand 2 focuses on interactive public service provision. This area of the action plan sets out areas where Government-public services are being-will be delivered on-line. For the business community, the following services are already being provided: Land Registry external access service; and FÁS-on-line service.</P>
      <P>This year further services, including a revenue on-line service will come on stream. Further information on services available, or soon to be available, can be obtained at the following web address.</P>
      <P>An implementation group of Assistant Secretaries General and a policy development team, based in my Department, have been put in place to progress the implementation of the agenda set out in the action plan. Further information on the action plan and on progress can be obtained on my Department's website at www.irlgov.iétaoiseach/eIreland/intro.htm. The latest report on progress implementing the action plan is nearing completion, it should also be available on the website in mid-April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance of delivery of on-line services continues to be promoted. The implementation <Col N="930" /> group and the policy development team have been encouraging Departments to come forward with initiatives for electronic public service delivery. In order to encourage and facilitate this, a dedicated information society fund &ndash; this year amounting to £30 million &ndash; has also been put in place to assist Departments in progressing action plan initiatives. A fast track evaluation mechanism has also been put in place to consider applications to the ISF. To date about £13 million of the £30 million available for 2000 has been allocated. Most Departments have come forward with initiatives, pilot projects and plans, others are in the process of doing so. I fully support the objective of delivering public services on-line.</P>
    <P>Strand 3 of the action plan deals with the provision of on-line fully integrated services. By facilitating fully integrated delivery of public services, we will make Government services more accessible and easier to use. It will also deliver new efficiencies in service delivery. The action plan sets out the delivery of such integrated services as the ultimate objective. A report on this will be considered by Government shortly. Once approved, it will be published on my Department's website.</P>
    <P>The Government will also consider the issue of time frames and requesting each Department to set out the services it can deliver in this context. It will be pressing for the maximum electronic service provision as soon as possible, consistent with the overall agenda objectives. In this context, the strategic management initiative implementation group will shortly make proposals to Government on an integrated public service strategy which will involve each Department developing a strategy in the light of its own business environment and requirements. This proactive approach will add further momentum to the development of electronic government.</P>
    <P>As for incentives, it is not currently envisaged that discounts or incentives of this nature would be offered for use of services or to do business on-line as it is anticipated that the on-line service delivery mode will sell itself through its ease of use and convenience and the efficiencies and time saving benefits which will accrue to the users. However, in progressing the development of the model for the fully integrated delivery of public services, consideration will be given to the question of what, if any, further incentives might be appropriate.</P>
    <P>Given that the role of the implementation group is to oversee the implementation of the action plan, including the integrated public service delivery agenda aspects, it is overseeing implementation.</P>

The following categories of persons were exempted from this change: travellers; ex-offenders; refugees; people with disabilities; people referred under drugs task force; off-shore island inhabitants and 18-24 year olds, referred through EAP, who are 18 months or more unemployed. There was no change to the period of unemployment necessary for eligibility for participation in the CE programme, that is, 12 months for the part-time integration option and three years for the part-time job option-rate for the job option.</P>
      <P>The age criterion was increased in order to better target available places on CE at older long-term unemployed persons and in line with a recommendation of the Deloitte &amp; Touche consultants' review of CE. The impact of the phased reduction in the participation levels on CE on the provision of community services will be considered by a special working group to be established shortly. The findings of this group, which will comprise representatives of the relevant Departments and the social partners, will be considered by Government.</P>

      <P>In relation to the availability of motor insurance cover there is no provision under EU or insurance legislation for me to interfere in underwriting risks by insurance companies nor am I empowered to regulate the level of premiums. The provision of insurance cover is generally based on underwriting experience, including trends in the cost and frequency of claims, and is a matter of judgment for the individual insurance company.</P>
      <P>I am aware that motor insurance is often available only at a high price to young people, especially young male drivers. However, this is directly related to adverse claims experience of young, especially male, drivers as a risk category. The 1996 Deloitte &amp; Touche report on an economic evaluation of insurance costs found that the average cost of an insurance claim for 17-24 year old drivers is twice that for the 36 to 40 age group and that motorists in the 17-24 age group are responsible for over three and a half times the total average claims costs incurred for motorists in the 36 to 40 age group.</P>
      <P>My re-establishment of the motor insurance advisory board was a major initiative aimed at providing us with information and advice on trends in motor insurance costs and with policy recommendations for addressing those costs. The board whose expanded membership includes a member representing young drivers' interests, has undertaken an ambitious programme of work and research, particularly in relation to the basis of charges to young drivers.</P>
      <P>The primary focus of initiatives aimed at reducing the cost of motor insurance for young drivers must be on reducing the frequency of accidents and the associated costs of claims. A number of initiatives are in place and are being taken to improve driving standards and safety awareness among all drivers, including young drivers. The Irish Insurance Federation, in conjunction with the driving instructors register, has introduced a scheme of insurance premium discounts for the young driver on completion of a required number of driving lessons. The National Safety Council, in co-operation with the gardaí, continue to promote anti-speeding and anti-drink driving media campaigns, including road safety educational programmes for secondary school students. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, has been asked to look at a graduated licensing system for learner drivers, based on the Ontario model which could have a significant impact if introduced here in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For those motorists who are having difficulty getting a quote for motor insurance and in recognition of the compulsory nature of third party motor insurance, the declined cases agreement between the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and <Col N="933" /> Employment and the Irish Insurance Federation offers the motorist the opportunity of a motor quotation subject to certain criteria.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to publish the ESRI study as it is commercially sensitive. The study shows that purchases from Irish companies by the company in question continue to increase. Following the completion of the first ESRI benchmarking study in March 1998 the company indicated that it would grow its total business with Irish companies from 692 million in 1996-7 to 997 million by February 2002, an increase of 44%. The <Col N="934" /> ESRI study of progress for the year ended February 1998 showed that the company's purchases had increased to 770 million.

      <P>Unfortunately, salmon stocks in Waterford and elsewhere throughout the country remain in a vulnerable state and, therefore, the critical conservation and management measures which were in force last year must remain in place. However, it remains the case that where commercial netsmen and anglers working with the regional fisheries boards can agree a management plan for specific areas, the possibility of extending the seasons in those areas will be examined. In addition, I have now established the National Salmon Commission on a statutory basis and this committee will be advising me on future conservation and management strategies for the salmon resource.</P>
      <P>It is very important that all the key fisheries interests in the area can work in close co-operation with one another to ensure that the resource is developed in an appropriate and equitable manner. To facilitate this I have asked BIM to work with all the relevant players to develop a co-ordinated local aquaculture management system, CLAMS, plan for Waterford estuary. I expect that with good co-operation from all parties a detailed CLAMS plan for the area can be prepared quickly which will be of benefit to all interests in the estuary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to encourage the association in question to pursue the Southern Regional Fisheries Board's suggestion for a Waterford Estuary Trust with the board as a further step in the development <Col N="936" /> of the potential of the estuary. Again, this would involve all interested parties in the catchment working together on a partnership basis. The services of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board, BIM and the Marine Institute would be available to assist in the process and it will provide an appropriate forum to liaise with Waterford and New Ross port companies in addressing issues of concern identified by the association.</P>

      <P>Ireland Aid has a significant programme of support for the health sector in developing countries. This programme is informed by a specific health policy which is based on principles of international best practice in the field of development co-operation. In the interests of sustainable development Ireland Aid supports health initiatives only as part of a system wide programme that is directed at strengthening health services and delivering a health package that is shown to be effective and affordable.</P>
      <P>In the past, many development agencies have provided financial support for specific health interventions in developing countries. Some of these, for example the eradication of smallpox, have clearly been successful. Others, such as programmes to decrease the high level of maternal mortality or address childhood malnutrition, have had very limited success. Many evaluations of donor funded health programmes in developing countries point to the fact that isolated donor funded initiatives have very limited impact if they are not directed at strengthening governments and non-governmental organisations to develop health services that can address prevalent health problems in a sustainable way.</P>
      <P>Though insulin is an essential and highly effective medicine that has transformed the lives of many millions of people worldwide, if it is not administered correctly and where supportive services of a standard quality are not available, it can be an extremely dangerous medication. Consequently, contributing to the purchase of such a medication in the absence of attention to the required backup and support services could be counterproductive.</P>

The order approved the construction of the line along the old Harcourt Street rail alignment as far as the Grand Canal and on-street from there to St. Stephen's Green.

      <P>The European Commission is currently finalising the Leader+ draft guidelines document, having regard to the observations of the European Parliament which have been accepted by the member states. It is expected that the commission will shortly publish the definitive guidelines. Based on these guidelines, member states will draw up operational programmes for Leader+ for forwarding to the commission for approval. The commission over a period of some months will subject the programmes to detailed examination to ensure in particular that they show evidence of significant innovation to the requisite standard for approval.</P>
      <P>Under the national development plan, funding of the order of £110 million will be available to support Leader+ type activity in the period 2000-6. Some £35.4 million of this is to be provided by the EU in respect of the Leader+ programme. The balance will come from the National Exchequer and will comprise national co-funding of £20 million for Leader+ as well as support for a mainstream Leader type measure. As with other measures provided for in the national development plan, approval by the European Commission is necessary to enable commencement of arrangements for the establishment of Leader mainstream activity.</P>
      <P>Pending EU clearance for Leader+ activity and Leader mainstream activity under the national development plan, it is not possible to define the precise arrangements for delivery. It is clear, however, that the commission's intention is that Leader+ funding will be confined to a limited number of rural areas and that the essential aim of the Leader+ measure will be to encourage the emergence and testing of new approaches to integrated and sustainable development.</P>
      <P>The indication is that the requisite Leader+ activity should be innovative and novel and should focus principally on integrated territorial rural development strategies of a pilot nature while maintaining the bottom up strategy and seeking to forge horizontal partnerships; support for inter-territorial and transnational co-operation and networking of all areas of the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="939" /> Because Leader+ will be a more focused programme than its predecessors, and some rural areas will not be covered, the national Leader mainstream programme will apply nationwide and will cater for aspects which will not be eligible under Leader+, in particular aspects of rural tourism.</P>
    <P>The report of the task force on the integration of local government and local development systems requires that attention be given to the avoidance of overlap between agencies including Leader groups and to exploring mechanisms capable of combining rural development and rural partnership activities in rural disadvantaged areas specifically.</P>
    <P>Groups have been funded to the 30 June 2000 Leader II completion date and I am conscious that a further period will elapse before the coming on stream of the new Leader measures. Accordingly, I have secured interim funding in respect of the period from 30 June 2000 to 31 December 2000 to assist with the administrative costs of existing groups. Such funding will be made available to groups who submit a plan document outlining their needs in this area. Any funding of existing groups will be without prejudice to the selection of groups for the delivery of the new Leader activity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the contents of the video in question.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 174 of 22 February 2000, the slaughtering of calves for veal production is minimal in this country. In compliance, however, with EU rules I have introduced the European Communities (Welfare of Calves) Regulations, 1998 (SI No. 138 of 1998). These give effect to Council Directive No. 91/629/EEC, as amended by Council Directive No. 97/2/EC and Commission Decision No. 97/182/EC. They specify the accommodation requirements for the rearing and fattening of calves. They also lay down rules regarding appropriate diet and inspection of the calves to ensure their health and welfare. The regulations also prohibit the use after 31 December 2006 of holdings which do not comply with housing and space requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards transportation, the Diseases of Animals (Protection of Animals during Transport) Orders, 1995 and 1997, prescribe strict standards for feeding, watering, resting periods, journey times and stocking densities during transpor<Col N="940" /> tation. Additionally, the Diseases of Animals (Carriage of Cattle by Sea) Orders, 1996 and 1998, lay down rules for the carriage of cattle by sea from the State. The latter orders provide for the inspection and approval of cattle vessels which comply with specified criteria, the loading and care of cattle on vessels, conditions in relation to weather and the submission of voyage reports. Veterinary inspectors of my Department monitor compliance with this legislation.</P>
    <P>The export of calves is a legitimate trade with the European Union. Member States are precluded by EU rules from taking any steps to restrict the export of calves to other member states. Provided that calf consignments comply with the requirements of veterinary certification and of the foregoing legislation, there can be no prohibition on exports. The treatment of calves in a member state is a matter for the authorities of that state.</P>

      <P>Under the national development plan, an amount of £147 million is provided for a scheme of waste management for the period 2000-6. As built into the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, consultation on the <Col N="941" /> scheme has taken place with the farm organisations. Proposals under the new scheme provide for a maximum of 200 income units with a grant rate of 40% of approved costs subject to a maximum grant of £16,000 applicable in the case of farmers having income units up to 150 units. A grant rate of 20% of approved costs subject to a maximum grant of £8,000 is proposed in the case of farmers having income units between 151 and 200 units. In effect, dairy farmers with a permanent milk quota of up to 80,000 gallons may be eligible for grant aid under this new scheme.</P>
      <P>The terms and conditions of the proposed new scheme are at present being drafted by my Department for submission to the European Commission for approval. Following receipt of that approval, the scheme will be implemented at an early date.</P>

Because of the large volume of applications under the scheme which were received in the closing months of 1999, there is a significant backlog. The applications on hands are being processed by local office staff in conjunction with other priority work. It is expected that the processing of this case will be completed in the coming weeks. I would point out that when the processing of an application is delayed in this way there is no financial loss to a retiring farmer.

      <P>Pensions under public sector occupational pension schemes are payable only for the lifetime of the beneficiary. Entitlement to the pension ceases on the date of death of the pensioner. Where a pensioner is survived by an eligible spouse and/or children, they may be entitled to benefit under the relevant spouses' and children's pensions scheme. Those schemes normally provide for enhanced rates of benefit in relation to the period immediately subsequent to death.</P>
      <P>Pensions are generally payable in arrears. However, I am aware that there have been some difficulties in cases where a pensioner dies and the pension payment has already issued for that payment period. In such cases, an overpayment of pension arises in respect of the period between the date of death of the pensioner and the date of expiry of that payment period. In such cases, under the terms of the schemes, only the amount due in respect of the period up to the date of death would be payable to the estate and the balance falls to be recovered. My Department is examining the position in relation to such cases with a view to complying with the scheme requirements as sensitively as possible.</P>

      <P>Overall Government policy on the development of the information society is set out in the report 'Implementing the Information Society in Ireland: An Action Plan' published by the Department of An Taoiseach in January 1999. The early development of e-government in delivering electronic services to citizens and businesses is a key element of the action plan and is considered vital to the development of the Information Society in Ireland. The action plan is available on the Department of An Taoiseach's web site &ndash; www.irlgov.iétaoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to the action plan, my Department has established a special dedicated fund, the information society fund, designed to support the development and implementation of e-government and e-commerce 'flagship' projects identified in the action plan and to encourage and facilitate Departments, and bodies under their aegis, to progress the information society agenda. Proposals for funding from Departments are assessed by the information society fund evaluation team which is chaired by my Department and which includes representation from the <Col N="946" /> Department of An Taoiseach. All Departments are eligible to apply for funding for projects which demonstrably progress the objectives of the action plan.</P>
    <P>In 1999, an amount of £1.7 million was allocated to projects from the information society fund and, at this stage, approximately £13 million of the £30 million available for 2000 has so far been approved for expenditure for 24 projects spanning 11 departments and offices. Examples of the projects being supported by the information society fund include: Land Registry's on-line electronic search service of property folios, the first phase of which has been implemented; the Revenue on-line service, ROS, to provide for the electronic filing of tax returns due to be introduced by the Revenue Commissioners in September; computerisation of the General Register Office to provide for on-line registration of events, data search facilities and the production of certificates; development of a central client eligibility index for the health sector; development of an electronic filing system for the submission of annual returns to Government by insurance companies; scoping studies in the justice area concerning the electronic lodgement of documents by solicitors to the Courts Service, the electronic payment of fines over the Internet and the provision of an on-line small claims court facility for members of the public; awareness campaigns for citizens and businesses co-ordinated by the information society commission; provision of Internet access points in all public libraries; development of an on-line citizens database by the National Social Services Board to provide a single point for information associated with the life-events of a citizen, for example, getting married, applying for a university grant, purchasing a house, becoming unemployed; development of an e-recruitment facility by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission; e-procurement for the public service to provide for the publication of procurement opportunities and the on-line submission of tenders &ndash; this project is being overseen by an interdepartmental steering committee chaired by the Department of Finance; and the REACH organisation recently established by Government under the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs with the objective of developing a common approach across Departments and agencies for the delivery of electronic services to citizens.</P>
    <P>I understand that the third progress report of the interdepartmental group for the information society will soon be published by the Department of An Taoiseach and this will provide further information on e-government and information society projects being implemented under the action plan. My Department fully appreciates the opportunities for Ireland in the information society and continues to promote the application of new technologies by Departments and offices in enhancing efficiency in their day-to-day business activities and in supporting the delivery of quality services to the public.</P>

      <P>My Department has not been approached regarding the provision of syringe vending machines and secure needle disposal units in areas of Dublin. However the provision of drug services, including needle exchange, is the statutory responsibility of the Eastern Regional Health Authority. I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the authority and have asked that a response be issued directly to him regarding this matter.</P>
      <P>The objective of needle/syringe exchange programmes is to reduce and prevent further morbidity problems encountered by the intravenous drug using cohort; to reduce the spread of blood borne viruses and illnesses and to offer an initial contact with services for intravenous drug users. They are an intrinsic part of a comprehensive drug treatment programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="948" /> The drug treatment service, including needle exchange programmes in the eastern region were recently independently evaluated and the evaluator found that remarkable progress had been achieved in a short time in developing a comprehensive range of drug treatment services. In so far as needle exchange is concerned, the evaluator recommended that the possibilities for further expansion of the service should be explored. This is currently under consideration by those managing the service. In this context, all reasonable options for the provision of such services will be reviewed in the light of experience of their operation both here and elsewhere. The practicalities involved in such options would also, obviously, require careful consideration as well as the public safety issues which arise.</P>

      <P>Details of the research referred to are not given by the Deputy. All significant research in this area is monitored by the Department of Public Enterprise with which my Department liaises regarding the human health aspects. The balance of scientific evidence to date does not indicate any significant health risk from non-ionising radiation associated with mobile phones and it has not been conclusively established that there is a causal link between this type of radiation and cancer.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that there will be 500 million mobile phone users globally by the end of 2000. The kinds of illnesses that affect populations at large will also occur among mobile phone users. Research in this area is ongoing and the European Union under its fifth framework research programme allocated 160 million euros for international research projects. The results of this research will become available over the next three to four years. I am advised that the mobile phones in use here meet with the standards for exposure levels recommended by the EU for public exposure to non-ionising radiation emissions. Mobile phone users can further reduce personal exposure from handsets by use of a headset.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996, each health <Col N="949" /> board is obliged to produce an annual service plan for the year on the basis of the financial determination notified to it. This requirement is also applied to voluntary hospitals on an administrative basis. These service plans are agreed with my Department at the beginning of each year. Responsibility for delivering the plans rests with management in each agency.</P>
      <P>As part of the process of delivering service plans, activity in the acute hospital sector is planned by agencies over a 12 month period having regard to anticipated levels of emergency admissions and the overall resources available. In achieving the activity targets set out in the annual service plans, temporary bed closures would form a part of the normal bed management function performed by local management as part of their efforts to optimise the overall activity delivered within the resources available. They also, of course, facilitate staff annual leave, refurbishment works and the scaling down of elective activity at times of low demand such as the summer period.</P>
      <P>In considering the delivery of service in the acute hospital sector, it is appropriate to examine the overall level of service provided in the sector rather than to simply focus on the number of beds available at any given time. This reflects major changes that have been taking place in medical practice, resulting in reduced average in-patient lengths of stay, a continuing shift in the delivery of care from an in-patient to day case basis and the increasing provision of treatment at out-patient level.</P>
      <P>The total discharges, both in-patient and day case, in the acute hospital system for the period January to December 1999 was 827,200. This huge volume of overall activity represented an increase of nearly 2.5% over 1998 levels. In particular, the level of hospital care being provided on a day case basis showed a very significant increase, up over 9.5% in 1999 over 1998 levels. The increasing delivery of care at this level reflects trends in modern medical practice and is indicative of a service that is increasingly focusing resources in a manner that is best suited to the needs of the public.</P>

      <P>Government policy in relation to the care of older people is to maintain them in their own homes for as long as possible. I, together with the various organisations representing the interests of older people, recognise that the role played by home helps is vital to the success of this policy. Notwithstanding this recognition, it is accepted that there <Col N="950" /> are a number of issues relating to the organisation and development of home help services which need to be addressed in order to realise the full potential of this service.</P>
      <P>My Department commissioned a report entitled "The Future Organisation of the Home Help Service in Ireland" by the Policy Research Centre of the National College of Ireland under the direction of the National Council on Ageing and Older People. Following the publication of the report, I made available to the health boards in 1999 an additional sum of £1.5 million to expand and develop the home help service and provide appropriate training as recommended in the report. This sum, together with an additional £0.78 million has been repeated this year.</P>
      <P>In further recognition of the contribution of home helps, improvements have been made to their pay and the national minimum wage of £4.40 per hour has been implemented with effect from 1 April, 2000, an increase from £3 per hour minimum in April, 1999. Negotiations are continuing, under the auspices of the Health Service Employers Agency, in respect of all aspects of status, pay and working conditions for home helps. These talks are taking place in the context of the report referred to earlier. It is envisaged that, in association with the Labour Court, all outstanding issues will be resolved by the end of this month.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>the audit structure in place to review, from a national perspective, the efficiency or otherwise of the health services; his views on whether there is a need to have such an independent authority; and the plans, if any, to enhance the structure already in place.</Quest>
      <QRef>[10140/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a wide range of structures in place to review the efficiency of the health services at both national and health board levels. These structures include various health strategies, programme expenditure reviews, service plans, performance indicators, audits by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and OECD reviews. My Department's strategy statement of 1994 also emphasises the need to attain the highest standards of efficiency and value for money in the delivery of health care.</P>
      <P>The 1994 health strategy set a framework for reorienting the health services to achieve health and social gain with a particular emphasis on improving the situation of people in the lower socio-economic groups. In 1998, my Department commissioned the first nationally representative survey of lifestyle practices, the National Health and Lifestyle Surveys, to provide baseline data to plan future interventions and this now forms the basis of my Department's new health promotion strategy for the years 2000 to 2005. The strategic aims and objectives of this strategy will contribute to reducing health inequalities.</P>
      <P>In regard to specific objectives for key areas, the national cancer strategy set a target of reducing the proportion of deaths from cancer in the under 65 age group by 15% in the ten year period 1994-2004. A number of improvements in relation to service developments were also identified such as addressing regional imbalances, varying approaches to treatment regimes and the development of effective screening programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recently launched cardiovascular health strategy has set two targets for 2010. The medium term objective is to bring Irish levels of premature deaths from cardiovascular disease in line with the EU average at a minimum. The longer term goal is to reduce Irish rates to those of the best performers in the EU. The recommendations will be implemented in a planned and structured manner over five years. Funding will be linked to <Col N="953" /> implementation of specific recommendations and appropriate monitoring arrangements will be put in place.</P>
    <P>The Government decision of 25 March 1997 approved proposals for a process of expenditure reviews aimed at providing a systematic analysis of what is actually being achieved by expenditure in each programme and providing a basis on which more informed decisions can be made on priorities within and between expenditure programmes. Reviews of the intellectual disability programme and the dental treatment services scheme have been completed. A review of the nursing home subvention expenditure scheme has recently commenced.</P>
    <P>Under the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996, health boards are required to submit an annual service plan to my Department setting out the level of service they will deliver for the financial determination they have received. The service planning discipline and structures now in place in health agencies and the continuing developments in this area will lead to enhanced efficiencies throughout the system. Part of this process includes the continuous refinement and development of a set of performance indicators to assist in the management and evaluation of health services and of improving health services delivery.</P>
    <P>There is an ongoing development of information communications technology aimed at enhancing delivery and cost effectiveness through integrated care processes. These developments are contributing to the efficiency of service provision and the provision of better management information to assist in the pursuit of further cost effectiveness. I will be making significant investment in modern information systems. The national development plan provides for increased investment and development of these systems.</P>
    <P>My Department's case mix programme collects information in relation to both hospital activity and its associated costs. It involves the monitoring and comparison of costs and activity between hospitals, classifies patients into discrete classes or groups which share common clinical attributes and similar patterns of resource use. The system uses clinical information which is derived directly from clinical practice in hospitals participating in the programme. Case mix budgeting ensures that cost effectiveness considerations are taken into account in determining hospital budgets. Also, the hospital in-patient enquiry, HIPE, programme collects and codes inpatient and daycase activity data and allows data to be classified into diagnosis and procedures.</P>
    <P>The remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General includes carrying out value for money audits across the public sector and in relation to the health sector make recommendations on energy and the emergency ambulance services which are being implemented by health agencies.</P>
    <P>The OECD in its review of the Irish health care System in 1997 said that the system had resulted <Col N="954" /> in good provision of health care at relatively low cost to the taxpayer. The latest OECD report, 1999, reaffirmed that the Irish health care system continues to work well.</P>
    <P>More recently, the Government in its review of the Action Programme for the Millennium announced its intention to retain consultants to carry out a comprehensive value for money audit of the health services to examine the trend in resource inputs versus the trend in service outputs to clients over the last ten years; the trend in demand for health services over the last ten years; the difference, if any, between the trend in the level of contribution to cost of public and private patients <i>vis-à-vis</i> service levels to each category; and differentials in output costs across health boards and hospitals including specialities.</P>
    <P>The consultants will also be requested to make recommendations on the development of a management information system for the health service which will allow monitoring of the above matters on an ongoing basis. My Department is currently engaged in the tendering process to appoint consultants to carry out the project and it is expected that this project will commence shortly.</P>
    <P>I believe that the structures in place ensure that the delivery of health services is carried out in the most effective manner. The issue of an independent authority can best be addressed when the value for money audit by management consultants is completed.</P>

    <P>When the 1999 data have been validated, a detailed analysis will be undertaken by the National Disease Surveillance Centre and this will enable comparisons to be made with previous years' data. The increase in cases in the Eastern Health Board area in 1999 can be ascribed in part to an increase in the number of tuberculosis cases occurring in non-nationals.</P>
    <P>The Health Act, 1947, and the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981, provide the legislative basis for the control of infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The report of the Working Party on Tuberculosis, which had been established to evaluate policy on the prevention and treatment of the disease in Ireland and to make appropriate recommendations, was published in 1996. The report makes recommendations for the prevention and treatment of the disease. The recommendations cover a range of issues including epidemiology, surveillance, screening, preventative therapy, clinical management and laboratory diagnosis. As recommended in the report, a permanent committee, the National Tuberculosis Committee, has been established to advise on a detailed national strategy for the control and management of tuberculosis and it is currently developing such a strategy.</P>

      <P>According to Comhairle na n-Ospidéal figures, there are eighteen full-time consultant urologists at present. In addition to these, there are a number of posts of general surgeon throughout the country where the post holders would also undertake some urology work. The need for additional consultant urologist posts will be considered by agencies and by my Department as part of the ongoing identification of priorities in the context of the many competing demands for resources throughout the health services. The total number of adults and children on the urology waiting list at the 31 December 1999 was 1901.</P>
      <P>A total of £23.5 million is available to agencies under the waiting list initiative for 2000. Agencies are being asked to consider all appropriate options for maximising the use of waiting list funding, with an emphasis on innovative methods for reducing waiting lists and waiting times.  In attaching a serious priority to tackling lengthy waiting lists and times, I believe that there are a number of practical steps that can be taken to accelerate progress, including achieving more flexible use of available capacity and closer collaborative arrangements between the different parts of the system. Taken together with longer term measures associated with the investment of resources available under the national development plan, my aim is to achieve real progress in addressing the underlying causes of poor accessibility to certain services.</P>

      <P>There are three rates of subvention payable, £70, £95 and £120, in accordance with three levels of dependency, medium, high and maximum. The amount of funding allocated to supporting older people in private nursing homes has been significantly increased by this Government in recent years. For example, over £5 million in additional funding has been allocated in the current year to provide for an increase in the number of people in receipt of subventions, their higher levels of dependency &ndash; resulting in more people receiving the higher rates of subventions &ndash; and the change in the regulations whereby the ability of adult sons and-or daughters over 21 years of age to contribute is no longer taken into account. The amount made available for the scheme this year is £38.4 million.</P>
      <P>My priority is to ensure that health boards have adequate resources to meet increasing demands. The question of increasing the rates of subvention will be kept under review in light of the availability of funding and competing priorities.</P>

      <P>The provision of school health services, as an integral component of child health services, is the statutory responsibility of the health boards. Under the 1970 Health Act, a health board shall make available without charge a health examination and treatment services for pupils attending a national school, or a school which is not a national school at the discretion of the health board.</P>
      <P>As a result of the identification of the need for a review of child health services in the health strategy, "Shaping a Healthier Future", the chief executive officers of the health boards initiated a review of the services in question. This review resulted in the recent publication of the report "Best Health for Children" which covers children in the 0-12 year age range.</P>
      <P>The report contains a wide range of recommendations on all aspects of child health services. In so far as the school health service is concerned, the thrust of the report is for a more streamlined service which would be operated in a standardised way in all areas and which would be evaluated regularly to ensure that it is meeting the evolving health care needs of schoolchildren. Specific recommendations cover issues such as the management of the school health service, the roles of health service professionals, teachers and parents, the core programme for child health surveillance, meeting the needs of children with problems and provision of appropriate referral and treatment services.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officers have established a national conjoint child health committee and filled the post of national child health co-ordinator for the purpose of overseeing implementation of the recommendations of the report in the health boards. In addition, the national conjoint child health committee has recently commenced a review of adolescent health needs which will include examination of the health needs of the early school leaver and the educationally disadvantaged.</P>

      <P>The total number of beds at Naas General Hospital is 124. Of these 124 beds, 94 are in-patient beds formally approved under article 8 of the Health Services (In-patient) Regulations, 1991, and 30 are located in the psychiatric unit which was provided under phase one of the development.</P>
      <P>Prior to the commencement of phase two of the development the hospital provided the following facilities: entrance; out patients department; physical medical department; pharmacy department; operating department; intensive care and coronary care; administration-medical records; accident and emergency department; radiology department; geriatric day hospital; day services-endoscopy; in-patient beds; observation beds; chaplaincy department; autopsy-mortuary department; acute psychiatric beds; pathology.</P>
      <P>On completion of the development Naas General Hospital will have a total bed complement of 189 beds, including 25 day beds and 30 beds in the psychiatric unit provided under phase one of the development at the hospital. The phase two development includes the following in new accommodation: main entrance concourse; out patients department; physical medicine department; pharmacy department; operating department; intensive care and coronary care units; geriatric rehabilitation-assessment ward; administration-medical records department; accident and emergency department; radiology department; geriatric day hospital; day services department; in patient wards; chaplaincy department.</P>
      <P>Phase two of this development also provides for the alteration and refurbishment of the mortuary-post mortem department in its existing accommodation. The designation of hospital beds into medical, surgical or other categories is a matter for the management of the hospital concerned and is subject to service demand.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to say that the work on phase two of this development is progressing well and that there have been no alterations in respect of anticipated costs. I am confident that when the development is complete Naas General Hospital will be in a position to provide an enhanced level of care to its catchment area.</P>

      <QRef>[10199/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The incident referred to by the Deputy was caused by a problem which arose in December 1999 when work was being completed on the Blood Transfusion Service Board's computer system to make it year 2000 compliant. As a result, the computer check which identified any donations received from donors who were temporarily deferred did not function properly. The board's own staff identified the malfunction which was rectified as soon as it was discovered.</P>
      <P>When the computer problem was rectified, reports for December were re-run and two donations were identified which had been taken from donors who were temporarily deferred due to recent nose piercing in one case, and recent acupuncture from a non-medically registered practitioner in the other. On investigation, the BTSB found that both of the deferred donors attended at a clinic which was different to one previously attended, completed the medical questionnaire and omitted to give the information which had previously led to their deferrals. The vital security check when processing blood is the sensitive laboratory testing which is carried out on all donations. Both donations had been subjected to rigorous laboratory checks and were found to be safe. Nevertheless, the recall procedure was initiated immediately and resulted in one donation being recalled and discarded before use. Red cells and plasma from the second donation were also recalled and discarded, however platelets had been infused into one patient. The donor whose platelets had been infused was traced in early January and agreed to undergo further tests. Blood samples were obtained and tested negative for all viral markers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any potential breach of security is recorded by the BTSB and in turn is inspected by the Irish Medicines Board, which is the regulatory authority. In this instance, the BTSB notified the IMB on 4 January of the problem with the deferred donors and the IMB requested a report on the incident and on corrective actions. The IMB notified my Department on 7 January and the Department also requested the BTSB to provide a report on the incident as soon as possible. On 11 January the medical director of the BTSB made his report to the IMB and supplied a copy to my Department. As soon as final testing was completed on the donor whose blood had been infused, the BTSB gave the Department details of the tests which had been completed and the <Col N="965" /> results which, as I have already stated, were all negative.</P>
    <P>My Department has made available approximately £4 million to replace the existing computer system which was the original cause of the problem. The new system &ndash; Progesa &ndash; is in use in many other transfusion centres internationally. Implementation of the new software is under way and a period of parallel running will take place before the system goes live during the summer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 206 and 207 together.</P>
      <P>When the women and crisis pregnancy report was published in 1998 the view of my predecessor as Minister was that it would not have been appropriate to publish a major report containing recommendations while the consultation process leading to the preparation of the Green Paper on Abortion was under way. The report as published did not contain recommendations but did contain detailed findings and conclusions, based on the research undertaken. The research team which had undertaken the study was invited to make a submission to the interdepartmental working group which was preparing the Green Paper, and such a submission was made. Along with other submissions received, this was taken into account in the drafting of the Green Paper.</P>
      <P>The Green Paper on Abortion contained a detailed discussion of the social context of abortion as it involves Irish women and identified a range of issues regarding the availability of family planning and related services as well as the attitudes of young people to sexual behaviour, which impact on the incidence of unplanned and unwanted pregnancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional funding of £1 million in 1999 and a further £1.6 million in 2000 has been provided to the health boards to enable them to fund measures aimed at addressing the issue of unwanted pregnancy. Health boards are undertaking a range of initiatives in this area. The type of issues on which boards are being asked to concentrate when developing policy include the provision of services which are accessible to young people and which meet their needs in relation to issues such as confidentiality and hours of operation. Educational-promotional activities should <Col N="966" /> focus on such issues as the need for responsible sexual behaviour of young people at risk, increased awareness of pregnancy counselling services and the cultivation of more responsible attitudes to alcohol, with particular regard to alcohol and sexual activity.</P>
    <P>Where pregnancy counselling services are supported, boards have been asked to ensure that these are available on a drop-in basis or without any waiting period and that a choice of service provider is available. Steps to increase women's awareness of post-abortion counselling and of the need for medical check-ups are also being considered. Such check-ups also provide an opportunity for women to obtain advice on appropriate contraception for the future and thereby reduce the incidence of further unwanted pregnancies.</P>
    <P>In addition to measures which are being developed by health boards, my Department is at present planning a public awareness campaign which will aim to encourage sexually active young people to be responsible in their attitudes to relationships and to inform and educate them about the issues involved.</P>

      <P>The provision of technology for local authority public representatives is generally a matter for each local authority, and thus my Department is not providing direct funding for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of initiatives at an early stage of development to maximise the use of <Col N="967" /> information technology in the delivery of local authority services. In conjunction with local authorities, and with the Local Government Computer Services Board, my Department is working with the Departments of Finance and Taoiseach's on central funding for pilot projects. Two specific projects are: a pilot project on e-planning, being led by Kildare County Council, and a pilot project on e-procurement, being led by Kerry County Council. In addition, an office automation project involving the development and use of intranets in three local authorities is currently under evaluation; this project may potentially include the provision of appropriate information systems to councillors. While approval in principle has been agreed for the funding of these projects, the precise amount of funding has yet to be finalised.</P>
    <P>To underpin the efficiency-effectiveness agenda for local authorities, the local government fund is meeting the bulk of the capital costs for the implementation of their new financial management systems. These will provide a sound basis for improved business management generally, and will utilise the latest technologies. In addition, I am considering the use of local government fund moneys to actively encourage local authorities to undertake specific projects in the provision of improved services through innovative and new approaches to delivering quality services. This would obviously include the use of technology.</P>
    <P>My Department, in collaboration with local authorities, is working with other Government Departments on general strategic management initiative developments in the information and communications technology area, to ensure that local government plays its part in delivering services to its customers in an integrated and effective way. A sectoral policy document on the use of ICT in local government is being finalised at present, as a joint departmental and LGCSB initiative, and I hope to be in a position to publish the policy in the next number of weeks.</P>

It is important, however, that in the interests of overall planning and sustainable development, planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála should consider the broad environmental consequences when deciding on applications for development which are subject to integrated pollution control licensing. In this way a more holistic approach can be brought to the consideration of the overall effects on the locality of such developments.

      <P>The other free schemes are generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who pass a means test.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a fundamental review of the free schemes of this Department has been completed and will be published next week by the Policy Institute, Trinity College Dublin, in the "Studies in Public Policy" series.

      <P>In anticipation of the review findings, I announced two specific measures in budget 2000. These are the extension of the free schemes to all persons aged 75 years and over, regardless of their income and household composition and the extension of the free electricity allowance and free television licence to all carers in receipt of the carer's allowance and to carers who are caring for people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relatives allowance. Both of these measures will be implemented from October 2000 at an estimated full year cost of £6 million.</P>

      <P>Waterways Ireland, a North-South implementation body for inland waterways, was established on 2 December 1999 on foot of the British-Irish Agreement and the supplementary Implementation Bodies Agreement signed in March 1999. It has the functions of management, maintenance, development and restoration of certain inland navigable waterway systems throughout the island, principally for recreational purposes.</P>
      <P>On 2 December 1999, the body took responsibility for the Shannon-Erne Waterway, carrying out appropriate studies and appraisals on the possible restoration of the Ulster Canal and taking over control of Shannon-Erne Waterway Promotions Limited.</P>
      <P>With effect from 1 April 2000 the body assumed responsibility for the Erne system, the Shannon navigation, the Royal and Grand Canals, including the Barrow navigation, and the Lower Bann navigation. Other waterways may be added to the remit of the body in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="972" /> In the discharge of its management and development function principally for recreational purposes, the body will engage in promotion including marketing and development of the tourism and commercial potential of the inland waterways for which it has responsibility.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I have to advise the Deputy that the matter raised by him is one for consideration by Waterways Ireland in the first instance.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware I have to date made available over £100,000 for the reconstruction of a barge at Athy by a local community group.</P>

      <P>I understand from Údarás na Gaeltachta that senior management of an tÚdarás travelled to Malaysia last month to assess the progress of a project which has been agreed for the main factory on the Dungloe industrial estate. The principals of the company indicated that they will come to Ireland shortly to begin the implementation of the project and it is hoped that the enterprise will be in operation before the end of the year. Some projects and inquiries have been discussed for the second factory, originally built as an advance factory, on the Dungloe industrial estate. No specific project has been identified as yet for this second factory but an tÚdarás will continue in its efforts <Col N="973" /> to secure a suitable industry for it. Two businesses in the information technology sector have been secured by an tÚdarás for Teach Cheanada &ndash; the third business unit on the Dungloe industrial estate.</P>

      <P>I also indicated to the Deputy that I would advise him of the outcome of the case. While the person concerned was informed of my decision, I regret that, due to a misunderstanding, the Deputy was not also informed.</P>
      <P>In arriving at the decision to make a deportation order in this case, I considered the matter under the relevant provisions of the Immigration Act, 1999, and I do not consider that a re-evaluation of the case is warranted.</P>

    <P>I understand that community service orders are occasionally made in the Central Criminal Court and Circuit Courts, but I am informed by the courts service that there are no statistics available on these.</P>
    <P>I think it is only proper that I should point out to the Deputy that in the course of supplying the material for this reply, the Courts Service drew my attention to the fact that the material supplied to me by the service for reply to the Deputy's question 24286/99 on 23 November 1999 was incomplete. The statistics in that reply referred only to community service orders made in respect of indictable offences dealt with summarily by the District Court and did not incorporate community service orders made in respect of summary offences dealt with by the District Court. I am assured by the Courts Service that the reply to the Deputy's present question is as complete a response as the service can provide.</P>

I have since clarified with the Garda authorities the issue raised by the Deputy. I have been informed that the reference was intended to be to a particular housing scheme which is in the course of development. The expansion in both housing and popu<Col N="978" /> lation in Tramore, of which this scheme is an example, may have future policing implications.</P>
      <P>The list as set out in the reply was not meant to be exhaustive, but rather an indication of some of the demands on local policing.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the power of the gardaí to move people away from trouble areas under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, is undermined by the absence from the Act of any time limit before those persons can return to the area; and if he will amend this feature of the Act.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, allows the gardaí, in prescribed circumstances, to direct a person to either desist from acting in a particular manner or leave immediately the vicinity of the place concerned in a peaceable or orderly manner or both. The Deputy will appreciate that the manner in which this provision is implemented varies depending on the particular nature of the circumstances with which the gardaí are confronted. The central consideration is that the person who is the subject of a direction does not remain a threat to public order of the kind envisaged by the section.</P>
      <P>I understand that the provision &ndash; which was extensively debated in the Oireachtas when the legislation was being considered &ndash; was drafted on the basis of allowing sufficient flexibility to deal with the wide range of incidents which can arise while at the same time having regard to the rights of individuals.</P>
      <P>In any event, the Garda authorities have not indicated that the operation of the provision in question has given rise to any particular difficulties. I understand that the provisions of the 1994 Act are used extensively by the gardaí and I believe that it is widely accepted that the legislation has proved invaluable to the gardaí in dealing with public order issues.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the number of asylum seekers entering the country has increased dramatically in the past two years. The directorate for asylum support services, established in November 1999 under the aegis of my Department, is responsible, <i>inter alia</i>, for meeting the accommodation needs of asylum seekers. Following advertisements for accommodation placed in the media, it became clear that a sufficient supply of suitable privately owned accommodation was not available to meet the needs of asylum seekers and that other measures would need to be examined.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works, acting on behalf of my Department, has identified the Ballymullen Army barracks in Tralee as a site suitable for development under the asylum seeker accommodation programme. On 29 March 2000, I made an order under section 2 (2) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1993 which allows, by reason of emergency, for the development of the site. The order provides that the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development ) Acts 1963 &ndash; 1999 or the provisions of part XIII of the Local Government (Planning and Development ) Regulations, 1994 shall not apply to this development. It is intended that approximately 50 mobile homes will be located on the site.</P>

      <P>The Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission is currently completing the process of recruiting additional suitably qualified psychologists. As a result, my Department expects to be in a position to appoint up to 50 additional psychologists during the current year, which will double the present number of psychologists in NEPS. No new appointments of educational psychologists were made in 1999.</P>
      <P>The planning group set up by my Department in 1997 to examine the level of need for an educational psychological service and to make recommendations for the future, recommended that 200 psychologists would be required to provide a psychological service to all schools. As recommended in the report of the planning group, it is envisaged that there will be a fully operating psychological service to all schools at the end of a five-year development phase, i.e. by the end of the year 2004.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Educational Psychological Service does not operate a waiting list system. Psychologists work with schools and assist them in prioritising children for assessment. All of those prioritised are assessed within a short period of time. I am aware however that there are children awaiting assessment in those schools not yet <Col N="982" /> served by NEPS. A working group of the management committee of NEPS, including personnel from the Department of Health and Children and the health boards, is addressing this matter as a top priority. It is hoped that agreement will be reached shortly on structures and procedures for effective liaison between NEPS and the psychological services in the health board sector in relation to urgent requirements for assessments during the development phase of NEPS.</P>

      <P>My Department provides capitation grants towards the day to day running costs of primary schools. School authorities are required to supplement the capitation grant with a local contribution.</P>
      <P>In 1999 the local contribution was reduced from £10 per pupil to £8.50 per pupil in the case of mainstream schools, and from £9.50 per pupil to £5.50 per pupil in the case of schools designated as disadvantaged. I have recently announced that I have decided to further reduce the amount required by way of a local contribution. The amount of the reduction will be £1.50 per pupil in the case of schools designated as disadvantaged and £1 per pupil in the case of all other schools. The new rates that will therefore apply, with immediate effect, are £4.00 per pupil in the case of schools designated as disadvantaged and £7.50 per pupil in the case of all other schools.</P>
      <P>The unprecedented level of funding provided by this Government for primary schools has made it possible to ease the burden on local communities who have been so generous in their support of their local schools for many years.</P>

      <P>Schools eligible for additional teacher(s) will also receive a once-off grant of £200.</P>
      <P>Primary schools in which between four and fourteen, inclusive, non-English speaking non-national pupils are enrolled will receive grant assistance.</P>
      <P>Schools with between four and nine such pupils will receive grant assistance in the amount of £5,000 while schools with between ten and 14 will receive grant assistance in the amount of £7,500. This grant aid is intended to enable schools to take appropriate measures to improve the standard of English of non-national pupils with significant English language deficits. Schools with three or fewer such pupils are expected to provide for the educational provisions of those pupils from their existing resources.</P>
      <P>Eleven application forms have issued to primary schools in connection with the grant aid for refugees and seven schools have completed applications submitted to my Department.</P>
      <P>At second level, my Department has allocated approximately 12 whole-time equivalent teaching posts in the current school year specifically to cater for the needs of children who do not speak English as their first language. Individual post-primary schools or vocational education committees may apply for additional teaching hours in respect of non-national students who may have particular English language deficits.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides that the arrangements in relation to the allocation of teachers to cater for the education of refugees and asylum seekers will be subject to review. In addition, the refugee language support unit, established under the auspices of Trinity College, will be provided with a budget of the order of £1.2 million over the period of the programme to co-ordinate action for language tuition for refugees to assist them along the pathway to independent living.

      <P>My Department has approved the establishment of a special class for children with autism at Ballyduff National School, County Waterford. It is envisaged that this special class will commence in September 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's inspectorate is also investigating the possibility of establishing a further special class for children with autism in a school in the Waterford City area. It is expected that a decision on the precise location <Col N="988" /> of this special class will be taken in the near future. </P>
    <P>Special classes for pupils with autism operate at a maximum pupil teacher ratio of 6:1. Each class also has the support of a special needs assistant and the pupils attract a special increased rate of capitation funding. In addition, the relevant health board provides an outreach support service for the pupils.</P>
    <P>My Department also provides resource teacher support for children with autism attending ordinary primary schools on a fully integrated basis. Under a Government decision of October 1998 all such children now have an automatic entitlement to the special support services they require to enable them to gain maximum benefit from the education system.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to make special support services available to children with autism, including children in the Waterford area, in line with assessed needs.</P>
