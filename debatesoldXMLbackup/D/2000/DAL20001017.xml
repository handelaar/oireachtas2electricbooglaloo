    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Estimate for my Department for 2000, totalling £85.294 million, was approved by the Dáil on 20 April 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order. We are having difficulty hearing the Taoiseach. I do not know if his microphone is working but we should be able to hear him when he is giving figures and data.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to that the Estimate was considered by the Committee on Finance and the Public Service in accordance with the procedures set out in Standing Orders. It is only in the context of that process that the matter of a general statement on the Estimates arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the specific questions in relation to Sports Campus Ireland, an allocation of £10 million was included in my Department's Esti<Col N="202" /> mate for this year. That allocation was made to facilitate the start-up of the project which my Department initiated. Now that the project is off the ground, responsibility for taking it forward has been given to the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, and this will be reflected in the Estimates for next year. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, answered questions in the House last week in which he dealt with the details of the project.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on the project from my Department's Vote to date in 2000 has been £113,232. Payments amounting to over £0.5 million are being processed at present, mainly in respect of office accommodation costs and studies into individual elements of the development such as the aquatic and leisure centre and the indoor arena. My Department spent £380,033 last year on the initial feasibility study entitled A Stadium for the New Century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that all of us on this side of the House are anxious that elements of this project go ahead, such as the aquatic facility which is essential for the Special Olympics, which we support and which we must be able to host properly? Does he accept, however, that there is increasing doubt about the viability of this project? On the Government's own estimates the original cost has escalated from £280 million to £550 million and that £550 million does not even cover the £90 million for the relocation of the Abbotstown facility, the £20 million for the development of associated infrastructure around the stadium, the £20 million for road, rail and bus services to the stadium or the provision for cost escalation or overruns. Is the Taoiseach aware that the estimated cost of this project would allow for the spending of £5.42 million on recreational facilities and swimming pools, many of which must be closed because their roofs are leaking &ndash; in each Deputy's constituency? For example, it would cost £3 million to replace the swimming pool in Ballinasloe, the roof of which is leaking. Does the Taoiseach agree there is a greater need for recreational facilities throughout the country, where many young people have nowhere to meet their friends except in a public house and that, therefore, this facility may not be the best use of limited resources for the promotion of sport and recreation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Deputy Bruton's support for the aquatic centre. That is the first element of the overall campus which must move forward. The tenders have just been received and examined and the detailed contract arrangements for that will be entered into between now and Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost for the stadium element of this project was, and still is, £281 million. The feasibility study was based on that and all the examinations carried out by the interim and advisory board were based on that. The 15,000 capacity multiple sport indoor arena, the medical centre, the admin<Col N="203" /> istration blocks and the other facilities were not, of course, covered by the £281 million. Therefore, one cannot make a comparison &ndash; I am not sure the Deputy is doing so &ndash; between the £281 million and the £550 million because they relate to different elements. The £281 million relates to the stadium only and the campus involves all the other initiatives.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is correct about the infrastructural elements. The initial report stated that Fingal County Council would require £13 million and of course there are transport initiatives. From what the chairman of the body has told me of the discussions with the local residents of Blanchardstown, the 15 committees, they are raising issues about the transport element. They will all need to be facilitated, as will the movement of staff. However, if this country is to develop a proper sports campus, it will cost money. I have long held the view that the amount of money spent on sport, leisure and recreation is paltry. We increased the health budget by 56% &ndash; £1.5 billion in three rounds of Estimates. I have no objection to the spending of that amount, or more for that matter, on health, but if we are to do as other countries have been doing for a long time, that is, spend money on prevention, the other end, the health bills, might not be as excessive or at least could be used more effectively.</P>
    <P>That said, in the past few years, now that there is a Department with responsibility for sport, tourism and leisure, the infrastructure is being put into local projects, each of which is important. I am a great supporter of and believer in recreational facilities, club halls, parish halls and facilities for county grounds for all sports and for club grounds. We have seen an enormous increase in recent years, right through the 1990s and in the life of this Government, in those areas. Under the national development plan, £41 billion has been allocated and a small amount of that has been allocated to sport. Even if this costs £1 billion, which it will not, it is a small proportion of what we spend in other areas.</P>
    <P>Sport has not been recognised since the foundation of the State. There were always areas that were more important, and that is why we are in this situation in regard to national sporting grounds, with the exception of Croke Park. Croke Park is the only sporting ground which comes anywhere near a good ground, but it lacks facilities, including transport and parking facilities. It has no facilities other than a stadium. It has no warm-up facilities which you would find in any collegiate ground elsewhere in the world. That is the difficulty for this country and it is a difficulty I would like to see addressed. It cannot be addressed in a year or two but it can be in this decade and that should be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept, as all of us on this side of the House do, there is a good case for spending at least £1 billion on sport? However, there are some on this side of <Col N="204" /> the House, at least, who would question whether it should all go into one project in one place, a large part of which will go on spectator facilities rather than on facilities for those taking part in sport. Does the Taoiseach agree that once this goes beyond the point of no return in contractual terms, the money has to be spent and, therefore, will not be available for any other projects such as the ones I mentioned where there are many schools without sports halls and so on?</P>
      <P>When is the point of contractual no return on the stadium element? At what date does the Taoiseach expect he will be committed financially to going ahead with the stadium to an extent that no subsequent Government with a different policy to his would be in a position to modify because of contractual commitments? I think the Taoiseach will accept that while we are united in our commitment to put £1 billion into sport, there is legitimate room for argument about whether it should all go primarily into one project or whether the £1 billion could be spread more profitably throughout the country. I imagine any one of the Deputies listening could think of many ways to spend £5.5 million in their constituency &ndash; that is the equivalent of the cost of this one project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept Deputy Bruton's point. Even if we did not have a campus and sports section and regardless of my views, I would like to see the money spent on sport. Down through the years, through no fault of the Deputy's or mine, we always found different ways to spend money. It will be some time before it comes to that. The contractual commitment on the aquatic leisure centre will be made in the next two months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The indoor arena is the next part. It will be a multi-purpose indoor and outdoor arena with training halls and pitches which will be used by all sports. There will be a sports, science and medicine centre which will be easy to plan because it will be based on the models in other countries. There are many of these centres throughout Europe. There will be headquarters for sports organisations. The question of the stadium will then arise. I understand the board is carrying out ongoing feasibility studies and examinations of design. While the feasibility study on the stadium was carried out by Price Waterhouse last year, it will look at more modern designs as it proceeds. It will be some time next year before they make any decision on that. The urgency for the next six months lies in some other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that we have significant sums of money, no one would disagree with the desirability of investing in a sporting infrastructure that stretches from the local parish and community to international competitions. I welcome, <Col N="205" /> in principle, the commitment the Government has made to this project.</P>
      <P>However, I am concerned already by the very loose set of costings and accountancy parameters that seem to apply to today's answer and which applied to the reply of the Minister, Deputy McDaid, last week. For example, does the Taoiseach agree there has been a substantial overrun in the 15 comparative studies of stadia of similar size to the one that is being costed at £281 million? Closer to home, there was a substantial increase, above and beyond construction inflation or changes in the original design, in the cost that was originally estimated for the port access tunnel and the original price that was signed off by way of public contract, which the Taoiseach was happy to announce last week.</P>
      <P>I am concerned this project might not be properly implemented because of poor planning. The figures at this stage seem to belong in fantasy land. Will the Taoiseach confirm that the £281 million includes the donation from a private individual?</P>
      <P>I have two specific questions arising from that observation. First, to whom is this private limited company, CSID &ndash; Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Company &ndash; accountable? Is it accountable to the Department of the Taoiseach or to the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation? Second, can the Taoiseach give some indication of the kind of moneys that are being prepared for the allocation to the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation in the budget? When will the taxpayer, the people who are ultimately accountable, get a clear indication of what will be the real capital cost and annual operating cost of this project?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Deputy's supportive remarks for what the Minister, Deputy McDaid and I have said. There is, perhaps, some confusion about this. The original Price Waterhouse report was on just the stadium and not any other element of the campus. The price in that report was £281 million. The additional elements, to which I have referred, are what bring it up to £550 million.</P>
      <P>The board stated it wanted to do much of this on the basis of public private partnerships, which is what has happened elsewhere. There has been a great deal of consultation with the Australians on this because they have the biggest infrastructural element. The Office of Public Works were the managers of it, with the other people in the design team. The estimated overall cost is £550 million. Some £150 million of that will come from public private partnerships and £50 million was donated by J. P. McManus to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Quinn &ndash; and this point was also made by Deputy John Bruton &ndash; there has been a cost overrun on all the stadia in Europe and outside it. We are already seeing that in the stadium being built here and the proposed one. In regard to the other infrastructural matters, the team is talking to CIE and others about <Col N="206" /> transport, rail and all the other issues and the overall cost.</P>
    <P>The board will answer to the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. However, I said from the start that it should also report twice a year to a committee of the House, so that everything will be seen to be up front. They will answer to the Department but will present themselves to a committee of the House. While the projection is that it will be finished in 2005 and I hope it will be, realistically it will have to be monitored. I agree with what the Deputy said about planning, construction, size and the over-runs on a project that will run seven if not more years and that that type of control needs to be maintained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is normal practice in most capital projects that a final agreement is not arrived at by the Department of Finance, which I assume has some input into this project, until a business plan is provided which demonstrates clearly and beyond doubt that the project can generate enough revenue on an annual current basis or will get a subvention from the State on an annual current basis. When will the capital sum be signed off and the estimated operational running costs be finalised, including revenue from the public private partnerships? Will this House be consulted before the final decision to go ahead is made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised three points. The Department of Finance has been totally involved in the feasibility study on the stadium. A detailed feasibility study or plan was not conducted on the other elements. They will all have to be assessed and cleared individually. I have opposed the idea that they could be considered together.</P>
      <P>On public private partnerships, a number of Members, including Deputy Allen and Deputy O'Shea, have looked at the reports on other countries. The best way is to allow the private sector in from the earliest stage where they design, build, manage and stay with a project. That is what has happened on the ten best stadiums in the world. We should not go against what has proved to be the best plan. That is not to take away from the Office of Public Works type management of the overall contract. At this stage the aquatic centre will have gone through all the mechanisms but the others will have to go through those positions as we move forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Is the Taoiseach aware that in the 12 months since the project was first promoted his Department has not had any consultation with the elected members of Fingal County Council? Will he accept that a project of this size, should it go ahead, has massive implications for the large residential community in the area, particularly in west Dublin? Will he give an undertaking that his Department will have an early meeting with the elected representatives of the people in that area? Is the Taoiseach as <Col N="207" /> alarmed as I am by the potential detrimental impact on the quality of life of residents in the greater Blanchardstown area, of 14,400 cars, which is probably an under estimate as all traffic predictions to date have been under estimated? Will he agree that people attend in large numbers &ndash; as they do at Croke Park at the weekend &ndash; at the same time for these events and leave at the same time? Does he understand that residents in the greater Blanchardstown west Dublin area will be prisoners of massive traffic gridlock on any day in which there is a major event at such a stadium? Therefore, it is absolutely critical that a rail link is provided at the site, not at Ashtown. Mr. J. P. McManus will be able to get in and out of his helicopter but the thousands of residents of west Dublin will be left with the major problem, the noise and the pollution. With regard to the remaining 185 acres of the site, PriceWaterhouseCoopers more than hinted that it should be sold for development. In view of the huge amount of development in west Dublin, including the doubling and trebling of densities in residential areas to up to 30 units of housing per acre, will the Taoiseach give an undertaking that the 185 acres will be preserved as green belt and will be tied into the Tolka Valley Park as a resource for the people of west Dublin and, indeed, for all citizens?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Higgins asked three questions. With regard to the first, I am aware there have been detailed discussions with Fingal County Council but the answer is yes, I will ensure that the public representatives of the area are briefed on those deliberations and discussions. I am not privy to what is happening in that regard but I will ensure that they speak to the individual political representatives.</P>
      <P>Second, I am aware, as are most Members, of the impact caused by the arrival of up to 70,000 people at a venue each week. I am blessed to have lived beside such a venue all my life and beside the smaller venue of Tolka Park where up to 5,000 people might arrive for an event. I am also aware of the advisability of having a rail link. While I am blessed to have a rail link beside my home, it closes down when there is a match. That is not very handy. It is a better idea to have a rail link which will transport people to and from a venue and does not have to close down on safety grounds when there is a match. That should be planned and that is the intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Third, the Deputy asked about the overall site. The company, Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Company, will publish advertisements outlining the terms of the competition to develop an architectural and environmental framework plan for the site. The site consists of 500 acres and the intention is that the winning framework plan will suggest a logical and coherent approach to accommodating Sports Campus Ireland, a major parkland amenity to serve the community and the public of the Blanchardstown <Col N="208" /> and surrounding areas, an education project to be selected and complementary leisure projects, all of which will respect the built and natural heritage that exists in Abbotstown. That competition will be managed by the Royal Association of Architects in Ireland in association with Campus and Stadium Ireland.</P>
    <P>The winning framework plan will suggest access and transport solutions to the site as well as an overall policy approach to the quality of the architecture that will be expected. The winning team of architects will develop the detailed development plan for the site and will act as consultants to Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited for the duration of the project. It is expected that both national and international firms of the highest calibre will respond to the exciting challenge.</P>
    <P>The achievement of that intention will, I hope, mean that there will not be piecemeal or undesirable development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i> (Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Is that a commitment that the 185 acres will not be developed for housing or commercial reasons? There is already plenty of land for those purposes in the general area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot tie the hands of whoever will win this contract. The architectural and environmental framework plan will take account of the matters I have outlined. It is important that this is followed and that the professionals deal with it &ndash; the last thing we need is piecemeal ideas. This is the best way of securing the proper development of the site and the protection of the interests of the community and the public, not to mention the heritage and the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has entered a new element, the public private partnership, for a project that will cost up to £1 billion. Since the GAA will be in Croke Park, the FAI will be in Eircom Park and we do not know the intentions of the IRFU, who will use the stadium to ensure it is sufficiently viable to attract a public private partnership? Has it crossed the Taoiseach's mind that notwithstanding the capital investment in the project, there will be a huge revenue charge on the Exchequer on an annual basis? Has it crossed his mind that we could be going down the road to a repeat of the Millennium Dome? The only difference is that the Millennium Dome can be disposed of whereas the National Stadium will be a permanent millstone around the neck of the taxpayer and the sporting bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a long time since we spent £1 billion in half an hour in this Chamber during Question Time. Does the Taoiseach believe that not just he but Deputies on this side of the House are losing a grip on reality here? If one looks back at newspaper reports when the £50 million was offered by this mysterious donor, is it not the case&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>Given newspaper reports at the time, is it the case that when the £50 million was offered by J. P. McManus, the cost of the project was approximately £100 million? It is now £550 million on the admission of the Minister for Tourism, Sports and Recreation &ndash; a number of items, some of which Deputy Allen listed, are not included in that figure. How will the stadium be run and what will take place in it when built? If this city needs an 80,000 seater stadium, I am sure it has not passed the Taoiseach's attention above any Member in the House that we already have an 80,000 seater stadium. The Taoiseach will be aware that when the work being carried out in Croke Park is concluded there is the prospect of a <i>rapprochement</i> with the rugby fraternity. The Taoiseach knows this better than any Member in the House because he has virtually colonised the place. How will another 80,000 seater stadium be filled? Eircom has separate approval for a 45,000 seater stadium. All the resources of the State are being utilised to try to ensure there is a stop put to that project. Is it not the case that during the recent planning approval by South Dublin County Council the Department of Defence entered a last minute objection, after approval had been cleared with the Baldonnel authorities, that would involve, if implemented, lowering the Naas Road in certain parts and knocking down Saggart and Rathcoole?</P>

      <P>I am doing it by way of question because it is about time we began to look at what is involved in this project. This may have been a brave project when envisaged, but now that the Taoiseach knows it will cost approximately £800 million, is it not time to look at the run-down swimming pools, the towns with no swimming pools, the young boys' football clubs throughout the city and country where there are no changing rooms, the athletic clubs that are under-provided for, the completely derelict infrastructure in every town and village throughout the country&mdash;</P>

This needs resources and if this folly goes ahead it will absorb all the resources that would otherwise be available to build up the sports infrastructure, of which we are all in favour. Does the Taoiseach believe that, rather than signing irrevocable contracts for whomsoever will form the next Government, he ought to look at the figures? If London, with a population of 11 million people, can ill-afford one Wembley Stadium&mdash;</P>

I have listened to approximately five minutes of questions from two Deputies and 30 seconds into my reply they do not want to hear the answer. I will be glad to give replies. Let us be frank about this. Some people who oppose this stadium did little or nothing to develop sport in Ireland when they had an opportunity to do so. Spending on sport by successive Governments was a crying disgrace. I established a departmental infrastructure to deal with sport. Most grounds <Col N="212" /> and clubs in every constituency will receive substantial capital funds for sport this year&mdash;</P>

We are spending money and shall continue to do so, and I hope people for years to come will continue to spend money.</P>
      <P>I refer to the question about who will use the stadium. It is a national stadium and all sporting organisations will use it.

      <P>Deputy Allen knows better than most that almost every time there has been an opportunity with regard to any of the major sports to hold an international event which did not involve Ireland, it has been necessary to turn it down because facilities were not available.

If we are <Col N="215" /> ever to bring ourselves into the real world in terms of sport at local and national levels, Ireland requires state of the art facilities. This is an attempt to provide such facilities. It has been identified since the mid-1980s that this needs to be done. It will be good value for the small proportion of capital money that is required.

      <askee>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the difficulties being experienced by trawler skippers in attracting manpower to go out on fishing trips which can take five to eight days; his views on whether fishermen have a most difficult job in a most hostile environment; and the plans he has to help the fishing industry.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The fishing industry, like other industries, is experiencing growing difficulties in labour supply. A number of factors are having a serious impact on the sector's ability to attract new entrants and to retain existing crews. The buoyant economic climate generally and the highly competitive labour market is imposing pressures. The labour shortage is also being exacerbated by the adverse impact of increased fuel costs. The hazardous nature of the job and the unsocial hours in the industry are also key factors. Working conditions, remuneration and career structures, safety and training are issues to be addressed in that context.</P>
      <P>In response to the emerging labour supply and demand challenges facing the seafood industry, the training and employment task force was established late last year and is finalising its analysis and recommendations. I expect to receive the report of the task force before the end of the year. The task force has a comprehensive remit to address all the factors impacting on employment in the seafood sector as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work of the task force, which includes industry representatives, is critical and timely given the degree to which manpower difficulties in the sector have increased over the past 12 months, notably due to the escalation in fuel prices. I look forward to receiving its final report <Col N="218" /> and to working with the industry to deliver a comprehensive strategic response to the employment challenge. In the meantime, options to alleviate the immediate crisis as a result of high fuel prices are being urgently assessed, including measures which would assist the industry to retain and attract crews.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for the briefing I received from the Civil Service since I was appointed spokesperson for the marine and natural resources. It was extremely good and it could not have happened unless the Minister wanted it to happen and I thank him for that.</P>
      <P>There are two or three points I have noticed from meetings with fishermen throughout the country. One is that fishermen&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will. Is the Minister aware of the extreme difficulty skippers have in recruiting manpower for their boats? Is he aware that there are occasions when full manpower cannot be recruited? Does he accept that there should be some change in the system of personal taxation given the hostile environment in which fishermen work? They are out of port for five to ten days at a time and there is probably no other living to be made in the country which is as difficult. Can the Minister see a role for a change in personal taxation? What is the Minister's view outside those of the consultants or the study group?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Connaughton on his appointment as Fine Gael spokesman on the marine and natural resources and I wish him the best of luck. I am delighted to assist by whatever means through my Department in giving a briefing because it is only right that that should happen. The former Fine Gael spokesman was present on the previous occasion I answered questions and I thank him for his courtesy to me and the good job of work he did in his brief. I wish him well in his new brief.</P>
      <P>I accept that there is a problem with the crewing of the fishing fleet at present. That is due in no small way to the unsocial nature of the work and the long days at sea in difficult conditions. It is only when I came into this job that I realised that fishermen are out at sea for up to ten days, sometimes in very poor conditions. We are now renewing the fleet and working and living conditions are improving considerably. There is a specific difficulty and I have discussed this with the fishing industry around the coast. We are very much aware of that difficulty and I am considering various measures by which we can try to assist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industry has put forward a number of proposals, including the one the Deputy mentioned. These are being considered in several different Departments at present. They are budgetary mat<Col N="219" /> ters which, in the final analysis, are for the Minister for Finance. The specific question the Deputy put to me is one which will be considered in the budgetary context. It would be remiss of me at this stage to state my views other than to say that I will certainly fight a battle with colleagues to try to obtain the best deal for the fishing industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister looking for this taxation measure? Fishermen will expect no less of the Minister than for him to say what he thinks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of proposals have been put to me, including the proposal the Deputy outlined. I am in favour of obtaining the best deal I can for fishermen. I do not want to be specific because that would give out the wrong signals. There are difficulties, and the Deputy will be well aware of this, with one sector trying to obtain a tax break over other sectors. We are in discussions with the Department of Finance at present. We have agreed with the industry that its representatives will meet representatives of four different Departments &ndash; the Departments of Finance, the Taoiseach, the Marine and Natural Resources and Social, Community and Family Affairs &ndash; to examine the question of employment in the sector and the difficulties with the number of crewmen who are walking off ships.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Expenditure under the fleet modernisation and renewal measures of the Fisheries Operational Programme 1994-1999 has been ongoing during 2000 as projects come on stream. The introduction of the 29 new vessels supported under the Whitefish Fleet Renewal Programme 1998-2000 has been under way throughout the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="220" /> In parallel and following agreement with the Commission during the year on the Community Support Framework 2000-2006, the new round of investment support strategies for the fleet and the seafood industry as a whole is being put in place. Under the national development plan, an unprecedented level of funding totalling £171 million will underpin overall investment strategies for the sector. My Department is working with BIM to finalise the detailed grant schemes which will strategically focus on the enhancement of the safety, quality and competitiveness of the whitefish fleet. The fleet modernisation programme will continue, therefore, to target improvements in operational safety, working conditions, efficiency, handling and quality. The significant difficulties which have emerged in fuel prices and labour shortages combined with declines in fish stocks are also factors to be addressed. In this climate, we must ensure that short and long-term strategies are targeted to secure the viability and competitiveness of the fleet now and into the future.</P>
    <P>There is a distinction to be drawn between modernisation and upgrading of existing vessels and the introduction of new replacement vessels. In that context, the Deputy will appreciate that the timing and nature of incentives to support the entry of further new vessels into the fleet requires careful evaluation. The majority of new boats assisted under the renewal scheme are just coming on stream. The impact on existing fleet structure and fishing opportunities of these new vessels has not been fully quantified at this stage. An economic evaluation of the impact of the renewal scheme together with an analysis of financial performance to date in light of all relevant factors is both prudent and essential. There is general consensus within the industry on this point. I have requested BIM to commission the necessary analysis and my Department and BIM will work together to finalise recommendations to me in light of the findings of that evaluation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify that there was no suspension of the fleet modernisation grant? If that is the case, why were many boat owners who needed a modernisation programme immediately not able or allowed to apply this year? I am led to believe that the Department has not yet allowed application forms to be released to them and that it is assessing this part of the scheme. If that is correct, will the Minister let the House know why this is so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is wrong in his proposition. The whitefish renewal scheme was completed under the old programme. Some 28 new vessels were brought in under that. The next scheme will be under the new national plan. Consequently, we are in the process of putting that scheme together. We have not yet made a final decision on whether there will be a continuation of the whitefish renewal scheme with new boats, as was the case in the past. There is a very significant reason for this review and we must make a careful evaluation of the performance of <Col N="221" /> the new boats that have entered the fleet. It would be dangerous to proceed with a further renewal programme in respect of the white fish fleet, particularly if we were to endanger the efforts of those who wish to purchase new boats. We must be very conscious of the position <i>vis-à-vis </i>quota and stocks and the fact that we do not have a scheme which is properly thought out and evaluated.</P>
      <P>That is not to say that we will not be proceeding with a significant programme of renewing and upgrading existing boats. Indeed, we will be replacing a number of these vessels. However, I would be concerned about becoming involved in a further renewal scheme without first carefully quantifying the success of the existing fleet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring specifically to the modernisation of existing boats. The fishermen are extremely angry with the Minister and they have stated that another year has passed without action being taken. Many of these individuals want to modernise their vessels. The Common Fisheries Policy will be considered in the next two years and if we are not up to speed we will face a situation similar to that which obtained in 1972. Does the Minister agree there is a need to do as much as possible now before the Common Fisheries Policy is debated again?</P>

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself with the safety procedures at sea in view of the recent tragic shipping disasters off our coastline; the plans he has to provide further protection for trawlers at sea; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am committed to ensuring the highest levels of safety at sea which can only be achieved by a three-pronged approach comprising statutory regulation and enforcement, the promotion of safety awareness and the provision of the highest quality marine emergency services.</P>
      <P>As regards the tragic accidents that occurred off the west coast recently, these vessels were not part of the Irish fleet and, as such, were not subject to the safety regime which applies to Irish-registered vessels. That being said, every vessel operating in or transiting our search and rescue region is entitled to and will receive appropriate protection from our emergency services. My Department, in partnership with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, has established marine search and rescue services which are second to none in Europe in terms of resources, readiness, training and management.</P>
      <P>In terms of the prevention of accidents at sea, my aim is to ensure that the appropriate regulatory framework is in place to ensure that all Irish registered vessels operating to and from Ireland are constructed, maintained and operated to acceptable international safety standards. To that end, a programme of work is currently being undertaken in my Department to update our maritime law and ensure that all EU Council directives and all relevant international maritime safety conventions, including amendments to SOLAS &ndash; safety of life at sea &ndash; and STCW &ndash; standards of training, certification and watchkeeping &ndash; are fully implemented. The enforcement of these regulations is carried out by the marine survey office of my Department.</P>
      <P>My Department is committed to an ongoing campaign of safety awareness. This work is undertaken in conjunction with a number of State agencies and other bodies such as the RNLI.</P>
      <P>I will now address the question of protection for trawlers at sea. Since publication of the report of the fishing vessel safety review group in 1996, it has been a priority for my Department to implement its recommendations and objectives to the greatest possible extent. In 1999 my Department established a fishing vessels safety implementation group to assess progress and identify further priority areas for action. A harmonised safety regime for fishing vessels over 24 metres in length was brought into force in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="223" />
      <i>Additional Information.</i>Further priority areas for action were identified and as a result safety regulations for vessels of 12 to 24 metres and six to 12 metres have been drafted and it is expected that they will be in place very shortly. A code of safety practice for vessels under six metres is also being developed and four additional training instructors have been appointed by Bord Iascaigh Mhara arising from the new radio regulations. In addition, £500,000 has been provided in my Department's Vote this year to establish a network of offshore weather and research buoys which will do much to improve weather forecasting and safety at sea.</P>
    <P>The development of a comprehensive safety programme for the sea fishing sector involves ongoing consultation with the fishing industry, which has a vitally important part to play in developing a safety culture among fishermen. A formal liaison process has been established between the fishing vessel safety implementation group and the industry, which is working very well.</P>

      <P>I know the Minister shares my view that the two accidents to which my question referred involved a terrible loss of life. We sympathise with the families of those who died. It makes no difference whether those individuals were Spanish or Irish, these accidents were major tragedies. I fully appreciate that the two trawlers were not sailing under the Irish flag, but, according to the information at the Department's disposal at present, did the crews involved seek the assistance of our rescue services? What went so terribly wrong to allow these two horrendous accidents to happen?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Investigations are being carried out into both accidents and it would be irresponsible to speculate on what went wrong. It is clear that these were two freak accidents and I join Deputy Connaughton in offering our sympathy to everyone involved. I have already communicated my sympathies to my counterparts in Spain and France.</P>
      <P>There was a great deal of bad luck involved in both cases and regardless of the precautions one takes, accidents will happen. It is particularly significant that our search and rescue services and coastguard were successful in rescuing some members of the crews of both trawlers. I thank the communities along the Connemara coast for the ongoing and significant efforts they are making to search the shoreline to find the remaining bodies.</P>

    <P>With regard to the Minister's comment about putting in place an appropriate regulatory framework, will he indicate the aspects of the SOLAS Convention and international maritime laws relating to safety which have not yet been trans<Col N="224" /> posed into Irish law? Does he intend to introduce legislation to give effect to the appropriate regulatory framework to which he referred? When can we expect those proposals to be brought forward?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Work is proceeding on the preparation of legislation. However, I cannot provide a timescale regarding when this work will be completed. We are working on updating our laws to ensure that all EU Council directives and maritime safety conventions, including the amendments to which the Deputy referred, are included in the legislation. As already stated, that legislation is in preparation but the pace is slow because of the amount of other legislation under preparation in the Department at present. The size of the workload in the parliamentary counsel's office means that several items of legislation must be dealt with before that to which I referred.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest>the progress made with regard to the identification of suitable sites for offshore wind farms; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[22028/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The role of my Department in relation to offshore electricity generation stations is to issue foreshore licences to allow the investigation of the suitability of sites on the foreshore and, in the event that the investigations prove any of the sites to be suitable, to consider applications for foreshore leases to allow for offshore electricity generation projects to proceed.</P>
      <P>The identification of suitable sites is a matter for intending developers, having regard to current or imminent technologies, access to the national grid and other issues of a technical and financial nature which are outside the competence of my Department. The technical issues will be ones which will largely be within the competence of the Commission for Electricity Regulation, which is in place to regulate the generation and supply market, or within the competence of the Minister for Public Enterprise whose Department is responsible for policy development in relation to green electricity and indeed electricity generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently four companies hold foreshore licences to allow investigation of the suitability of sites off the east coast. Of these, one is actively being investigated by Sure Partners. Work to date has concentrated on preparation of an environ<Col N="225" /> mental impact assessment and examination of the suitability of the Arklow Bank from the point of view of stability, make up and so on.</P>
    <P>The active investigations show that the bank is primarily a sand base and that there is little flora or fauna in the area. Installation of an anemometer to allow measurement of wind speeds and direction over the banks will commence in the near future. One other company, the Kish Consortium, is known to have been carrying out wind measurements for some time but as the company is not using the foreshore for such investigations no foreshore licence is necessary for such work.</P>
    <P>The Kish Consortium and the two other licensees, Harland and Wolff and Wind Farm Developments Limited intend to activate their foreshore licences and commence on-site investigations in April next.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister identify the seven sites where investigation is being undertaken? He has already identified two sites.</P>
      <P>I understand the licences have been issued for four years. When does the Minister expect definitive proposals for the development of offshore wind farms? Does he consider the Foreshore Act an adequate legislative mechanism for dealing with applications for the development of offshore wind farms? The framers of the Act in the 1930s can hardly have anticipated the development of wind farms off shore. Does the Minister have plans to develop new procedures for the assessment of such applications?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will provide a map for the Deputy and for the Oireachtas Library showing the locations of the various research exercises which are being undertaken at present.</P>
      <P>I cannot say when definitive proposals will be received because that is a matter for the industry. However, licence holders are confident that electricity will be produced in a short time.</P>
      <P>I opened this matter to public consulation to give the general public and industry interests an opportunity to contribute to the debate. I am satisfied that sufficient procedures are in place to deal with applications. Because the technology is new we have opened the debate to public consultation. There is no pressing demand for legislation or new regulations but I will keep an open mind on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister has not mentioned wind farm development on the west or south-west coasts when the prevailing winds are from the south-west and west. Will lack of access to the national grid be an impediment to the development of offshore wind farms? The south-western, western and north-western coastlines do not have access to the national grid. How can offshore wind farming be developed in areas which do not have access to the national grid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept Deputy Sheehan's point that the winds blow wild off the west and south-<Col N="226" /> west coasts and particularly off the coast of west Cork. However, the siting of wind farms off those coasts would not be easy and would demand private sector investment. Some research is being carried out but because of the difficult conditions in the west, the east coast is a much better proposition.</P>
      <P>If there is a successful outcome there will be access to the national grid and I would strongly encourage that. A research programme involving co-operation between the Marine Institute and Harland and Wolff is in place. This is designed to create electricity from wave energy off the west and south-west coasts and is very promising.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98, 118 and 126 together.</P>
      <P>In January 2000 the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company was granted a foreshore lease for a term of 99 years under section 2 of the Foreshore Act, 1933, for the purpose of the construction, use and maintenance of the marina and recreational development on the foreshore in Dún Laoghaire Harbour. This lease included a provision for the underletting of the marina to Marina Marketing and Management Limited. Consent was subsequently granted in September 2000 for the sub-leasing of the area of foreshore relating to the marina to Karnool Limited which is legally and beneficially owned by Marina Marketing and Management Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with section 23 of the Harbours Act, 1996, the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company was granted approval in December 1999, with the <Col N="227" /> consent of the Minister for Finance, to borrow money for the construction of breakwaters and the provision of traffic management facilities for the marina at Dún Laoghaire Harbour.</P>
    <P>My Department also provided, with the consent of the Department of Finance, a £3 million equity, and a sum of £850,000 in grant aid was also secured from the Ireland Wales EU Maritime INTERREG Community Initiative. I support fully the endeavours of the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company in bringing this project to fruition.</P>
    <P>As regards discussions or correspondence with the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company and Marina Marketing and Management Limited the position is as follows. Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company advised my Department in May 1999 of its intention to enter into a contract with Marina Marketing and Management Limited to build and operate the marina at Dún Laoghaire Harbour. The harbour company advised that the selection was based on the recommendation of independent consultants following a tendering process under the terms of which eight separate proposals were considered and evaluated.</P>
    <P>In May of this year I met representatives of the coal harbour users group who raised concerns regarding the future of the coal harbour and boatyard. On foot of that meeting the coal harbour users group met Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company, at my request.</P>
    <P>In June 2000 following that meeting the harbour company detailed the position in relation to the future management of the boatyard by Marina Marketing and Management Limited. It advised that the rights of existing boatyard users are protected and guaranteed by the imposition of a number of conditions in contractual agreements with the marina company. The facility is also being opened up for use by a wider population.</P>
    <P>The harbour company must operate under its commercial mandate, given to it by the Harbours Act, 1996, and I as Minister am precluded from interfering with the day to day business of the harbour company. I should mention that the boatyard is in the ownership of the harbour company and that no ministerial consents are required in relation to its management and operation.</P>
    <P>As regards Deputy De Rossa's question on reports from the chairperson of Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company the position is as follows. In accordance with section 28(4) of the Harbours Act, 1996, the chairperson of each port company is obliged to submit to me as Minister, not later than six months after the end of each accounting year of the company, a report on various issues relating to the company.</P>
    <P>I last received a report from the chairperson in April 2000 which outlined,<i> inter alia, </i>that Marina Marketing and Management Limited was awarded the contract to fund, construct and manage the marina in Dún Laoghaire. I have not <Col N="228" /> received any other reports from the chairperson on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the dispute between the coal harbour users groups and Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company over the use of the boatyard. Does the commitment regarding the protection of the rights of existing users extend to possible future public users of the boatyard?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Existing boatyard users are protected and guaranteed by the imposition of a number of conditions in contractual agreements with the marina company. The facility is being opened up for use by the wider population. Consequently, it would apply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall management of the facility is a matter for Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company. Consequently, any questions which arise in the future will, in the first instance, be a matter for it. I am satisfied, however, that there is no basis for many of the concerns which have been expressed, which I accept are legitimate. While I do not want to become involved in the dispute, I have been keeping a watchful eye on it. I am satisfied that everybody, including the coal harbour users group, can live in harmony in Dún Laoghaire. There should be no major difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that all the issues raised by the coal harbour users group have been <Col N="229" /> adequately provided for. The principal conditions included in the contractual agreement between Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company and Marina Marketing Management Company Limited are that the boatyard will be managed by the marina operator; the remainder of the coal harbour, including boat moorings, will be managed by Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company; the boatyard will be run as a public facility; the terms of the agreements with St. Michael's, Viking Marine Limited, Irish Youth Sailing Club, Dún Laoghaire VEC and Sail Ireland will be adhered to fully and honoured; the public will continue to have a right of way over and along the boatyard to gain unrestricted access to the slipway and boatyard, and the provision of a site within the boatyard at a nominal rent for the purpose of building a clubhouse for St. Michael's Rowing Club. These conditions will ensure the rights of existing users are protected in opening up the facility to the wider population. Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company's by-laws will be amended to clearly state that the boatyard will continue to be used as a public facility. I do not see, therefore, how I could have a further impact in dealing with the problem. I am satisfied, having regard to the agreements reached and the conditions laid down, that everybody's interests will be protected.</P>

      <Quest>the plans he has to extend the fishing berthage in Clogherhead, County Louth; his views on whether the facilities can provide for the existing fleet which has been recently extended; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the major part of the fleet has to dock in Howth, County Dublin, and Drogheda, County Louth; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The pier in Clogherhead is owned by Louth County Council with which responsibility lies for its maintenance and development. It is, accordingly, a matter for the county council in the first instance to bring forward proposals for capital investment. Funding of £125,000 has been provided in the current year for the county coun<Col N="230" /> cil to support essential safety and maintenance works.</P>
      <P>In 1998 Louth County Council commissioned consulting engineers to make a technical assessment of the development needs of the harbour. Their report, which examined a range of options, recommended extending the pier, the construction of a breakwater and dredging works. The minimum cost of these capital works has been estimated to be in excess of £3 million. The annual value of landings in Clogherhead is of the order of £1.8 million.</P>
      <P>I visited Clogherhead recently and accept that there is scope for enhancement of the harbour. Any major capital investment proposed would require, in the first instance, a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis having regard to all relevant economic and socio-economic factors, trends in volume and value of landings, fleet trends, and regional and local considerations. It is also the case that existing funding for major fishery harbour development is oversubscribed. Development options for Clogherhead will be kept under review in that context and my Department will consult further with Louth County Council on the way forward.</P>

      <P>A comprehensive strategic review of current and future infrastructural needs in Dunmore East Fishery Harbour was commissioned by my Department in August. The review is being undertaken by KPMG Consulting in conjunction with a firm of consulting engineers. The review is scheduled for completion before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The consultant's brief is to assess the capacity of the existing infrastructure and onshore facilities in Dunmore East to service the existing and future needs of the fishing industry and the marine tourism and leisure sector. It will also take into account other potential commercial activity in the harbour. In the light of this assessment the consultants will evaluate future development needs and undertake a cost-benefit analysis of the options for delivery. They will recommend on an integrated and cost-efficient strategic plan for any identified enhancement of infrastructure and facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review is being conducted in consultation with harbour users and other local interests. It will take due account of the socio-economic role of the fishing sector in the south east region and the Dunmore East catchment area having regard to emerging structural and market trends in the sector. Full consideration will also be given to the current and potential future role of Dunmore East as a centre for marine tourism and leisure <Col N="231" /> activity and other potential commercial usage.

There is no question of any foot dragging as regards Dunmore East which I intend to visit within the next two weeks.

The Alouette 111 is a single-engined helicopter, restricted to daylight only offshore visual contact flight conditions, and to operations to a maximum of three nautical miles offshore. The Alouette is a replacement for the Dauphin which crashed on Tramore beach on 2 July 1999 with the tragic loss of four crewmen.</P>
      <P>The current deployment is based on the findings of a number of reports prepared over the period 1988 to 1996. While the present coverage is adequate, growing offshore and onshore demands highlight the need to keep capacity and deployment under review. On 12 July 2000, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, announced the first stage of a process to acquire new medium-lift helicopters for the Air Corps. This major investment programme involves the acquisition of two medium-lift helicopters, with an option for a third, for search and rescue purposes as well as an option for two medium-lift helicopters for general purpose military transport. The acquisition of medium-lift helicopters for the Air Corps for search and rescue is a positive indication of the Government's commitment to the Air Corps and is welcomed by the Coast Guard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of a new multi-engined marine SAR helicopter for the Air Corps with its increased endurance, capability and range will relieve the workload on the Shannon and Dublin helicopters for long range missions, provide back-up for the west coast and provide an opportunity <Col N="233" /> to consider enlarging our marine search and rescue area of responsibility.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should be aware that helicopters are not the only SAR facilities available and there are many distress situations in which other forms of SAR response are suitable. Among the other significant assets available to the Coast Guard for search and rescue tasks is the fleet of purpose-built lifeboats provided and operated by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, the eight community inshore rescue boats and the boats and search and rescue units of the Coast Guard.</P>

      <P>The review of the adequacy of the marine search and rescue coverage published in June 1996 examined, among other matters, the suitability of the Alouette 111 for marine SAR and concluded that, because of its visual contact flight conditions, daylight only restrictions and range, it was unsuitable for marine emergency cover. The Minister for Defence is reviewing the inadequacies of the various helicopters in the fleet and is bringing forward proposals for replacements and the engagement of newer and more appropriate equipment.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have previously stated in the House, my Department set up and is facilitating discussions between representatives of the Irish Offshore Operators Association, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Enterprise Ireland and the Irish Offshore Suppliers Association on the utilisation of Irish resources and services in the offshore petroleum industry. These discussions are ongoing.</P>
      <P>Exploration and production companies employ Irish workers in offshore exploration and development, particularly in the Kinsale gas field. I have continually impressed on the Irish Offshore Operators Association and the individual operators that Irish workers and suppliers of goods and services, including service ports, must be given opportunities to participate fully in such activities, and I will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy is to ensure the economy benefits to the maximum extent possible from any current and future offshore exploration activities, within the constraints of EU legislation. Crucial to that is the need to ensure all potential contractors or suppliers of service are made aware of present and future requirements of operators and main contractors.</P>
      <P>I have asked Enterprise Ireland to intensify its business awareness efforts. In that context my Department organised a contract awareness seminar for the offshore sector. This was held in Westport on 14 April last. The seminar, which was a success, brought together the main parties involved in the offshore and enabled Irish companies in the goods and services sector to hear at first hand of the opportunities available in the offshore sector. On 14 September last Enterprise Ireland organised a Corrib gas seminar in which the probable contractual requirements and their structure was addressed by Enterprise Energy Ireland Limited. In addition, it was agreed that Enterprise Ireland would work directly with the Irish Offshore Operators Association and specific operators to ensure there is early notification of future offshore work to potential Irish participants. I am glad to say the Irish Offshore Operators Association is committed to fully supporting these opportunities.</P>
      <P>I am confident that as a result Irish companies will realise they have the skills to participate in the exploration industry through the supply of goods and services. Enterprise Energy Ireland Limited gave a commitment to increase servicing activity from Ireland this year and a number of contracts were agreed with Irish companies for the provision of various services. I should also mention that the onshore work likely to be involved in connecting any offshore gas supply to the national grid will be a major employer of Irish goods and services.</P>

      <P>What will be the estimated number of employees in the Corrib gas field? How many Irish offshore workers does the Minister expect to work in the Corrib gas field? Did he place any condition on Enterprise Oil to employ Irish workers in the Corrib gas field when he issued the licence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the figure for the number of people who will be employed in the Corrib field, but obviously there will be substantial numbers employed over the next two years in the construction phase of the pipeline from the field to the County Mayo shore. It would not be possible to place any condition, in terms of the requirement to use Irish workers, on any company drilling for oil or gas because that would be in breach of EU legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of the comment made by a former Statoil director that there is a cosy relationship between the Government and the oil exploration companies, what practical economic benefits will accrue to Ireland as a result of the commercial development of the Corrib gas field by Enterprise Oil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no cosy relationship between the Government and any person in the oil or gas sectors. We are anxious to encourage substantial increased exploration off the west coast. We are quite confident that there is significant potential and consequently there are five to eight wells being drilled next year. There were seven wells drilled off the west coast in the past 25 years compared to 4,000 wells drilled in the North Sea. We have a long way to go.</P>
      <P>There is significant potential to provide natural gas to the west coast from the Corrib gas field which will allow the national grid to be serviced by Irish gas as opposed to gas imported through the interconnector. It will certainly bring significant potential to the west coast in terms of a gas supply being made available for the first time and will also save the need for an interconnector for the next couple of years.</P>

      <P>In respect of Deputy Connaughton's question, it is important that we, as politicians, do not treat the finding of gas off the west coast as a panacea for putting gas into every town. That would be to seriously mislead people. The main benefits of gas to the west coast are that it will enable a cheaper energy supply for very large industries, which were not able to locate in the west to date, and it will also ensure a gas powered electricity generating station to produce cheaper electricity on the west coast. Those two developments will be of major significance to the BMW region.</P>

Does she acknowledge that to have one major dispute is bad enough, to have two is extremely serious but to have five disputes simultaneously where up to 6,000 people are effectively withdrawing their service is a catastrophe for the company? Why were these five disputes not addressed earlier? Why were they allowed to simmer and fester until such time as they all boiled over simultaneously?

Will she admit she has been gravely derelict in her duty to protect companies in public ownership and ensure fair play for their workers, in this case, Aer Lingus workers?</P>
      <P>How does she justify allowing a low wage, yellow pack regime to fester for years in Aer Lingus, in the same way she allowed Dublin Bus to be heavily subsidised by the low wages of its drivers for years? Does the Minister not remember that when the workers were massacred by the hatchet job called &ldquo;the Cahill plan&rdquo;, that was as a result of failure by successive Governments to invest properly in this premier State company?

Why has she not blown out of the water the calculated misinformation put out by Aer Lingus management that the major cause of the strike today is a dispute between two unions? Will she say that is a lie and a smokescreen, used as an excuse for the failure of the management to come to terms with the real problem and negotiate seriously? That is very important.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister understand that the management of Aer Lingus has deliberately continued to implement a low wage policy, despite profits of more than £50 million, so that those profits will look rosy to the vultures it wants to buy the company when the Minister and her Government privatise it, or attempt to privatise it? They hope they will then get bonuses as obscene as those received by the Eircom management to whom the Minister gave our telecom services.

Will the Minister take into account that the management did not mention any improvements, in terms of its own staff, in the list it read out to us? Will she make it clear that the low wage regime it operates has been consigned to history and that proper remuneration with dignity will be restored, as was the case in the early days of Aer Lingus?

      <P>Aer Lingus must also maintain viability under EU rules. When we got permission for the money in 1994, we were clearly told it was the last cash injection that could go into Aer Lingus, so Aer Lingus must operate in an economically viable manner and pay its way.</P>

        <b>: </b>In respect of her meetings with the chief executive and the chairman of Aer Lingus, will the Minister list, in relation to the baggage handlers, pilots, catering staff, administrative staff and the cabin crews, the individual problems in each area that have to be resolved? Are they pay, pensions, contracts, rosters, conditions of employment and so on? The myriad of <Col N="247" /> problems will not be solved until such time as we recognise and identify the problems in each area. Will the Minister accept there is a deep industrial malaise within Aer Lingus, that a once happy thriving successful company is now beset with industrial relations problems and is a cesspool of bitterness and division and that something will have to be done as a matter of urgency before the bubble finally bursts and the entire operation goes down the tubes?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that for over a decade there has been a feeling of unrest in sections of Aer Lingus employees. That was evident through the turbulent years of 1992, 1993 and 1994. In 1997 the problems at TEAM continued for 12 months. Taking the decade as a whole from 1990 to 2000 there was a clear continuation of unrest and concern. There is no doubt part of that remains because the legacy of the 1994 Cahill plan, estimable and worthy as it was, resulted in a pay freeze and an acceptance that if the company was to be able to hold its head up and be viable sacrifices had to be made. That has continued right through the decade. Many of the five disputes which are in waiting have their roots in that period. The Deputy asked the reasons for each of the pending disputes. Most relate to pay plus pensions. Rostering is an issue for some, while the pilots have highlighted equivalence. The problems relate mostly to pay and pensions and in some cases rostering.</P>

      <P>When did the Minister first learn there would be a strike at Dublin Airport today grounding the whole fleet, something which has not happened for 20 years? Has she known this for two days or three days? Most of us read in the Sunday newspapers that it would occur. When was she told authoritatively that it was likely to occur today? What action has she taken since then, as the Minister responsible, to prevent the strike taking place? Since she has taken a Pontius Pilate type attitude towards most of her brief, what does she think the company should do in regard to the issue of low pay given that it has acknowledged that it is an issue? Will she tell the House how the Labour Relations Commission can address the issue of low pay which is a policy matter and must be addressed in advance as a policy matter by the company or by the owner, being the Minister, before it can act on it? Calling for the matter to be referred to the Labour Relations Commission in the absence of a policy on low pay from the Minister is like going down a <i>cul-de-sac.</i></P>

      <P>&mdash;in some of the categories to which I referred earlier in my reply. It has said so clearly and intends to address them. They cannot be addressed without talking. This goes back to what I said at the outset. The talks have happened at the machinery. I would love to hear some approval of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court from the opposite side of the House instead of putting them to one side as if they do not exist. They have instituted talks tomorrow, the day after and the day after with three separate groups who have turned down talks with the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court. I hope the new discussions will bear fruit.</P>
      <P>With regard to IMPACT who wish to move to the Labour Relations Commission, that should happen. That directly answers the question which Deputy Joe Higgins put to me. It is a highly relevant one in today's circumstances. Finally the Deputy asked when I heard about the strike. I heard of it at the weekend. The management took a decision that it would be better, because of the pending 24 hour strike today, to halt all Aer Lingus flights. That was a management decision which the management took.</P>

Is she aware that the company informed the public enterprise committee that it had successful delivery of sav<Col N="249" /> ings and disposal programmes and that they exceeded the targets? That sounds as if the company is rolling in it. Does she accept that the viability of a company requires, first and foremost, a work force which feels valued and duly rewarded for the stress and strain of its endeavours? I include the pensioners in that. Given that £175 million in State funding was injected into the company, does the Minister accept that if viability is the criterion on which this company is judged, she has an obligation as the main shareholder to require that that viability takes into account the low wage issues and that her role is to make that happen?</P>

Will she also agree that both the Government and the management took their eyes off the main problems by being more concerned about the pending sale of Aer Lingus rather than the conditions and salaries of the staff? Will she acknowledge that the five groups of workers &ndash; baggage handlers, caterers, clerical workers, cabin crew and pilots &ndash; are no longer prepared to accept a low pay regime in the airport? Will she give a commitment on behalf of the Government and the management that a time scale will be put on this and that they will deal in a realistic way with the problems of the people I met on the picket lines this morning who are earning £5,000 per year?

        <b>:</b> I have already outlined my approach to this legislation and I asked the Minister a number of specific questions regarding the role of the agency and its policy committee, in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is é atá anseo ná Acht chun socrú a dhéanamh maidir le feidhmeanna a bhaineann le bainistiú éilimh áirithe i gcoinne an stáit agus feidhmeanna gaolmhara áirithe eile. Cuireann an Bille gníomhaireacht ar bun chun éilimh áirithe i gcoinne an stáit a láimhseáil. Tá sé ciallmhar go mbeadh polasaí lárnach ag an stát maidir leis an bhfadhb seo <Col N="260" /> mar íoctar carn mór airgid gach bliain anois ó ranna stáit, ó údaráis áitiúla, ó bhoird sláinte agus ó chomhlachtaí eile stáit i ngeall ar fhaillí a fhaightear i gcoinne na gcomhlachtaí poiblí úd. Tá sé riachtanach mar sin féin go ndéarfadh an tAire linn go cruinn cén slat tomhais atá i gceist aige maidir leis an ngníomhaireacht bainistíochta.</P>
    <P>An mbeadh, mar shampla, i gceist ag an Rialtas nach mbeadh anseo ach modh chun airgead a shábháil don stát? An gníomhaireacht é chun ciste airgid an stáit a chaomhnú? An é sin amháin atá i gceist agus gan aon tagairt ann don fhreagracht sóisialta maidir le daoine a ghortaítear de dheasca faillí ó chomhlachtaí stáit? Ba náireach, mar shampla, mar a láimhseáil an stát cás Bridget McCole, bean a chuir an stát trí ifreann nuair a bhí sé soiléir go raibh an bhean bhocht ar leaba an bháis de dheasca éagóir a dhein gníomhaireacht stáit uirthi. Más é sin atá i gceist i ngníomhaireacht bainistíochta an chisteáin náisiúnta ní bheidh aon tacaíocht uaimse don Bhille. Caithfidh an tAire a rá go soiléir linn cad iad na téarmaí tagartha cruinn a bheidh ag an gcoiste polasaí. Le déanaí tugadh breithiúnas san Ard-Chúirt a fuair go raibh an stát faillíoch maidir le hoideachas a thabhairt do leanbh a raibh mí-chumas air, Jamie Synnott. Bhí an stát faillíoch ansin agus bíonn an stát faillíoch go minic chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé le cearta gnáthdhaoine agus tá sé sin cruthaithe sna cúirteanna le tamall maith anois.</P>
    <P>An cheist a bheadh agamsa, mar sin, ná cén ról go beacht a bheidh ag an gcoiste polasaí seo a thabharfaidh comhairle don ghníomhaireacht maidir le polasaí agus modhanna oibre a bhaineann le bainistíocht ar éilimh a dhéantar in aghaidh an stáit nó in aghaidh comhlachtaí stáit? Cad iad na téarmaí tagartha a leagfaidh an tAire os comhair an choiste? An mbeidh sé de dhualgas ar an gcoiste seo comhairle a thabhairt don stát a bheidh níos leithne ná sábháilt airgid amháin? An dtabharfaidh an coiste comhairle a bhainfidh le cad ba cheart agus cad ba chóir a dhéanamh ó thaobh deileáil le daoine, le cearta daonna daoine agus leis na ceartanna eile atá ag daoine nuair a bheidh siad ag brath ar an stát maidir le hoideachas agus rudaí eile. Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh freagra cruinn ar na ceisteanna sin.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na húdaráis áitiúla de is maith an rud é go bhfuil ciste á chur ar bun chun airgead a thabhairt ar iasacht do na húdaráis sin agus do na boird sláinte. Ba cheart chomh maith go gcuirfí iachall ar na húdaráis áitiúla deileáil leis an gciste sin agus airgead a thógaint as nuair atá sé níos saoire ná na bainc len a ndeileáileann na húdaráis áitiúla de ghnáth. Ba cheart don choiste polasaí an iachall sin a chur ar na húdaráis áitiúla agus ar na húdaráis eile agus gan a bheith ag dul go dtí na bainc a bhfuil brabús thar fóir acu cheana féin. Tá súil agam go mbeidh aon ráta úis a bheidh i gceist ag an gciste fábharach i dtreo is gur féidir airgead a shábháil, airgead a bheadh ag dul go dtí na bainc murach an ciste.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with the Bill. It <Col N="261" /> is appropriate to set up a State claims agency. Many of the legal expenses that have arisen as a result of tribunals and hepatitis C and Army deafness cases could have been avoided if there had been an expeditious way of dealing with claims against the State.</P>
      <P>Section 8 is significant in relation to the CIE group and claims against that organisation. Some years ago I spoke to the boss of Dublin Bus and he told me that, at any point, there are claims against the company worth in excess of £10 million. Another example is Irish Rail. There was a derailment at Claremorris and when I asked if the company carried any insurance, I was told that it did not. The position was that the taxpayer ultimately, in addition to a subvention of approximately £100 million, was expected to pick up the bill. Section 8 states that where it considers it appropriate to do so, the agency may purchase insurance cover against certain insurable risks. This area needs to be scrutinised and considered.</P>
      <P>The major points I will make relate to the NTMA. It is rare that primary legislation dealing with the NTMA comes before the House and it is important, therefore, to consider its role. It is one of the State agencies that has been an outstanding success and tribute is due to Dr. Michael Somers. In terms of the folly involving Mr. Justice O'Flaherty, Dr. Somers would have been an excellent candidate for the vice-presidency of the European Investment Bank. The NTMA gives quangos a good name and it has discharged its functions well. To some extent, it has been able to spin the amount by which it reduces the cost of servicing the national debt. Some of that could have been done by others, but it has done a good job in terms of its role.</P>
      <P>However, its role is too narrow and it greatly needs to be expanded. The biggest problem facing Ireland in terms of the economy is the infrastructural deficit. This has been well articulated in terms of the deficit in relation to the provision and capacity of public transport and sanitary services, which is leading to a supply crisis in housing. A total of 500,000 houses is needed but they cannot be produced. If one reads the national development plan, which involves expenditure of £40 billion, it is proposed to increase public capital expenditure from approximately £2.4 billion to between £6 billion and £7 billion a year. The capacity does not exist in some Departments to achieve that level of expenditure.</P>
      <P>There is a nebulous situation in some areas, for example, with regard to Dublin transport where there is reference to public private partnerships. If one asks the Department of Public Enterprise or even the Department of the Environment and Local Government how exactly the metro for Dublin or the provision in relation to sanitary services and, to a lesser extent, road schemes will work, there is no blueprint. They are at the very tentative stage of putting the design together. Basic decisions on whether it will involve only design and construction or design, construction and operation have not been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="262" /> Within the Department of Finance, there is a deep suspicion of public private partnerships because it wants to retain the level of control it has had over total expenditure under the public capital programme. It does not want to write IOUs with regard to the operational aspects of PPPs in the future. I am advocating that the role of the NTMA should be extended to provide a dynamic executive office to manage public private partnership projects.</P>
    <P>The Department does not have sufficient expertise and if there was an agency under the Department of Finance, it would be more relaxed and play a more supportive role in the projects. Over the lifetime of the plan, between now and 2006, many of the aspects of the plan will not be delivered. There are construction capacity constraints but the PPP element needs to be driven. We need to get the best international experience and a small dynamic office that is not caught up in the strait-jacket of Civil Service terms of reference.</P>
    <P>There is a need for cross-departmental contact because the same problems will arise in the Department of Public Enterprise as in the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Sufficient capacity is not available and senior civil servants at assistant secretary level to whom I spoke acknowledge that the expertise does not exist in those Departments. Ultimately, the projects will be financed by the private sector so there should be direct interaction. A fortune will be spent on consultancy fees for each project but a new PPP office, adjunct to the NTMA, would work if the expertise was built into it.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance believes it can get money more cheaply through the NTMA than any public private partnership project. Therefore, it will ask why it should sanction such a project if it can get money more cheaply through the conventional system. This will happen in the future and the critical problems of this country and its capital, such as house prices that are seven times the average industrial wage and average traffic speeds that have reduced at peak hours to eight kilometres an hour &ndash; a brisk walking pace &ndash; can only be resolved by delivering a massive public transport facility and serviced land through water and sewerage schemes that currently take 12 years to complete.</P>
    <P>The plan contains an expectation that public private partnerships will deliver those objectives. However, if one seeks the plans in the individual Departments, one finds that they are not available. Somebody needs to drive it forward but a sub-committee of the Cabinet dealing with infrastructure will not suffice. In so far as the macro-economic management of the economy is concerned, too much money is used on too few goods and services. As well as the housing situation which is underlying inflation, this is the primary reason for the 6.2% inflation rate announced today. It is the highest in 18 years and is treble the EU average. It will clearly impact on our <Col N="263" /> competitiveness, exports, jobs and investment. While we were on the virtuous cycle, we are now heading into the vicious cycle.</P>
    <P>Something needs to be done to abate the current voracious consumer spending. I am told that inflation in the construction sector is running at 15%. We need an investment product that will soak up this credit splurge whereby people with a few extra pounds are saying to themselves: &ldquo;If I put money into a deposit account in the bank what will I get? A 3% rate of return, at best&rdquo;. The NTMA should introduce an attractive tax-incentive in the form of a ten year bond. I am satisfied this money will be required to meet our infrastructural deficit.</P>
    <P>The £3 billion allocated in the next three year programme for sanitary services is not enough. Of the 500,000 houses we need to build, half are on greenfield sites. If one asks builders about the delay in building 16,000 houses that the Bacon report said should be delivered on the north side of Dublin, they will talk about delays in planning, water and sewage. There is a great need to examine investment in that area and to open up services for land. What I have in mind is an infrastructure bond that the NTMA would issue deliberately to soak up the spare money that is awash in the economy. As in 1977, that money is being spent on imported goods and services which is fuelling inflation and does nothing for a stable economic environment. Such a bond issue would meet two objectives: it would cool the overheating economy and would provide a source of money for an existing infrastructural deficit.</P>
    <P>It is essential that in the forthcoming budget, the NTMA should come forward with such a new investment product &ndash; a savings bond which could not be redeemed for a ten year period and which would provide an attractive rate of return. At least £2 billion to £3 billion could be made available in this way. During the privatisation of Eircom we saw how much money is available for investment purposes. Given the way people's fingers were burned by the 40% dip in the capital value of Eircom shares, however, I do not think there will be too many more IPOs in the State sector.</P>
    <P>With all the financial security involved, it would be attractive for people to invest in the type of bond I am advocating. Many young people are looking ahead and they know that in ten years time they could be facing the expense of educating their children, or they may want to put aside money for an earlier retirement date. People want to invest in savings products but there are none of an attractive nature due to DIRT and the current low interest rate on savings.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with the Bill but the NTMA should examine the question of public transport insurance and, specifically, the fact that CIE's three component companies have no insurance cover in the event of a serious accident. As my party's spokesperson on public enterprise, I have <Col N="264" /> beaten the drum about rail safety. We have jointed track and wooden sleepers on the Mayo line and if there is a derailment there the cost of the accident could reach several hundred million pounds in compensation, yet there is not one iota of public transport insurance. It is one thing for a Lloyds underwriter to take such a risk, but in this case the taxpayer would have to pay. The NTMA should seriously examine the fact that in monopoly areas such as public transport there is a necessity for such insurance cover or for the State claims agency to take it over and deal with spurious claims.</P>
    <P>Essentially, I have two main points. First, within the budgetary remit of the NTMA there is a need for a new ten year savings bond product to soak up excess financial demand in the economy and to provide a source of funds for infrastructural investment, particularly in public transport and sanitary services, at a known cost. Second, now that the NTMA is moving away from its mainline business into a claims agency, it should be the body designated to run a dynamic, value-for-money office for public private partnership projects. No such office currently exists and Civil Service Departments do not have the expertise. The Department of Finance distrusts the idea of such an office because the NTMA comes under the remit of the Minister for Finance. For all those reasons, that is the only way one will have delivery of the PPPS in the national development plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Yates strayed far and wide on the subject of the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Bill. I agree with him that the question of an infrastructure bond is worthy of examination, but I question whether the supply of capital is at the root of our present infrastructural problems. It seems the scarcity of labour and land are the factors which are impinging on our infrastructural development. The supply of capital is not the major problem. Given all that, I take the point the Deputy is making, that there is a need to provide an attractive investment channel for investors who wish to save at a productive rate. I have a fundamental objection, however, to vesting this function in the National Treasury Management Agency. This agency was established for the purpose of managing our spiralling national debt in the context of market realities. The agency has been commended on all sides of the House for doing that very well over the years, but it would be wrong to extend its functions to a very different type of operation, namely, the suggestion Deputy Yates made of issuing an infrastructure bond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unclear whether this bond would be issued to the bond holder on a current market basis. It is also unclear whether the State would essentially subsidise savings through this bond or whether it would be tailored to the actual circumstances of the open market and the interest rates available thereon. I would not like to see the NTMA <Col N="265" /> saddled with the function of providing an attractive loan for investors generally. The suggestion, however, is worthy of examination.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Yates indicated, there is a lack of channels for domestic investors. We must look in an imaginative way at how channels can be found to direct savings into worthy areas of infrastructural improvement. I have no difficulty with that as a general principle, but I object to the idea that it should be vested in the NTMA which has done so much good work in bringing our national debt under control and in managing it in a rational manner. I have read the agency's annual report every year since I was elected to the House. I am impressed at the prowess of the agency in managing the national debt and I commend it on carrying out its primary task. The extensions of the agency's tasks proposed in the Bill are appropriate ones for a body with such expertise.</P>
    <P>Before addressing the principles of the legislation, I should declare an interest as a counsel who is instructed from time to time in proceedings against State authorities. I do not think I have an actual conflict at present, but I could have a possible or potential conflict in that regard so I should declare an interest. In the past, I have had considerable experience in handling claims made against the State and also in representing the interests of the State in relation to claims.</P>
    <P>I welcome this measure because it is long overdue and desirable. The central treasury and fund management functions and the extension of the powers of the agency to provide external consultancy services are not controversial, do not raise any serious issue of principle and are a natural extension of the remit of the agency. The main feature and innovation of the legislation is the decision to establish a State claims authority under the agency.</P>
    <P>Until 1972, it was very much an issue whether an individual litigant could name a State authority, a Minister of State, the Government or the State as a party in proceedings. It was the decision in Byrne <i>v.</i> Ireland in 1971 and reported in the 1972 Irish Reports which established the principle that the State was a jurist amenable to claims made by individual plaintiffs for injury suffered by them as a result of negligence on the part of State authorities. At the time of this decision, it was commented and suggested by many jurists that consideration should be given to the enactment of State proceedings legislation which would lay down on a clear statutory basis the precise identification of parties who were named by plaintiffs in claims against the State and to regulate procedural aspects of these claims from the point of view of civil liability. No such legislation has ever been enacted.</P>
    <P>The Minister commented on the difficulties of drafting this measure. Some of those stem from the fact that we did not enact a State proceedings Act in this jurisdiction. The State is described before the courts as Ireland, and plaintiffs are sometimes confused to discover that the name of the defendant against whom they are bringing a <Col N="266" /> claim is the whole of Ireland, but that is how it is named in court proceedings in the absence of any more definite State proceedings legislation.</P>
    <P>The main feature and innovation of the legislation is the establishment of a State claims agency. That is long overdue in terms of value for money for the taxpayer and a professional approach towards the management of these claims. I very much welcome that. In effect, until now, each Department has operated as its own insurer subject to the legal advice it receives from the Attorney General. The same principle has applied to claims made against a number of defendants or the State collectively known as Ireland. Each Department has operated as its own insurer and the relevant Department, in effect, the body against which the claim has been made, has investigated and dealt with claims. There is an obvious conflict in that in terms of proper claims management procedures.</P>
    <P>The crucial central feature of the legislation is section 8(3) which imposes upon the new agency a mandate to contain claims. I commend the wording of the section because it obliges the agency to manage delegated claims and counterclaims to ensure the liability of State authorities are contained at the lowest achievable level. I notice the use of the plural in mentioning claims and counterclaims. The agency will have to take an overall view of claims and counterclaims and manage them to ensure the State pays out as little as possible.</P>
    <P>That might appear an obvious principle and some might ask why Departments and Government have not been doing this already. In fact, a large percentage of claims against State authorities tend to go to full hearing. In general practice, where claims are taken against named insurance companies, a policy is often taken of early settlement of claims. The early assessment of claims from the point of view of the risk of liability involved and the early settlement of these claims is very much in the interest of both the claimant and the person making the payment because it reduces the amount of legal costs payable and the amount of distress caused to the claimant who may have been in a very difficult personal position, and it minimises the amount of publicity and subsequent exposure which the defendant party may incur as a result of the publicity of a full hearing.</P>
    <P>Extraordinarily, in the case of the State, a very high percentage of claims have gone to trial. One of the reasons is the Accounting Officer procedure which is very correct and rooted in our administrative system but which means Departments and their heads are very reluctant to settle claims without the protection of the High Court, so to speak. Judgments are made on claims not on the commercial basis of what is realistic to settle or contest but on the basis of whether the official making the decision to settle the claim is fully protected. This is notwithstanding the existence of the Attorney General and the advice he or she can give. The ultimate decision on settle<Col N="267" /> ment always rests with the individual Department, and its Accounting Officer ultimately has to stand over the decision at the Committee of Public Accounts. That system is a very bad one where the settlement of claims is concerned.</P>
    <P>A similar problem often exists with local authorities where the county manager reserves the right to sanction a settlement. It has led to an undue proportion of claims against local authorities going to trial and not being settled on an expeditious basis. It is a welcome development that the State will delegate a large proportion of claims to this new claims agency which will take a commercial view of what can and cannot be settled and reduce as far as is practicable the amount of money that the taxpayer must pay out.</P>
    <P>I note that the Act also contains a provision which enables the agency to retain an insurance company for a specific class of business within the agency's remit. The legislation is silent on tendering procedures for such business, but clearly that is a matter which will have to be attended to. If private concerns are to be allowed to tender for this, the National Treasury Management Agency must be put in a position where it is beyond reproach as regards who is retained to do this work. I take it that would be the position under the relevant EU legislation, but I see no harm in spelling that out in the legislation as it would be for the protection of the agency. Regardless of whether an insurer is retained or whether the agency opts to deal with certain classes of claim on its own account, the idea that a State agency would take responsibility for these claims in a collective way and assess them in a commercial way is very good and welcome and the measure is long overdue.</P>
    <P>I note that section 8(4) contains the other crucial provision of this legislation where the agency is obliged to advise and assist State authorities regarding measures to reduce risks that occasion claims, to give advice regarding claims, the assessment of risk and the determination of whether it could give rise to a serious hazard, and to evaluate the adequacy of the measures adopted by State authorities to counter such risk. That is very important because the current system is defective in that, once a Department is allowed to be its own insurer, there is not a clear separation between the function of investigating and compensating these claims and policing whether there is any repetition of the conduct which gave rise to the claim and the administration of the Department. The two are so intertwined under the current arrangement that it is an unsatisfactory way of dealing with claims.</P>
    <P>Under this subsection, the agency will have a distinct statutory duty to advise Departments how to get their act right as regards claims. That is also a very desirable provision. There is an obligation on Departments to give early notification to the claims agency of any matter which might give rise to liability. That is analogous to the provision in an insurance contract where any person <Col N="268" /> who is likely to have a claim made against them is obliged to report that claim to a relevant authority. It is a bit unclear how that section will operate in practice and what sanctions exist regarding the duty to report adverse incidents. I do not see any provision for criminal offences in the legislation. God forbid I suggest that people should be tried, convicted and punished for failing in their duty to report an accident. However, if one includes a section in a Bill one must have a method of enforcing it. In that context, I am not sure what machinery is included in the Bill to enforce the provisions of the section which will oblige the State authorities to report to the agency any conduct which might give rise to liability.</P>
    <P>As far as research is concerned, we must face up to reality. Litigation in this country has moved towards the North American model. More than any other jurisdiction in the European Union, we are faced with a legal climate in which high compensation awards are being given by the courts and the arc of liability is forever being widened. In those circumstances, it is essential that the State protects itself and takes a systematic view in relation to the making of claims. In other words, it must become aware, at an early stage, of difficulties that might arise and advise authorities in a comprehensive way with regard to how to meet claims as they are made.</P>
    <P>The Bill is an enabling measure and allows the agency to retain professional assistance. With regard to legal advice and assistance I believe I am correct in stating &ndash; perhaps the Minister will confirm this in his reply &ndash; that the agency is responsible for deciding which solicitors it wishes to employ. I understand it can, like many insurance companies, retain in-house solicitors, employ solicitors in private practice to handle claims on its behalf or use the services of the Chief State Solicitor. Regardless of which system is operated, I hope the agency will arrive at a commercial judgment. I also hope that proper tendering procedures will apply in relation to any engagements made under these arrangements. I presume proper tendering arrangements will also apply in respect of employing counsel.</P>
    <P>I welcome this measure without reservation. It is a long overdue and desirable change in our practice. The Minister is to be congratulated on introducing a measure which will build on the very positive work done by the agency in the future in managing liabilities of the State which, if not attended to with care, could escalate out of control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this timely item of legislation. The National Treasury Management Agency was established to manage the national debt during what was probably the most difficult period, in economic terms, this country has ever faced. It is good to acknowledge that the success of the National Treasury Management Agency over the past decade has led to widespread recognition not only at national but also international <Col N="269" /> level, where other economies have used the model established here. It could be claimed that the work of the agency is complete, but it is important that it should remain in place. I welcome the additional functions the Minister has provided for it in the Bill.</P>
      <P>As already stated, the NTMA has been very effective in managing the national debt. It is now being given a number of additional responsibilities under the Bill, namely, to establish a State claims agency, a central treasury service and a fund investment unit. I find it difficult to believe that an overlap will not occur in this regard because, on one hand, the privatisation of State companies and financial institutions is now the norm while, on the other, we are extending the powers of the National Treasury Management Agency. We appear to be running in opposite directions because the State is privatising the ACC and the TSB and selling off the ICC while the National Treasury Management Agency will, in effect, act as a bank for State organisations. It will provide banking facilities, loans and overdraft and deposit facilities. Perhaps the Minister will indicate whether those two sides of the coin can be reconciled.</P>
      <P>In many instances throughout the Bill there appear to be overlaps in respect of certain areas of responsibility. There is no clear demarcation of such areas of responsibility. It might be a good development, when dealing with Ministers and departmental officials, to have no defined area of responsibility. Perhaps the new powers and functions we are giving to the National Treasury Management Agency will work well in so far as they might remove the rigidity from the Department's thinking in certain areas. Departmental thinking has often been overly rigid in the past.</P>
      <P>When the National Treasury Management Agency was established in 1990 to manage the national debt, through its advice and direction of expert and qualified personnel, its remit was limited to that area. At that time, because of our huge national debt and the need to restructure our borrowings and investments, the agency had a powerful role. In more recent times, however, the need for such a body has become less important in view of Ireland's economic buoyancy. As a result, the financial expertise of this professional body can now be extended to new areas of responsibility. It would be a pity if this expertise was dispersed back into the areas from which it emerged, particularly if it was believed that the work of the agency was complete.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the State claims agency is a welcome development, particularly as it comes in the wake of serious problems at national level. One wonders if this agency had been in place during the past decade &ndash; and if it was armed with the powers it is proposed to confer on it under the Bill &ndash; if we would have been obliged to establish tribunals, inquiries etc. to deal with problems relating to the banking sector and the non-compliance of lending institutions in respect of the payment of DIRT and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="270" /> Would the same level of difficulty have arisen in respect of hearing impairment claims from members of the Army if this new agency had been in place? Those claims were allowed to spiral out of control by the Minister with responsibility in that area who failed to plan an effective response. To date, his indecision and lack of understanding of the problem has been a high cost to the State.</P>
    <P>Would the new agency have dealt better with relating to other Departments, particularly Health and Children, the Environment and Local Government and Agriculture, Food and Rural Development? The most recent claim made against the Department of Education and Science has been heard by the courts and the judgment handed down will lead to enormous difficulties in the future, particularly in terms of the provision and delivery of services.</P>
    <P>One must question the ability and capacity of Departments, particularly the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, to deal effectively with claims in a reasonable way. In many instances we have seen pathetic attempts by Departments to defend the indefensible, often at a huge cost to the Exchequer. The cases to which I refer often caused stress and inconvenience for claimants and they were defended by the Departments in order to protect the credibility of a poor policy decision or even the maladministration of a policy.</P>
    <P>The annual reports of the Ombudsman show that high on the list of offenders are the Departments themselves, particularly the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Social, Community and Family Affairs. If this agency, through its expert advice, deflects Departments and Ministers from costly litigation it will be of great benefit. If the agency pre-empts these difficulties and advises officials who tend to be vindictive in the administration of their duties, the Bill will have established a meaningful structure to eliminate wastage of funds and official time and it will be very worthwhile. If, through the transfer of areas of responsibility, situations which developed in vocational education committees in the past &ndash; the overspend of £1 million in the Westmeath VEC comes to mind &ndash; are monitored, the agency will justify its new responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The Bill appears to make things up as it goes along. The Minister, the Department, the agency and the Attorney General will all offer advice and it is difficult to see where final responsibility lies. Where is the pivot and where is the base? I hope the Minister will clarify this matter. Because of this indecisiveness, additional areas of responsibility will be given to the agency. It is important that its past success and potential for success in the future will not lead to the offloading of controversial or unattractive ministerial or departmental responsibilities and duties onto the agency.</P>
    <P>I hope the agency will deal in a more humane <Col N="271" /> way with the claims of relatives and dependants of people who died or were injured as a result of violence or of some national tragedy. It was deeply disturbing to hear on &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo; this morning how shabbily relatives of the victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings were treated by way of compensation. It is not too late to revisit this issue and I hope a similar situation could never occur again without instant and reasonable compensation being provided. This agency may be the one to deal with such matters. In the past various Ministers and Departments lacked the initiative to treat such people in a humane way. If a body such as the National Treasury Management Agency had the opportunity to be proactive in such cases much suffering and distress would have been avoided. Does the Bill allow for tiering of responsibility? Areas of responsibility are not clearly outlined. If the responsibilities of Government, officials, the Minister and the agency are not clearly defined, turmoil and confusion will result.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the agency would invest the funds of semi-State organisations or boards. When health board property is sold, for example, the board members and executive frequently wish to retain the accruing financial resources to provide additional facilities or allow for capital outlay within their area of responsibility. At present, if such moneys are accrued to a VEC or health board they are drawn back to the Department. Will the National Treasury Management Agency be able to invest such money on behalf of local authorities or health boards? What impact will this have on local banking institutions which have provided these facilities in the past? The offloading of the ACC and ICC cannot be reconciled with the establishment of a new State banking institution. I am not unduly worried about the capacity of the commercial lending institutions to carry on their work. I merely ask what impact the activity of the new agency will have on such institutions at local level. When funds are made available to a body such as a VEC they should be accounted for and should come back to an agency such as the NTMA to be re-loaned to the body. This is not the case at present when, if the money returns to the Department, there is no guarantee that it will be used in the area of responsibility of the local body, even when it is badly needed. Does the Bill provide that money which comes back to the agency from a local body may be loaned to that body to be spent in its area? </P>
    <P>I hope the success enjoyed by the NTMA in the past decade will continue. If the agency is as successful in its areas of new responsibility as it has been in the past, future Ministers will find new areas of responsibility to offload onto it.</P>
    <P>It is important that Departments, higher officials in particular, seek and take the advice of the agency in order to prevent litigation. I am concerned in particular about the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development which seems to be the greatest defaulter in this respect. <Col N="272" /> There would be no need for much of the callous disregard shown for the personal feelings of individuals if Department officials accepted advice at an early stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>For the information of the House, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is unable to be present as he is attending the joint ECOFIN-Social Affairs Council in Luxembourg.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputies for the welcome and broad support which the Bill has received across the House. Deputies have raised a number of pertinent issues during the course of the debate, particularly on the State claims agency provisions, but also on the central treasury and fund investment proposals. I will take the opportunity to clarify some of these issues, to which we can return in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Deputies Noonan and McDowell agreed that the National Treasury Management Agency is an appropriate place in which to locate the State claims agency. They made the point, however, that its expertise lay in the financial area. It has no expertise in dealing with claims management or legal expertise. The same can be said, however, of any other existing agency which might be given the claims management function. Naturally, the NTMA's expertise is in the financial area given that its main areas of activity are borrowing and debt management. I have no doubt but that the broad range of financial skills which the agency has built up, supplemented by the particular expertise which claims management requires, will enable the agency to perform this new function in an efficient and cost-effective manner. The agency intends to recruit experienced claim managers who will form the core skill set in the claims management area as they do in commercial practice. In addition, the agency intends to recruit legal expertise, both directly and through the use of a panel of solicitors. An experienced risk manager will also be recruited.</P>
      <P>It is important to be clear that the agency will deal with all aspects of claims management from the time of receiving the claim to the point where it is finally disposed of, whether this involves court actions. I am not in a position at this stage to give details of the operational procedures which will be followed. These are still to be worked out in consultations between the agency and my Department and the other interests involved, including the policy committee. What we are doing in the Bill is providing the broad framework within which the agency will perform its claims management functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On claims outstanding on its establishment, the number and nature of cases to be delegated will be a matter for discussions which my Department and the agency will complete with individual Departments in consultation with the Office of <Col N="273" /> the Chief State Solicitor. The agency's view is that existing cases could be transferred, excepting those on which decisions regarding liability and tactics have been taken on the basis of legal advice. Existing cases would need to be transferred on a phased and smooth basis so as not to overload the agency in the early stages.</P>
    <P>Deputies have commented on the role of the Attorney General in relation to the State claims agency and seem to have an impression that he will be actively involved in settling and signing off on individual claims. This will not be the case. Provision is made, however, in section 10 of the Bill that the claims management functions will, in so far as the role of the Attorney General as adviser to the Government in matters of law and legal opinion applies to them, be performed by the agency on his behalf. The Attorney General will have the right to be furnished with such information as he may request and give directions to the agency on the performance of its claims management functions where he is satisfied that the interests of the State so require.</P>
    <P>The point was made that the State claims agency should have a wider remit than that provided for in the Bill. The possibility that it should deal with all claims against the State was raised and mention was made of cases involving defamation, unfair dismissal and institutional child abuse. Deputy Yates mentioned even wider areas in which the agency should be involved. I am sure he will tease these out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The concentration at all stages of the development of the proposals for a State claims agency was to have a coverage which would correspond to the type of claims the claims department of a commercial insurance company would handle, that is, personal injury and property damage claims. These are the claims where the scope exists for handling claims on a commercial basis, that is, by early and economic settlement, both where liability is admitted and where it is not admitted. Given the number of claims which arise involving injury to persons or damage to property on a recurring basis, I am satisfied that these are the type of claims with which the claims agency should deal.</P>
    <P>Defamation claims arise much less frequently. They are not amenable to the commercial approach mentioned and I am convinced that they should not be taken out of the direct control of Ministers. Claims involving alleged infringement of constitutional rights, clearly, should not.</P>
    <P>As regards institutional child abuse, the House will be aware of the recent announcement by the Minister for Education and Science of the Government's intention to establish a compensation body for child abuse victims. I have no doubt that cases will arise which will involve sensitive issues or where injury has been caused through negligence on the part of the State. In <Col N="274" /> situations such as this the agency will deal with claimants in a fair and sympathetic manner.</P>
    <P>Deputy Joe Higgins referred to the policy committee, which will deal with policy and procedures relating to claims. It will not deal with individual cases. It will provide Departments with a forum in which to put forward their views on the agency's overall claims management strategy. The existing advisory committee will continue to focus on the other functions of the agency, in particular its core functions of borrowing and debt management.</P>
    <P>The question of accountability was raised. The debt management functions of the NTMA are performed subject to the control and general superintendence of the Minister for Finance. This will also apply in the case of its claims management functions.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have supported the idea of having a State claims agency. We are at last getting close to the point where it can be brought into being. The NTMA is looking forward to the challenge of dealing with claims against Departments and Offices. I thank it for the ready and enthusiastic manner in which it responded to the Government's wishes in this area.</P>
    <P>Regarding the central treasury provisions it might assist Deputies if I set out how the service will function in practice. The service will operate a Post Office Savings Bank fund. Any deposits by designated bodies with the central treasury service will be credited to the fund. It will be a matter for the agency to decide whether to place these deposits on the interbank market or with the Central Bank or to loan them back out to other designated bodies. When designated bodies wish to borrow from the central treasury service the agency will provide these amounts from moneys in the Post Office Savings Bank fund which are not being utilised for other purposes, whether these are moneys which have accrued to the Post Office Savings Bank fund in the normal manner or through deposits by other designated bodies.</P>
    <P>I wish to clarify a number of points regarding the fund investment service. The aim of the proposed service is to provide Ministers with an investment facility for statutory funds under their control. It is not intended to establish a duplicate service where perfectly satisfactory investment arrangements already exist. For instance, Deputy McDowell raised the issue of the reserves managed by the Central Bank. These moneys will remain under the control and management of the bank, utilising the bank's investment expertise as at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell also raised the issue of whether the Bill should place restrictions on the way fund moneys may be invested by the NTMA. Restrictions on the manner in which fund moneys may be invested are set out in the legislation gov<Col N="275" /> erning each fund. The relevant Minister is responsible for ensuring investments meet these statutory criteria. This will remain the position. This is enabling legislation which does not alter the investment powers of a fund.</P>
    <P>The Bill enables the Minister for Finance to give directions or guidelines to the agency regarding the manner in which it performs investment functions on his behalf. Furthermore, it makes clear that where the agency is investing fund moneys on behalf of another Minister, it will remain the responsibility of that Minister to determine the appropriate investment strategy. In other words, the setting of limits on the ways fund moneys may be invested will clearly remain the responsibility of the relevant Minister.</P>
    <P>Last week Deputy Noonan raised the issue of why surpluses in the social insurance fund are not being combined with moneys allocated to the national pensions reserve fund. The Minister subsequently set out the reasons for keeping the two funds separate in his reply to Second Stage of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Bill.</P>
    <P>The aim of the central treasury service is to manage Exchequer moneys in the most efficient manner possible. Put simply, excess funds will be placed on deposit at the most advantageous terms possible or temporarily reallocated to where they are needed. The approach taken in the Bill is to mirror best practice in corporate treasury management in the private sector.</P>
    <P>I hope I have clarified some of the issues Deputies raised on the provisions of the Bill. I appreciate the Bill is fairly technical and that Deputies will wish to further explore how its provisions will operate in practice. These matters can be teased out in detail on Committee Stage. I thank Deputies for their contributions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There are two main purposes for this Bill. First, to provide for the transfer of liability for the State-guaranteed debts of NET to the Minister for Finance and, second, to provide that the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts would not apply to NET in the event of any future sale by NET of its 51% shareholding in Irish Fertiliser Industries.</P>
      <P>The Bill also provides for the amendment of the First Schedule to the National Treasury Management Agency Act, 1990. This will enable the Minister for Finance to transfer responsibility for the repayment or management of the NET debt to the NTMA. The latest date for which a report on NET's borrowings is available is 30 September 2000 at which time the total debt stood at £187.2 million.</P>
      <P>NET was established in 1961 as a State-sponsored company to manufacture nitrogenous fertilisers in Arklow. The company started in a relatively modest way but expanded to the stage where after the completion of the Marino Point plant in 1979 it was one of our largest chemical manufacturing companies, employing over 1,500 employees. By the early 1980s it was clearly recognised that because of the construction cost overruns and operating losses in the early years of the Marino Point plant, a substantial part of the NET debt was a sunk cost which could not be expected to be recovered. The overall size of the debt and the costs of servicing it were such as to keep the future of NET's fertiliser business and that of its employees in constant jeopardy.</P>
      <P>However, the future of the business was safeguarded with the formation of the joint venture with Imperial Chemical Industries in 1987 whereby NET's fertiliser businesses in Cork and Arklow and ICI's Richardson's fertiliser business in Belfast were transferred to the new joint venture company Irish Fertiliser Industries Limited, with NET's old core capital debt, most of which was guaranteed by the State, left with NET.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the joint venture arrangements NET took a 51% shareholding in the new company, with ICI taking the remaining 49%. In addition, NET entered into a long-term agreement with IFI for the supply of its gas feedstock requirements with a contract termination date scheduled for the end of 1999. At the time of the joint venture in 1987, NET already had a long-term gas con<Col N="277" /> tract in place with Bord Gáis Éireann under which NET purchased gas from BGE. The old accumulated NET debt, which was £164.6 million in September 1987, remained with NET with the intention that NET would service the borrowings from its income from profits on the sale of gas to Irish Fertiliser Industries Limited and dividends from that company.</P>
    <P>Since 1987, therefore, NET's primary activity has been the management of its debt portfolio as well as managing a gas contract and monitoring IFI. However, the combined income accruing to NET from its profits on the sale of gas and from dividends from IFI has been insufficient to fully cover the interest payable on NET's borrowings. As a result, the shortfall in interest had to be converted into new State-guaranteed borrowings, with the result that overall borrowings have continued to grow and have now reached £187.2 million.</P>
    <P>ICI and the State have offered for sale their shareholdings in IFI. Following this decision by both shareholders to seek to sell 100% of Irish Fertiliser Industries, two indicative offers were received. However, both the State and the other shareholder, ICI, were of the view that neither offer presented a sufficiently strong basis for proceeding further with the joint sale process. Subsequently, several other parties expressed a possible interest in the purchase of IFI but no further indicative offers were received. The company is still on offer for sale.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the various sections of the Bill. Section 1 provides for the standard interpretation and definitions. Section 2 provides for the transfer of liability in respect of NET's State-guaranteed debt to the Minister for Finance to enable the Minister to discharge the State's liabilities under the various outstanding loans. The current legislative limit on NET's State-guaranteed debt is £200 million and this section reflects that maximum amount.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for an amendment to the First Schedule of the National Treasury Management Agency Act, 1990, which will allow the Minister for Finance to transfer responsibility for the repayment and-or management of the NET debt to the National Treasury Management Agency. Section 4 is a standard provision to allow the Minister for Finance to make payments arising under this Bill from the central fund.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts, 1977 and 1988, four worker directors are elected to the NET board. Section 5 will enable the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make an order which would have the effect of discontinuing the entitlement of the four worker directors to be elected to the board of NET. It is only intended to exercise this power in the event of the sale or disposal of NET's 51% shareholding in IFI. The four worker directors on the board of NET are actually employees of IFI. Therefore, if the State was to dispose of its shareholding in IFI <Col N="278" /> there would no longer be a rationale for IFI employees to be elected to the board of NET.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the repeal of all previous NET legislation which comprises Acts stretching from the statutory establishment of NET in 1963 to the most recent Act in 1993. The section provides for the repeal of the NET Acts, 1963 to 1993, to be brought into operation by order of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Again, it is the intention to exercise this power only in the event of a sale of the State's shareholding in IFI and the subsequent winding up of NET.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is a standard provision enabling expenses incurred in the administration of the Act to be paid from moneys provided by the Oireachtas. Section 8 is also a standard provision giving the short title of the Act, which will be the Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Act, 2000. I am confident that the Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Bill, 2000, will commend itself to the Dáil and I recommend it for approval.</P>
    <P>Now that I have dealt with this matter on behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, I wish to address a few points on my own behalf. NET is a constituency matter for me. I suppose it is my <i>Alma Mater</i> because for a couple of decades I was employed by that company. I see colleagues on the other side of the House who, like me, also have a parochial interest in this. I was distribution manager with the company and was responsible for distribution of products from both the Arklow and Marino Point, Cork, plants, but I was based in Arklow. I had the pleasure of journeying to and from Cork regularly. I want to make a few points in that vein.</P>
    <P>The NET factory in Arklow had, indeed still has and I hope will continue to have, important economic implications for my constituency. For many years it was the economic heart-blood of not only the town of Arklow but also south Wicklow and north Wexford, employing in the order of 1,000 or 1,200 people. There was a huge spin-off involvement in the wider locality with hauliers and CIE. There was a great interconnection between NET and CIE, another State company. CIE, in effect, was the end of the conveyor belt of the production line of NET, whereby much of the finished product found its way onto rail trucks, usually custom-built rail wagons, which took the product around the country to Irish merchants, co-operatives and farmers. Hauliers from all over Ireland were employed in that business and benefited substantially.</P>
    <P>The company distributed its products through a series of distribution points, all of which were located at railheads around the country, and I was instrumental in putting that distribution network in place. That, again, had spin-off implications for many towns and villages around Ireland where NET product was stored on behalf of the company by CIE personnel, who otherwise perhaps would not have been employed in those areas. <Col N="279" /> Overall it was a great State company and national employer, giving employment widely.</P>
    <P>It also had serious beneficial implications for Irish agriculture, farmers and the agri-business generally. While in more latter years prices have fallen quite low, in years gone by that was not always the case on the international markets and were it not for the indigenous production of nitrogenous fertiliser products, for many years Irish farmers would have been held to ransom by high prices with imported product having to be brought into the country, particularly for our important grasslands. In that context, it has been a good company and its management and workers in Arklow and Cork have served the nation extremely well.</P>
    <P>Wonderful people started off the company in the early 1960s. J. B. Heinz was seconded from the Civil Service as the supremo and first managing director of the company. He had been a senior civil servant and he was taken from that post by the Government and put in charge of the company. Some years later he was succeeded by Peadar McSweeney, another former civil servant, who took over as the company supremo and managing director and served well for many years. A few other people come to mind, like Brendan Casey, who is a very innovative factory manager. We had a wonderful commercial team at the time. Two men with whom I worked were Tom M. Cullen and Lorcan O'Brien. Mr. Cullen is alive and well and has retired. Unfortunately Lorcan O'Brien has gone to his eternal reward. They were a wonderful commercial team, operating on the world stage at the most senior management and executive level, and they did excellent work for the company and Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Arklow and Cork operations, with modern technology and the need to trim down, are operating with far fewer employees nowadays, but it is a tighter and more streamlined operation. Let us hope that they will continue in that vein for many years to come.</P>
    <P>The Arklow operation is currently led by its general manager, Bill Flood. Mr. Flood and his management team and their workforce have streamlined the operation and are placing great emphasis on the environmental aspect of the business. Alas perhaps this was not much in our culture as a nation in the 1960s and 1970s and perhaps environmental considerations were not high on our agenda, but they are extremely high on the agenda of that company at present. On housekeeping, the general effluent coming from the plant is negligible and I suppose lessons of the past have been learned. For this, the management and staff are to be congratulated.</P>
    <P>The company's Arklow base was the lifeblood of the town and its wider hinterland of south Wicklow and north Wexford. That area really flourished. It was possibly one of the best provincial centres in Ireland in terms of economic activity and employment in those glorious years. Unfortunately, that was to end and much leaner <Col N="280" /> years were to follow because when the fertiliser industry ran down in that town and area, simultaneously the traditional pottery industry began similarly to run down, with huge numbers of lay-offs. It was a devastating blow to that part of the country and to my constituency. Many lean years ensued for that area of Arklow and south Wicklow.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, however, that is now in the past. There has been huge infrastructural investment in roads, sewage treatment and water works in the Arklow area. Arklow is now returning to those good years. It is a place that is very attractive to potential investors, industrialists and business people. Already, quality companies have been attracted and have been, and are being, set up. Part of the infrastructure there is an IDA park which is set to flourish with, as I said, quality people providing quality jobs. The good era of NET was followed by a lean period which is, thankfully, being followed by a good and prosperous period with a better quality of life for the people of the area. I apologise if I have been indulging in the parochial for too long but I wanted to put those important points on the record.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the work the Minister of State did in Arklow and with the Marino plant over the years has, in no small way, been important in the development of Irish Fertiliser Industries to date. I think he can take a bit of credit for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the issues surrounding NET and the future of IFI. I know my two colleagues, Deputy Stanton and Deputy Timmins, also have a vested interest in the future of the Irish Fertiliser Industries plants. This Bill will provide for the transfer of the State guaranteed debt from Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta to the National Treasury Management Agency to facilitate the sale of NET's holding of Irish Fertiliser Industries should a suitable purchaser come on the scene.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that the establishment of Irish Fertiliser Industries with ICI in 1987 was probably one of the first public private partnerships. My colleague, Deputy Noonan, was the Minister who signed that Bill into law. In fairness to NET, it fulfilled its element of the bargain with its responsibility in relation to servicing the debt during a very difficult time and especially after the establishment of IFI when we had the economic crisis and the Wall Street collapse in 1987 which made things difficult for servicing that debt at a future date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>NET, as the holding company of the State's 51% shareholding in IFI, has accumulated £187 million worth of debt. Its traditional source of income had been the sale of gas to IFI which ended at the end of last year. Now NET can only rely on the dividend from IFI to service this enor<Col N="281" /> mous debt. Fertiliser is a costly bulky product and suffers from commodity price swings. The Irish market is reliant, to a certain extent, on the weather. Good grass growth produces a drop in sales. It suffers from erratic supply patterns when cash strapped exporting countries, especially on the eastern side of the European Union, increase output to earn hard currency.</P>
    <P>The Irish fertiliser industry is facing a changing climate which may lead to consolidation even among the existing small number of blenders and wholesalers within the Irish market. Future fertiliser usage in Ireland faces new pressures. More public scrutiny is likely as the Department of the Environment and Local Government seeks to insist on farm nutrient plans being drawn up for farms to improve and conserve Irish water quality. Moreover, fertiliser usage is seen by some policy makers as excessive, particularly in relation to nitrogen and phosphates, and farmers face the prospect of having strict fertiliser limits imposed on their businesses in the future.</P>
    <P>It is important to make the point that as the new EU water directive is put in place, we will have to look seriously at the whole issue of phosphorous contamination of our water supplies. We should maybe look at the issue of licensing phosphate, especially in relation to the domestic use of phosphates, which can be controlled.</P>
    <P>I refer to public statements that have been made on the agriculture industry, products from IFI and phosphate pollution of our water supplies. The point has been made that the biggest polluters in terms of phosphates in our water are farmers. That is right in that the biggest amount, in terms of tonnage, comes from the farming community. However, only a small number of farmers are involved. That needs to be taken into account rather than reading headlines in the newspapers saying that all farmers are polluting our water supply. Only a small number of farmers in certain pockets are involved and it depends on the type of ground water. If it is properly regulated and if the by-laws are put in place, as has been proposed, it will resolve that problem.</P>
    <P>There was a problem in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's constituency, and if those by-laws are put in place, it will resolve the problem. It is not fair to blacken the agriculture and farming communities. Until now they were not aware of the risks or problems associated with ground water. The farming community will grasp this issue and help to resolve it. It is fundamentally important that we look at the broader aspect of this and at phosphates in household detergents etc. to see if we can find alternative ways of solving the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>I use the opportunity this <Col N="282" /> evening to put that on the record. I hope we will see further research in this area.</P>
      <P>At EU level, agriculture faces further pressures through extensification of livestock production and nutrient plant requirements which are being imposed. Therefore, the backdrop to the sector in Ireland is a static to declining market reinforced by the long-term schemes such as REPS and set aside.</P>
      <P>In terms of overall nitrogen production, IFI is a minor player, with 4.5% of the EU market. It also has approximately 40% of the Irish market which is predominantly geared towards grass production. Through its Northern subsidiary, Richardson, IFI controls about 52% of the market share in Northern Ireland. Sales of fertilisers are closely linked to the grazing season, farm grass supply and stock numbers. The current high stock numbers nationally are of benefit in preventing a sudden fall-off in fertiliser usage, but should stock numbers decline, the fertiliser usage will also drop.</P>
      <P>As agriculture continues to face stiff international competition, fertiliser sales internationally will be dictated by the cheapest supplier. Unless the IFI operation can generate cheaper fertiliser than available internationally, the security of the company hangs in the balance. The Irish fertiliser market peaked at about 1.9 million tonnes of consumption in 1996 and has since dropped back to approximately 1.5 million tonnes. About 60% of this consists of nitrogen or high nitrogen products.</P>
      <P>The price of energy is of crucial importance to IFI with its manufacturing facilities in Cork, Arklow and Belfast. That can play a big role in relation to the profits and losses of the company. IFI recently hit the headlines with the threat to employment during the ILDA train dispute. Prior to that, the headlines related to possible suitors interested in purchasing the three facilities. The sale of IFI was prompted, as the Minister highlighted, by ICI and its decision in 1998 to realise its shareholding following the disposal of its fertiliser industries in the UK. ICI has given a commitment that it will remain with the company for a further 18 months to two years. That is of fundamental importance to the future of Irish Fertiliser Industries. The Government and ICI are likely to adopt a different approach, however, to the sale, with the former likely to be concerned about keeping as many of the 630 jobs as possible after the sale, and ICI, naturally, wanting to sell to the highest bidder.</P>
      <P>Finding a buyer for IFI is likely to prove difficult, particularly in light of the uncertainty surrounding the fertiliser industry, as I have pointed out. However, the Government has missed the boat, in terms of selling the business at peak profitability. The outcome of that sale will be crucial in determining the size of the State's write-off and the future of those 630 jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The larger international manufacturers may be interested in buying IFI with the long-term aim of closing down its Irish bases and reaping the <Col N="283" /> benefits by supplying the Irish market from continental Europe. However, unlike the majority of European fertiliser operations, IFI has been extensively rationalised and is now a low cost producer. It has made significant investment in its three plants over recent years. Arklow has received a £13.5 million investment in a new granulation facility. The Richardsons facility in Belfast has received a £35 million investment and the ammonia plant in Cork is one of the most state-of-the-art and modern plants in the European Union. Rationalisation within IFI dates back almost to the commencement of production in the plant at Marino Point.</P>
    <P>The other option is that a consortium of Irish interests might be convinced to purchase IFI at a relatively low price if it could be shown that such a move would generate an advantage to their suppliers and owners by having an Irish based fertiliser manufacturing operation. This is seen by some as the best avenue for the long-term security of IFI. However, 12 months ago IAWS boss, Philip Lynch, said the Government would find it very difficult to sell IFI. He said IAWS made a token bid for the company last year but that the truth is that nobody wants to buy it. In effect, unless the level of fertiliser production is cut dramatically, the long-term outlook for the sector is dismal.</P>
    <P>However, the Tánaiste established a consultation committee made up of representatives of the company, trade unions, the Government and its corporate advisers, who were appointed at that time to oversee the process of the sale when that was being considered by the Government. As the Minister said, it is still for sale. The Tánaiste reassured the trade unions in regard to the jobs in the company. The Government will make much about these job guarantees forming part of the sale, but are such commitments guaranteed? I would like the Minister to address this point because it is a fundamental concern in his and Deputy Timmins's constituency and in Deputy Stanton's constituency. The big fear out there is in relation to the security of those jobs. I had hoped the Minister would address that in his initial speech but I hope he will address it when he replies.</P>
    <P>The workers are afraid of the employment conditions they will have under any new employer. Will their current conditions of employment be protected? They should be congratulated on the current pension fund, which I am told is quite successful. However, will that be protected in a new company? The investment that has been made in that fund by the company and its employees should be ring-fenced for those employees. What protections and guarantees can the Minister give in that regard?</P>
    <P>The staff have broached with the Minister the issue of employee share ownership. Now that negotiations are no longer ongoing with prospective purchasers of IFI, perhaps the Tánaiste should reopen such discussions. I believe there <Col N="284" /> were discussions in this regard at the time of the initial consideration of the sale of the company. That avenue should be looked at again and the employees should be given that opportunity. I do not know whether the option of a staff buy-out is feasible. However, all these avenues need to be looked at and the staff need to be reassured. It is important those reassurances are put on the record of the House because there are concerns out there. The company is a major employer in those constituencies.</P>
    <P>We must also take into consideration the fact that, while the company is partially owned by a semi-State company, it is also a cross-Border company. It has employed staff in Belfast from all communities, for which all credit is due to it.</P>
    <P>There needs to be consultation and communication between the staff representatives and the Department. That is the fundamental issue I hope the Minister takes from this debate. Those commitments must be laid before the House. I am disappointed the staff representatives were not consulted prior to publication of this Bill. It would have been a gesture, more than anything else, because I do not think there is anything very controversial in the Bill. They should have been consulted, out of courtesy, and informed that the Bill was coming before the House this week. Failure by the Department to do so will set the tone for any future sale and, naturally, raises concerns for the employees. I hope contact is kept with the staff representatives involved.</P>
    <P>Under section 3 the management of the debt will be transferred to the NTMA. Will the debt itself remain with NET following the enactment of this legislation? Section 5 provides that the worker participation legislation will not apply to NET after the sale. Can the Minister guarantee the board will be fully consulted prior to any sale of the shareholding in IFI held by NET? The worker representatives are not represented on the board of IFI and their only avenue to that board is through its chairperson, who is also the chairperson of NET. They have representation on the board of NET. If the Minister could even guarantee that the board of NET would be consulted on the future sale, it would put at ease the minds of many of the staff.</P>
    <P>The outlook within the fertiliser industry is not as negative as I have made out. There have been many amalgamations throughout Europe, quite a number of plants have closed and efficiencies have increased. However, given the size of the Irish industry, Irish Fertiliser Industries should be given credit for its operation here. The short-term outlook is for the industry to pick up and the price of fertiliser to improve, although while that might be of benefit to some constituencies, I know it will be a disadvantage to others. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann mindful of the public outrage that followed the Omagh bomb atrocity in August 1998, a criminal act carried out by the Real IRA, and recognising the continuing anguish caused to the victims of this bombing by the failure to secure convictions thus far, calls on the Government to:</P>
      <P>&ndash;set out the action, if any, taken on foot of the enactment of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998;</P>
      <P>&ndash;give details of the further measures currently being considered;</P>
      <P>&ndash;outline the discussions that have taken place between the British and Irish Governments on this matter,</P>
      <P>and recognising the excellent investigative work that is jointly taking place between An Garda Síochána and the RUC, further calls on all Members of Dáil Éireann to support the call made by both Prime Ministers for the public to assist both police forces with their ongoing inquiries through the giving of information which may help in apprehending those responsible for this crime.</P>
      <P>The Omagh bombing was the biggest single crime committed on this island in the past 200 years. Two years after the event the people responsible have not even been brought before the courts. According to <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning the perpetrators of the Omagh bombing are back in action and preparing further atrocities at this time. Their identities are known but their activities continue. I welcome the fact that there have been three arrests this morning in relation to Omagh, but there have already been 58 arrests and subsequent releases in this investigation and still there has not been a successful prosecution. The timing of the arrests on the day of this debate is not a matter on which I will comment now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two years ago in the wake of this crime the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, described the range of legislative measures then being proposed by the Government to the Dáil to catch the Omagh mur<Col N="286" /> derers as the toughest in the history of the State. The Government told the Dáil that surveillance and intelligence gathering activities would be stepped up, particularly in relation to the Real IRA and the Thirty-Two County Sovereignty Movement. The Taoiseach said he would continue to pursue those responsible for the Omagh bombing to lock them up for a long time. He said the so-called Real IRA cannot hope to take on the people of Ireland and win. He said that the Government was determined to crush and dismantle any organisations that still engage in violence and that the Real IRA should be in &ldquo;no doubt&rdquo; about our determination to do everything we can to bring the perpetrators of the Omagh bombing to justice. At the same time the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform got the Dáil to agree to an Offences Against the State Act to overturn the rules of evidence to facilitate prosecution for membership of an illegal organisation.</P>
    <P>If the identities of the Omagh bombers are known, as <i>The Irish Times</i> says, why have these new powers not been used against them. The Minister's new Act also created new offences of directing an unlawful organisation, possession of articles for the purposes in certain offences, unlawful collection of information, withholding information and training in the use of firearms. How often have these powers been used against the Real IRA? Very seldom, I suggest.</P>
    <P>The Minister, furthermore, asked the Dáil to agree powers of forfeiture of property of persons convicted of certain offences. As no one has even been prosecuted for Omagh, that power is effectively a dead letter. The Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998, will lapse in two months time unless renewed. It has been so little used, will it be renewed? What would be the point? Perhaps the Minister will answer.</P>
    <P>The Dáil gave the Garda all those extra powers, but no tangible results have been achieved, and it is time to ask why. Most democrats would accept there must be accountability for law enforcement just as there is accountability for other activities of the State. The time has come for an account to be given by the law enforcement authorities of both jurisdictions on this island as to why there have been no prosecutions of the principal perpetrators of the Omagh bombing. That is why Fine Gael has tabled tonight's motion. I hope the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will tonight give a proper account of the reasons for the failure of the authorities here and in Northern Ireland to bring a successful prosecution.</P>
    <P>Additional allegations about Omagh have been made in two newspapers in recent days. This debate affords the Minister an opportunity to deal comprehensively with these allegations. The allegations must be put on the floor of the House so that they can be dealt with. For saying we would put these questions about the allegations to the Government tonight, questions about the biggest crime in Irish history, Deputy Hayes and <Col N="287" /> I have been accused by an anonymous Government spokesperson speaking to the <i>Irish Independent</i> this morning of being sucked into a campaign of disinformation aimed at destabilising the peace process. This slander suggests that the Government may be reluctant to face questions about Omagh. The Dáil is the place to ask questions. If allegations are made, in both cases by respectable Irish journalists, about the biggest crime in Irish history, this is the place to ask and answer those questions.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, a straight question to his face if he was here. Does he think the two Irish journalists who have raised these matters, Henry McDonnell and Jim Cusack, are trying to destabilise the peace process, in the words of the Government spokesman. If not, who is trying to destabilise the peace process? How can asking questions about the non-prosecution of the Omagh murderers be construed as destabilising the peace process? Surely a successful prosecution of the Omagh murderers would actually stabilise the peace process? That is what I believe. I believe that the failure to bring prosecutions and the limp admission by the authorities of their inability to bring a successful prosecution is what is destabilising the peace process.</P>
    <P>I wish to set out briefly the background to the most recent concerns. This morning <i>The Irish Times</i> contrasts this winding down of the Omagh investigation with the situation in the Veronica Guerin case. It states that almost two years into the investigation of the murder of Veronica Guerin there was a sizable team of detectives based in Lucan Garda station compiling evidence and tracking movements of the figures responsible for her murder across the Continent. Many of the original 40 or so detectives in the case have devoted much of the intervening four years to the case. By contrast, the group of 40 or so detectives assembled to investigate the Omagh bombing, which is the worst single atrocity committed on the island in the 20th century, was largely disbanded within three months of the bombing. Is this so and, if so, why? How does that square with the Taoiseach's statement in the Dáil about hunting down these killers? These are matters the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must explain here tonight.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also explain the reasons for the statement in the <i>Irish News</i> on 13 March by Commissioner Pat Byrne in relation to the Omagh bombing, when asked if the masterminds of the attack would get away scot free, he replied, &ldquo;sadly, possibly and maybe probably&rdquo;. On what basis has the commissioner formed the view that the masterminds will probably get away scot free? The Minister should explain that. Does that admission not make nonsense of all the extra powers we voted here? In the same interview Commissioner Byrne stated: &ldquo;If I could prosecute people for all the intelligence information I had on them, I can tell you a lot more people would <Col N="288" /> be in jail.&rdquo; It is obvious one cannot prosecute people on the basis of intelligence information but one can sometimes decide that a crime is so serious that the sources of intelligence should be asked to give evidence in the trial. This is a judgment call. In minor cases one will not ask such informants to give evidence because the information about subsequent offences may be more useful. In the case of the single biggest murder in the nation's history such informant evidence is not being used while it is being used in other serious crimes. If that is happening it must be explained. Can the Minister explain it?</P>
    <P>It is obvious the Garda Síochána had good information about the internal workings of the Real IRA in the months leading up to the Omagh bombing. The Garda intercepted at least six potential bomb attacks in Howth on 8 January, Redhills, County Cavan, on 24 February, Hackballscross on 22 March, Dundalk on 22 March, Dún Laoghaire on 2 April and Jonesboro on 24 March, all in 1998. The Omagh bombing took place on 15 August of the same year. <i>The Irish Times</i> claimed this morning that these interceptions happened because the Garda had infiltrated the Real IRA and had recruited a number of informants, including people used to ferry explosives, to steal cars and to conduct other relatively low level activities. It is claimed that these informants were responsible for the Garda successes. It appears that these informants have not been required to act as State's evidence in a case against the Omagh bombers, whereas informants have been used in other cases. This is in contrast with the Veronica Guerin case in which accomplice evidence was used.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should explain if there has been a difference in approach in regard to the use of accomplice evidence in the Guerin murder and the Omagh bombing case and, if so, why. If a decision was made, what type of decision was it and by whom was it made? <i>The Irish Times </i>speculates that there might be political difficulties in using accomplice witnesses in the courts in Northern Ireland. As the Minister has stated that there has been no political interference in this particular case, I would be grateful if he stated the general policy in regard to the use of accomplice evidence of people currently living in the Republic in cases in Northern Ireland where the RUC is also involved in the prosecution. Is there a problem with this on policy grounds? Due to the magnitude of the atrocity committed at Omagh there should be no such problem. I believe the Irish people would agree with me. Accomplice evidence should be used. The Minister should clarify his policy in general terms and in respect of this case.</P>
    <P>It is claimed by <i>The Observer </i>that the Garda wishes to use the same methods which led to the conviction of those involved in the killing of Veronica Guerin in 1996 in the Omagh case and that a protection scheme for witnesses, which was set up in the Guerin case, has not been made avail<Col N="289" /> able in the Omagh case. That should be clarified. We are at a difficult juncture in the peace process in Northern Ireland. Despite the commitment given in the Good Friday Agreement to the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons, no decommissioning has taken place. There has been a proper insistence that every other aspect of the Good Friday Agreement be implemented in full and to the letter but none on the accompanying decommissioning of paramilitary weapons.</P>
    <P>During the debate on Omagh two years ago I asked that the mainstream Republican movement, the Provisional IRA, act on the commitments given by Sinn Féin in the Good Friday Agreement on decommissioning. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, responded to me by saying, &ldquo;The answer to the decommissioning question is, ask me in two years time&rdquo;. Well, two years have passed. The Minister and all those who shared his view then should answer the question now. Will there ever be decommissioning by the IRA and, if not, why was a commitment on decommissioning put in the Good Friday Agreement? Would it not have been more honest to have told the people before they voted on the agreement that they should ask this question in two years and not then, as the Minister was happy to point out after the people had safely voted for it?</P>
    <P>It has been said that the RUC must be transformed from a counter insurgency force into a normal police force. I agree. However, we should also understand why some people might want to be sure that the insurgency is over before the counter insurgency methods are disbanded. That is the problem we face now. The continued activity and non-prosecution of the Real IRA creates the impression that insurgency is not yet over. That is why the Taoiseach must live up to his promise two years ago to put the Real IRA out of business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. We need to do more than make annual and sometimes ritualistic statements about the Omagh bombing. Given that the Dáil was reconvened in emergency session in September 1998 to facilitate a change in our domestic law, it falls on the Government, which originally proposed such legal changes, to set out the progress that has been made to date in relation to the worst atrocity in the 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Omagh bombing has left its mark on the collective conscience of the Irish people. It is imperative that those responsible for this crime, namely, the Real IRA, be brought to justice at once. The surviving victims and the relatives of those murdered in Omagh made clear at the recent inquest their compelling desire for justice. They want the bombers, their accomplices and those who directed the bombing to be brought into open court and held accountable for their actions. Nothing must stand in the way of their wishes. Our actions must be guided by the maxim, &ldquo;Let justice be done, though the heavens fall&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="290" /> Last week's &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; programme unleashed an understandable public reaction throughout the country. Everybody is horrified that a small group of people who may be responsible for the Omagh bombing are entitled to walk freely about this Republic as if nothing had happened. Needless to say, there are some who would prefer that the matter be either forgotten about or quietly ignored. This is the same group of people who are worried that increased pressure could lead to a further splintering of the Republican movement. There can be no political considerations in the pursuit of those who are responsible for the Omagh bombing. If this were to happen, it would mean that paramilitaries would still be using violence as a political tool.</P>
    <P>Tonight's motion is critically important in calling on the public to support the police authorities on this island. People must come forward and give information to the Garda or the RUC so the final pieces of the jigsaw can be put in place. To date, virtually all political parties have been prepared to call on the public to do their patriotic duty by giving information which could assist in apprehending the Omagh bombers. The Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, reiterated that call over the summer months. I believe a unanimous resolution of this House calling on the public to support the work of the police authorities on this island will give additional weight and support to both Governments.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for Sinn Féin to say today that it condemns the bombers of Omagh while refusing to support a call for the public to come forward with information. That type of double-speak, particularly after the Irish people supported the Good Friday Agreement which was, in effect, an expression of self-determination, cannot be compatible with a party that espouses non-violence. Without evidence given in an open court it is impossible for the Omagh bombers to be convicted. People need to come forward and the State has a responsibility to ensure the safety of such people against the fear of intimidation or threat from any quarter.</P>
    <P>Nobody can doubt that the Omagh bombing was a direct challenge to the clearly expressed wishes of the Irish people as expressed in their support for the Good Friday Agreement. The decision of the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA to continue their campaigns of violence after May 1998 was another example of the fundamentally anti-democratic and fascist nature of those organisations. I wish Sinn Féin and the IRA would recognise that those self-styled rejectionist Republicans are doing untold damage to the peace process and the Republican community. I hope they will realise this sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>It would be naive to think that the movements and actions of the small group of people behind the Omagh bombing could go unnoticed in the wider community. Without the support of 50 or 60 people, perhaps more, an atrocity of this nature could not have happened. Somebody knows <Col N="291" /> the identity of the people who stole the car that was used in the bombing, the bogus number plates, the movements of those who were responsible for manufacturing the bomb that killed 29 people and somebody has information about where the car used in the incident was stored.</P>
    <P>People in possession of this information must come forward and political parties in this House and elsewhere should stop equivocating on the issue of encouraging people to come forward. We must break the culture of silence which has surrounded the Omagh bombing. This culture of silence has been an indelible feature of political violence in this country since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>The murder of Detective Jerry McCabe by the IRA in Limerick and the court case that followed were marked by the unwillingness of certain witnesses to give evidence. Some do this out of loyalty to terrorist organisations, others because they dare not speak out. The intimidation used by the Republican movement in Limerick during and after the McCabe murder are clear examples of how ruthless paramilitary organisations will be to protect the guilty.</P>
    <P>The Government spoke bravely in September 1998 about its willingness to take on the threat posed by dissident republican groups opposed to the Agreement. The Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, speaking in the Dáil on that occasion said, &ldquo;They [the Real IRA] should not be in any doubt about the Government's determination to crush and dismantle any organisations that still engage in violence.&rdquo; The enactment of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998, was described by the Taoiseach as &ldquo;extremely tough, even draconian&rdquo;. However, two years later the Real IRA and their apologists in the 32 County Sovereignty Committee are still very much in business. In this morning's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> Mr. Jim Cusack said:</P>
    <P>Not only are the people who perpetrated Omagh still free but according to sources on both sides of the Border, they are again actively engaged in pursuing a terrorist campaign aimed at unsettling the North. Security forces on both sides of the Border expect a significant terrorist attack.</P>
    <P>Members are aware of well publicised cases in recent months where dissident republican paramilitary operatives have attempted to import arms from Croatia and the United States. This highlights further the extent of the threat that is currently posed. It should not be forgotten that despite a belief that the Real IRA would go away after the Omagh bombing, fund raising activities for that organisation have continued uninterrupted. Since the Omagh bombing, I understand the Real IRA has carried out a further 26 criminal acts, including robbery, possession of explosives and attacks on public buildings and persons. Under any set of objective criteria, it could hardly <Col N="292" /> be said that this organisation has been dismantled.</P>
    <P>Some would prefer if such things were not said. There is a belief that talking about these matters is causing &ldquo;difficulties&rdquo; within the wider republican community. I do not accept that. The security of this State is a matter of fundamental importance to the proceedings of this House and to the actions of our democratically elected Government. Furthermore, the vast majority of republicans have confidence in the peace process and believe the Good Friday Agreement provides a way forward for all shades of political opinion on this island. However, the vestiges of paramilitarism, which relentlessly hangs on to the threat of violence as a means of achieving its aims, must be forever banished from the new politics we all have created since the Good Friday Agreement was signed.</P>
    <P>While the Omagh bombing case is different from the investigations that followed the murder of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> journalist, Veronica Guerin, it should be recognised that success in the Guerin case came after a security clamp down on Dublin crime bosses. This was a clear example where political support for the work of the Garda yielded direct results in terms of apprehending Veronica Guerin's murderers. It is a case in point where new legislation, allied to excellent investigative work on the part of the Garda, brought successful prosecutions, but also checked the direct threat posed to this State from the influence of the criminal underworld.</P>
    <P>It is also worth highlighting that the Offences Against the State Act allows the State to confiscate lands or property where it is proven that persons are engaged in or have directed terrorist acts. The Government has a responsibility to set out in the context of this debate if the legislation I have referred to has been used in respect of the Omagh bombing.</P>
    <P>While we can say nothing to reduce the pain of the victims of Omagh, we have a responsibility to ensure that justice is done. The most effective way to achieve this is for the perpetrators of that massacre to be brought before the courts. This is something every Member of this House wants to see happen. The longer people get away with this act, the greater the suffering will be for those who are scarred from the Omagh bombing. The victims do not want revenge but rather to see justice established. As the sovereign parliament of the people of this Republic, it is our task to ensure justice is done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie:</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not find it easy in this House to support the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998. It was described by its proposers here and in Britain as draconian. It was oppressive and illiberal legislation similar to that which I opposed in parliament and on the streets of Northern Ireland during the civil rights campaign. I supported the legislation because of the enormity of the atrocity and because I was told it would help bring to justice the murderers of 31 <Col N="293" /> innocent human beings. That has not yet happened, despite the best efforts of the Garda and the RUC. We are told by both police forces it is unlikely the perpetrators will be brought to justice, despite the fact that their identities are known to the authorities and that the BBC can identify them apparently without any fear of libel actions.</P>
      <P>When the Minister replies to this debate &ndash; I am sorry he is not present &ndash; I hope he will tell us if he sees any use in this legislation which some of us supported after considerable agonising. Will he tell us what other action he is contemplating to ensure the perpetrators of this dreadful act are brought to justice because it is completely unacceptable that they remain free, particularly when there is ample evidence they have continued to plan further acts of terrorism and may, even as I speak here today, be planning another Omagh type atrocity.</P>
      <P>Let us place Omagh in a wider political context. I have long believed that a power sharing executive in Northern Ireland, enabling politicians from both traditions to work together to combat social, economic, political and cultural problems, could make a major contribution towards reconciliation and lasting peace. I still believe this to be the case. There is, however, another necessity for Northern Ireland which is fundamental, that is, a police service acceptable in all areas of the North and among the adherents of both the unionist and nationalist traditions. When I say &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo; I mean in the most basic way of a police service which has serving in its ranks young nationalists, republicans and unionists. Ideally there should be a power sharing executive which would have its laws and regulations enforced by an acceptable police service. I have in the past described as a eunuch, a so-called administration which relies on someone else, in this case the British Government, to enforce its edicts. The Northern Ireland executive should have its own policing function.</P>
      <P>Suppose a situation develops where the political situation dictates that a choice must be made between a power sharing executive and an acceptable police service. I hope against hope that such a dilemma will not develop, but the current and deep divisions over the implementation of the Patten report makes such a development at least a possibility. In such unfortunate circumstances, where a choice would have to be made between the continuation of a power sharing executive and the establishment of an acceptable police service, an acceptable police service would have to be the choice. No administration can survive which does not have the support of a police service acceptable to both communities. A power sharing executive is no exception. Acceptable policing must, therefore, be a paramount consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion calls on all Deputies to support the call made by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister for the public to assist both police forces with their ongoing inquiries into the Omagh <Col N="294" /> atrocity by giving information which may help in apprehending those responsible. That responsibility applies to the Sinn Féin Member of this House and to the republican movement generally. The Omagh atrocity provided the optimum conditions for all self-respecting human beings to provide information which would lead to the detection of those responsible. This was the greatest single atrocity in the history of the troubles, given the lack of humanity of those who left the scene in the full knowledge of the proximity of so many innocent people and, in political terms, it was a crime perpetrated in the aftermath of the Good Friday Agreement and its endorsement by the great majority of the Irish people. Omagh was a two-fingered insult to the Irish people. It was also a two-fingered act of defiance to Sinn Féin and the republican movement which had contributed to the agreement. The perpetrators were former &lsquo;provos'. Their expertise in bomb-making and their mode of operation were learned in that organisation. Why then has Sinn Féin not co-operated in bringing the perpetrators to justice? If Sinn Féin is not prepared to co-operate with the RUC why does it not co-operate with the Garda? The party's failure to do so raises questions about its attitude to the institutions of this State. For the future, what weight should be given to Sinn Féin's commitment that in the context of the full implementation of Patten, it will ask young Nationalists and republicans to join the new police service in the North?</P>
    <P>In these circumstances the burden once again falls unequally on the shoulders of the SDLP. As so often in the past that party has been put in the position of having to take the tough decisions. The SDLP will take its own decisions and will do what it considers to be right. The conditions must be right in regard to policing. There is no point in the SDLP calling for young Nationalists and republicans to join a new police service unless there is a good chance its call will be heeded. The party's demand for the full implementation of Patten deserves the support of the Government and all Members of this House.</P>
    <P>Most people who speak about Omagh refer to the past but Omagh's nightmare still continues. The agony of the relatives continues from day to day and at the recent inquest the disclosure of the gory details added to the agony. The failure of the authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice has hindered the mourning process but Omagh is also suffering in other ways. Hardly a day goes by without its business life being disrupted by bomb scares. No new industry has been attracted to the town. It is as if the dreadful events of August 1998 have put a blight on the town's development.</P>
    <P>The murderers must be brought to justice and other practical steps for Omagh's rehabilitation must be taken, particularly by the Government and Executive which claims jurisdiction and has responsibility for it. I hope the unanimous passing of this motion will demonstrate where we stand on this issue and our determination that justice <Col N="295" /> will eventually be done following the terrible atrocity at Omagh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. It is an outrage that two years after the greatest atrocity in the history of this State the perpetrators of that crime still roam the country free. Ordinary people cannot comprehend why they have not been brought to justice. It appears that the names of the people involved are well known. Their families and neighbours know who they are and I believe the police authorities, North and South, know who was involved.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Garda on the great work it has done in preventing many more such atrocities. Unfortunately, it was not capable of preventing what happened in Omagh. It appears the people who caused the loss of so many lives crossed the Border to inflict great injury on our neighbours and friends in Omagh. It is not acceptable or good enough.</P>
      <P>The recent inquest relived the entire horror of what those families went through at the time and they are still suffering. Some people hope Omagh will be forgotten in time but it will never be forgotten. Healing will take place when the perpetrators of this bloody, murderous act are brought to justice, no sooner and no later. Nobody need think that in time it will pass and be forgotten. That is not acceptable in or good for a democracy.</P>
      <P>I hope the news that three people were arrested earlier in County Monaghan in relation to the Omagh bombing might be the start of a process that will bring about the arrest, charge and sentence of the perpetrators to the terms of imprisonment they must serve without any conditions attached. Nothing less will be sufficient to satisfy the ordinary, decent people of Ireland who do not like the fact that these people are going about their business, meeting in units and recruiting young people into their organisation.</P>
      <P>In one public house not far from this House, young people are openly canvassed to join the Real IRA. If that information can be given to me, it can be given to the Garda. Why are those who are recruiting and encouraging young people to join this organisation not brought to justice? Surely that is an illegal act. I believe more can be done. I do not blame the Garda because I have the highest regard for its work but I and ordinary people feel that in some way its hands are being tied in regard to this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing less than the Taoiseach coming into the House tonight or tomorrow tonight and explaining to the people what is happening clearly and categorically and what the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is doing to ensure that these people are brought to book will do. I hope the Taoiseach will come into the House and clear the air not only in relation to Omagh but also the activities of illegal organisations which are masquerading around Ireland. If the officials in the Departments of the Taoiseach <Col N="296" /> and Justice, Equality and Law Reform are not aware of that something is radically wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. I live nearer than most Members to the scene of the Omagh bombing and what happened that day is still on our minds. A total of 31 people lost their lives, including two unborn children who should be celebrating their second birthday within a few weeks. That is some benefit to offer this country by whoever did it, possibly the Real IRA. Victims of the bombing call to my office, as they do to those of other Members, to express horror and anger that nobody has been brought to justice. Hopefully the news that three people were arrested earlier will mean something to them.</P>
      <P>The Omagh nightmare still continues two years later. The inquest brought back many memories and the fact that none of the bombers is behind bars is a serious issue for the families and friends of the deceased. The Patten report and the need for a new police force in Northern Ireland was debated by the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body in Galway last week. The report was mentioned earlier in this debate but it is only one element of the Good Friday Agreement. Another element involved the release of prisoners which has been carried out but another important chapter of the Agreement dealt with decommissioning. The failure of Sinn Féin, our Government and the British Government to ensure that element of the Agreement was undertaken is nothing short of a disaster.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ó Caoláin asked the Taoiseach whether he accepted the Sinn Féin commitment to encourage its members to join the new police force if the Patten report was agreed. The Taoiseach said he did. Are the people who gave the commitment on Patten the same as those who gave the commitment on decommissioning? That is extremely important.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace):</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express the sincere regret of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, that he cannot be present. He had scheduled a flight to return this afternoon from an EU meeting, but the meeting is still ongoing. He will be present tomorrow night for the debate and I wish to express his sincere apologies for his absence this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of the Government, I accept the terms of the motion. The House is united in its outrage at the bomb in Omagh and in its determination to do all it can to help combat such atrocities. I have no difficulty in fulfilling the terms of the motion, even as it is debated, by outlining for the House the steps taken in the aftermath of the Omagh bombing. The House will appreciate, I am sure, particularly given that a person is before the courts at present on charges arising from the bombing at Omagh, that there are clear constraints on the level of detail I can share with the House. This is aside entirely from the long-stand<Col N="297" /> ing tradition of not commenting on operational security matters.</P>
    <P>The bomb at Omagh, the single worst atrocity in the troubled history of Northern Ireland, caused all of us to feel a sense of horror and revulsion and it hardened our resolve to do everything in our power to confront such evil and to advance the cause of peace. In the aftermath of the Omagh bombing, the House in 1998 passed the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act. In legal terms, it represented a significant enhancement of the Offences against the State Acts. In moral terms, it represented our determination to protect lives and democracy itself.</P>
    <P>However, before dealing in detail with the operation of that Act, I intend to address other important issues. My comments are not necessary to make clear the unswerving commitment of the Government to bring to justice those responsible for the Omagh bombing. No Government could have a greater commitment. I hesitate to raise the matter, lest even discussing it might be taken as an acknowledgement that there is a substantive issue to be addressed, but I cannot ignore reports over the past few days in certain parts of the media to the effect that the Government has in some way put political pressure on the Garda Síochána with the intention of interfering with the investigation into the Omagh bombing.</P>
    <P>The details of the allegation, such as they are, are so preposterous as not to be worth repeating. I reject them with contempt and I ask the House to do likewise. This monstrous allegation can only cause hurt to those who lost loved ones in Omagh and to the survivors of that terrible atrocity, and generate suspicion and mistrust. I ask Members not to breathe life into this contemptible story by saying anything which would be open to the interpretation that they believed it could possibly be true. It is one thing for a grossly irresponsible report such as this to be published in the media. It would be another matter for Members of the House to take up this issue because to even ask the question is to at least contemplate the possibility that the allegation might be well-founded.</P>

      <P>The commitment of the Garda Síochána and the Government to bring the Omagh bombers to justice is beyond question &ndash; we are all at one in that regard. So too is our determination that everything possible should be done to prevent further such atrocities, and immense work has been done in this respect by the Garda Síochána in terms of arrests, detentions, charges and the discovery of firearms, explosives and related material. That this determination and work is necessary and that those responsible for the Omagh bomb might contemplate further such atrocities is in itself shocking, but that is the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those responsible for the Omagh bomb and their fellow travellers reject peace. They reject the peace process and its democratic legitimacy. They reject democracy itself. They reject all the values we hold dear and they are ruthlessly dedicated to the imposition of their will on the people of this island. They will have no regard for what we say in the House, but it is important, nevertheless, for us to restate our total commitment to the peace process and to opposing with all means at our disposal those who seek to destroy it through violence. There is a great deal at stake. We cannot allow those who represent no one except themselves and who are prepared to commit the <Col N="299" /> most appalling atrocities to bring down the peace process. I am sure that is the joint determination of the House.</P>
    <P>The 1998 Act amended the Offences against the State Acts in a number of important respects. First, the Act made changes to the rules of evidence which previously applied in relation to the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation and more generally for the purpose of other offences under the Offences against the State Acts and scheduled offences under those Acts. Second, the Act created certain new substantive offences of particular relevance to the activities of unlawful organisations and those who provide support for them. Third, the Act gave additional power to the courts in respect of those who provide support to the activities of unlawful organisations or engage in offences on their behalf. Fourth, the Act extended the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act.</P>
    <P>It is worth recalling in more detail some of the more important provisions of the Act. Section 2 deals with the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation &ndash; it is one of the key provisions of the Act. Its effect is to provide that where, in any proceedings against a person in relation to that charge, evidence is given that the accused failed to answer or gave false or misleading answers to any question material to the investigation of the offence while being questioned in relation to that offence, the court may draw such inferences from that failure or from the furnishing of a false or misleading reply as appear proper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Has that section been used in any case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace:</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 of the Act, which made the second important change in the area of evidence, also relates to the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation. It provided that in proceedings for such an offence the accused shall not, without leave of the court, call any other person to give evidence on his or her behalf unless notice has been given of his or her intention to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 is not restricted to the offence of membership but, provided the offence carries a penalty of five years imprisonment or more, it has application to any offence under the Offences against the State Acts, scheduled offences for the purpose of the 1939 Act and offences arising out of the same set of facts as an offence under the Acts or a scheduled offence. The effect of this section, which is closely based on a similar provision in the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) <Col N="300" /> Act, 1996, is to allow a court to draw inferences where the accused relies on a fact in his or her defence that he or she could reasonably have been expected to mention during questioning or on being charged but did not do so. This section, as with section 2, incorporated important safeguards whereby it will not have effect unless the accused was told in ordinary language what the effect of a failure to mention such a fact might be and provides that a person shall not be convicted solely on an inference drawn from such a failure.</P>
    <P>The second main objective of the Act was the creation of five new substantive offences in sections 6, 7, 8, 9 and 12. Section 6 established the offence of directing, at any level of the organisation's structure, the activities of an organisation in respect of which a suppression order has been made under the Offences against the State Act, 1939.</P>

      <P>Of course, it is not a function of the Government to enforce the Act, but rather it is for the Garda Síochána and the courts to apply its provisions in appropriate cases. It is quite right, however, that this House should keep under review the operation of the Act. Indeed, this is provided for in the Act itself, under which each year the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must lay before both Houses a report on the operation of key sections of the Act as a prelude to a vote in both Houses on the renewal of those sections, in the absence of which they would automatically lapse.</P>
      <P>The first such report was laid before this House on 15 June this year and a resolution continuing in force the provisions of the Acts was passed by both Houses on 20 June. I do not propose to repeat everything that was said on that occasion either, but I am glad of this opportunity to reject emphatically the view which has been expressed in some quarters that little or nothing has been done to enforce the Act.</P>
      <P>The report shows that up to the end of May, 29 persons were held in the extended detention provided for under the Act. Clearly, this demonstrates that one of the central provisions of the Act is being utilised by the Garda Síochána to the extent that they consider appropriate. It cannot credibly be argued that the power of extended detention ought to have been used more widely. Certainly, we in this House cannot form a judgment on operational issues as to when such detention might be justified. That is a matter in each case for the Garda Síochána and the courts.</P>

    <P>It is also worth recalling the reason the Oireachtas required positive yearly approval by both Houses of the key provisions of the Act, following a report by the Minister, Deputy O'Don<Col N="302" /> oghue, on their operation. That was the recognition that these are strong provisions which, by their nature, must be kept under review. It would be distinctly odd, in those circumstances, if the House, being so alive to the potency of these provisions as to require their annual renewal, in effect was to urge the Garda Síochána to implement them in circumstances where the Garda Síochána does not, in its professional judgment, consider it justified.</P>
    <P>It is also worth bearing in mind the consideration that some of the provisions are such that, when activated, their impact is not immediate, but is none the less real for all that. I have mentioned, for example, the provisions on the drawing of adverse inferences from silence during Garda questioning. Those provisions are activated during Garda detention when relevant questions are put to the person detained, but are only availed of at a subsequent trial when the court or the jury, as the case may be, is empowered to draw inferences in appropriate circumstances.</P>
    <P>Turning to another aspect, the motion calls on the Government to detail any further measures which are currently being considered. Of course, the House will appreciate that for obvious security reasons, it would not be appropriate to go into the specific details of any further measures which might be under consideration, but certainly it is the case that the capacity of the criminal law to respond to atrocities, such as Omagh, is kept under constant review in the light of experience. The Government will not hesitate to bring to this House any further proposals it considers necessary. More generally, there is a committee currently sitting under the chairmanship of former Supreme Court Judge, Anthony Hederman, which is reviewing the Offences against the State Acts, including the 1998 Act, and the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, expects to have its report before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The motion also calls on the Government to outline the discussions that have taken place between the British and Irish Governments on this matter. The Governments are united in their determination to confront terrorism of the kind that led to the atrocity at Omagh. There is the closest possible co-operation between the two Governments in this regard and, of course, between the Garda Síochána and the RUC. Only last week the Taoiseach met with Prime Minister Blair to discuss the situation in Northern Ireland, including security matters. Later this week, the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, will meet the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The motion also calls on all Members of this House to support the call made jointly by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister for anyone who may have fresh evidence on the Omagh bombing to come forward. I am glad to add my voice and that of the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, to that particular call. There is not just a legal but a moral obligation on any such person in this jurisdiction to contact the Garda Síochána. <Col N="303" /> Every effort has been and will continue to be made by the Garda Síochána to bring to justice those responsible for Omagh, but for that to happen evidence of guilt must be found. Even the provisions of the 1998 Act, strong as they are, do not and could not obviate the need for actual evidence. It would be unforgivable if such evidence were known by persons, other than those responsible for the bomb, but not made available to the authorities.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal that has been done and can yet be done. The Government will continue to work with this House to develop whatever further measures may yet be necessary to protect our democratic values. We will continue to work with the British Government in co-operation against the threat we both face. The Garda Síochána will continue to make every effort to deter and detect terrorist offences. They will never give up on the hunt for the Omagh bombers, and I know they have the support of all sides of the House in their endeavours.</P>
    <P>It is right that this House should address the issues raised by the atrocity at Omagh. It is important that the debate should be characterised by the seriousness it deserves and, as I am sure it will be, by a sense of responsibility. All sides of the House will agree that this, of all subjects, cannot be allowed to become politicised in a way which would engender public dismay and cynicism in equal measure, and cause further hurt to those bereaved by Omagh. In this context, I would particularly like to re-emphasise the importance of not giving currency to utterly unfounded allegations concerning political interference with the investigation into Omagh; allegations that, in effect, there has been a massive and wholly incredible conspiracy on the part of the Government and the Garda Síochána to pervert the course of justice. I cannot imagine what agenda might be served by those who promulgate such allegations.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that Deputies should remain silent in the face of these preposterous allegations, but simply that this debate as a whole should reflect what I am sure the House will agree upon &ndash; that it is unimaginable that any Irish Government would do what has been alleged.</P>
    <P>This House shows a face united in defence of democracy and against the violent threat to our democratic values. We say to those responsible for the Omagh bomb and to those who even now may be contemplating further atrocities, &ldquo;You may be beyond reason, but you are not beyond the law&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>If the Minister of State does not intend using the other ten minutes available to her to amplify any of the points made by the Fine Gael speakers, I will commence my own remarks if I may. The Omagh bombing, the worst single incident in more than 30 years of violence on this island, was a particular shock given that it came <Col N="304" /> within a few months of the signing of Good Friday Agreement and its subsequent endorsement in referenda by the overwhelming majority of people, North and South. It is hard to think of a more callous act than to drive a car bomb into the centre of a busy town, on a Saturday afternoon, crowded with innocent people going about their lawful business &ndash; shopping, meeting friends and sightseeing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not expect to have the full amount of my time tonight. I had planned to share it with Deputy McManus but I think she has left the House. We will have to see how we go, a Cheann Comhairle. With your indulgence, Sir, I expected the Minister of State to take her full time allocation.</P>
      <P>As with so many other such incidents in Northern Ireland, Britain and here in the Republic, the Omagh bomb did not differentiate between Catholic or Protestant, Nationalist or Unionist, adult or child, resident or visitor, as it cut a swathe of destruction through the busy main street of that town. The Omagh bombing was an act of indescribable evil. It was recognised at the time as not just designed to bring death, injury and destruction to the people of Omagh, but also an attempt to destroy the entire peace process in Northern Ireland. The initial shock at the horrific carnage speedily gave way to a sense of determination &ndash; expressed by all sides in this House when the Dáil was recalled in special session on 2 September 1998 &ndash; that those responsible for this unspeakable outrage would not be allowed to usurp the clearly expressed wish of the people for peace and for new political structures on this island that would make political violence, permanently, a thing of the past.</P>
      <P>We all share some of the responsibility for allowing Omagh to slip down the political and policing agenda. Time passes and other issues arise, but for those directly involved, that awful event is indelibly and permanently carved into their lives. The relatives of the dead and those maimed in the bombing can never forget the awful damage done. Many of them have had to relive the awful trauma of August 1998 during the recent inquest on the victims. The recent BBC &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; programme focused attention on the failure of the authorities on both sides of the Border to deliver on the promises made in August 1998 that those responsible would be brought to justice. For those who lost loved ones or who were maimed, there can be no closure, finality or end until those responsible have been brought and called to account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the pledges of resolute action from the RUC, the Garda and the Irish and British Governments have come to nothing. The initial determination that those responsible would <Col N="305" /> be caught and brought to justice seems to have been replaced by a resigned shrug of the shoulders that, despite our best efforts, it is now unlikely that those directly responsible will ever be charged. This view was publicly articulated by the Garda Commissioner, Pat Byrne, in an interview with the <i>Irish News</i> in March of this year when he said that the Garda had the intelligence to identify those involved but lacked sufficient evidence to bring charges. He said that the masterminds of the attack &ldquo;possibly and maybe probably&rdquo; would evade justice. Many people felt their hearts sink on hearing those words. The Garda Commissioner is a determined and able man who leads a determined and able force, but it is a dreadful admission for all of us committed to justice and law that those responsible for this most heinous of crimes possibly, and maybe probably, would evade justice.</P>
    <P>Comparisons have been made with the investigation into the Veronica Guerin murder. In the aftermath of that outrage, a very substantial Garda team was put in place, huge resources were made available, extensive use was made of the witness protection programme and there was a visible determination &ndash; a zeal &ndash; to bring those responsible to justice. It showed results, with some of those principally involved now serving long sentences and other individuals facing charges which have yet to be heard and determined by the courts. Despite the scale of the death and destruction in Omagh, the same level of resources and commitment does not seem to have been applied to this investigation.</P>
    <P>Apart from the handful of those who were directly involved in the manufacture, transport and detonation of this bomb, there must be a significant number of people who are aware of those who were involved or who have information which could lead to the arrest and conviction of those involved. It is to our collective shame as a society that so little information has apparently been forthcoming and that people apparently have not been prepared to identify and testify against those involved. I have no lack of knowledge of the pressure that must be on those people and of the fear that is engendered by this gang of thugs and murderers.</P>
    <P>The need to see justice done for the victims of Omagh should be superior to the needs of any political cause, party, policy or objective. I would have thought that, given that the Omagh bomb was a clear, overt and direct attempt to destroy the Good Friday Agreement and to defy the will of the Irish people as expressed only ten weeks earlier in the referendum, there would not have been equivocation on the part of anyone who was a party to the Good Friday Agreement about the need to co-operate fully, completely and wholly with the authorities, North and South, in their efforts to bring the perpetrators of this crime to justice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="306" /> Unfortunately this has not been the case. Given the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland, no one will have been surprised by the refusal of the republican movement to co-operate with the RUC, although I and many in this House believe they should. What really shocked people was the refusal of the republican movement to urge anyone who had information about the Omagh bombing to provide it to the Garda Síochána. People will long remember the sickening letter from Gerry Adams to the parents of the 12 year old victim, James Barker, defending his decision to refuse to encourage those with information about the Omagh massacre to provide it to the Garda. This cruel snub to the Barkers and the Garda is hardly consistent with a claim recently made by Deputy Ó Caoláin that Sinn Féin recognises and accepts the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The republican movement is rooted in those communities from which the bombers came. It is very likely that members of the republican movement have knowledge that could lead to the conviction of those responsible. The failure to encourage people to co-operate with the Garda in the hunt for the Omagh mass murderers casts a serious question over the attitude of Sinn Féin not only to policing in Northern Ireland but also to policing in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The immediate response of the Government to the Omagh bombing was to seek considerable additional powers for the Garda Síochána in the form of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998, details of which were again put on the record by the Minister of State this evening. The Labour Party recognised the need for a strong and unequivocal response from the Oireachtas to the Omagh outrage and to demonstrate clearly that those responsible would not be allowed to get away with mass murder. We also agreed to support the legislation because we were led to believe that the law then in operation would not be adequate to bring those responsible to justice and that the further powers clearly expressed in the legislation were required.</P>
    <P>Newspaper reports at the time quoted a senior Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform official as saying:</P>
    <P>. . . the intelligence and evidence against these people is already there . . . but there is no way convictions would have been secured under existing legislation . . . there is enough evidence against those responsible for this heinous crime to make strong cases against them under the new legislation.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas made a unanimous decision to deliver those powers to the Garda Síochána but, to date, the force has failed to deliver the prosecutions and convictions the Minister led us to believe would follow the enactment of the legislation to which I refer. As far as I am aware &ndash; a question on this matter was put to the Minister <Col N="307" /> of State earlier this evening &ndash; only one prosecution has been taken arising from the Omagh investigation. That prosecution is currently before the courts. Nobody has been charged with the mass murder which occurred in Omagh; nobody has been charged with direct involvement in the bombing. The longer the investigation goes on, the less likely it is that anyone will be charged.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that no convictions have been secured following the enactment of the legislation. However, what is even more surprising is that there has not been a single prosecution taken or conviction secured under this legislation which the Government informed us in September 1998 was so urgently and badly needed. Not a single prosecution has been made under any of the sections, although in June, on the day before the extension order came before the House, the Minister informed me in reply to a series of Dáil questions that a number of files had been referred to the law officers.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State indicated earlier, the only section of this Act that appears to have been used is the power to extend the existing period of detention of people in custody. In June of this year, the Minister, in a reply to a parliamentary question, informed me that no court proceedings utilising sections 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 12 of the Act have arisen. This is the legislation we were promised would be the weapon necessary to bring those who perpetrated this awful crime to book. Up to June, 29 people had their period of detention extended but not one of them was subsequently charged, much less convicted. I do not believe the situation has changed since the Minister put those details on the record of the House in June.</P>
    <P>The Act provided strong new powers in respect of the forfeiture of land or property on which certain offences have been committed. Again, that power has never been used. Why did the Minister enter the House two years ago determined to strike at those fellow travellers who are providing succour and secure depots for those involved in storing arms or explosives if that power was never to be utilised? The Act created new offences relating to the training of persons in the making or use of firearms or explosives. Again, however, nobody has been charged in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Act created a new offence relating to the withholding of information, but nobody has been charged. It also created a new offence relating to the direction of unlawful organisations but, more than two years later, this has never been used. One can read through each of the additional powers or new offences we created and the question which continually arises is why, if these powers were so urgently and desperately needed in September 1998, have they not been used in the intervening period?</P>
    <P>In my opinion the Garda should be given all <Col N="308" /> reasonable powers to deal with paramilitary organisations. However, I am concerned that the Oireachtas has been asked to give what the Taoiseach described as &ldquo;draconian powers&rdquo; and to create serious new offences which are simply to be placed on the Statute Book and not utilised, despite the fact that we are being exhorted to support them.</P>
    <P>Why have other measures which have been used with such success against the criminal gangs &ndash; I raised this matter by way of parliamentary question last week &ndash; not been used against the Real IRA and other paramilitary organisations? I refer here to measures such as the Proceeds of Crime Act and bodies such as the Criminal Assets Bureau. Every single paramilitary organisation on this island is involved, to some extent or another, in racketeering, gangsterism, armed robbery, smuggling, money laundering, property protection rackets and &ndash; in some cases known to the Garda &ndash; drug dealing. The nefarious criminal activities to which I refer are used to grease the financial wheels of these paramilitary organisations.</P>
    <P>The most effective way of destroying paramilitary organisations is by cutting off their money supply. We have been successful in this regard against the drug gangs that were decimating this city a few years ago. Unfortunately, newer gangs have replaced those to which I refer. However, we must not forget that the powers we put in place by enacting the proceeds of crime legislation were utilised effectively by the Criminal Assets Bureau to smash the original gangs. I have always found it inexplicable why those powers and the Criminal Assets Bureau have not been used in the same way against paramilitary organisations involved in racketeering and other criminal activities.</P>
    <P>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Mandelson, recently announced that special legislation was to be introduced in Northern Ireland to establish a body similar to the Criminal Assets Bureau to target specifically the finances of paramilitary organisations in that jurisdiction. We already have the legislation and the necessary bodies in place. What seems to be missing &ndash; perhaps the Minister of State or the Minister will have an opportunity to respond to this point &ndash; is the political will to use those powers against the paramilitary organisations.</P>
    <P>The various political parties, groupings and individuals involved in the ongoing peace process have always recognised that there would be a cohort of irredentist die-hards who could not grasp at a changed world in which a new order of peace held sway and who would have to be confronted. According to the most recent media publications, those people continue to recruit and they still pose a threat to this jurisdiction, to Northern Ireland and to the safety of the citizens of both. Most of all, they are determined to smash <Col N="309" /> the Good Friday Agreement which was so clearly and overwhelmingly endorsed by the peoples of this island, North and South. These individuals must be confronted and the State must use whatever forces are available to it in that regard. It is for that reason I ask why the mechanisms we used so effectively to smash the dangerous gangs involved in drug dealing in this city and throughout the country were not used in the same way against paramilitary organisations.</P>
    <P>This debate takes place against the background of a delicate and difficult political situation in Northern Ireland. The question of policing remains an extremely divisive issue, with politicians on both sides taking entrenched positions. We all know David Trimble faces yet another challenge to his leadership and confidence among unionists in the Good Friday Agreement appears to be ebbing away. The recent feud between sections of the UDA and the UVF in west Belfast which resulted in three deaths, many injuries and hundreds of people being driven out of their homes shows that these organisations retain the capacity and the will to cause death and destruction.</P>
    <P>Questions remain about the bona fides of the IRA. There is, at least, strong circumstantial evidence of the IRA's involvement in the murder of Mr. Joe O'Connor in Belfast on Friday last. A number of other murders have been attributed to the IRA in which that organisation has not denied its involvement. A number of people were convicted in Florida this summer on charges of attempting to acquire arms for export to this country. One of those convicted is reported to have described himself to the United States authorities as an international representative of Sinn Féin. If the republican movement has genuinely put violence behind it and is now committed to exclusively peaceful and democratic means why are people allegedly representing it involved in the acquisition of arms in the United States? </P>
    <P>Against this background there is a need for additional confidence building measures on all sides and particularly on the part of the republican movement. There has been some speculation in recent days that another inspection of arms dumps is imminent. I hope this is the case. It would be timely, helpful and useful to the maintenance of peace. Another confidence measure would be for the IRA to lift the exclusion orders it has served on hundreds of people in Northern Ireland over the past decade. Often these people following a knock on their door are told to be out of Northern Ireland within 24 hours. People in Northern Ireland know the consequences of disobeying an order of that nature. Revoking those apartheid-like exclusion orders would be a particularly appropriate gesture in the aftermath of the recent decision of the British Government not to pursue extradition warrants against 21 republicans whose arrest it had been seeking.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="310" /> No one knows how many have been exiled from Northern Ireland in the course of the conflict by threats of death or injury at the hands of various paramilitaries. It is clear that despite the ceasefires the practice is still going on. Despite signing up to the Mitchell principles and the requirement of a peaceful environment, those activities continue. Figures quoted recently by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Mandelson, suggest that 335 people had been exiled in 1998 and a further 256 in 1999 by order of paramilitary kangaroo courts. Some of these people subsequently returned but others are still in exile, in fear of their lives and cut off from their families and communities. Often, very young people are dispatched from Northern Ireland at the decision of some dispenser of kangaroo justice. Both loyalists and republican paramilitaries have been involved in these despicable practices. Some people were driven out because they were involved in, so called, anti-social activities. Others were regarded as having in some way betrayed the paramilitary organisations of which they were members. Some simply wanted to end their paramilitary involvement.</P>
    <P>The paramilitary organisations have been among the principal beneficiaries of the Good Friday Agreement. Hundreds of prisoners, including those convicted of the most appalling crimes, have secured early release and have been allowed to return to their families. Substantial public moneys have been spent on schemes designed to assist the re-integration of former prisoners into their communities. It would be bizarre if those jailed for serious offences were allowed to return home free and helped to re-establish themselves in their communities while those who have not been convicted of any offence were forced to remain in continued exile.</P>
    <P>Despite the continuing difficulties and the problems which remain to be resolved we must not lose sight of what we have achieved in recent years. The Good Friday Agreement was negotiated in difficult circumstances. Despite the pessimistic view that we would never broker an agreement that would win the support of both the Ulster Unionist Party, Sinn Féin and the SDLP, that was done. We are familiar with this huge advance. Nevertheless, this is a critical time. We all have our parts to play and I urge all not to ignore what has been achieved in recent years and to bear in mind the potentially disastrous consequences for this island and all who live in it and for our neighbouring island if the carefully balanced edifice created so painstakingly in the Good Friday discussions is allowed to collapse.</P>

    <P>This is still a very emotive topic for the people of my constituency and of the north-west. Deputy Howlin has reminded us of what has been <Col N="311" /> achieved.

Life cannot return to what it was like before 15 August 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this issue. There is a total of 6,000 apprentices studying in institutes of technology, many of whom have come through FÁS. Dundalk Institute of Technology is the one nearest where I live. It has become evident that there is a serious dispute between the Department of Education and Science and officials of institutes of technology about the status of the examination which takes place at the end of each year of the apprenticeship. This test is regarded by the Department as an assessment. On this basis, in its interpretation, those who correct the assessment should not be paid. On the other hand, the lecturers who correct what they regard as an examination paper believe they should be compensated and paid for their work in the same way as those who correct the leaving and junior certificate papers given that the same level of study and commitment is involved.</P>
      <P>The Department has allowed this problem to develop and fester over a period of four years. This is unacceptable. When the mother of one of the apprentices involved &ndash; she contacted me about the issue six to eight weeks ago &ndash; contacted the Department this morning to ascertain whether it would take action on the correcting of individual assessments or examination papers, she was informed by a departmental official that the Department stands by its principles; in other words, there will be no surrender. The Department is not prepared to deal with the issue and sort the matter out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister for Education and Science, the Ministers of State at that Department and officials realise the pressures the young people concerned are under to complete their apprenticeship, especially those who have had to repeat <Col N="312" /> a year, all of whom are awaiting results for the previous apprenticeship year. They are pawns between the Department and institutes of technology. This should not be the case.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by a person who used to correct the leaving and junior certificate papers that they were paid £1.10 per examination paper; this may have increased to £2 or £2.50 per paper. Taking into consideration the number of papers involved and the fact that the Department of Finance will take back 42% by way of the taxation system, we are talking about a very small sum of money. It is unacceptable, therefore, that the Department is standing by its principles. As the lady whom I mentioned said to me this morning, is it any wonder that so many young people commit suicide given the stupidity of the Department in standing by its principles with the result that examination papers in Dundalk Institute of Technology are not being corrected because of a few measly pounds?</P>
    <P>Hundreds of young people are wanted in the construction industry. As up to eight months have passed, some of the apprentices concerned are now saying to their parents that they are thinking of emigrating and leaving all this behind. Does the Minister of State have any intention of solving this problem? I do not want her to read a script prepared by an official in which it is stated that the Department is standing by its principles. I want action on behalf of those who contacted me about this issue. The delay in dealing with it is unacceptable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Ms Hanafin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar son an Aire, Deputy Woods, tá áthas orm an cheist seo a fhreagairt, to respond to the issues raised by the Deputy and to clarify the Department's position on this matter. The Department is aware that results of phase 4 assessments have been withheld in some institutes of technology in a number of apprenticeship grades.</P>
      <P>The standards based apprenticeship system currently in place was introduced in 1993 following extensive consultations between the social partners and other interested parties. It replaced the old time served model and is based on the attainment by apprentices of industry agreed standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operational arrangements relating to the assessment and certification of apprentices studying under this standards based system were agreed by an interdepartmental committee representative of the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Dublin Institute of Technology, the then regional technical colleges and FÁS. These operational arrangements were set out in a letter from the Department to the various institutes of technology in December 1995. The arrangements clearly stated that assessment for <Col N="313" /> phase 4 would consist of two occasions of testing and that a terminal examination would only apply at the end of phase 6 of the apprenticeship system. The latter would be the only situation in which payment for an examination as part of the apprenticeship system would be made.</P>
    <P>In August 1999 it was brought to the attention of the Department that certain institutes of technology were conducting both occasions of phase 4 testing at the end of phase 4 and as such some institutes are of the view that this constitutes a terminal examination. The Department subsequently issued circular letter IT 9/99 on the assessment regulations governing phase 4 procedures reiterating the position as set out in 1995. All directors of institutes of technology and the president of the Dublin Institute of Technology were directed to ensure the sanctioned arrangements were complied with. Notwithstanding this direction, the Department has been advised that in latter months certain phase 4 assessment results have been withheld by staff in the institutes who are TUI members seeking examination payments in respect of this testing. Every effort is being made by the Department to resolve this dispute.</P>

    <P>On 29 January 1997 the principal of St. Lazerians special school in Carlow town, which is situated in the South Eastern Health Board area, wrote to the acting director of community care, Eastern Health Board, Wicklow town, stating that in her school a speech and language therapy service was being provided for pupils who resided <Col N="314" /> in the South Eastern Health Board area. She indicated that the service did not extend to pupils who resided in other health board areas and that the need for therapy for these pupils was urgent. On 18 February 1997 the principal received a response which stated that in the Eastern Health Board area children who attended special schools were seen by the therapists in those schools regardless of their home address, that the children would be placed on the Wicklow waiting list and would, in due course, be offered appointments at the nearest speech and language therapy clinic. Unfortunately, in the case to which I am referring, this would involve taking a day off school and a one and a half hour return journey.</P>
    <P>In addition, the acting director of community care in Wicklow said she would write to the director of community care in Carlow to see if a more satisfactory solution could be arranged. In May 1999 I received correspondence from the East Coast Area Health Board stating that only one in five of the children concerned took up the offer of the service in Wicklow. It was also pointed out that it would not be a productive use of time to travel from Wicklow to Carlow and back when a speech and language therapy service is already available in the school. No one could disagree with this point.</P>
    <P>The east coast area health board tried unsuccessfully to negotiate a deal with the South Eastern Health Board whereby it would deal with children from the South Eastern Health Board area who are geographically suited to the east coast area health board region in exchange for its treating these five children.</P>
    <P>In June 1999 I tabled a written question on this matter to the Minister for Health and Children and was told that the South Eastern Health Board was willing to enter negotiations with the east coast area health board concerning the future development of speech and language therapy services for the children in question. Almost four years later the girl, who is now eight years of age, has received no therapy. This is an unreal situation which beggars belief. I am sure the Minister of State will agree this is unacceptable and I am asking her to right this wrong. One of the reasons given for breaking up the former Eastern Health Board was to bring health services to the people. There was a language and speech therapy service in Baltinglass hospital for children in the greater west Wicklow area but this has been moved to Naas since the re-establishment of the board. I ask the Minister of State to consider reinstating this service in west Wicklow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for sharing time. The problem referred to by the Deputy frequently occurs in areas on the border between two health board regions. However, there is a further dimension to this problem which is repeated in many parts of the country. Parents of children in need of these services who live near Kildare town and Newbridge in my constituency, and in Clane and Celbridge in the adjoining con<Col N="315" /> stituency of Kildare North, have to bring their children to Tallaght for speech and language therapy. These people spend the greater part of a day getting their children to this service.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Department allocated money for a centre in Naas but has been unable to find a premises. I ask the Minister of State to ensure that, in conjunction with the demarcation problem which is quite common, these services are made available within a reasonable distance of the homes of children as otherwise the service is not available.</P>
      <P>It is utterly unreasonable to expect a parent to travel for one hour from her home, as is typically the case, to the place where the child receives the service, to wait for two hours, drive home again and, on arriving home, have to go out again to collect other children from school. There is a demand in County Kildare and areas bordering two health board areas which needs to be met rationally. Demarcation disputes between health boards should not be allowed to obstruct the provision of these services.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies Timmins and Dukes for raising this matter. As the Deputies are aware and have highlighted, the provision of speech and language therapy services in the Wicklow and Carlow regions is the responsibility of the east coast area health board and the South Eastern Health Board in the first instance. With regard to the matter raised by Deputy Timmins, a replacement speech and language therapist has recently been appointed and will be deployed to provide services to the school which the individual in question attends.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will be aware that all health boards are facing considerable difficulties in recruiting and retaining the necessary multidisciplinary staff, including speech and language therapists, required to provide health related support services to school-going children with special needs. There are currently two vacant speech and language therapist posts in the Carlow-Kilkenny area. Because of the difficulties in recruitment and retention to which I referred, it has been necessary to limit the services provided to all children attending the school in question.</P>
      <P>The South Eastern Health Board is endeavouring to increase the level of services generally and, in particular, to the school in question. I understand that the east coast area health board made a number of proposals, including the provision of an after-school service, but that the parents of the individual in question do not feel this is an appropriate response in this case. I would like to make it clear to Deputy Timmins that it is the difficulty in recruiting suitably qualified therapy staff in both health board areas which has led to the limitations in service, rather than any question as to which health board is responsible for providing services to the school in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The South Eastern Health Board and the east coast area health board are fully conscious of the <Col N="316" /> concerns of the parents of the school children. I assure the Deputies that both health boards will continue to explore all possible means to increase the provision of services to the school in question and the Minister has asked them to keep him informed of progress in this matter.</P>
    <P>As regards the broader issue of recruitment and retention of staff, I assure the Deputies that my Department is pursuing a number of initiatives to address the difficulties faced by the health services. Earlier this year, the Minister received the final report of the expert group on health professionals. Part of this group's remit was to deal with recruitment and retention issues. It is hoped that its recommendations in these areas will help alleviate some of the current difficulties.</P>
    <P>The report recommends that action be taken in relation to manpower planning. A manpower planning study for the therapy professions has been undertaken and is being progressed as a matter of urgency. Following discussions with the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority, significant progress has been made recently in relation to increasing the numbers of training places for allied health professionals. An additional 52 places for physiotherapy, three for speech and language therapy, five for occupational therapy and 20 for psychology came on stream this month.</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority is also establishing a group comprising representatives from each of the three physiotherapy schools to investigate the establishment of a fast-track physiotherapy programme to begin in each school from October 2001. A similar exercise can be undertaken for speech and language and occupational therapy. At least a further 19 psychology places will be available from October 2001 and a service review of psychology services is currently under way in the health boards.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children has been liaising with other Departments, health boards and the Federation of Voluntary Bodies Providing Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap, to ensure that every opportunity is taken to highlight the career opportunities available in this sector and to maximise the results achieved by the various recruitment processes which are undertaken by the services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue I wish to raise is a damning indictment of the Government's shameful record on the provision of vital health care. Due to a lack of radiotherapy facilities in Waterford Regional Hospital some breast cancer patients are opting for mastectomies because they cannot get access to such treatment in Waterford. If the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, does not believe me or accept my word, I urge him to read an article by Padraig Ó Moráin in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 3 October in which he spoke to Dr. Seamus O'Reilly, a cancer specialist working in Waterford Regional Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="317" /> According to Dr. O'Reilly, due to an absence of radiotherapy treatment in the hospital some women are resorting to mastectomies. I would like to read Dr. O'Reilly's remarks into the record.</P>
    <P>In the case of a woman newly diagnosed with breast cancer, it mightn't be easy for her to travel and to be out of the home for five weeks. Someone has to look after the children and there may not be a father at home to do it. This may influence her decision to have a mastectomy or breast conservation.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that women in the south-east are forced to make such an agonising and painful choice. Over 400,000 people live in the south-east region and this level of population is more than enough to justify the provision of a radiotherapy centre in Waterford Regional Hospital. Given the amount of money the Minister has at his disposal, I call on him to make funding available to provide full and comprehensive radiotherapy services in Waterford Regional Hospital so that women in the region will not be forced into making a terrible choice of whether to opt for radiotherapy outside Waterford or have an operation.</P>
    <P>For any woman, to opt to have a mastectomy is traumatic enough in its own right, however it is unacceptable that women from the south-east region or any part of the country should have to opt for such a distressing and difficult operation. Women from the south-east region have a right to get cancer treatment at the main hospital in the region. They should not be in an intolerable situation where they are forced to make a terrible choice, either to have an operation or travel long distances for radiotherapy. It is all the more disconcerting against the background of the launching of the national breast screening programme last week that where diagnosis is positive, women in the south-east region can have no confidence that radiotherapy will be available to them.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to respond to what I have outlined and to listen to the comments made by Dr. Séamus O'Reilly. If the Government does not make funding available to provide full cancer treatment services at Waterford, it will be an indictment of the Government's poor record in reforming the health service. I urge the Minister for Health and Children to address this problem immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin:</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my colleague the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, I thank Deputy O'Shea for raising this important matter in the House, and for giving me an opportunity to outline the major investment the Government is making in the development of radiotherapy services in the context of an agreed strategy based on a firm assessment of need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against the background of some of the recent critical commentary, it is important to reassure patients, potential patients and their families of the capacity of radiotherapy services here to respond to their needs, and of the Government's <Col N="318" /> continuing efforts to ensure the development of services keeps pace with demand.</P>
    <P>There are some important points regarding cancer treatment services. The National Cancer Strategy which was published in November 1996 and followed in March 1997 by a three year action plan for its implementation, identified two principle objectives: to take all measures possible to reduce rates of illness and death from cancer, in line with the targets established in the Health Strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future; and to ensure that those who develop cancer receive the most effective care and treatment and that their quality of life is enhanced to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>Underlying these objectives is the need for quality, patient-focused service. One of the specific objectives of the strategy is to ensure that all patients have access to an equitable, effective service with a uniformly high quality of care, wherever they live.</P>
    <P>Since the commencement of the implementation of the strategy in 1997, some £40 million of dedicated funding has been allocated to the development of cancer services nationally. This investment has resulted in additional consultant appointments in the areas of medical oncology, haematology, histopathology and palliative care.</P>
    <P>Radiotherapy is a highly specialised and capital intensive service, requiring specialist personnel, including, for example, therapeutic radiographers, nurses with training in oncology, and technical and engineering support staff. A minimum throughput of patients is required to maintain and develop the specialist skills required for the service. Because of these considerations and the complexity of radiotherapy services, the National Cancer Strategy recommended that radiotherapy services should be provided from two supra regional centres. The two centres currently providing radiotherapy services to cancer patients are St. Luke's Hospital, Dublin and Cork University Hospital.</P>
    <P>The strategy recommended that the case for providing a radiotherapy service from a third supra-regional centre at Galway should be kept under review, and I am pleased to report that the Government acted quickly in assessing that case and took the decision to provide a service at Galway at an estimated cost of some £10 million. The radiotherapy service there will be provided as part of the overall phase two development at the hospital. Construction of the overall phase two development commenced in June 2000.</P>
    <P>In addition to this major investment in new radiotherapy facilities, the existing services available have also benefited from a major injection of resources. An important investment in radiotherapy and other cancer services in Cork University Hospital is being made with the allocation of £12.5 million for this purpose. The development will include a chemotherapy day unit, two state of the art linear accelerators and advanced CT simulation facilities. Together with approval for the appointment of two consultant medical <Col N="319" /> oncologists, the improvements will ensure that the service for cancer patients in this area is in line with the best available internationally.</P>
    <P>The State's largest radiotherapy centre at St. Luke's and St. Anne's Hospital opened in June 1998, after a major redevelopment funded by a capital investment of more than £20 million. Last year, two additional consultant radiotherapists were appointed to the hospital as part of the ongoing process of developing services there.</P>
    <P>The Minister is well aware of the need for further investment in cancer services and will continue to identify this as a priority for his tenure of office. The National Cancer Strategy has to date achieved a widespread enhancement of the range and quality of cancer services available and a major improvement in equity of access to these services. However, we must continue to look ahead and to examine ways of building on the success to date by continual improvement and investment. In this regard, on foot of a proposal from the National Cancer Forum, an expert review group to examine the appropriate further development of radiotherapy services has been established.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the developments in cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment in recent years, the provisions of the National Cancer Strategy regarding radiotherapy services and best practice in this area, the expert group has been asked: to undertake an assessment of need in radiotherapy services, including recommended norms regarding service provision, planning and staffing for facilities; and on the basis of needs identified, to make recommendations on the future development of radiotherapy services, including links with radiotherapy services in Northern Ireland. It is in this context that the assessment of need for radiotherapy services at Waterford Regional Hospital will be carried out.</P>
    <P>I cannot over emphasise the Government's commitment to a further development of cancer services. Cancer is a scourge on this society, as it is in societies the world over. While it must be recognised that significant progress has been made in the development of our infrastructure and services for the treatment and prevention of this disease, the Minister is equally aware of the need for the continued concerted effort in this area. It is the Minister's intention to work with the National Cancer Forum to ensure that those people requiring cancer treatment services will have available to them a high quality, equitable service that matches the best available anywhere in the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>That Monaghan General Hospital theatre was not maintained or replaced, leading to its closure last week for all intents and purposes, is nothing short of a disgrace and a clear indication that its needs have been ignored for years. While I appreciate that all four county <Col N="320" /> council elected board members and the other Monaghan board member are working together to make sure patients and families in Monaghan General Hospital are provided with an adequate service in the long-term, that the consultants at the hospital decided to refer all but emergency operative procedures to other hospitals will cause serious inconvenience to patients and families, especially in the north Monaghan area. The maternity department, I understand, is also turning away patients and informing them that the department cannot take such cases for four to five months. As the Minister will be aware, these are people who cannot wait.</P>
      <P>Many people fear this is an effort to further curtail services at Monaghan General Hospital in the hope that once patients get used to going elsewhere, it will remove the local pressure from the development committee and others. I beg the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to intervene and make sure that promises made by all of the recent Ministers for Health that Monaghan General Hospital would be upgraded with two theatres and back-up services, will be fulfilled. I understand money has been committed to the North Eastern Health Board over the next five years to upgrade all its services. However, I beg the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, to make sure that Monaghan General Hospital is looked after as the number one priority in the region. It is and has been the most neglected hospital, a fact underlined by the recent report by English consultants appointed by the health board to inspect hospital facilities in the north-east region. The report adjudged the theatre in Monaghan General Hospital a potential health risk. Our consultants were warned that only bona fide emergency surgery should be conducted in a Monaghan operating theatre. I believe from advice I have received that this situation should have been foreseen without any outside inspections and should have been acted on long ago.</P>
      <P>The patient waiting list in the North Eastern Health Board was one of the longest in the country before the closure of Monaghan. I know the Leas-Cheann Comhairle said some time ago that the waiting list in Monaghan was gone but, of course, we all know now that staff were withdrawing patients from it. Will Monaghan General Hospital be put on a never ending waiting list or will the Minister make sure it is a number one priority? I ask the Minister to make a clear statement on when we will get our full services back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The former Minister, Deputy Cowen, could only provide £0.5 million to Monaghan, but £52 million to his own constituency. The food industry makes sure that factories and processing plants meet all health and EU rules. Why do health board executives not do the same for hospitals? Can the Minister imagine an emergency at Moybridge or Carrickroe along the Border where people would have to travel 45 to 50 miles in the middle of the night on secondary <Col N="321" /> roads? The High Court accepted that only because Monaghan General Hospital was there, patients in the past might have lost their lives. We have first class consultants, nursing and other staff who are prepared to give a good service if given the necessary tools of their trade, that is, theatres, intensive care units, etc.</P>
    <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I have tried to work together with other elected colleagues and to arrange joint meetings with health board officials. We were never advised that we had reached this serious situation. I ask the Minister of State to make sure the Minister, Deputy Martin, provides the funds and makes sure they are used not only in the North Eastern Health Board area but to restore Monaghan General Hospital to its rightful place immediately. There must be a clear statement from the Minister. The health board must make all nursing and other staff permanent, if possible, to make sure there is a degree of understanding and certainty that there is a will within the Department and the health board at executive level that Monaghan General Hospital will not only be maintained but upgraded so this pocket, this difficult Border region, is given the service it deserves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Crawford for raising this issue to which I will respond on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin. I would like to clarify the position in relation to the provision of services at Monaghan hospital. The North Eastern Health Board at its meeting in June 1998 approved the framework for the development of acute hospital services in the north eastern region and submitted a set of proposals for the development of all five acute hospital sites in its region, including Monaghan hospital, to the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure the highest possible quality of service for patients, the North Eastern Health Board is now providing acute hospital services on the basis of two integrated hospital groups &ndash; the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group and the Louth-Meath-Drogheda group. This approach, in addition to promoting quality health care on each site, underlines the fact that all five hospital sites in the region are secure. The establishment of an integrated Cavan-Monaghan hospital group has ensured that the population of the catchment area of both hospitals will have available to them a range of high quality, easily accessible medical and surgical services.</P>
      <P>The following developments are proposed by the North Eastern Health Board for the Monaghan site of the Cavan-Monaghan group: composite diagnostic and treatment unit for accident and emergency services, day services and improvements in out-patient and surgical services, improvement of existing hospital wards for high quality accommodation and immediate refurbishment of theatre and provision of an emergency recovery area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="322" /> The North Eastern Health Board policy on acute surgical services is clear and explicit and the plans included in the framework will significantly develop the range and complexity of services in the region and allow the board to develop self-sufficiency in regional services. A project team, appointed by the chief executive officer of the North Eastern Health Board, with representation from the Department of Health and Children, is currently preparing a brief for the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group which will form the basis for instructing an architect and design team to advance the planned developments. Under the national development plan, £80 million has been approved for the North Eastern Health Board's hospitals and ambulance service development during the period 2001-06.</P>
    <P>The general and specialist surgical services are an important component of the board's overall service. Joint departments of surgery have been developed at each of the hospital groups and the majority of surgeons have assignments across two hospital sites within the hospital groups. In this context, the North Eastern Health Board has an obligation to ensure that the health care services it provides meet acceptable standards of safety. A commitment was given in the 1999 service plan to introduce a clinical risk management programme for all services.</P>
    <P>Risk management consultants appointed by the board advised the chief executive officer in August 2000 that they had concerns regarding serious deficiencies in the physical infrastructure of the operating theatre at the Monaghan hospital site. This gave rise to concerns for patient safety.</P>
    <P>The present operating theatre was built as part of the hospital and dates from the early 1940s. While some upgrading of the ventilation, electrical and piped gas services has taken place, essentially it has had no additional development to reflect contemporary operating theatre requirements and standards.</P>
    <P>A properly constructed and equipped operating theatre is one of the essential components for safe surgical services. The proposed development of Monaghan hospital contained in the board's 1998 framework document includes the provision of two fully equipped operating theatres. However, the deficiencies in the present theatre are such that remedial action must be taken in the immediate future to ensure a safe environment for surgical procedures pending the provision of the new theatres.</P>
    <P>The North Eastern Health Board has informed me that the theatre users group at Monaghan hospital has made recommendations to health board management on the provision of a semi-permanent theatre facility and arrangements are currently in train to provide for this as an interim measure.</P>
    <P>The consultants on call at Monaghan hospital continue to see all emergencies and protocols and procedures have been put in place for the transfer of patients to other hospitals if required following triage at Monaghan hospital. The board has also <Col N="323" /> put in place transport arrangements to accommodate patients and their families affected by transfers to other hospitals. The North Eastern Health Board is fully committed to the future development of Monaghan hospital and the brief being <Col N="324" /> prepared by the project team will ensure that planned facilities at the hospital are in line with best modern standards in all respects.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 18 October 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish fishing industry is currently experiencing severe difficulties as a result of increased fuel prices. The fishing industry is exceptionally exposed to the dramatically increased fuel prices because of the relatively high proportion of fuel costs to overall costs. The exposure is compounded by the fact that the sector is a &ldquo;price taker&rdquo; with little or no scope for passing on costs.</P>
      <P>The fishing industry, in common with those in other member states, is rebated excise and VAT on marine diesel. As a result, fuel cost increases directly reflect movements in the supply price. In effect, fuel costs to the fishing industry have doubled since January 1999, with an increase of the order of 30% since January this year. The fuel cost increases are exacerbating emerging difficulties in relation to labour supply and retention of crews.</P>
      <P>I have discussed the situation in detail with industry representatives and with Government colleagues and I have a very clear understanding of the severity of the difficulties being experienced. My discussions with the industry are focusing on ways to alleviate the problem and the industry has put forward a number of proposals, including changes to taxation and PRSI regimes as well as support for training and fleet renewal and modernisation.</P>
      <P>I am assessing all options to assist the industry in this very difficult climate, including the industry's own proposals. Short and long-term strategies need to be developed to ensure the viability and competitiveness of the sector. The investment programmes being finalised under the national development plan will be strategically focused on the short and long-term needs of the sector. Discussions are under way with relevant Departments in the context of the budget, on the industry's proposals for changes to PRSI and taxation regimes. My Department is also analysing possible mechanisms within our direct remit which could alleviate the immediate crisis and promote sectoral adjustments which will ensure viability and competitiveness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>At its inaugural meeting on 12 April 2000, I invited the national salmon commission as its first priority task to consider and advise me on progressing the national salmon tagging scheme. On the recommendation of the commission I published my notice of intent to make the necessary regulations for the scheme. This triggered a 30 day statutory period for public consultation. At the end of this period the commission recommended that I should sign the regulations as discussed and finalised by the commission and that the effective date for the implementation of tagging should be 1 January 2001. The recommendation of the commission was fully informed by the public consultation process as well as advice to the commission from the central and regional fisheries boards and the Marine Institute.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to accept the advice of the commission and I signed the regulations on 11 August. In accordance with the statutory requirement, the regulations were laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 17 August. The regulations provide for the implementation of tagging from 1 January 2001. From that date all commercial and recreational salmon licence holders will be required to tag and record each salmon caught. Tags and logbooks will be available free of charge.</P>
      <P>During the course of the settling of the regulations by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel my Department was advised that it would be legally preferable to make provision in primary legislation for offences and penalties relating to the tagging scheme. This was confirmed by the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>On foot of this advice, amending primary legislation is needed before year end to provide for offences and penalties. The Government has already approved the drafting of this short Bill and the detailed drafting is being finalised. I will be seeking the approval of the Government of the text of the Bill very shortly with a view to its publication and introduction in the Oireachtas without delay. The tight timeframe is essential in order to ensure the successful introduction of the national salmon tagging scheme from 1 January next.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The area of new afforestation grant-aided by my Department in 1999 was 12,668 hectares. The figure for 1998 was 12,928 hectares. The percentages of broad leaf trees were 15.92% and 15.12%, respectively. However, these percentages only reflect the planted areas of commercial broad leaf trees and do not include broad leaf trees planted near rivers, roads and scenic areas, which amount to an additional 4% approximately of all grant-aided planting. In <Col N="328" /> addition, the per hectare stocking level of broad leaf trees is 250% that of conifers. When these factors are taken into account, the target of 20% broad leaf tree planting set out in the strategic plan for forestry is being met.</P>
      <P>The detailed information sought by the Deputy for the two years in question, that is, the breakdown per county of broad leaf tree and conifer planting, is contained in the tabular statement which will be circulated in the Official Report.</P>

      <P>I understand the national strategy review group on the Common Fisheries Policy will be in a position to submit its overall report to me by the end of this month.</P>
      <P>The review group has already produced a number of interim reports dealing with national investment priorities for the seafood sector, technical conservation measures, control and enforcement, regionalisation of the Common Fisheries Policy and fisheries management and the marine environment.</P>
      <P>These interim reports were the result of detailed and painstaking analysis by the review group. As I have previously indicated to the House, I believe that the group is doing excellent work. The analysis is most detailed and thorough and the group's highly proactive, open and consultative approach at national and EU level is particularly noteworthy.</P>
      <P>I look forward to the receipt of the group's overall report at the end of this month which will influence and assist the European Commission's current process of examination of how to move forward with the Common Fisheries Policy.</P>
      <P>The group's report will also make a significant input into my overall strategy of influencing the debate on the 2002 review at an early stage. That debate will intensify next year following the publication by the Commission of its own Green Paper early next year. I am satisfied that there will be an excellent understanding of Ireland's position in relation to the CFP and the work of the review group has, and will, considerably assist that task.</P>

      <P>The seafood industry, comprising fishing, aquaculture, processing and ancillary sectors currently employs close to 16,000 people directly between full-time and part-time jobs. The industry generates an estimated additional 9,000 jobs in downstream activities.</P>
      <P>The seafood industry offers valuable employment opportunities in the regions and coastal communities, and there is considerable potential for further expansion with consequent benefits in terms of improved regional distribution of economic activity and employment. The Government is committed to maximising that potential. Investment support of £171 million under the national development plan is being targeted to deliver a sustainable, safe, competitive and quality driven seafood industry. An immediate strategic objective is to ensure that the industry is well positioned to address the challenges posed by a highly competitive labour market and emerging labour shortages. The task force on training and employment in the seafood sector is finalising its recommendations on strategies to enhance the sector's ability to recruit new entrants and retain existing personnel. It is also considering initiatives to meet the existing employment demand through, for example, sourcing non-national labour which BIM, working with the industry is already actively addressing. I expect to take delivery of the task force report in December.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 and 117 together.</P>
      <P>A thorough examination of the final report of the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise into Accident DH 248/Rescue 111 Tramore, 2 July 2000 has taken place in my Department. The recommendations that relate specifically to the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources are as follows:</P>
      <P>4.14.The emergency services, including the fire service, including regional airport fire-crews, An Garda Síochána, IMES coastal teams, mountain rescue teams and RNLI lifeboat crews should be made fully aware of and trained to deal with the potential hazards to rescue personnel associated with sites of serious aircraft accidents. (SR 24 of 2000)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.15.A formal service level agreement should be put in place between the Air Corps <Col N="331" /> and the Irish Coast Guard defining the precise responsibilities and deliverables of both parties. (SR 25 of 2000)</P>
    <P>4.16.For future SAR bases at airports-aerodromes, a service level agreement between the operator and the airport authorities should be put in place before operations are commenced. This should clearly identify the level of support services to be provided. (SR 26 of 2000)</P>
    <P>4.21.The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources should review the aviation expertise and training requirements for personnel involved in the tasking of SAR air assets. (SR 31 of 2000)</P>
    <P>4.22.The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources should conduct an investigation into the maritime circumstances which gave rise to the mission and also to the prolonging of the mission. (SR 32 of 2000)</P>
    <P>4.25.The relevant operators should ensure that future new, or significantly changed, SAR operations are the subject of a work-up period prior to the commencement of full operations. (SR 35 of 2000)</P>
    <P>The following is the response of my Department to the recommendations which relate to it following the numbering set out in the report:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Recommendation 4.14. </i>My Department has in place training programmes for Coast Guard units in dealing with hazardous situations. This training is being upgraded in the case of serious aircraft accidents. Last weekend, the chief fire officer at Shannon Airport delivered a lecture on the subject of downed aircraft search and rescue techniques at the Coast Guard area officers' annual conference in Limerick.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Recommendation 4.15. </i>My Department accepts the need for formalising current relationships and such agreements will be put in place as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Recommendation 4.16. </i>My Department in its contract relationships with private operators ensures that appropriate agreements to the Department's satisfaction are in place between service providers and airport authorities. It should be noted that the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources is not a party to relationships between the Air Corps and airport authorities.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Recommendation 4.21. </i>My Department has an ongoing training and review programme in place which encompasses, <i>inter alia,</i> aviation requirements. However, a thorough review of aviation requirements will be instituted.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Recommendation 4.22. </i>The maritime circumstances that gave rise to the rescue mission are well known and documented. Unfortunately these types of circumstances are all too common despite continuing intensive media and publicity campaigns led by my Department assisted by the RNLI, Irish Water Safety, Civil Defence, CIL and sporting, fishing and various representative organisations. The chief marine surveyor has <Col N="332" /> advised that a formal investigation is not required as all the details are already available. The level of call-out to assist leisure craft in difficulty is more than 300 annually. A key aim of my Department is to bring about a fundamental change in safety culture.</P>
    <P>In June of this year, legislation governing the use of recreational craft was enacted as part of the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act, 2000. I signed the commencement order for section 44 in August and the regulations governing the use of powered recreational craft are currently being worked on. A draft of the proposed regulations should be forwarded to those involved in the consultation process shortly.</P>
    <P>The regulations will have both national and local application. At national level, there will be regulations on age restrictions, the carriage and use of safety equipment and the consumption of alcohol or drugs. I fully expect that this work will lead to better knowledge of, and respect for, the hazards of going to sea. The carriage of safety equipment, more information and, in general, a more professional approach to seagoing will work to reduce recourse to the rescue services.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Recommendation 4.25. </i>My Department has to be satisfied when taking on private contractors that they will be fully capable and proficient in providing the required service from date of contract. The relationship with the Air Corps is not a contractual one and proficiency of crews and assets is primarily a matter for the military authorities.</P>
    <P>My Department is working closely with the Department of Defence to ensure immediate and sustained action on the implementation of recommendations made in the report.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the difficulties of herring fishermen in upgrading their fishing boats, particularly due to the requirement for and problems in obtaining extra active tonnage; and the proposals he has to alleviate the situation.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU Multi-Annual Guidance Programme for Ireland covering the period to 2001 prescribes the maximum permissible capacity, in terms of tonnage and engine power, for the Irish fishing fleet. To ensure compliance with these limits, fishing vessel licensing policy requires a licence applicant to remove from the sea fishing boat register tonnage and engine power equal to that of the vessel to be licensed.</P>
      <P>If a licence applicant wishes his or her vessel to be permitted to fish for herring and mackerel the capacity removed from the sea fishing boat register must have an active history of fishing for these pelagic species. For these purposes, an active history is defined as a minimum of four months fishing for those species in each of the last four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="333" /> It has been represented to me that this criterion may be excessively onerous having regard to actual patterns of fishing activity, and that this is posing difficulties for fishermen who wish to acquire active pelagic capacity in fulfilment of licensing requirements. I have, therefore, asked my Department to review the scope for change to the existing requirements and the implications of any change, in consultation with fishermen's representative organisations.</P>

      <P>Enterprise Energy Ireland completed a fourth appraisal well in the Corrib gas field in September. The company and its partners are currently assessing the results from this well in conjunction with data from previous appraisal wells with a view to determining the extent and characteristics of the reservoir.</P>
      <P>All data and information relating to the field are submitted on an ongoing basis by the company to my Department. This data is analysed by my Department using in-house expertise in conjunction with consultants. The Deputy will appreciate that all material associated with this assessment is commercially sensitive and therefore must remain confidential. However, I should point out that Enterprise Energy Ireland is reported as saying that the Corrib field might have in place recoverable reserves of more than one trillion cubic feet of gas. This compares to over 1.5 trillion cubic feet of gas produced to date from the Kinsale and Ballycotton gas fields. However, as I have already stated, it is too early at this stage to give a precise figure for the size of the gas accumulation and the licensee will not be in a position to do so until it has fully evaluated the discovery. I expect Enterprise Energy Ireland and its partners to be in a position to decide on the commerciality of the Corrib field in the very near future.</P>
      <P>I am aware that BGE has reached an outline agreement with the Corrib partners on the financial terms for the spur pipeline to bring Corrib gas from Mayo to Galway. I am not aware of SIPTU's concerns, if any, in relation to this agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>In March 2000 my Department informed the Dublin Port Company that the environmental impact assessment submitted as part of its application for reclamation under the Foreshore Act, 1933 did not comply with statutory requirements. The company is currently preparing a new EIS for submission to my Department.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the port company has various development schemes in hand or at an advanced planning stage for improved ro-ro ramp provision. According to a recent update of the assessment of Irish seaport capacity study, given the rate of growth of HGV traffic this seems appropriate. The report states that &ldquo;the increased size and number of ramps will provide better accommodation for lines operating to the port and their larger ships which will be put on to the services. They will not, however, add capacity to the port. Additional space adjacent to the ramps is needed to allow the terminal operating companies to marshal and hold efficiently, on a temporary storage basis, the ever increasing HGV traffic&rdquo;. The report adds however that &ldquo;such land is generally not available. The port company retains as much control over space as possible and transfers plots of land between terminals to meet space demands as best it can.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Bulk and break bulk cargoes are handled by private companies at dedicated berths and terminals, which the study finds adequate for current traffic levels, and by three stevedores at Alexandra Quay West, East, and Ocean Pier.</P>
      <P>Dublin Port Company has advised that the port's current landbank is totally utilised. The landbank is used for port purposes and of this land 80 acres are leased to the oil companies, 30 acres will be taken by the port tunnel for the next four years, 20 acres will permanently be utilised for port tunnel purposes and on the southside 18 acres of land are currently being used by Dublin Corporation to prepare its sewerage scheme for Dublin Bay.</P>
      <P>The study confirms that Dublin Port is achieving a high utilisation of existing facilities. It notes the flow of increasing cargo volumes, particularly ro-ro vehicles and the lack of spare land areas within the port. Neither problem can be resolved by the Dublin Port Company in isolation.</P>
      <P>An expert EU co-financed assessment of port access requirements nationally, which I hope to publish shortly, concludes that &ldquo;Dublin will increasingly face capacity constraints over the next ten years. Over the period to 2006, immediate capacity constraints will be felt in the unitised modes and ongoing expansion of facilities will be a priority. If land for expansion is unavailable, the port will have to concentrate its developments on increasing the utilisation of existing land and facilities and possibly forgoing existing lower value trades which are space intensive&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The annual yearbook published by the company details current use of the landbank under the jurisdiction of the company and I have <Col N="336" /> arranged for a copy to be made available to the Deputy.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116, 155 and 156 together.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned in my reply of 14 June last to similar questions from the Deputy, there are developments in relation to two hydrocarbon discoveries in our offshore, the Corrib gas accumulation and the Helvick oilfield.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Energy Ireland Limited completed a fourth appraisal well in the Corrib gas field in September. The company and its partners are currently assessing the results from this well in conjunction with data from previous appraisal wells with a view to determining the extent and characteristics of the reservoir.</P>
      <P>EEIL is of the view that the Corrib field might have in place recoverable reserves of more than one trillion cubic feet of gas. This compares to over 1.5 trillion cubic feet of gas produced to date from the Kinsale and Ballycotton gas fields. However, it is too early at this stage to give a precise figure for the size of the gas accumulation and the licensees will not be in a position to do so until they have fully evaluated the discovery. I expect Enterprise Energy Ireland and its partners to be in a position to decide on the commerciality of the Corrib field in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Helvick oilfield, Providence Resources completed an appraisal well last September. The company is still evaluating the data results from the well. All the data and information relating to the appraisal drilling have been submitted by the company to my Department. <Col N="337" /> The Deputy will appreciate that all material associated with the assessment of the field is commercially sensitive and therefore must remain confidential.</P>
    <P>The operator is currently analysing the data acquired in the course of the appraisal drilling. The results will be integrated with existing knowledge about the field in order to establish a soundly based estimate of the hydrocarbons in place and the potential recoverable resources.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above, next year will see a substantial increase in offshore drilling activity with the likelihood of between five to eight wells being drilled, including wells off the south west coast, in the Porcupine Basin, in the Slyne-Erris area and possibly in the Donegal and Rockall Basins.</P>
    <P>Regarding non-petroleum minerals, as I reported in the six-monthly report laid before the Houses for the period to 30 June last, there is a continuing and lively commercial interest in Ireland as an area for minerals exploration. I will continue to service and encourage this exploration effort through licensing rounds four times per year, and through active promotion, attendance at relevant trade shows and conferences and through dissemination of information by means of publications and direct contact with companies.</P>
    <P>The combined output from the zinc-lead mines at Tara, Galmoy and Lisheen brought Ireland to eighth largest in the world as a producer of zinc in concentrates for 1999. When Lisheen reaches full production we expect to be in sixth place. The opencast gypsum mine at Knocknacran, County Monaghan, continues to provide the raw material for plaster and board manufacture at nearby Kingscourt and to supply all cement manufacturers on the island.</P>
    <P>In spite of a worldwide downturn in investment in minerals exploration, Ireland has not only maintained the level of expenditure by explorationists but according to provisional estimates reached over £10 million in 1999.</P>
    <P>There has been no exploration or mining for non-petroleum minerals under the Minerals Development Acts in the Irish offshore in recent years nor has my Department any application at present for such activities.</P>

      <P>The Government, in May 2000, accepted in principle the findings of the emergency towing vessel study which included a recommendation for the deployment of an ETV to protect our coastal and marine resource and processes from the consequences of major oil pollution and vessel strandings.</P>
      <P>The Government also agreed that my Department, in consultation with the Departments of Finance, Defence and the Environment and Local Government would assess and identify the most cost-effective means of acquiring an ETV and propose the uses to which an ETV capacity might be applied and make proposals on matters including its positioning, specification, operations and financing of such capacity.

While search for bodies from the vessel was suspended on 5 October, the situation continues to be monitored by the Irish Coast Guard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One survivor was rescued from the British registered f.v. <i>Arosa </i>which sank on 3 October 2000 and while six bodies have so far been recovered, six crew members are still missing. My <Col N="340" /> Department has not yet been notified of the identity of the body recovered from the water off the west coast on Sunday last, 15 October 2000. An incident manager from Irish Coast Guard headquarters has been on scene in Rossaveal since the afternoon when the vessel sank, and the search is continuing with the Irish Coast Guard and Air Corps helicopters, Coast Guard coastal units and local people. The incident manager is co-ordinating the search in conjunction with the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre, MRCC, in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Under international maritime law, it is the responsibility of the flag state to carry out investigations into marine casualties involving their vessels.

The chief surveyor from the marine survey office of my Department advises me that his office has provided every assistance to the investigation and that all relevant data available have been given to the UK inspector. I am further advised that the French administration has also been in contact with the marine survey office concerning its inquiries into the loss of <i>An Orient </i>and it has likewise been furnished with all the data available in relation to that casualty. My Department will continue to offer every assistance to the UK and French authorities in their respective investigations into these tragic incidents and has asked to be kept informed of the outcome of their investigations in due course.</P>

      <P>I should clarify for the Deputy that the organism responsible for &ldquo;red tide&rdquo; does not produce toxins that can accumulate in shellfish or finfish tissue and does not, therefore, pose a threat to human health through the consumption of fish or shellfish.</P>
      <P>A range of other algal blooms are directly associated with the presence of biotoxins in shellfish. A comprehensive and rigorous programme of testing for biotoxins in shellfish is essential to protect public health and market and consumer confidence in Irish shellfish product.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the lively international interest in exploring for non-petroleum minerals in Ireland it is not necessary to provide incentives for this activity. Instead we ensure that our regime remains attractive and widely known on an internationally competitive basis. We market the prospectivity of Ireland through licensing rounds at three monthly intervals, provision of data from previous exploration, participation in relevant trade shows and conferences and direct contact with target companies not at present exploring in Ireland so as to stimulate their interest.</P>
      <P>This effort is enhanced and supported by a range of leaflets giving details on specific aspects of interest to potential explorationists and investors. These are updated regularly to take account of changing circumstances here and in the investment market. My Department is currently involved in an extensive study of comparative royalty and tax regimes in other mining jurisdictions, the results of which will allow me to fine tune our system so that it remains competitive. I expect to have these results early in the new year. My overall aim is to maximise the level of private investment in exploration, which is at its highest for many years, against a background of a significant global reduction in exploration expenditure.</P>
      <P>Commercial production of oil and gas can make a major contribution to Ireland's economic development. This has been demonstrated by the impact of natural gas from the Kinsale Head and Ballycotton fields. The Government is, therefore, committed to realising the full potential of oil and gas resources in offshore Ireland. However, since the Government does not consider that direct State involvement in this area of activity is appropriate, the pursuit of its policy objectives requires that competent private sector companies be encouraged to invest in the search for and production of oil and gas in Irish waters. The private sector is recognised as having the resources, expertise and practical experience essential for such a task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A primary incentive to investment in exploration and production offshore Ireland is the Government's fiscal treatment of such activity. A statutory regime of petroleum taxation together <Col N="342" /> with attractive licensing terms were introduced in 1992. Royalties and production-related levies no longer apply. The detailed provisions of the taxation legislation recognise the operational characteristics of the sector while the regime as a whole achieves a risk-reward balance which reflects Ireland's present prospectivity circumstances and conditions and acknowledges the realities of competition for internationally mobile exploration or production investment.</P>
    <P>There are no resources provided under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006 for either hydrocarbon or mineral exploration. All investment in these areas is funded by the private sector.</P>
    <P>The overall level of investment is market driven and dependent on a wide range of factors. There is no reliable basis on which to develop firm forecasts of investment for the medium term.</P>

      <P>Control of the Irish vessels authorised to take part in the drift-net tuna fishery is exercised through monitoring and surveillance undertaken on land by my Department's sea fisheries inspectorate and at sea by the Naval Service and Air Corps. Any fishing activity by tuna vessels of other member states in Irish waters is equally subject to surveillance by the Irish fishery protection services. The control programme for 2000 was determined in consultations between these services. The European Commission fisheries inspection services undertook several routine visits during the season as they have done in previous years. A review of the operation and control of the tuna fishery this year is under way and will inform planning for the 2001 season.</P>

An information technology training roadshow is currently under way, with the deployment of a mobile computer classroom around the country to provide late adopters with access to basic computer and Internet training. A further initiative to promote greater access to new technology among the general public is the commission's Internet venue directory. This is a register of public Internet access points which can be accessed via the commission's website or by phoning a lo-call number. Plans are also in preparation for a radio series &ndash; which will complement the excellent &ldquo;dot.what?&rdquo; series co-funded by the commission with RTE  &ndash;  on the importance of new and emerging technology in everyday life. In addition, the commission is working with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and IBEC to provide a series of e-business master classes for SMEs around the country. This will build on the highly successful countrywide e-commerce business awareness campaign organised by the commission in conjunction with IBEC.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of community employment is to reintegrate long-term unemployed persons into jobs in the open labour market. The review of CE by Deloitte &amp; Touche, consultants, undertaken in 1998, set a framework for a reform of the programme for the years ahead. It recommended that there should be a reduction in participation in the programme over time, as well as a range of other reforms aimed at securing better targeting and outcomes from the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the restructuring of CE approved by Government in 1999, the following revised eligibility criteria apply to persons who wish to participate in the options available under the programme: (a) part-time integration option is aimed at persons who are unemployed and in receipt of a payment in respect of unemployment assist<Col N="346" /> ance, unemployment benefit, qualified adults, one parent family payment or widow's-widower's pension for a minimum period of 12 months. Persons in receipt of a disability payment who obtain approval from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to engage in employment of a rehabilitative nature can also participate in the programme.</P>
    <P>The eligibility age for participation in this CE option was raised from 21 years to 25 years on 1 January 2000 with the following exceptions: travellers; ex-offenders; refugees; people with disabilities; people referred under drugs task force; offshore island inhabitants; 18-24 year olds, referred through EAP, who are 18 months or more unemployed.</P>
    <P>Participants remain on this programme for a period of one year. A limited number of people can remain for a second year in circumstances where it will facilitate their progression to employment. (b) part-time job option or rate for the job is targeted at persons who need a longer programme in order to become job ready. Participants must be 35 or over and three years unemployed and in receipt of the payments stated previously. Participants can remain on this option for a period up to three years.</P>
    <P>Other changes to the programme forming part of the restructuring process, which were introduced in April 2000, include: the duration of participant breaks between schemes increased from six to 12 months, andfuture participation in CE by an individual will be capped at three years. An individual's previous participation in the programme will not be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Offshore island residents are exempt from these changes.</P>
    <P>These changes were introduced to discourage repeated participation in CE and to give individuals the opportunity to undertake training programmes where possible, or to utilise the service of FÁS placement officers and-or the local employment service.</P>
    <P>It should be noted, however, that the three year cap will not affect an individual's participation in the programme until 2003 at the earliest and I intend to monitor the programme carefully in the interim.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>An ESRI impact study, May 1999, estimated <Col N="347" /> that 163,000 employees would benefit from the national minimum wage, particularly women and young workers. The ESRI study also concluded that the national minimum wage would directly increase the national wage bill by 1.6% and lead to an increase of 0.26% in inflation in the short term and 1.45% in the long term.</P>
    <P>Inflation in the 12 months to August 2000 was 6.2%, which has been attributable to a number of factors, including increased oil costs, higher European Central Bank interest rates, the decline in the value of the euro, and domestic causes such as higher excise duties on tobacco products and services sector inflation.</P>
    <P>Inflation in the services sector was 6.9% in the 12 months to August 2000 and has contributed 1.2% to overall inflation. This can also be attributed to a number of factors. In relation to labour costs, the tightening labour market is pushing up wages throughout the economy, including the services sector. The national minimum wage, as forecast by the ESRI, has also contributed to the increased costs of labour in the low paid sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>The statistics published by the Central Statistics Office on inflation do not show the impact of the introduction of the national minimum wage on the current rate of inflation and therefore it is not possible to precisely quantify the impact of the national minimum wage.</P>

      <P>In this context, I asked Forfás to bring forward proposals for the establishment of an appropriate science centre or centres which would contribute to the public understanding of science and engineering. Since then, a dedicated task force in Forfás under the aegis of the Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation &ndash; ICSTI &ndash; has addressed this issue and a report was recently submitted to me. This report strongly endorses the concept of science centres, which have proved both popular and successful in other countries, and makes detailed recommendations for developing a suitable Irish model.</P>

      <P>I draw the Deputy's attention to section 20 of the Foreshore Act, 1933, which requires me to lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas annually a statement detailing all leases and licences granted under the Act in the previous financial year. The statement for the financial year ending on 31 December 1999 was presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas on 16 February 2000 [PN 8230] and is available in the Oireachtas Library along with previous such statements.</P>
      <P>Such statements include the particulars, terms and date of each lease or licence granted. The name of the licensee or lessee and fees charged are also recorded.

      <P>It should be noted that all applicants for foreshore leases or licences are required to publish notice of their proposals in newspapers circulating in the area. The Department prepares the notice and specifies the newspapers in which it should be published. A three week period is allowed for representations and objections to be made to me. The applicant is allowed an opportunity to comment on these before the final report is made to me.

      <P>Exploration for non-petroleum minerals is permitted under prospecting licences which are issued under the Minerals Development Acts, 1940-99. Since the six monthly report for the period to 30 June 2000 was laid before the Houses, the number of current prospecting licences has further increased to 495 at 30 September. The continuing interest shown by prospectors in investing in Ireland is a measure of how well Ireland is seen internationally as a promising area for further discoveries of mineral bodies. Having identified a mineral body it is a commercial decision for the finder whether the extraction would be economic. A positive decision would result in three applications in parallel to the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources for a State mining facility; to the relevant local authority for planning permission; and to the EPA for an integrated pollution control licence. All three must be supported by an environmental impact assessment to ensure that the proposed development would be sustainable.</P>
      <P>Offshore petroleum exploration activity continues with 21 exploration licences in place covering 106 blocks or part blocks. In addition there are eight offshore licensing options and two leases in place. Applications for one further licensing option and two lease undertakings are at present under consideration in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Appraisal drilling took place this year on two hydrocarbon accumulations in our offshore, namely, the Corrib gas field and the Helvick oil- field. Enterprise Energy Ireland Limited, EEIL completed a fourth appraisal well in the Corrib <Col N="350" /> gas field in September. The company and its partners are currently assessing the results from this well in conjunction with data from previous appraisal wells with a view to determining the extent and characteristics of the reservoir.</P>
    <P>EEIL is of the view that the Corrib field might have in place recoverable reserves of more than one trillion cubic feet of gas. This compares to over 1.5 trillion cubic feet of gas produced to date from the Kinsale and Ballycotton gas fields. However, it is too early at this stage to give a precise figure for the size of the gas accumulation and the licensee will not be in a position to do so until it has fully evaluated the discovery. I expect Enterprise Energy Ireland and its partners to be in a position to decide on the commerciality of the Corrib field in the very near future.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Helvick oilfield, Providence Resources completed an appraisal well last September. The company is still evaluating the data results from the well. All the data and information relating to the appraisal drilling have been submitted by the company to my Department. The Deputy will appreciate that all material associated with the assessment of the field is commercially sensitive and therefore must remain confidential.</P>
    <P>The operator is currently analysing the data acquired in the course of the appraisal drilling. The results will be integrated with existing knowledge about the field in order to establish a soundly based estimate of the hydrocarbons in place and the potential recoverable resources. This is not expected to be completed for some time.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above, next year will see a substantial increase in offshore drilling activity with the likelihood of between five to eight wells being drilled, including wells off the south west coast, in the Porcupine Basin, in the Slyne-Erris area and possibly in the Donegal and Rockall Basins.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of my opening address to the National Ports Conference on 29 September last, I adverted to the need to reduce congestion at Dublin Port and the gridlock experienced by traffic movements to and from the port and its environs.</P>
      <P>This is nothing new. Earlier this year in April when I first met the Irish Ports Association, at which Dublin Port was represented, in April when I visited Dublin Port and as the Deputy has quoted when in Cork in September and on other occasions, I have pointed out that until the port tunnel is completed and open for business, Dublin Port will have difficulty in managing its traffic throughput.</P>
      <P>Dublin Port is our number one port in the country. Throughput has risen from 6.1 million tonnes in 1989 to 15.2 million in 1999 and is forecast to reach 23.7 million tonnes by 2007. It handles by far the largest proportion of the country's unitised freight, some 71%, and has a high prospective growth over the coming seven years.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, immediate access to the port is through busy residential and commercial areas. The port's own road network is to a high standard with more than adequate capacity. However, because of severe congestion in the vicinity of the port caused, to a large extent, by heavy commuter traffic, port traffic is severely disrupted and delayed as it seeks to enter and leave the port. All traffic currently accesses the port through the city streets, most of it along the quays and the East Wall Road. The Dublin port tunnel, which is due to be completed in 2004, will provide a direct link from the port to the M1 or M50. However, in the meantime all port traffic will have to continue to access the national road network via the city's streets.</P>
      <P>An expert EU co-financed assessment of port access requirements nationally, which I intend to publish shortly, concludes that &ldquo;Dublin will increasingly face capacity constraints over the next ten years. Over the period to 2006, immediate capacity constraints will be felt in the unitised modes and ongoing expansion of facilities will be a priority. If land for expansion is unavailable, the port will have to concentrate its developments on increasing the utilisation of existing land and facilities and possibly forgoing existing lower value trades which are space intensive&rdquo;. It is also a fact that the financial power and underlying strength of the larger ports, Dublin and Cork in particular, has already led to a concentration of volumes in these ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Diversion of traffic to the ports mentioned and also to the other east coast ports must be among <Col N="352" /> the alternatives considered in order to avoid the creation of bottlenecks limiting the flow of imports and exports so vital to the sustained growth of the economy.</P>
    <P>It is my policy to encourage shipping operators and the ports industry in general to maximise utilisation of capacity outside of Dublin and enhance competitiveness. In order to strengthen the contribution of east coast ports I have announced that both Dundalk and Wicklow will shortly become commercial State port companies joining Dublin and Drogheda. Together with Rosslare and Greenore this will strengthen the capacity of the east coast ports industry in servicing the central and southern shipping corridors.</P>

      <P>A special scheme was introduced some years ago, with EU approval, to regularise the position of small fishing vessels which, although part of the fishing fleet, had not been formally licensed or registered. The scheme, which permits the addition of capacity not exceeding 5,473 gross tonnes and 28,447 kilowatts to the overall capacity of the Irish fishing fleet, applies to small vessels which were demonstrably part of the fleet prior to 1989.</P>
      <P>The closing date for receipt of applications under the scheme was 17 February 1995. Licences have been issued to the majority of applicants and remaining cases are being processed to finality by my Department, as and when all necessary documentation and information is submitted by the applicants concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no proposals at present for a further scheme of this nature, which would require EU <Col N="353" /> approval. I have, however, asked my Department to examine whether there is any objective necessity for pursuing the case for a further scheme with the Commission, in the context of the overall circumstances of the inshore fisheries sector, as well as the implications for overall fleet management policy.</P>

      <P>Neither my Department, nor any of the agencies under its aegis, is involved in the provision of schemes or supports to schools, businesses, community groups and individuals to promote information technology. The Department has, however, plans to improve its delivery of public services. In that context, the Department is reviewing its information technology strategy and development plans with a view to preparing a public service strategy that will ultimately deliver integrated services to its clients. As part of this work, my Department aims to identify services that may be suitable for access through the use of modern communications based on Internet technologies. For example, one particular scheme, which is aimed at increasing efficiency in the seafood industry, will involve fishermen, on entering port, inputting details of catches on board allowing those involved in the industry to see, at a glance, the supply available at any given port.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the measures adopted by the North Western Regional Fisheries Board to conserve salmon stocks by setting bag limits on its own fisheries and by promoting a catch and release policy throughout its fisheries region.</P>
      <P>The national salmon stocks remain very vulnerable and I propose to maintain all the conservation measures that are currently in place, including measures relating to the length of the fishing season, the weekly closing times, night-time fishing and the use of baits. I encourage the voluntary practice of catch and release by anglers, particularly in the case of the spring salmon which is especially vulnerable to over-exploitation in individual catchments.</P>
      <P>Following the advice of the National Salmon Commission I have made regulations to provide for a scheme of tagging for wild salmon which will commence on 1 January 2001. The information provided by the tagging scheme combined with the fish counter programme will critically inform the development of salmon management policy over time.</P>
      <P>Salmon tagging will provide valuable management information as a real time basis. There is, however, a great deal more to be done to effectively conserve and manage salmon stocks. I have asked the commission to analyse and advise me on a range of priority issues as follows: expanding and upgrading the national fish counter programme, enhanced spring salmon conservation strategies, catchment management strategies, the water quality challenge, incentivising reduction of commercial fishing effort, and predation.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently providing co-funding in respect of two pilot schemes for set-aside of commercial fishing engines for salmon. Both of these schemes are at catchment level and I have requested the regional fisheries boards to encourage the various players in their fisheries regions and catchments to develop further similar projects based on consensus and local contribution.</P>

      <P>The Government's forestry policy as set out in &ldquo;Growing for the Future &ndash; A Strategic Plan for the Development of the Forestry Sector in Ireland&rdquo; is to increase Ireland's forest cover from its present level of 9% of land area to 17% by 2030. This strategy is to be achieved by planting approximately 20,000 hectares of forestry per annum. The planting programme is supported by a generous grants and premium package co-financed by the European Union. This significant increase in forestry will assist in countering the increase in greenhouse gases. If national planting targets are achieved, Irish forests will be sequestering over 1.5 million tonnes of carbon per year by 2008 &ndash; around 30% of the predicted surplus emissions of carbon dioxide.</P>
      <P>Conifers are particularly well suited to play a significant role as a carbon sequestrator. It is estimated that one hectare of sitka spruce absorbs 3.3 tonnes of carbon per year while broadleaves absorb 1.3 tonnes. Over its rotation one hectare of conifers will remove approximately 100 tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere per hectare, making conifers exceptionally efficient in combating the greenhouse gas effect.</P>

      <P>Mandatory tonnage objectives are set for the Irish fishing fleet by the EU multi-annual guidance programme for Ireland up to the end of 2001, and a policy of 100% replacement capacity for the introduction of vessels is applied to ensure conformity with those objectives. Fleet policy is focused, therefore, on facilitating vessel renewal, modernisation and upgrading within these binding capacity limits.</P>
      <P>The pelagic fleet has seen very significant reinvestment by owners in recent years and is one of the most modern and efficient in Europe. The whitefish fleet renewal programme has supported substantial investment in new and modern second-hand boats, vessel modernisation and safety improvements. This will help to ensure that the Irish fishing industry can compete effectively, in terms of efficiency and technology, with its EU counterparts. Programmes under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 will continue to support further investment to ensure that Ireland has a safe, technologically advanced and efficient fishing fleet appropriate to the available fishing opportunities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>Forestry in Ireland is governed primarily by the Forestry Act, 1946. This Act, which is currently being revised, confers significant powers on the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources in relation to forestry. The Act requires that in general, trees cannot be felled without the consent of the Minister and also imposes replanting obligations where appropriate. A licensing system involving site inspections is in place to cover these requirements.</P>
      <P>My Department recently launched a number of important publications dealing with forestry management in Ireland.</P>
      <P>These are the &ldquo;Irish National Forest Standard&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Code of Best Forest Practice &ndash; Ireland&rdquo; and a suite of five guidelines dealing with forestry and the environment. These publications form an important element in this country's programme of sustainable forestry management, SFM.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The &ldquo;Irish National Forest Standard&rdquo; outlines the basic criteria and indicators relating to the national implementation of sustainable forestry management. It lists a series of qualitative and <Col N="357" /> quantitative measures by which progress towards SFM can be monitored under Irish forest conditions.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Code of Best Forest Practice &ndash; Ireland&rdquo; covers all forestry operations and outlines the manner in which they should be carried out to ensure the implementation of SFM in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The five guidelines cover: forestry and water quality; forestry and biodiversity; forestry and archaeology; forestry and the landscape; forest harvesting and the environment.</P>
    <P>Compliance with these guidelines is a condition of grant aid. The forest service inspectorate of my Department monitors adherence to the guidelines through site inspections. It is worth noting that virtually all forestry planting in Ireland is grant-aided under the afforestation grants and premium scheme and all payments under the scheme are contingent on compliance with the environmental guidelines.</P>
    <P>My Department has also undertaken significant work on the development of a geographical information system called the forest inventory and planning system, FIPS. The purpose of this system is to provide geographical, forest resource and environmental data for management, control and planning purposes.</P>
    <P>My Department is also involved in training for the forestry sector and works in conjunction with Coillte Teoranta, Teagasc and Enterprise Ireland in the provision of appropriate training courses for the sector.</P>
    <P>As Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, I am also responsible under the 1988 Forestry Act for the corporate governance of Coillte Teoranta. This semi-State company is the largest owner of forestry in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied therefore, that the implementation in the forest and at national level of the standard, the code and the environmental guidelines, together with effective monitoring and enforcement by the forest service, will ensure that all timber produced in Ireland is derived from sustainably managed forests.</P>

      <P>The most recent result of a commercially viable mineral discovery in the State was the entry into production in September 1999 of the zinc and lead mine at Lisheen in County Tipperary. At full production its output of zinc in concentrates, combined with that of Tara in County Meath and Galmoy in County Kilkenny, will rank Ireland as sixth in the world.</P>
      <P>In addition to this new mine, a planning application has been made to mine additional reserves discovered at Galmoy. Moreover, I recently issued an additional mining licence for Tara Mines and have received an application for a new lease to work a substantial extension to that orebody which was identified as a result of intensive exploration effort. Although there are other encouraging results from ongoing exploration, particularly for zinc, it is too early to say whether these will lead to commercial developments.</P>
      <P>There is a strong international interest in investing in minerals prospecting in this country. I am committed to ensuring that the investment climate for prospecting and mining is kept competitive and will use the results of the current examination by my Department of comparative rates of royalty and tax in other mining jurisdictions to fine-tune our system to that end.</P>

      <P>Ongoing stock assessments by Irish and EU scientists point to serious declines in a number of key whitefish stocks in Irish waters. These include hake, monkfish saithe in the north west and south west, cod and whiting in the Irish Sea and plaice in the Celtic Sea. Concerns about the state of stocks were reflected in the total allowable catches agreed by the Council of Ministers for 2000. The Council also agreed the implementation of the Irish Sea cod recovery programme 2000 which introduced spring closures and other management measures to protect the spawning cod stock. Negotiations are currently under way on the continuation of the cod recovery programme for 2001.</P>
      <P>Emerging assessments this year of the state of the hake stocks 2000 point to the need for urgent measures to protect juvenile and spawning stocks. Ireland has been pressing for conservation measures for hake stocks for several years and the Commission has initiated discussions with Ireland, the UK, France and Spain on the scope for such measures in 2001.</P>
      <P>Ireland has been at the forefront at EU level in pushing for enhanced conservation measures to protect fish stocks. With the support of the industry and backed up by the recent analysis of the CFP national strategy group, I am pursuing the case for further systematic action with the Commission and member states.</P>

      <Quest>if Irish fishing vessels compare with those overseas in terms of seaworthiness and safety; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>Although there are no international league tables available which show how Irish sea fishing vessels compare with their overseas counterparts, our vessels compare favourably with other countries in terms of seaworthiness and safety.</P>
      <P>Safety regulation of vessels at international level emanates from the safety conventions of the International Maritime Organisation which produce consistently improving safety standards for vessels of all kinds. My Department continues to give the highest priority to introducing into Irish law the provisions of these conventions, thus ensuring that Irish sea fishing vessels meet the same safety standards as those of other countries. The same applies to initiatives at European Union level.</P>
      <P>European Council Directive 97/70 on a harmonised safety regime for fishing vessels of 24 metres and over in length provided for the implementation in EU states of the 1993 Torremolinos International Convention for the Safety of Fishing Vessels. In 1998, my Department introduced two statutory instruments which transposed the directive into national law. All Irish fishing vessels of 24 metres and over built since the mid-1980s comply with the requirements of the Torremolinos Convention.</P>
      <P>As well as safety regulation which stems from our international commitments, my Department has also initiated a wide range of measures to improve the seaworthiness and safety of fishing vessels. For fishing vessels of less than 24 metres, there are extensive regulations in place which cover life-saving appliances, fire-fighting equipment and radio equipment. Further safety regulations for vessels of 12 to 24 metres and from six to 12 metres have been drafted, in consultation with the fishing industry and these are expected to be in place in the near future.</P>
      <P>In addition, the manning requirements and qualifications for officers on fishing vessels are in line with the STCW (F) (Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping) Fishing Convention, 1995, which ensure that our fishing vessels are manned by highly trained professional crews, the products of our two excellent nautical fishing colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" /> Investment in the fishing fleet under the whitefish renewal programme which has totalled £5.5 million has also contributed significantly to improved safety and seaworthiness. The programme provided support for the introduction of 29 new fishing vessels and of 19 modern second-hand vessels and the modernisation and upgrading of a further 63 vessels. All of these vessels will have the latest life-saving equipment on board to provide the safest possible workplace for our fishermen.</P>

      <P>There are 238 fish processing plants which are approved by my Department for the production of seafood products under EU health and hygiene regulations. There are also 90 plants similarly approved for the production of live bivalve molluscs. Some plants have dual approval.</P>
      <P>The issue of consistent supply of quality raw material impacts mostly on the 238 plants involved in production of fishery products. These plants are largely supplied by landings of fresh fish into Irish ports and supply is affected by a number of factors such as quota, weather, seasonality and market prices.</P>
      <P>My Department has commissioned an independent consultant to prepare an integrated strategy to enhance the profitability and performance of the seafood processing sector. The strategy will inform investment support strategies for the sector in the short to medium term. One of the critical issues being examined in this context is the consistency of raw material supply. I expect to receive the strategy document shortly.</P>

Timber supply from privately owned forests will increase significantly in the longer term and together with projected increases from public forests, supply of and demand for logs should be at equilibrium.</P>

    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Following consultation with the Irish Timber Council, Donal Magner, and Coillte, John McLoughlin Marketing, there is currently an adequate supply of logs to the industry, which is expected to continue into the future. Even with increased investment in new machinery by the sawmilling subsector the question appears to be whether the industry has the capacity to process the increased volumes of timber that will be coming on stream. There is also a question mark over whether the sawmills can market the increased production of sawnwood, if they can process the increased supply of logs.</P>

      <P>Funding of £75,000 has been provided during 1999 and 2000, through the human rights and democratisation scheme administered by Ireland Aid, for a capacity building project for the Bur<Col N="363" /> mese democratic movement in exile. This project was submitted for support to Ireland Aid by Trócaire.</P>
      <P>There were two distinct components to this project, the first was a training programme in public administration and management for members of the Burmese democracy movement. This element of the project took place in February and March 2000 at the Institute of Public Administration and was regarded as having been very successful. The second element of the project took place earlier this month when a group of exiled Burmese members of parliament visited Ireland and participated in a conference also hosted at the Institute of Public Administration.</P>
      <P>During both elements of this project, meetings took place between some of the visiting participants and officials of my Department. At the most recent such meeting, in early October, it was confirmed that Ireland Aid would consider providing further support for projects involving the Burmese democratic movement in exile, upon receipt of appropriate proposals.</P>
      <P>In addition, Ireland will continue to work actively through the EU and other relevant international fora to maintain pressure on the Burmese military regime in order to persuade it to change its present policy and to initiate dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi and the supporters of democracy in Burma.</P>

      <P>Although I have not met the south Armagh farmers and residents group, officials of my Department maintain close contact with it and continue to meet it from time to time.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Government has had detailed discussions with elected representatives from the area about the lack of progress towards normalisation in south Armagh. At these meetings, elected and community representatives have put the case that the absence of tangible progress towards normalisation runs the risk of both undermining support for the peace process and increasing support for the dissident position. The Government is very aware of their concerns and of the importance of normalisation generally to the local community in south Armagh and we pursue these matters with the British Government on an ongoing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, the British Government undertook to make progress towards the objective of as early a return as possible to normal security arrange<Col N="364" /> ments, consistent with the level of threat. Some progress has been made since April 1998 on the reduction of security measures, including the withdrawal of a number of battalions of the British Army and the ending of military patrols in areas of Northern Ireland. However, the rate of progress has fallen short of Nationalist expectations, especially in south Armagh.</P>
    <P>Following agreement at Hillsborough last May, a number of specific normalisation measures were announced by the RUC Chief Constable, including the demolition of Cloghogue observation base and the demolition of the observation sangar overlooking the square in Crossmaglen, both of which are in south Armagh. The latter was removed at the end of July and work on the former is nearing completion. More recently, on 29 September, the Chief Constable announced a further series of measures, including the return of land requisitioned by the army in Newtownhamilton.</P>
    <P>While the two announcements on normalisation made so far this year have been welcome, I look forward to further progress, particularly in south Armagh, at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

      <P>There is an ongoing debate within the Union on the extent to which the &ldquo;widening&rdquo; of the Union by enlargement can be combined with closer integration or &ldquo;deepening&rdquo;, now and in the future. The Taoiseach and I have set out the Government's view on these issues on a number of occasions both in the Dáil and elsewhere. I have indicated the need for reflection and awareness of the evolution taking place in the European Union and in Ireland's place in and relationship to the Union, especially as we are becoming relatively more prosperous.</P>
      <P>We have consistently favoured broadening the Union through enlargement, and, through our participation in EMU, for example, have shown ourselves ready to embrace deepening of the Union. However, the concept of further deepening requires clear analysis of what is meant, and of what the structures can support. We strongly feel that the Union is successful because of the balance that has been achieved, through the Treaty, between the supra-national and intergovernmental, that is, the division of competences among the institutions and between them and the member states. Like many other member states, we will wish to see that delicate balance maintained into the future, including in the context of the negotiations currently under way in the framework of the intergovernmental conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="365" /> It is widely recognised that the successful development of the Union requires a broad measure of public support. This is why the Commission, for example, has recently initiated a significant public information programme, while the Taoiseach and I have also sought to encourage greater public debate.</P>
    <P>Ireland has benefited enormously from membership of the European Union and has at the same time contributed constructively to the Union's development, politically and institutionally. As a country which supports both the enlargement of the Union, and the updating of its institutional arrangements on a balanced basis to meet the challenges ahead, we will participate fully in the reform process, most particularly in ensuring the successful conclusion of the present intergovernmental conference.</P>

      <P>The people of the Shankill and other loyalist communities in Northern Ireland have endured terrible violence and intimidation over the past two months. Three men lost their lives during the month of August as a direct result of the feuding between the main loyalist paramilitary groups, and many have been injured. Particularly disturbing is the fact that an 11 year old girl was among those seriously injured. Hundreds of people have been forced to leave their homes as a result of intimidation on the Shankill, which has been linked to the feud.</P>
      <P>The families of the dead and injured and those who have been forced out of their homes have both my sympathy and that of the Government. No one, from any community in Northern Ireland has a mandate to engage in murder, violence or intimidation. The people of this island, North and South, in endorsing the Belfast Agreement, have decided on a future based on democratic principles, peaceful resolution of division and mutual respect.</P>
      <P>I hope the efforts being made to mediate between the feuding parties reach a successful outcome. I encourage all those with influence in the loyalist community to use their best endeavours to bring about such a resolution.</P>

      <P>EU Council Regulations 3820/85 and 3821/85 were introduced in 1985 to promote safety for drivers and other road users. These regulations concern the use of tachographs in heavy goods vehicles and large public service vehicles &ndash; buses &ndash; and lay down maximum driving times, minimum rest and break periods.</P>
      <P>All EU member states are obliged to comply with the regulations. It is the responsibility of operators to organise work in such a way that drivers are able to comply with the provisions of the regulations. Drivers have responsibility to plan their journeys so as to ensure that they take adequate rests in accordance with Regulation 3820/85.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="367" /> According to Council Regulation 3820/85, driving is limited to nine hours per day but this may be extended twice in any one week to ten hours. On the issue of breaks from driving, a driver must take a break of at least 45 minutes after 4.5 hours driving. This break may be replaced by breaks of at least 15 minutes each distributed over the driving period or immediately afterwards.</P>
    <P>Member states are also required to undertake a minimum number of inspections at both the roadside and at premises under the regulations each year. In addition, they are also obliged to provide certain statistical data on the implementation of the regulations to the European Commission.</P>
    <P>The regulations are enforced by transport officers from my Department who are engaged full time on the detection and prosecution of breaches of these regulations and other offences under the Road Transport Acts. Where serious contraventions of the regulations are detected, prosecutions are initiated in accordance with the regulations. A person guilty of an offence is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both fine and imprisonment.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, no scope for any adjustments to these requirements under the EU regulations.</P>

      <P>The European Commission has recently published proposals to amend the 1997 EU postal directive. These include proposals to reduce the maximum tariff and weight parameters of the reserved area within which the universal service provider in each member state &ndash; An Post in the case of Ireland &ndash; has exclusive rights.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the reserved area is to guarantee the provision of a universal service of a specified standard to all users throughout the State.</P>
      <P>The Government is in favour of the gradual and controlled liberalisation of the Irish postal market. In my examination of the Commission's most recent proposals in this regard, my primary concern will be to ensure a continuing commitment to a uniform universal service for all users. My understanding is that there is no intention at EU level to depart from this principle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>The findings and recommendations of the board of inquiry established by Iarnród Éireann were conveyed by me to the Deputy in October 1998.</P>
      <P>The board of inquiry recommended that the level crossing be examined in the context of a risk analysis of level crossings that was being carried out at that time by consultants A.D. Little on behalf of Iarnród Éireann. I understand that in their subsequent report, the consultants did not assess the level crossing at Slieve Corbally to be a high risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, Iarnród Éireann and Roscommon County Council did agree to put in place additional measures at this level crossing and the work was carried out by the county council during the summer period this year. The measures <Col N="369" /> included resurfacing of the road, the erection of new warning signage on the approaches to the crossing and the erection of &ldquo;stop&rdquo; signs at the crossing. In addition, the road has been painted with yellow line markings to highlight the crossing.</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann is in ongoing discussions with Roscommon County Council in relation to the level crossing and consideration is now being given to additional measures which may further improve safety at this location, for example, the installation of public lighting.</P>
    <P>The Slieve Corbally level crossing has been visited by the railway inspecting officers of my Department on a number of occasions since October 1997 and will continue to be monitored. On each occasion the gates were found to be open and I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to users of this type of level crossing throughout the country to please close the gates every time they use a crossing.</P>
    <P>The issue of safety at level crossings generally is being addressed in the context of Iarnród Éireann's railway safety programme, 1999 to 2003. Under the programme, £88 million is being targeted at 602 level crossings across the Iarnród Éireann network which A.D. Little considered to pose the highest risk. Work on this programme is ongoing and, to date, approximately 140 of these crossings have been completed.</P>

      <Quest>the reason disability pension has not yet been granted to a person (details supplied) in County Sligo in view of the fact that, after 27 years service, he was offered early retirement on medical grounds and further taking into consideration the medical assessment of 7 June 2000; if he will ensure that his pension is immediately put in place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>On his retirement from the Defence Forces in January 1997 under the voluntary early retirement scheme, the person in question was granted a service pension and gratuity under the Defence Forces pension schemes, together with an additional severance gratuity, appropriate to his rank and service.</P>
      <P>In 1998, he applied for a disability pension under the Army Pensions Acts in respect of noise-induced hearing loss and one other medical condition. His case was referred to the Army Pensions Board, which is the statutory body appointed under those Acts to investigate and report on applications for disability pensions. Recently, the board reported that only his hearing condition is attributable to his military service and that the degree of his disablement due to this condition does not reach the minimum of 20% required to qualify for a disability pension. However, based on the board's findings, he is eligible to be considered for the award of a disablement gratuity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person in question received compensation in 1998 in settlement of a civil action against this Department in respect of his hearing condition. <Col N="373" /> In this regard, the Army Pensions Acts provide that any compensation received may be taken into consideration in fixing the level of disablement pension or gratuity that might otherwise be awarded for the same condition. In that context, the question of whether all or some of the compensation received should be taken into account in this case arises for consideration. The underlying rationale is to prevent double compensation for the same disablement.</P>
    <P>My Department will write to the person concerned in the very near future.</P>

      <P>The military authorities advise that, in 1994, 49% of Naval Service personnel completed the &ldquo;Life&rdquo; fitness test. Of this substantial group of Naval Service personnel who completed the test, 82% successfully passed. Due to the fact that large numbers of personnel serve at sea Naval Service command recognises the requirement to secure a further improvement in this area and, therefore, it has taken the following steps: (a)new naval vessels are being constructed with a small gymnasium on board, (b)the director of Defence Forces training has agreed to initiate an independent study into the special requirements of the Naval Service with regard to physical fitness testing and physical education in general. Under this proposal, a masters degree of physical education student from the University of Limerick will carry out the study with the view to assisting the Naval Service in this area.</P>

      <P>The recent publication of the final report by the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise into the accident at Tramore, County Waterford, on 2 July 1999 in which four members of the Air Corps, Captain David O'Flaherty, Captain Michael Baker, Sergeant Paddy Mooney and Corporal Niall Byrne, were tragically killed, evoked many sad memories for the families of the victims, for the Defence Forces and for the public in general.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the investigation was to determine the circumstances and cause, or causes, of the accident in order to prevent future such accidents.</P>
      <P>The report, which is a very comprehensive and detailed document, has been examined in my Department. The safety recommendations set out in the report which call for action by the Department and the Defence Forces are being considered as a matter of priority with a view to their immediate implementation. In this regard, I have put procedures in place to monitor progress.</P>
      <P>In addition to the aforementioned investigation, a military court of inquiry was convened following the accident to inquire into its circumstances. Its main thrust will be an examination of both the final report of the AAIU and the coroner's report. The work of the military court of inquiry will, therefore, now proceed following publication of the final report of the AAIU. The court of inquiry must also await the findings of the coroner's court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 197 to 199, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Leader type activity in the period to 2006 will be delivered through the European Union Leader+ programme, together with a mainstream national rural development programme. Funding of over £117 million has been allocated to these two programmes.</P>
      <P>Work on the preparation of the operational programme for Leader+ is at an advanced stage and it is expected that it will be lodged with the European Commission in the coming weeks. The programme will also be presented to the special North-South EU programmes body for its endorsement in tandem with the Northern Ireland Leader programme.</P>
      <P>A period of five months is provided for to facilitate the Commission's consideration of the programme prior to deciding on approval. While I will be pushing for early approval of the programme, it is unlikely that approval will be forthcoming before the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national rural development programme forms part of the regional operational programmes and will be funded under the National <Col N="381" /> Development Plan 2000-2006. Given their complementarity, the European Commission has indicated that the approval process for the national rural development programme and the Leader+ programme will take place simultaneously.</P>
    <P>Following a number of information seminars around the country, my Department invited applications from rural development groups interested in participating in the new programmes. Both the Arigna and the mid-south Roscommon Leader groups were among the groups which signalled their interest in operating both programmes but to date no formal applications have been received from these groups.</P>
    <P>Advertisements inviting interested groups to submit full business plans for either or both programmes were placed in the national and provincial newspapers and farming press with a closing date of 27 October 2000 for receipt of applications.</P>
    <P>An independent consultant will be commissioned to examine and make recommendations on selection. The Department will consider this assessment and report to Government which will make the final decisions on groups. The process for selection of groups to operate the new programmes will proceed contemporaneously with the Commission's consideration of the Leader+ operational programme. I expect that the decision on the successful groups will follow shortly after the Commission's approval of the programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that under the disadvantaged areas compensatory allowance scheme agreed in July and since approved by the European Commission, some £360 million in additional funding has been committed over the period 2001-06. This will increase the total value of the scheme to £1.080 billion over the period concerned.  It is estimated that the number of farmers qualifying for payment under the new area based scheme will rise from 90,000 currently to 109,000 in 2001. Total expenditure in 2001 will increase by some £60 million to £180 million. Some 81,000 farmers stand to gain under the new arrangements while about 28,000 will incur some losses. I have negotiated a compensation package with the European Commission for losers under which 90 per cent of <Col N="382" /> losses will be made good in 2001, 80 per cent in 2002 and 50 per cent in 2003. Under these arrangements the average loss in 2001 will be about £32 rising to £64 in 2002.</P>
      <P>I am committed to reviewing the scheme with a view to finding an equitable long-term solution to the problem of losers.</P>
      <P>At the time the new scheme was agreed in July last the Irish Farmers Association in particular acknowledged that the package was a balanced one backed by increased resources which is designed as far as possible to secure the incomes of vulnerable sectors, including drystock farmers and both mountain and lowland sheep producers in these areas. It also acknowledged that the new package meets the commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, PPF, that the incomes of farmers dependent on disadvantaged area payments will be protected. The reality is that moving from an animal based payment system to an area based payment system based solely on the disadvantaged status of the land involves &ldquo;winners&rdquo; and &ldquo;losers&rdquo;. The scheme model outlined by the Deputy would cost approximately £240 million per annum.</P>

      <P>Following an inspection on the farm of the REPS participant named in June 1999, penalties amounting to 70 per cent were imposed on his third year payment. The person appealed the penalties unsuccessfully to my Department's local office in August 1999 and in September 1999 lodged a further appeal with the REPS appeals committee. The matter will be fully considered by the REPS appeals committee at its next available meeting. The person named will be informed directly of the outcome.</P>

      <P>My Department is fully committed to the use and promotion of information technology, IT. The importance which I attach to IT is evidenced by the production early this year of a new IT strategy for my Department. This strategy recognises the significance of the effective use of IT in the delivery of our schemes and services to all of our customers. This commitment has been included in our protocol for direct payments published in July of this year.</P>
      <P>My Department currently provides a comprehensive range of services to our client base, including paying grants totalling some £2 billion per annum. While these operational schemes are fully computer supported, it is our intention in implementing the new strategy to web-enable all of these systems. The availability of an electronic service delivery channel will encourage our client base in the use of information technology. In addition, my Department already provides a vast amount of information on its website, which is being widely used by the public.</P>
      <P>Also I should point out that my Department fully supports the objectives of the Information Society Commission and has actively participated in the work of the public sector implementation groups chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently drafting its e-government strategy and is exploring a number of initiatives consistent with the promotion of IT.</P>
      <P>In addition, I should mention Leader, the EU initiative for rural development. Under Leader, funding may be provided to community groups, individuals and businesses for the purposes of increasing awareness of the relevance of information technology, enhancing information technology skills among rural dwellers and improving access to IT facilities in rural areas.</P>
      <P>I have also asked the bodies under the aegis of my Department to provide the Deputy with the information requested.</P>

      <P>Mechanically recovered meat, MRM, is the product of a process designed to recover residual meat from the bones of slaughtered animals and poultry and has been permitted for use in human food under EU and national legislation for many years.</P>
      <P>MRM is used in certain food products manufactured in Ireland, typically pigmeat products. The process is subject to specific public health requirements, particularly in relation to heat treatment of the MRM. In May 1998 my Department introduced legislation which prohibited the use of the bones of the vertebral columns of bovine, ovine and caprine animals in the production of MRM. One of the effects of this legislation was that commercial production of MRM from these species effectively ceased.</P>
      <P>While my Department monitors the hygiene conditions attached to the production in Ireland of MRM, records of the amounts produced are not maintained. My Department is not aware of any commercial import trade in MRM.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>Standards for organic crop produce had been fixed since 1991 by EU Regulation 2092/91. When Regulation 2092/91 was extended to the livestock sector on 24 August my Department had proposed to adopt standards for such produce in accordance with the regulation.</P>
      <P>However the standards in the regulation did not include all the requirements recommended by the three private bodies, the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association, Organic Trust and Demeter Standards Limited. Following further discussions on this issue with interested parties, including the three private organic bodies and other stakeholders in the organic sector, my Department has indicated that it is prepared to set certain additional requirements and that others may be considered subsequently by the Organic Development Committee which I am establishing in accordance with the recommendation of the AgriFood 2010 committee. I am confident that the standards now being set for the organic sector will provide every reassurance to retailers and consumers as to the quality and integrity of Irish organic produce, without compromising the competitiveness of Irish organic producers. My objective is to ensure the continuing growth of the organic sector as part of mainstream farming in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The AgriFood 2010 report recommended that a credible regulatory system be put in place for the organic sector and that the existing confusion between competing inspection bodies be ended. In response, I undertook to streamline the inspection arrangements. My objective is to ensure that all organic farmers and processors have ready access to the most efficient, transparent and consistent arrangements for inspection and certification. My Department has recently put proposals to the three private bodies for a unified inspection and certification system which will achieve this objective while allowing the three bodies to continue to operate their own private arrangements, where their own members are concerned, as heretofore. I understand that the three bodies are currently considering these proposals and I am hopeful for a positive response.</P>
      <P>My Department will also implement the recommendation in the recent Bord Bia report on prospects for organic food in Ireland that there should be one clear national logo for organic food that can be used to market Irish organic food to both domestic and overseas consumers. I am confident that this measure will bring significant benefits to all Irish organic producers and processors.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy and other relevant particulars are contained in the following table.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, unlike cannabis which is a bulk product, heroin is usually transported in smaller quantities, often on the person. This makes detection far more difficult relative to other categories of controlled substances. The methods used in detection are regularly reviewed. I am informed that, following a recent review of the operation of the Customs national drugs team, the Revenue Commissioners have decided to acquire passive sniffer dogs which will be specifically trained in the detection of drugs concealed on the person. These dogs will be deployed at the main ferryports and airports. Training for the dogs and handlers commences in November next and the first fully trained dog will enter service in February 2001.</P>

      <P>Under section 73 of the Succession Act, 1965, the estate of any person who dies intestate and without known next-of-kin falls to the State. Moneys falling to the State in this way are paid into the intestate estates fund.</P>
      <P>The sum to which the Deputy refers represents funds of deceased patients which had been held by the health boards for a number of years and which have now been paid into the intestate estates fund.</P>
      <P>Under section 36 of the State Property Act, 1954, the Minister for Finance's discretion is confined to either leaving the moneys in the fund pending claims from a next-of-kin or to transferring moneys from the intestate estates fund to the central fund. The Minister for Finance does not therefore currently have legal power to transfer moneys from the intestate estates fund in the manner proposed by the Deputy. In the context of legislation currently being drafted in relation to dormant accounts I will consider, in conjunction with the Attorney General, whether it would be possible to provide for the transfer of surplus moneys from the intestate estates fund to the dormant accounts fund which will in turn utilise surplus funds for charitable purposes generally.</P>

      <Quest>the reason both parents can claim the tax free allowance for lone parents; his views on whether this discriminates against a married couple with children; the provisions in the tax code in relation to a married couple with children; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that section 462 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides for an additional tax allowance for one-parent families. A single parent, whether widowed, single, deserted or separated, who has a dependent child or children may claim the allowance of £4,700 at the standard rate of income tax. A condition of eligibility for the allowance is that the child must live with the claimant for the whole or part of the year of claim. As a child may live with each parent for part of the year, both parents can claim the allowance. This provision dates from the Finance Act, 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initial legislation in the Finance Bill, 1979, <Col N="396" /> as published proposed to apportion the new one-parent family allowance where a child or children were maintained jointly by separated or divorced parents; this apportionment was to be on the basis of the expense incurred by each in the maintenance of the child or children.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, ministerial amendments were made to the Bill that granted the single parent allowance to each parent in the case where parents were separated and where the child or children resided with each parent for part of the year. It was decided that both parents should get the allowance rather than have one allowance shared between them.</P>
    <P>This was considered to be the fairest approach as it was likely that serious difficulties would have arisen if the one-parent allowance was apportioned in the manner previously proposed. The amendments were welcomed and endorsed by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>I regard this provision as being reasonable, having regard to the circumstances of separated couples with children.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that in budget 2000 I introduced the home carer's allowance. This is a tax allowance of up to £3,000 at the standard rate of income tax which may be claimed by a married couple, provided they are jointly assessed, where one spouse, the &ldquo;home carer&rdquo;, cares for one or more dependent persons. A child is a dependent person for the purposes of home carer's allowance. This allowance is restricted to married one earner couples where one spouse stays at home to care for the couple's children.</P>

      <P>Overall Government policy on the development of the information society is set out in the report, Implementing the Information Society in Ireland: An Action Plan, published by the Department of the Taoiseach in January 1999. The action plan sets out a series of measures and initiatives considered central to the development of the information society and giving Ireland &ldquo;first mover&rdquo; advantage in the emerging information economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to the action plan, my Department has established a special dedicated fund, the information society fund, designed to support not only the development of flagship e-government and e-commerce projects identified in the action plan, but also key initiatives designed to provide ready access to the Internet and to achieve a high <Col N="397" /> level of IT literacy and capability throughout the general public and the business community.</P>
    <P>In the area of information technology, IT, awareness, funding has been provided for a number of awareness campaigns co-ordinated by the Information Society Commission targeting both citizens and the business community. Internet access is now available for the general public at public libraries throughout the country. Additional measures are currently being considered by an interdepartmental group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and a number of proposals addressing the &ldquo;digital divide&rdquo; and targeting late adopters of IT are expected in the near future.</P>
    <P>In the business area, major e-commerce awareness and capacity building projects are being co-ordinated by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment through Enterprise Ireland's accelerator programme for SMEs, and the city and county enterprise boards' empower programme for micro enterprises.</P>
    <P>The action plan also identifies the importance of promoting the use of IT in schools and third level institutions. Major programmes in the education sector include the Schools IT 2000 and IT skills initiative which are being funded and managed by the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <P>Under the information society fund, proposals for funding are assessed by the information society fund evaluation team which is chaired by my Department and which includes representation from the Department of the Taoiseach. In 1999, an amount of £1.7 million was allocated to action plan projects and at this stage, £20.6 million from the £30 million available for 2000 has so far been approved for expenditure on 56 projects sponsored by 16 Departments and Offices.</P>
    <P>My Department fully recognises the importance of IT in the emerging information society and information economy and will continue to actively promote its use in achieving the objectives of the action plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 242 and 243 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the 1998 competition to which the Deputy refers was a once-off arrangement, held in the context of a particular difficulty which was being experienced in filling vacancies in various operational enforcement units of the Customs enforcement division in specified geographical locations. The Customs enforcement division is comprised of the Customs national drugs team, the Customs and Excise investigation bureau and the Revenue mobile service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that it was decided exceptionally not to allow serving officers in the enforcement units, including the Revenue mobile service, to take part in the 1998 competition. The view taken by Revenue was that to allow such officers to participate would simply have recycled the vacancies between the various operational units in the same division and would not have been an effective use of resources. This decision was taken shortly after the issue of Circular E.5490 in August 1998, but before applications were considered. Serving <Col N="402" /> officers who had applied were informed of this decision in writing at that time.</P>
    <P>In summary, the 1998 competition was an interim situation to meet a particular difficulty. Revised arrangements were subsequently put in place for the next competition, advertised in December 1999. All general service staff in Revenue were invited to compete, including staff in the Revenue mobile service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a child receives a site for a house from his/her parents, the child may be liable to stamp duty and capital acquisitions tax &ndash; CAT</P>
      <P>The rate of stamp duty applicable will depend on the market value of the site. The normal rates of stamp duty on transfers of non-residential property, that is, land are as follows: 0 &ndash; 5,000 &ndash; not liable; 5,001 &ndash; 10,000 &ndash; 1%; 10,001 &ndash; 15,000 &ndash; 2%; 15,001 &ndash; 25,000 &ndash; 3%; 25,001 &ndash; 50,000 &ndash; 4%; 50,001 &ndash; 60,000 &ndash; 5%; and over 60,000 &ndash; 6%.</P>
      <P>However, transfers between relatives are at half the above rates. All parties must be blood relatives for this relief to apply.</P>
      <P>The transfer of a site from a parent to a child would also be considered a gift or inheritance for CAT purposes. However, a tax-free threshold of £300,000 applies on transfers from a parent to a child. CAT would only be levied on the value of the site, if any, in excess of this threshold. Where a child has received previous gifts or inheritances since 2 December 1988 from a parent, the value of these benefits must be taken into account for the purposes of determining the current, if any, liability to CAT.</P>
      <P>In practice, therefore, the only liability to tax for a child receiving a site from a parent(s) is that arising from stamp duty &ndash; and that at a rate which is half the normal rate.</P>
      <P>It should be noted, however, that the transfer of an asset is regarded as a disposal at market value for capital gains tax &ndash; CGT &ndash; purposes regardless of what, if any, consideration is received in return. Consequently, where a parent transfers a site to a child, the parent would be liable to CGT, in the normal way, on any chargeable gain over the period of ownership of the site by the parent, at a rate of 20%. The first £1,000 of chargeable gains of an individual for a year of assessment is exempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the significant CAT exempt threshold applying for transfers to a child, the 50% stamp duty reduction for transfers between relatives and the current low CGT rate of 20%, I have no plans <Col N="403" /> at present to make any changes to the legislation in this regard.</P>

I have considered this report and while having taken no final decisions on its implementation, I accept the broad thrust of its recommendations. However, I feel some further refinement is needed in relation to implementation arrangements at local level. In this regard, I recently established an advisory group chaired by Professor Niall O'Higgins, to assist and liaise with health boards in formulating their plans for the development of specialist breast cancer services. The report recommends that &ldquo;At least two breast care nurses be available per 100 cancer patients to counsel and offer practical advice and emotional support to newly diagnosed patients, discuss treatment options with them and provide a prosthetic service.&rdquo;. This issue will be pursued in the context of the overall implementation of the report on the development of services for symptomatic breast disease.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The warfarin testing system pilot which operated in the Western Health Board area is being further evaluated at the moment. In some other areas there are warfarin testing procedures in place at general practice level and these are aided by the purchase of equipment or the collection of <Col N="405" /> blood samples and funded by the primary care units of those particular boards. The extension and development of a general practitioner led warfarin service will be considered in the context of the general review of general practitioner services at present being conducted by the chief executive officers of health boards in conjunction with my Department. I expect the review to be completed shortly.</P>

    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the overall numbers on waiting lists as at 30 June 2000 fell by 5,004 which is a reduction of 13.58% on the end of December quarter. This welcome <Col N="410" /> reduction is a reflection of the major priority that is being attached to addressing high waiting lists.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment. In this context, following a series of discussions with the chief executive officers of the health boards earlier this year, I announced a £10 million initiative aimed at maximising available capacity in the system to enable additional waiting list procedures to be performed before the end of the year. This brings the dedicated funding to waiting list procedures to £34 million this year.</P>
    <P>These short-term measures are being taken in tandem with longer term measures associated with the £2 billion investment under the national development plan, the ongoing implementation of the recommendations of the expert review group on the waiting list initiative and the national bed capacity review now under way. It is my intention to continue to take all available steps to address the short and longer term issues associated with lengthy waiting lists and waiting times.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have commissioned a work force planning survey, to be carried out by Dr. Peter Bacon, to report on the prospective supply and demand for physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists between now and 2015. This report will be presented by end of 2000 and will address the number of additional training places required for these professions. Through the Higher Education Authority, the possibility of increasing the number of training colleges, as well as training places will be addressed as a result of the findings of this survey. It is also intended to undertake a similar exercise for chiropody and dietetics.</P>
      <P>My Department is also engaged in strategic planning through the Study of the Nursing and Midwifery Resource. The primary objective of the study is to forecast, as far as is possible, future nursing and midwifery work force needs. I have recently received the steering group's interim report. This will be published shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 7 July last, I announced that from the 2000-01 academic year, all students studying for the post-registration higher diploma in public health nursing would be paid a salary while training and would have their fees refunded. This is in <Col N="411" /> return for a commitment on their part to work for at least two years following qualification as public health nurses with the sponsoring health board. This initiative is currently being implemented. The Deputy may also be interested to know that my Department is committed to the issue of a revised strategy statement on the role of the public health nurse. Arrangements for research support to facilitate this are currently being finalised.</P>
    <P>Work force planning for other professions will be addressed through the health services skills group to be established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, PPF. This group, comprised of the social partners, Departments and educational institutions will identify the needs of the health service and how best to address these needs.</P>
    <P>In relation to the number of vacancies, the identification of staffing requirements and the deployment of staff within the overall financial and employment levels set by my Department is a matter for the management of each health agency. Current personnel policy for the health service provides that health agencies may fill non-consultant replacement posts without recourse to the Department. For this reason the information sought by the Deputy in relation to vacancies is not available.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that recruitment of personnel is carried out on an ongoing basis in most agencies, and the level of vacancies fluctuates accordingly. At any given time, significant numbers of personnel would be in the process of being appointed by employers or moving from one employment to another.</P>

      <P>The recruitment of staff is a matter for the management of each health board authority. The Western Health Board has advised that in respect of staff nurse vacancies in St. Anne's Community nursing unit, Clifden, County Galway that two recruitment competitions were recently advertised. Unfortunately, the competitions did not provide suitable candidates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With our vibrant economy the issue of recruiting staff has become an important one for both the public and private sectors. My Department on a national basis has and continues to promote arrangements to recruit and retain nurses within the public health service. These <Col N="412" /> arrangements include better starting pay to nurses taking up employment through recognition of previous experience at home and abroad, standardised overtime arrangements, improved allowances, significant improvements to the promotional structure within nursing, the introduction of permanent part time working, expanded number of back to nursing courses and post-registration programmes, increased nurse training places, and an increase in the annual maintenance grant for nursing students.</P>
    <P>My Department is also engaged in the long-term strategic planning of future nursing and midwifery work force needs and an interim report has recently been completed. The Department in collaboration with the Health Research Board has commissioned a national study examining the turnover in nursing and midwifery with the intention of estimating the turnover rate and identifying the underlying reasons for it. Agreement has also been reached between the relevant Government Departments on a fast track procedure for clearances and work permits for non-EU nurses. An agreed priority plan has also been agreed with the nursing alliance of trade unions to examine the development of appropriate systems to determine nursing staffing levels and the opportunities for increased use of care assistants and other non-nursing staff.</P>

    <P>The provision of health services in County Kilkenny is a matter for the South Eastern Health Board. The allocation of funds provided under <Col N="415" /> the national development plan in respect of specific projects is a matter for decision by each health board.</P>
    <P>I understand from the board that, as part of its Kilkenny hospital plan, it has provided for £2.5 million under the national development plan to support the development of a new 30 bed community hospital for the elderly at St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny. A project team has been appointed to oversee the development and this phase will commence shortly.</P>
    <P>The board has advised that it is meeting the commitment given to the local community of Castlecomer in relation to the expenditure of £80,000 for refurbishment works and the provision of long stay beds at Castlecomer Hospital. It is currently addressing the short-medium term development of additional beds at Castlecomer district hospital. As such, architects have been engaged to draw up a plan for the development of two respite and two long stay beds. In line with the architect's report, the board has agreed the scheme of works recommended and is seeking the necessary planning approvals to proceed with these works. The board has advised that it is also investigating the possibility of providing sheltered housing on the grounds of the hospital.</P>

      <P>The provision of health services in Kilkenny is a matter for the South Eastern Health Board. I have had inquiries made of the board and been advised that it is pursuing the development of St. Luke's Hospital as part of the Kilkenny hospital plan. Under the national development plan approximately £43 million is to be provided for the Kilkenny hospital plan for the development of a 45 bed acute psychiatric unit, a coronary care unit and a building for a CT scanner. A project team has been appointed to oversee the next phase of the development which will include a community hospital, ward refurbishment-replacement and the development of the accident and emergency and out-patients departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to St. Canice's Hospital, it is intended that mentally ill patients will be transferred to the new acute psychiatric unit at St. Luke's, mentally handicapped patients will be transferred to a new purpose built 21 bed unit at Kilcreene Hospital and extended care will be provided for approximately 60 patients in alterna<Col N="416" /> tive accommodation. A high support unit is currently under construction at Kilcreene Hospital for children with special needs and there is also provision for a new regional ambulance control centre, and general refurbishment.</P>
    <P>Regarding the site of St. Canice's, the board advises that, in accordance with the Kilkenny hospital plan, potential for future development on the site is limited. I have been assured that the board intends to seek the maximum economic return from any surplus lands and, to reinvest any realised assets in the provision of health services within the city and county.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been advised by the board that the mammography equipment in question was purchased in 1997 by the friends of Cavan hospital. The Deputy will be aware that there was a review of the services for symptomatic breast disease carried out by a sub-group of the National Cancer Forum and I have received their report. I have considered this report and, while having taken no final decisions on its implementation, I accept the broad thrust of its recommendations. Some further refinements are needed in relation to implementation arrangements at local level. In this regard, I have recently announced the establishment of an advisory group, to be chaired by Professor Niall O'Higgins, St. Vincent's hospital, to assist and liaise with health boards in formulating their plans for the development of specialist breast cancer services. I am confident that the development of symptomatic breast disease services which will result will greatly <Col N="417" /> enhance the quality of the services currently available to the women of the north east area.  </P>

      <P>The North Eastern Health Board is fully committed to the future development of Monaghan hospital and to the provision of a high level of service for the people of Monaghan. Substantial refurbishment took place at the hospital last year and work is ongoing to prepare for the further development of facilities at the hospital. In this context, the brief which is being prepared by the North Eastern Health Board will ensure that planned facilities at Monaghan General Hospital are in line with best modern standards in all respects. The board has an obligation to ensure that the healthcare services it provides to clients and patients meet acceptable standards of safety.</P>
      <P>Health Risk Resources International advised the chief executive officer of the board in August 2000 that they had concerns regarding serious deficiencies in the physical infrastructure of the operating theatre at the Monaghan hospital site. The proposed development of the hospital contained in the board's 1998 framework document includes the provision of two fully equipped operating theatres. However, the deficiencies in the present theatre are such that remedial action must be taken in the immediate future to ensure a safe environment for surgical procedures pending the provision of new theatres. A schedule of the works necessary to provide a semi-permanent theatre at Monaghan has been finalised and this theatre will be available for use early in 2001.</P>
      <P>I also understand from the board that the consultants on call at Monaghan hospital will continue to see all emergencies. Protocols and procedures have been put in place for the transfer of patients to other hospitals if required following triage at Monaghan. The board has also put in place transport arrangements to accommodate patients and their families affected by transfers to other hospitals.</P>

      <P>My Department is providing funding for IT developments to health agencies under the national development plan to an amount of approximately £145 million over the period 2000-06. This includes training costs for health agency personnel who will be using the various IT systems involved. In addition, my Department provides support for information technology for general practitioners and for community pharmacists.</P>
      <P>The National GP IT Group, which was established by my Department in 1997 to promote the computerisation of general practice medicine, has launched a pilot national GP IT training programme involving approximately 270 GP doctors. The primary focus of the programme is on implementing computerisation within the practice. The group also maintains a web site which functions as an information resource for general practice and contains an extensive range of links to other relevant sites.</P>
      <P>Community pharmacists are supported in undertaking agreed upgrading of equipment for the purposes of improving IT and telematic linkages with health boards and the GMS (payments) board and facilitating better accountability arrangements.</P>
      <P>The health agencies undertake a range of measures to promote and support the use of information technology among their staff and client populations. These measures are supported from the IT and other programme related funding provided by my Department and through participation in a wide range of initiatives supported by the European Union. Major agencies maintain web sites containing details on matters such as the services provided, latest developments and health promotion/advice. Persons with disabilities are facilitated in the use of information technology as part of the range of vocational training and day services provided by the health boards and specialist voluntary hospitals and other agencies. Support is provided to local community groups for the purchase of computer equipment, IT awareness and development skills and training for their members-service users.</P>
      <P>Information technology is increasingly being used to optimise health services delivery with a particular emphasis towards people who are isolated due to social and physical boundaries and limitations; that is an interactive school access initiative has recently been launched in the Southern Health Board for children who have to spend long periods in hospital, enabling them to attend their normal classroom. The student who is a patient can see and interact with their normal teacher and fellow classmates and be seen and heard by them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. The guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
      <P>It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government identified in its programme An Action Programme for the Millennium the need to review medical card eligibility for the elderly and large families and decided that the income guidelines for entitlement to medical cards for persons aged 70 years or over should be doubled. This improvement, which is being introduced over a three year period, began on 1 March 1999. The income guidelines for those aged 70 to 79 and 80 years and over, which are already higher than the normal guidelines, increased by one third in 1999. The second stage of this process was implemented on 1 March 2000 and the third stage will be implemented in March 2001. In addition, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness refers to the fact that health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of <Col N="420" /> the medical card scheme and will consult with the social partners by the end of 2000.</P>

The information requested in the Deputy's question is not routinely gathered by my Department. I have requested the health boards to provide this information and will communicate with the Deputy on receipt of same.</P>
      <P>The recruitment of allied health professional staff generally is presenting problems throughout the health board regions and it is clear that the demand for the three therapy grades, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy needs to be reviewed. Following a Labour Court recommendation in 1997, an expert group was established to examine and report on various issues relating to the allied health professional grades, including occupational therapists. One of the issues examined by this group is the problems which arise in relation to the recruitment and the retention of various grades. The expert group submitted its final report in April 2000 and I am implementing in full the recommendations of this report at a cost of £10 million. Among its recommendations was the urgent commissioning of a work force planning study for the three therapy grades, that is, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy. The terms of reference for the work force planning study for the three therapy professions have been agreed and the study commissioned. This study will report by the end of this year. In the context of this report, a large expansion in the area of training for these therapists, in both the numbers of graduates produced and the number of training colleges established will be examined in partnership with the education authorities.</P>
      <P>I am also very pleased to announce that, in co-operation with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, I have secured a total of 52 extra places for the training of physiotherapists, five additional places for the training of occupational therapists and three in the area of speech and language therapy, all available from October 2000.</P>

    <P>The Higher Education Authority is also establishing a group comprised of representatives from each of the three physiotherapy schools to investigate the establishment of a fast-track physiotherapy programme to begin in each school from October 2001.

The possibility of establishing a similar course for occu<Col N="422" /> pational therapy and speech and language therapy will also be investigated.</P>

      <P>A common list of reimbursable items was introduced for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme to ensure equity in relation to the products reimbursed by the State under both schemes. The list of reimbursable food items to which persons registered under the drug payment scheme are entitled is in line with those items available to medical cardholders. While the range of such items available under State reimbursement schemes provides a reasonable choice of gluten free foods, my Department is currently reviewing the list of gluten free products with a view to making some additional products available under the common reimbursable list. I expect that this review will be completed shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children on health and smoking was given careful and detailed consideration by the Tobacco Free Policy Group before finalising its own report to me. I launched that report titled, Towards a Tobacco Free Society, on 7 March this year. I supported the request from the health committee for powers of compellability to summon documents and witnesses for an inquiry into the tobacco industry.</P>
      <P>I have already taken significant steps in advancing a national anti-smoking strategy with a view to achieving a tobacco free society. Earlier this year I advised the tobacco industry that from July no further expenditure on tobacco advertising other than limited retail and trade advertising is being allowed. Banning tobacco advertising has the effect of reducing the numbers of people, particularly young people, taking up smoking.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year the Office of Tobacco Control was established and a board of management appointed. A chief executive officer and support staff have been appointed and the office is operational. The role of the office is to ensure that the policy incorporated in the report, Towards a Tobacco Free Society, is implemented. Among its functions will be co-ordinating the implementation of tobacco controls by health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Bill is currently before the Dáil which will raise the age limit for the sale of tobacco products to 18 years instead of 16 years and substantially increase the fines on those convicted of selling <Col N="426" /> tobacco to underage persons. Price is also a significant factor in young people taking up smoking. In last year's budget the price of twenty cigarettes was increased by 50p, the single highest increase in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>On 10 October I launched a new national multi-media anti-smoking campaign aimed at encouraging young girls to quit smoking and indeed not even to start. The drive against smoking is the largest individual focus of health campaigns undertaken by my Department.</P>
    <P>Furthermore a comprehensive tobacco Bill is being prepared in my Department which will,<i> inter alia</i>, give effect to the proposals in the policy document, Towards a Tobacco Free Society.</P>

      <P>The health promotion unit of my Department supports an extensive range of anti-smoking initiatives. The most recent anti-smoking campaign, Break the Habit for Good, emphasises the positive effects which quitting smoking can have on the individual. This campaign was developed in conjunction with the Irish Cancer Society and the health boards.</P>
      <P>An offshoot of this campaign has been developed to target young female teenagers. The simple message of this campaign is that smokers are less attractive and it uses a range of anti-cosmetics presented by a character called NICO who highlights the unappealing aspects of smoking. The unit has also co-ordinated two school programmes which seek to prevent young people taking up smoking in the first instance. The Smoking Reduction Action Programme is a peer led anti-smoking programme for schools which was developed by my Department in conjunction with the Irish Cancer Society, the National Youth Federation and with support from the Department of Education and Science. The smokebusters project, which is aimed at primary school children aged between seven and eleven years in an urban environment was developed by the Irish Cancer Society, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science and the then Eastern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Action against smoking also continues at health board level and in the voluntary sector. The health promotion unit, in association with voluntary agencies active in this area continue to produce a range of materials including leaflets and posters containing information on smoking and encouraging smokers to quit. The Change of Heart handbook which has been delivered to every home in the country in the past few weeks as part of the heart health campaign also offers <Col N="427" /> encouragement and support to those wanting to quit smoking .</P>

      <P>The long-term illness scheme entitles persons to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a specific schedule of illnesses. The illnesses covered by this scheme are: &ndash; mental handicap, mental illness for persons under 16 years only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukaemia.</P>
      <P>Domiciliary care allowance is paid by health boards in respect of children with a disability aged between six months and 16 years who live at home and who require care and attention considerably in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age. Many of the illnesses for which a domiciliary care allowance is in payment would also be covered by the long-term illness scheme.</P>
      <P>People who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the chief executive officer has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. Even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 296 and 298 together.</P>
      <P>Domiciliary care allowance was introduced by way of Circular No. 24/73 dated 23 September 1973 and is administered by health boards on my behalf. DCA is paid in respect of eligible children under 16 years who are severely physically or mentally disabled and who require constant care and supervision at home substantially greater than that which would normally be required by a child of the same age.</P>
      <P>As the allowance is paid in recognition of the additional care and supervision required by children who are severely physically or mentally disabled, it is not proposed to introduce a graded system of payments at this time.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's question about the payment of a full DCA in respect of each eligible child in a family, I should point out that although Circular No. 24/73 did not make provision for the payment of a full DCA in respect of each eligible child, this was subsequently amended. Circular No. 8/78 dated 19 April 1978 stated that &ldquo;the full allowance will, from 1 April 1978, be payable in respect of each eligible child irrespective of the number of eligible children in the family&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Officials from my Department have contacted all the health boards regarding this matter and have been assured that this amendment is being applied. If the Deputy is aware of an incident where the full DCA is not being paid, perhaps he would contact me and I will ask the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to investigate the case.</P>

      <P>I have no immediate plans at present to formally investigate the possibility of introducing a direct payment scheme for persons with an intellectual or other disability which would enable them to purchase services. As part of the ongoing development of both policy and services in this area, my Department monitors, through national and international contacts, changes in the models of both service delivery and funding mechanisms <Col N="429" /> which are in use in other countries. Self determination or individualised funding is one of those funding mechanisms.

The health boards are responsible for paying the respite care grant in cases where a person is in receipt of domiciliary care allowance only. The health board respite care grant is aligned with the criteria used by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs which allows for one respite care grant per carer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. The guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income <Col N="430" /> exceeds the guidelines a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    <P>Persons aged 16 to 25, including students, who are dependants of a person who is not a medical cardholder are not normally entitled to a medical card. Students who are financially independent are entitled to apply for a medical card in their own right and are assessed on the same income criteria as all other applicants. The decision on whether or not a person is regarded as a dependant or as being financially independent is made by the chief executive officer of the health board on the basis of the circumstances in each individual case.</P>
    <P>It is open to all persons, be they parents or students, to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness refers to the fact that health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme and will consult with the social partners by the end of 2000. Particular emphasis will be placed on the needs of families with children and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the cost of providing residential or respite care will vary from case to case, depending on the individual needs of the persons availing of the service. My Department reviews the average cost of providing these services on an annual basis, using the costs associated with the previous year's actual developments as a guide. In 2000, the average cost for both residential and respite places was £27,000 per place. My Department is currently reviewing the average costs which would be associated with any proposed developments in 2001 as part of the estimate and budgetary process which is currently under way. One of the issues which will be considered is the fact that because a respite service <Col N="432" /> may have to cater for a wide variety of clients with different levels of dependency, there may be additional costs associated with the provision of these services.</P>

    <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority is aware of seven children awaiting full assessment for more than three months in the east coast area health board, three for sexual abuse and four for neglect. All these children have received an initial assessment and found not to be at risk. There are no children awaiting full assessment for a period of more than three months in the northern area health board. The authority has informed me that the south-western area health board was not in a position to provide a response to this question due to lack of relevant computerised information systems within the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in March 1997 the then Minister announced the introduction of a major action plan to implement the proposals contained in the national cancer strategy. Included in the plan were proposals for the introduction on a phased basis of a national breast screening programme. Phase I will cover the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the North-Eastern Health Board and Midland Health Board areas and will target 136,000 women in the age cohort 50 to 64, which represents approximately 50% of the national target population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="435" /> The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process rather than the costs involved and my Department's key objective is to ensure that the Irish programme meets the necessary quality assurance criteria. It is for this reason that the Irish national breast screening programme must be driven by international quality assurance standards and best practice.</P>
    <P>Specifically the phasing will take account of the following critical success factors: the achievement of acceptable compliance levels among the target population; on-going evaluation of the programme from a quality assurance perspective; and availability of the necessary clinical expertise to conduct the programme.</P>
    <P>The service is being delivered by two central units, the Eccles unit on the Mater hospital campus and the Merrion unit on St. Vincent's hospital campus, with outreach to the community by means of three mobile units. The Eccles unit is now fully commissioned and screening commenced there in February 2000. Limited screening is also in progress in St. Vincent's hospital pending the construction of the new Merrion unit. In addition, the first mobile screening commenced on 21 August 2000 in Longford.</P>
    <P>Decisions in relation to subsequent phases of the programme will be guided by the experience gained from putting phase I of the programme in place. Phase II will involve the extension of the programme to the rest of the country. The steering committee has recommended that phase II of the programme should follow phase I as soon as is practicable.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the importance of early access to symptomatic mammography services and of the provision of an equivalent standard of excellence in both symptomatic and screening mammography services. At my request, a review of the symptomatic breast cancer services has been undertaken by the National Cancer Forum. I have received this report and it is currently under consideration.</P>

      <P>This initiative will come into operation next year and will continue until at least the year 2005 when it will be reviewed in the light of developments in pre-registration nursing education. Nurses and midwives who commence the courses covered by the initiative in the academic year 2000-01 will qualify for a refund of their fees in 2001 provided they sign a written undertaking, before they commence the course, to continue working in the public health service for the required period after the completion of the course. Courses covered by the fees initiative include specified access courses and courses undertaken on a distance education basis, as well as certain health service management courses. The purpose of this initiative, which has been warmly welcomed by the nursing unions, is to ensure equity in the provision of financial support to nurses and midwives undertaking part-time degree courses through the introduction of uniform criteria.</P>

One of the issues examined by this group is the problems which arise in relation to the recruitment and the retention of various grades. The expert group submitted its final report in April 2000 and I am implementing in full the recommendations of this report at a cost of £10 million. Among its recommendations was the urgent commissioning of a workforce planning study for the three therapy grades, that is occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy. The terms of reference for the workforce planning study for the three therapy professions have been agreed and the study commissioned. This study will report by the end of this year. In the context of this report, a large expansion in the area of training for these therapists, in both the numbers of graduates produced and the number of training colleges established, will be examined in partnership with the education authorities.</P>

      <P>The Higher Education Authority is also establishing a group comprised of representatives from each of the three physiotherapy schools to investigate the establishment of a fast-track physiotherapy programme to begin in each school from October 2001. The first graduates from these programmes should be available in 2003. The possibility of establishing a similar course for occupational therapy and speech and language therapy will also be investigated.</P>

      <P>I understand from the North Eastern Health Board that it and the Cavan hospital management have extended the kidney dialysis service in recent weeks by taking on three extra patients. A further four patients are due to be transferred for dialysis to Cavan within the next three weeks. The board hopes to be in a position to have provision for a further 18 patients in 2001 which will significantly clear the waiting list for dialysis services in Cavan-Monaghan and the surrounding area.</P>

A Database Development Committee was established in December 1998 to prepare detailed proposals for the development of the national database and recommendations for the content of the regional datasets on the specialised health and personal social service needs of persons with physical and sensory disabilities. To date, the committee has developed the dataset for both the regional and national databases and phase 1 sites have been selected in four health board areas, including Galway city in the Western Health Board area, to test the dataset and the procedures for collecting the data. Phase 1 implementation will be completed in April 2001 and will enable the Database Development Committee finalise its recommendations for the establishment of the national database for physical and sensory disability services.</P>

      <P>The essential repairs grants are available from local authorities for necessary works to dwellings that have deteriorated to such an extent that they cannot be made fit for human habitation in all respects at a reasonable cost. The grant is usually confined to the carrying out of limited repair works for elderly persons to prolong the life of the dwelling so as to avoid the possibility of having to move to a different area or to be rehoused by the local authority. The full cost of the works is met by the relevant local authority and then recouped by them from my Department. The maximum amount which may be recouped is £4,000 or two thirds of the approved cost, whichever is the lesser.</P>
      <P>The conservation grant scheme is operated by the local authorities. The purpose of the scheme is to assist the owner or occupier of a protected structure to undertake necessary works to secure the conservation of the structure or part of the structure. The scheme is not intended to assist in carrying out routine maintenance, alterations or improvements. The standard grant is 50% of the approved costs of the works up to a maximum of £10,000. A local authority may, at its discretion, vary this amount downwards or, in exceptional circumstances, upwards, subject to a maximum allowable grant of 75% of the cost of the approved works or £20,000, whichever is the lesser.</P>
      <P>While the schemes referred to above are not mutually exclusive, it is unlikely that a person who qualifies for the essential repairs grant would be in a position to meet the matching financial requirement of the protected structure scheme.</P>

The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the water services investment programme 2000-02 announced in July. Given the priority rating afforded to the scheme by the council, the level of competing demand and the funding available, it was not possible to include it in the programme at that time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Very significant additional resources have been allocated to the driving test service which now numbers 107 testers compared to 66 in 1998.

Additional testers are also being recruited in light of the increased demand for tests.</P>
    <P>I expect that we will reach our customer service target of ten weeks waiting period countrywide by July to September 2001. The waiting time in the Dundalk centre will reach ten weeks within a shorter period of time.</P>

      <P>An analysis of the involvement of provisional driving licence holders in road accidents has been carried out by the National Roads Authority &ndash; NRA &ndash; in the report Young Driver Accidents 1997, a copy of which is in the Oireachtas Library. That analysis acknowledges the statistical limitations of the sample involved and consequently of its findings.</P>
      <P>According to the NRA report of the road accidents in 1997 where licence information was provided, 38% of young car drivers aged 17 to 24 years injured were reported as holding a provisional licence, compared to 9% of older car drivers. The corresponding figures for young and older motorcyclists were 69% and 36%, respectively. Changes have subsequently been made to the licensing regime for novice motorcyclists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the statistical limitations involved, the NRA report also estimates that drivers with pro<Col N="445" /> visional licences are considered to be to a large extent responsible for road accidents in which they are involved to a higher degree than drivers of corresponding age and gender who have full licences. The extent of this greater responsibility ranges from +5% to +11%, depending on age and or gender.</P>

      <P>My Department, in partnership with local authorities and bodies under its aegis, is committed to the use of information and communication technology &ndash; ICT &ndash; to provide enhanced and more cost effective delivery of services. Action on these fronts will promote improved awareness of the benefits of ICT generally as a by-product of the introduction and expansion of various ICT programmes.</P>
      <P>More specifically, my Department, in conjunction with the Information Society Commission, provided grant aid of over £1.5 million for the installation of 783 Internet PCs for public access in 277 public libraries in 1999. A further £800,000 has been allocated this year. An Chomhairle Leabharlanna, funded with an Information Society grant of £70,000, has recently recruited six trainers to provide training to library authority staff across the country. The staff will then be in a position to provide assistance to members of the public in the use of Internet PCs.</P>
      <P>I have also recently launched a pilot scheme in six public libraries to provide optical scanners for the visually impaired. Following the assessment of this scheme, I expect that 125 optical scanners will be installed in public libraries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of measures have been taken to ensure an increase in the availability of professional planners in the planning system. My Department has written to planning authorities on a number of occasions asking that they consider the adequacy of their professional-technical and administrative-clerical staffing in order to ensure that the planning system does not cause bottlenecks in meeting demand and delivers the best possible service to the customer. While my Department has approved requests from planning authorities for sanction for additional professional planner posts, I am aware that some authorities have experienced difficulties in recruiting to fill these additional posts. An additional 64 planners were employed by the local authorities between March and July of this year.</P>
      <P>In June of this year, I made the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 2000, which increased the size of exempted domestic extensions from 23 sq. m. to 40 sq. m. This was designed to remove about 30% of planning applications for such extensions from the planning system in major urban areas, to allow planners to concentrate on forward planning issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been in contact with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, and the third level education sector with a view to identifying ways of producing more planners through the education system. As a result, from September of this year new and expanded courses in University <Col N="452" /> College Dublin and Dublin Institute of Technology Bolton Street will treble the output of graduate planners in two years time to approximately 75 planners graduating per annum. Further additional courses are also under consideration.</P>
    <P>In the interim, to meet the short-term demand, the possibility of employing planners from abroad on fixed term contracts is being examined. My Department will also pursue with the local authorities and the local Government Computer Services Board the use of information technology to streamline planning procedures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 347 and 348 together.</P>
      <P>In pursuance of the decision announced in the Government's Action on Housing on the principle of designating strategic development zones where the delivery of significant numbers of houses was to be advanced, my Department wrote on 12 July to the authorities in the area covered by the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, the other county boroughs and their surrounding counties and to Louth and Westmeath County Councils seeking proposals from them for suitable large scale residential development sites that could be considered for designation under part IX of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, as strategic development zones for residential development. Proposals were received from Cork, Fingal, Louth, Meath, South Dublin, Westmeath and Wicklow County Councils and Dublin and Waterford Corporations seeking the designation of a total 25 sites as strategic development zones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An evaluation of the 25 sites submitted is being finalised having regard to the following criteria: the number and phasing of the housing units which would be delivered by the inclusion of the lands within a strategic development zone; the potential for comprehensive planning offered by the nature and scale of the land and its ownership structure; the existence of water and sewerage services or the likelihood of the provision of such <Col N="453" /> services in the short-term; the location of lands proximate to existing or proposed public transport corridors; and the need to deliver a high quality of design and layout. I will shortly be inviting a number of these authorities to give more detailed consideration to selected sites. It is my intention that following this more detailed analysis and the commencement of part IX of the Act in November, that a number of these sites will be designated by Government order in December. Further sites may be designated by the Government at a later date, either for residential development or for other types of development which are of economic or social importance to the State.</P>
    <P>Arrangements to give effect to the Action on Housing proposal for the introduction of a land retention levy of £3,000 per potential site unit per annum for non-development of sites within the designated strategic development zones as a <i>quid pro quo</i> for fast tracking planning and infrastructure provision are under consideration in my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Residential Density issued in September 1999. The guidelines set out in a detailed manner the locations appropriate for higher residential densities, the range of densities appropriate to various locations and the need to achieve a high quality of residential environment. Planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála were advised at the time that the guidelines are policies to which planning authorities under section 7(1) of the Local Government Act, 1991, and An Bord Pleanála under section 5 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976, are obliged to have regard.</P>
      <P>In line with a commitment made in Action on Housing, published in June 2000, my Department commenced a review of the level of compliance by planning authorities with the recommendations and policies set out in the guidelines. To date, the review shows that of the 38 larger planning authorities, that is, county councils and county borough corporations, some 32 have either incorporated the provisions of the guidelines into their development plans or are in the process of doing so, that is, have prepared draft variations to their development plans which have not yet been adopted. My Department is in correspondence with the further six larger authorities to establish their plans for implementation of the residential density guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="454" /> With regard to the 50 smaller planning authorities, that is, urban district councils and borough corporations, 41 have confirmed to my Department that they either have reviewed or are in the process of reviewing their development plans to ensure full compliance with the provisions of the guidelines. The remaining nine authorities have not yet submitted confirmation of their intention to ensure that their development plans comply with the provisions of the guidelines.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that 73 of the 88 planning authorities have confirmed to my Department that they have implemented or are in the process of implementing the provisions of the guidelines in their development plans and my Department will continue to monitor the situation to ensure that effect is given to the guidelines in the development control process. It is essential that the quality safeguards are applied in high density schemes to ensure a high quality living environment.</P>

      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards. The scheme is designed to assist certain recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear. Certain people on low incomes who are in receipt of family income supplement may also qualify for assistance.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme, an allowance of £63 is payable in respect of qualified children aged two to 11 years while £78 is payable in respect of qualified children aged 12 to 22 years. These current rates represent a £20 increase on the rates which applied last year.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting that the clothing and footwear component of the consumer price index published by the Central Statistics Office has been falling over the past number of years. For example, the three monthly period up to August 2000 saw a decline of 5.4%, while prices declined by a cumulative 18.4% over the ten years from June 1990 to June 2000.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I am aware of the difficulties faced by low income households when faced with providing clothing and footwear for children at back to school time in September each year. I am also very conscious of the importance of supporting low income families so that their children can participate fully in the education system to the maximum extent possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have established a working group to undertake a review of the back to school clothing and <Col N="455" /> footwear scheme as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The review is examining all aspects of the scheme including the rates of payment as well the income limits, the means test and other issues. Any changes recommended in the course of the review of the scheme will be considered in the context of the budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 351, 362, 363, 364 and 365 together.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to carers on low incomes who look after people, including children, who need full-time care and attention.</P>
      <P>Based on the research carried out in the review of the carer's allowance, which was published in October 1998, the current number of full-time carers is estimated to be around 50,000 people, covering carers of older people and adults and children with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are currently 16,137 carers in receipt of <Col N="456" /> carer's allowance. These figures show that 32% of full-time carers are in receipt of a carer's allowance payment which is an increase of 75% in the number of carers in receipt of the allowance since this Government took office. This large increase is reflected in the expenditure on carer's allowance, which was £36.5 million in 1997 and is projected to be £78.3 million this year, representing an increase of 115%.</P>
    <P>As with all other social assistance schemes, a means test in which the income of both the applicant and his-her partner is assessable is applied to the carer's allowance to ensure that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need. The means test has been eased significantly in the past few years, most notably with the introduction of disregards of income from employment and other sources. The effect of these changes mean that a couple with two children could have a joint annual income of £9,152 and qualify for the maximum carer's allowance while a couple with up to £19,500 could still qualify for a minimum carer's allowance, and also receive an annual respite care grant and the free schemes.</P>
    <P>The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one social welfare payment is payable to an individual. The review of the carer's allowance examined the question of paying the carer's allowance in conjunction with another social welfare payment. It noted that the allowance is an income support payment and not a payment for caring. As indicated, the practice of paying only one allowance is a feature, with very few exceptions, of all social welfare payments and is designed to ensure that limited resources are not used to make two income support payments to any one individual. The review concluded that this practice should continue. Of course a person qualifying for two social welfare payments will always receive the higher payment to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>The review proposed the introduction of a non-means tested continual care payment to recognise carers providing the highest levels of care and to promote care in the community. It envisaged that this payment would be made, irrespective of income or social welfare entitlement, to carers caring for those who are in the highest category of dependency.</P>
    <P>In order to differentiate between the levels of care and care needs, the review considered that a needs assessment encompassing both the needs of the care recipient and the carer should be introduced, and that the continual care payment could be introduced following the introduction of such an assessment. It was considered that a needs assessment would separate care needs from income support needs and could be used by all State organisations which provide reliefs or grants to those in need of care.</P>
    <P>Establishing a pilot system of needs assessment for carers and people needing care was identified as a priority in the Government's review of its action programme. This area is the responsibility <Col N="457" /> of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Chil dren. I understand that the Western Health Board agreed to undertake this pilot project in its area and that the results of this study are being considered by the working group.</P>
    <P>The question of further improvements to the carer's allowance and for carers generally will be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of our key priorities in the care area, as set out in the review of our action programme.</P>

      <P>In the last two budgets measures have been introduced to ease the position of two particular groups of people who could not qualify for an old age contributory pension under the standard qualifying conditions. These included firstly a limited number of self-employed people who were already over 56 years of age when compulsory social insurance was introduced for the self-employed in 1988, and secondly people with appropriate contributions paid prior to 1953 who cannot satisfy the normal yearly average test. In both cases 260 paid contributions at the appropriate rate are required to qualify for a pension of 50% of the maximum personal rate. Any further move in this regard must be viewed in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 353, 356 and 359 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The free schemes, including the free electricity-gas allowance, free telephone rental allowance and free television licence schemes, are generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 <Col N="458" /> years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who pass a means test. They are also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
    <P>Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of free schemes retain that entitlement in order to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlement following the death of a spouse.</P>
    <P>The review of the free schemes, which was published by the policy institute, Trinity College Dublin in April this year, noted that the free schemes share a common set of objectives in the area of social inclusion. These are defined as: to provide assistance to those living alone by targeting them with specific benefits providing both income and social inclusion gains; to support older people and people with disabilities in their wish to remain in the community as opposed to institutional care; and to support Government policy which seeks to acknowledge the value of older people in society.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the free telephone rental allowance scheme is to provide an element of protection and security in their homes for older people and people with disabilities who are either living alone or with people who would be unable to summon help in an emergency. A secondary objective of the scheme is to encourage social contact and to assist in the prevention of social isolation for those living alone. Extending the free telephone rental allowance to those who reside in nursing homes would not be in keeping with the objectives outlined above.</P>
    <P>The free travel scheme is available to people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. This enables them to travel free on the main public and private transport services. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by semi-State companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as services provided by some 75 private transport operators.</P>
    <P>In regard to travel for people requiring medical treatment, it should be noted that under the provisions of the Health Acts, a health board may make arrangements for the conveyance of patients to and from hospitals.</P>
    <P>The review of the free schemes examined the many demands to extend the free schemes to other groups, including widows and widowers using social inclusion objectives as the criteria for decision. It considered that the schemes as currently constituted provide a basic package that ensures a limited standard of comfort or well-being to a particular targeted group, that is based on age or disability. Widow/ers under age 66 years may experience social exclusion but they are not groups in need of community care support nor do they experience the same physical risks of isolation as older people and people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The review noted that, where payment levels are adequate, any extension of the free schemes <Col N="459" /> must be based solely on increased social benefits that are over and above those which can be purchased by increased income. Accordingly, the review concluded that the schemes should not be extended further to additional groups of people or to include other types of schemes. Overall the proposals in the review are being examined in the context of future budgets and available resources.</P>

      <P>The survivor's contributory pension, now widow/ers contributory pension, was introduced in 1994. This allowed widowers, with or without dependent children, to qualify for a contributory pension on the death of their spouse.</P>
      <P>The weekly rate of child dependent allowance payable with widow/er's contributory pension has been set at £17.00 since 1994. Child dependant allowances on schemes generally have not been increased in recent years because the policy direction being followed has been to concentrate resources for child income support on increasing child benefit. Unlike CDAs, CB does not contribute to poverty traps or work disincentives as it is a universal payment which is not subject to a means test. This policy has been in place since 1994. Over that period, the combined CB-CDA payment has increased, on average, by more than double the rate of inflation. Future approaches to child income support are a matter for budgetary consideration.</P>

      <P>The treatment benefit scheme operated by my Department provides a range of benefits in the areas of dental, optical and aural treatment for qualified PRSI contributors and their dependent spouses. The PRSI contribution conditions relating to entitlement to dental as well as the other treatment benefits vary <Col N="460" /> depending on the age of the insured person. Persons must also have been insurably employed and paid appropriate rates of PRSI for a certain length of time.</P>
      <P>Persons aged under 21 years of age must have at least 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work in order to qualify while persons aged from 21 to 24 years of age must have at least 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks paid or credited in the relevant tax year of which a minimum of 13 weeks must be paid contributions. In the case of persons aged from 25 to 65 years of age the requirement is that they have at least 260 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year of which a minimum of 13 weeks must be paid contributions.</P>
      <P>The contribution conditions for treatment benefit are generally in line with those applying to other contributory benefit schemes. These conditions are necessary to ensure the continuing viability of the scheme while directing limited resources towards those in greatest need. They also ensure a realistic relationship between entitlement to benefit and a continuing or recent attachment to the workforce through an active PRSI contribution record. The lower contribution requirement for a person under 25 is in recognition of the fact that a younger person may have entered insurable employment relatively recently and would have difficulty meeting the higher condition.</P>
      <P>Any changes in the insurance conditions for receipt of treatment benefits would have financial implications and is a matter for consideration within the constraints of budgetary policy and the best targeting of available resources. At present, while I have no specific proposals, for changing the qualifying conditions or entitlements under the dental or other areas of the treatment benefit scheme the operation of the scheme is subject to ongoing monitoring by my Department.</P>

      <P>While promotion of information technology is not the main focus of these schemes and programmes, groups may seek support for IT training and provision of IT equipment to use, as one of the many approaches, in addressing such exclusion and disadvantage.</P>
      <P>In assessing such applications my Department must establish the extent to which the applicant groups, and the particular project for which funding is sought, addresses such poverty and exclusion. In allocating funding it is also necessary to take account of the overall demands under the schemes and the level of funding available to meet these demands. In addition, grant support is also available to voluntary organisations providing marriage, child and bereavement counselling services.</P>
      <P>Funding is also provided by my Department, £5.2 million this year, to the new information organisation, Comhairle, which was established earlier this year. Comhairle will combine the functions of the former National Social Service Board with relevant functions of the former National Rehabilitation Board to form a new mainstream organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The widow/er's pension schemes recognise the particular difficulties that arise for people following the death of a spouse.</P>
      <P>The qualifying conditions for the widow/er's contributory pension are already very flexible and make it relatively easy for a widow/er to qualify for a payment. Someone with insufficient social insurance contributions to qualify for the contributory scheme may be eligible for a widow/er's non-contributory pension or the one-parent family payment if they have dependent children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Title to these pensions also gives access to the free schemes, where the person is over 66 years of age. In this context, special measures are in place to ensure that households do not suffer the loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse. Widows/widowers aged from 60 to 65 <Col N="462" /> whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement.</P>
    <P>In Budget 2000 the free schemes were extended to all persons aged over 75 years of age regardless of income and household composition. I have also made changes to the arrangements which are in place to provide support to widows and widowers in the immediate aftermath of a bereavement. These include an enhanced bereavement grant, the introduction of the widowed parent grant for those with dependent children and improvements to the six weeks after death payment which is made when the deceased was a social welfare recipient.</P>
    <P>The question of making further improvements in the supports available for widows and widowers is a matter for budgetary consideration.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for carer's allowance on 22 September 2000.</P>
      <P>Carer's allowance is a social assistance payment, made to persons who are providing full time care and attention to elderly people or to people with disabilities and whose income falls below certain limits. The principal conditions for receipt of the allowance are that full-time care and attention is required and being provided and that the means test is satisfied.</P>
      <P>On receipt of an application for carer's allowance, a comprehensive medical report form must be completed in respect of the person being cared for. This report is completed by the person's own doctor and is subsequently examined by one of the Department's medical assessors who advises if the medical criteria for the receipt of carer's allowance are satisfied. This form has issued to the person concerned for completion.</P>
      <P>In addition, her case has also been referred to an investigation officer of my Department for a means assessment. On receipt of the investigation officer's and the medical assessor's reports, the claim will be immediately considered further.</P>

      <P>To sign the live register for unemployment purposes a person must be unemployed, capable of, available for and genuinely seeking work. In determining whether the conditions are fulfilled deciding officers take account, <i>inter alia,</i> of the person's efforts to find employment and the circumstances in the employment market. I wish to emphasise that there has not been any change this year in the rules in this regard.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 30 June 2000. Following an examination of her case her claim was disallowed on the grounds that she failed to satisfy the deciding officer that she was genuinely seeking work.</P>
      <P>On receipt of the disallowance notice the person concerned submitted an appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office and the decision was upheld. An appeals officer's decision is final in the absence of new facts or fresh evidence.</P>
      <P>Under social welfare legislation decisions in regard to claims are made by deciding officers and appeals officers, who are statutorily appointed, and I have no role in relation to the making of such decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received a report from the heritage service of my Department &ndash; Dúchas &ndash; on the development of integrated constructed wetlands undertaken by Kerry County Council in Killarney National Park as environmental enhancement works.</P>
      <P>An integrated constructed wetland, ICW, is a method of treating waste by natural biological processes. Ponds are constructed and planted with appropriate plants which naturally remove excess nutrients from waste water, such as in this case, phosphates. They are an environmentally sustainable waste management solution, which works in harmony with natural ecological processes. They also act as a safety buffer if, for any reason, the treatment plant should not work properly.</P>
      <P>The treated waste water from the Killarney town sewage treatment plant is discharged into Lough Leane in compliance with the appropriate legislation. Discharges are already at standards of best practice having already had tertiary treatment but in order to improve further the quality of the treated waste water and thus lake water quality Kerry County Council officials decided to create ICW which will further clean the waste before discharge into the lakes. In addition to the immediate benefits the constructed wetland will have for the natural heritage within Killarney National Park, it will also serve as an example of best practice in waste water management for landowners and local authorities elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The ICW is within a candidate Special Area of Conservation &ndash; cSAC. When Dúchas was consulted, an assessment was carried out by a Departmental official who is a qualified ecologist. He was satisfied that the project would have a positive impact and would have no significant adverse impact on the cSAC.</P>
      <P>When questions were raised with Kerry County Council about the necessity to secure formal planing permission for this project, the council, which had up to then been of the opinion that formal planning approval was not required because of the nature and scope of the works involved, decided to reconsider its position on this and to suspend operations at the ICW.</P>
      <P>My officials are making themselves available to meet interested parties to discuss the issue. One group has sought a meeting and a date has been proposed.</P>

    <P>*Applications lodged with the embassies abroad come under the aegis of the Department of Foreign Affairs. The initial processing takes place in the embassies and the applications are finalised by the Department of Foreign Affairs. These applications are sent to my Department only when they are fully processed. The certificates of citizenship are issued by my Department and passed to the Department of Foreign Affairs for distribution to the various embassies around the world.</P>
    <P>**The figures shown for declarations accepted and refused in a given calendar year, relate to some cases received prior to the year in question. Refusals in respect of declarations made abroad are dealt with by the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>In relation to refusals, the Deputies should note that even in cases where an application has been unsuccessful the applicant can re-apply if circumstances change and a full re-examination of that fresh application is undertaken.</P>
    <P>As part of the recent package of measures announced by the Government in relation to increased resources for the immigration and asylum areas, significant additional staffing resources are being allocated to the immigration and citizenship division of my Department with a view, <i>inter alia,</i> to reducing the time involved in processing such applications and improving the service provided. These resources will impact considerably on the present delays.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in December 1998, the Government approved my proposals to establish a working group to undertake a comprehensive review of the coroner service, including the 1962 Coroners Act. I understand that the group has finalised its deliberations and I expect to have its final report shortly.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the report of the group will, on its receipt, be examined by Government as quickly as possible. When I have particular legislative proposals, I will bring them to the Government for approval and have them published in the normal way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate my Department and its agencies do not provide direct funding for schemes or provide support to schools, businesses, community groups or individuals to promote information technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am responsible for a budget of £23.2 million for an equality for women measure under the regional operational programmes of <Col N="471" /> the national development plan. This funding relates to the period 2000-6 and will support a broad range of initiatives designed to promote equality for women in the labour market, business and in decision making. The allocation to the Border, midland and western region is £6.12 million and £17.08 million to the Southern and Eastern region. I announced details of the measure on 5 October and invited project applications for a budget of IR£6 million for the period 2000-3. The closing date for receipt of applications is 5 January 2001. Project promoters can include community and voluntary groups, trade unions, employers, State bodies, women's organisations as well as commercial organisations. While the measure is not specifically intended to address use of technology, it is expected that a number of proposals designed to re-train and up-skill women may relate to the IT area.</P>
    <P>I can also inform the Deputy that, while the probation and welfare service has no direct role in promoting information technology, community groups funded by the probation and welfare service to support ex-offenders and those at risk of offending often include information technology familiarisation and training, where this is seen as addressing the needs of those involved.</P>
    <P>Similarly, some of the 39 Garda youth diversion projects funded by my Department and An Garda Síochána incorporate basic computer skills training.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that many offenders have access to computer education and training as part of both the prisons education and prisons work training programmes.</P>

    <P>I am informed by the board that where waiting times, for whatever reasons, become excessive the position is examined by the board with a view to taking remedial action.</P>
    <P>In relation to continued client representation where a solicitor resigns from the Legal Aid Board, I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate that under section 30 of the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, responsibility for deciding how legal services should be provided is solely a matter for the Legal Aid Board. The Deputy will be aware that under section 31 (2) of the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, the board may nominate a member of its solicitor staff for the purpose of providing a person with legal aid or advice, or refer a person to the private practitioners' panel to select a solicitor therefrom. Accordingly, a client whose solicitor resigns from the board will continue to receive legal representation, provided either by another member of solicitor staff, nominated by the board, or by a private practitioner selected by the client from a panel set up by the board.</P>
    <P>I understand from the board that private practitioners are used in cases of geographical remoteness, conflict of interest cases and in cases where the exigencies of the law centre service so require.  </P>
    <P>As regards the recruitment of solicitors, the Deputy will be aware that there is a huge buoyancy in the Irish economy at present and employment opportunities for law graduates are now far more extensive than has hitherto been the case. In this context, the Legal Aid Board, in common with employers generally, has to compete for candidates in an increasingly competitive market in order to fill vacancies.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the board that negotiations in relation to a more competitive salary for its solicitors are now at an advanced stage. The board considers that the package on offer, which includes provisions for flexibility and change, will, if agreed, prove more attractive to the market in the filling of vacancies. The increased pay scales will, of course, also make a continued career with the board more attractive to existing solicitor staff.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="474" /> The Deputy will also be aware that, in order to combat the problems being experienced in relation to waiting times in law centres, I made additional resources available to the Legal Aid Board this year, when I increased the allocation of grant-in-aid to £12,899 million. This represents an increase of 8 per cent on the 1999 allocation.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I understand from the Legal Aid Board that a review of practices and procedures in law centres is being undertaken to seek to improve efficiency. The board considers that this review will lead to an increase in the throughput of cases and the provision of services to a greater number of persons.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the board that they are also reviewing the allocation of the additional staff resources I obtained for the board earlier this year and the respective needs of the different law centres will be considered so that the board can maximise the use of resources made available to it.</P>

      <P>Three Garda CCTV systems have been installed, to date, in the State &ndash; in Temple Bar, Dublin; in Dublin north central, which includes O'Connell Street and its adjoining areas, and in Tralee, County Kerry.</P>
      <P>The advisory committee established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate CCTV applications has received in excess of 40 applications for the installation of Garda CCTV systems. Six locations have been prioritised for the installation of such systems. These are, in alphabetical order: Bray, Cork, Dublin (south central), Dundalk, Finglas, and Limerick. The extension of the Garda CCTV system in Dublin (south central) which will include Grafton Street and its adjoining areas and the installation of a CCTV system in Cork City are the CCTV projects currently being undertaken. The order in which the remaining priority locations will be undertaken has not yet been decided &ndash; although it is intended to commence the installation of Garda CCTV systems in each of the prioritised locations as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Recently the Garda CCTV system in Dublin (north central) was increased from 38 to 42 cameras. The CCTV system in Dublin (south central), when complete, will result in the cameras in the original Temple Bar area being increased from nine to 24 cameras to cover Grafton Street and its adjoining areas.</P>
      <P>Some delays have been encountered in progressing various CCTV projects due, in part, to the fact that the demand from various communities for CCTV systems has been very significant. A shortage of technicians in the telecommunications section of the Garda Síochána has also impacted on the progress in implementing CCTV systems. Notwithstanding this, it also became evident that the existing approach to CCTV could not cope with the demand and a review of all aspects of CCTV was required. I therefore decided to initiate a review of CCTV and asked the Garda Commissioner to look at this whole area. The review is now complete and I expect to make a statement on CCTV in the near future.</P>
      <P>All applications for Garda CCTV systems must be prepared in co-operation with the local Garda district and divisional officers and receive their full support. Funding for Garda CCTV systems is normally provided jointly by local community interests and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It has been the experience of the Garda authorities that the cost of an efficient and effective CCTV system is, on average, £20,000 to £25,000 per camera. Provision is made in the Garda Vote for installing Garda CCTV systems. The allocation for this year is £700,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important to remember that Garda CCTV systems are an aid to existing Garda resources. As such, they must be viewed in the <Col N="476" /> context of overall policing operations and carefully planned and integrated into Garda operational procedures.</P>

      <P>I can confirm to the Deputy that a review of the criminal injuries compensation scheme is being undertaken by my Department at present. It is intended that the review will be a comprehensive one, taking into account all relevant questions and situations. Submissions for proposed changes to the scheme have been invited from relevant organisations, including Victim Support, and these submissions will receive consideration as part of the review. My Department is awaiting receipt of a small number of the submissions invited before being in a position to complete the review. I hope to receive a report on the matter shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out that, while the scheme is a non-statutory one, any proposals for changes to the scheme, which may be recommended as part <Col N="477" /> of the review, will require the approval of Government and the revised scheme will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

Two fees orders were subsequently introduced for the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds last February and May respectively. I have no plans at present for a further review. The Deputy may also be aware that under section 14 of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976 no Land Registry fees are payable on a transaction creating a joint tenancy between spouses in respect of a family home where the home was, immediately prior to such transaction, owned by either spouse or both spouses, otherwise than as joint tenants.</P>

I should add also that there has been a major increase in the level of dealings lodged with the registries over the last two/three years due in the main to the increased buoyancy in the property market during that period. In all cases where there is a particular urgency cases are prioritised and expedited. The use of modern technology is also being pursued in order to improve the standard and level of service to the users of Land Registry services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The law already contains a number of substantive measures to deal with drinking in public places.</P>
      <P>Under the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1998, it is an offence for any person under 18 years of age to consume alcohol in any place other than a private residence in which that person is present either as of right or by permission.</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, makes it an offence for any person to be present in a public place while intoxicated to such an extent as would give rise to a reasonable apprehension that he or she might be a danger to himself or herself or to any other person in the vicinity. Section 5 of the 1994 Act creates the offence of disorderly conduct in a public place and section 6 creates the offence of using or engaging in any threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour.</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the 1994 Act also empowers the gardaí to confiscate alcohol where it is suspected that an offence under that section is being committed or where it is suspected that an offence under sections 5 or 6 is being committed and the alcohol is relevant to those offences.</P>
      <P>Section 8 of the 1994 Act empowers the gardaí to &ldquo;move on&rdquo; persons who are acting in a manner contrary to the provisions of a number of sections including sections 4, 5 or 6 or who are loitering in a public place in circumstances which give rise to apprehension for the safety of persons or property or the maintenance of the public peace.</P>
      <P>While I have no plans for further legislative changes, I can say that the operation of the law in this area is being kept under review by my Department. I shall also, of course, take into account any recommendations that may be made on the subject matter by the Commission on Liquor Licensing that is very shortly to be established to review all aspects of the liquor licensing system.</P>

      <P>Under the culture, recreation and sports measure of the local infrastructure sub-programme of the Border, Midlands and Western Regional Operational Programme of the NDP, a sum of £26 million has been specifically allocated for the provision of community sporting and recreational facilities for 2000-6. These facilities will be located at gateway towns to be identified in the national spatial strategy currently being undertaken by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Once the gateway towns have been identified, proposals will be sought from local authorities, and where appropriate voluntary and community organisations, for the provision or upgrading of sport and recreational facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Work on the identification of regional gateways is scheduled for completion by mid-2001, when implementation of the measure can begin. The sports capital programme will continue to also provide funding for sporting facilities at national, regional and local level. This year the sport capital programme allocated some £36 million to nearly 700 local community based projects and to a number of national and regional projects throughout the country. This Government has increased the level of provision for sport in gen<Col N="482" /> eral from £13.5 million in 1997 to over £51 million for the year 2000.</P>

      <P>My Department and the agencies under its aegis are very conscious of the benefits of information technology and the agencies in particular have been actively promoting its benefits to the various sectors.</P>
      <P>In the tourism sector, Bord Fáilte is now in the process of finalising an extensive Internet strategy review, in conjunction with key industry representatives, with a view to maximising its web presence by moving to encourage and capture as many visitors as possible and assist the industry in converting enquiries ultimately into business transactions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Meanwhile, in March of this year, CERT announced its e-commerce initiative &ldquo;dot-cert&rdquo; which consists of an ongoing awareness campaign and a series of nation-wide workshops which focuses on helping Irish tourism businesses to exploit the marketing and cost effective potential <Col N="483" /> of e-commerce. One set of workshops focuses on demonstrating the advantages of the web and how to implement e-commerce principles for greater business efficiency while the second set of workshops focuses on exploiting the web in the best possible way, suitable to individual businesses. The initiative opened with a series of eight workshops attended by 120 participants. The autumn series of workshops has just commenced and these will be run throughout the country. It is anticipated that between 150 and 180 industry personnel will attend.</P>
    <P>In support of this initiative CERT has also developed its own &ldquo;dot-cert&rdquo; website that provides industry with user friendly material designed to raise awareness of the benefits of e-commerce and how to implement e-commerce in practice. Additional information on e-commerce best practice will be added to the site over the next 12-18 months. The site is currently under reconstruction and will be available shortly. As part of the awareness campaign over 5,000 establishments received a publicity leaflet introducing the &ldquo;dot-cert&rdquo; website and the training workshops.</P>
    <P>All training courses delivered by CERT include a module on new technology, the content of which is updated periodically to take account of the impact of changes at operational level within each area of the industry.</P>
    <P>The Irish Sports Council's scheme for funding national governing bodies of sport includes provision for incentives for investment in information technology hardware and software in the context of improving administrative efficiency for their respective organisations and members.</P>

Options for the continuation of funding of this project are currently being explored.

      <P>In relation to the application of fair and objective entrance criteria for entry to second level schools my Department has agreed with the three post-primary managerial associations that the selection of pupils for enrolment in second level schools should not be based on academic ability and selection on that basis, where used heretofore, must be discontinued; each school should disclose its enrolment policy and the criteria used in selecting pupils for enrolment to inform parents of the selection procedures and to allay fears of discrimination and the principle of the school working in and for the community it serves should be emphasised.</P>
      <P>On that basis, emphasis should be placed by post-primary schools on catering, in the first instance, for children from their own communities and catchment areas.</P>
      <P>Schools are advised to use some of the following selection criteria in determining how best to frame a selection policy to meet its individual needs: priority to pupils from national schools in the area; enrolment on a &ldquo;first come, first served&rdquo; basis; random selection on the basis of age of applicants; and priority to brothers and sisters of pupils already enrolled in the school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 410 and 415 together.</P>
      <P>At primary level, my Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. However, this scheme has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional per capita grants for primary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. Under this scheme qualifying schools receive grants of £40 per pupil &ndash; £20 per pupil in respect of each service &ndash; subject to a maximum of £20,000 and a maximum of £10,000 in respect of each service.</P>
      <P>These grants are paid as additions to the standard per capita grants. This scheme does not provide for the linking of the additional per capita grants to any particular pay scale. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are to be provided. Secretaries and caretakers employed by schools are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="488" /> I have increased the rates of grant by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil with effect from January this year. Furthermore, I also recently announced that, with effect from September of this year, I am extending the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less. Scoil Náisiúnta Bhríde, Ballyconneely is one of the schools which will benefit under this phase of the scheme.</P>
    <P>These improvements mean that, for the first time, all primary schools now qualify for an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999 has increased this year to approximately £12.2 million and will further increase in 2001 to approximately £16.8 million.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that I remain committed to further improvements in the scheme.</P>

      <Quest>if a system is in place to check the safety standards in operation on all buses used in the school transport system; if he has satisfied himself that all vehicles in the system meet the standard laid down by the Department; the way in which that standard is defined and policed; the number of accidents recorded in this regard; the way in which these are investigated; and the plans he has to modernise and review the operation of the fleet of vehicles.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Safety on school buses is of paramount importance to my Department and to Bus Éireann, who operate the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann vehicles are serviced every six weeks under specified maintenance procedures to ensure that the highest safety standards are achieved. Any faults coming to the notice of Bus Éireann's maintenance staff are dealt with immediately. A large proportion of the existing Bus Éireann school bus fleet was refurbished during summer 1999.</P>
      <P>All vehicles operating under the scheme are required to meet the statutory regulations as laid down by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and are subject to a roadworthiness test. Where vehicles have over eight adult seats and are more than one year old, they are required to pass that Department's annual roadworthiness test.</P>
      <P>Contractors employed by Bus Éireann to provide services under the school transport scheme must satisfy strict criteria and must hold a road passenger operator's licence. Vehicles nominated for use under the scheme must be suitable for the conveyance of school children and must have complete and current documentation in respect of both buses and drivers as required by law. This includes a PSV licence, certificate of roadworthiness, certificate of insurance and tax disc. Drivers must have a valid driving licence for the class of vehicle to be driven. The vehicles have to be kept and maintained in a safe and roadworthy condition and to comply in all respects with the Road Traffic Acts. Vehicles must be kept clean internally and externally to the satisfaction of Bus Éireann. Contractor's vehicles are subject to inspection/testing by Bus Éireann inspectors from time to time to ensure the safety of pupils travelling on buses.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann has a very good safety record in the operation of school transport and an ongoing commitment to highlight safety in this regard. Accidents are immediately investigated by Bus Éireann and, where appropriate, the Gárda Síochána. I should also mention that the age profile and quality of vehicle of the Bus Éireann school bus fleet is being significantly improved due to the ongoing programme of fleet replacement.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the condition of the school bus fleet continues to be of the utmost concern to my Department and to Bus Éireann.</P>

      <P>Architectural planning of the new vocational education committee college for the north side of Drogheda, County Louth continues. County Louth Vocational Education Committee recently submitted draft tender documents and specifications to my Department for approval. Officials will inform the school authority in due course if it is in order to proceed to tender.</P>
      <P>Delays in having the proposed project progressed to this stage were due largely to design issues. Attention to detail is critically important at the planning stages of any project to ensure value for money and to assist in keeping post contract variations to a minimum.</P>
      <P>Since the disclosure of the cost plan for the project could distort the tender process, I am not in a position to reveal the likely cost of this project at this stage. The contract period is expected to be 72 weeks.</P>

      <P>The operational arrangements relating to the assessment and certification of apprentices under the standards based apprenticeship system which was agreed by all relevant groups was set out in a letter from my Department to the various institutes of technology in December 1995. The arrangements clearly stated that assessment for phase 4 would consist of two occasions of testing and that a terminal examination would only apply <Col N="491" /> at the end of phase 6 of the apprenticeship system. This latter would be the only situation in which payment for an examination as part of the apprenticeship system would be made.</P>
      <P>In August 1999 it was brought to the attention of my Department that certain of the institutes of technology were conducting both occasions of phase 4 testing at the end of phase 4. My Department subsequently issued Circular Letter No 1T 9/99 on the assessment regulations governing phase 4 procedures reiterating the position as set out in 1995. All directors of Institutes of Technology and the president of Dublin Institute of Technology were directed to ensure that the sanctioned arrangements would be complied with.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding this direction, the Department has been advised that in latter months certain phase 4 assessment results have been withheld by staff in the institutes, who are TUI members, who are seeking examination payments in respect of this testing. Efforts to resolve the dispute are ongoing.</P>

        <i>Schools IT 2000 Project</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>All new recognised primary schools and all new second level schools recognised for grant purposes under the free education scheme are eli<Col N="493" /> gible for grant aid under the Technology Integration Initiative (TII) of Schools IT 2000 as follows:</P>
    <P>(f2&gt;a) Phase 1 Grants:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Ordinary Schools:</i> A basic grant of £2,000 plus £5 per pupil in ordinary classes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Special Schools:</i> A basic grant of £3,000 plus £20 per pupil.</P>
    <P>All new schools with one or more special classes are eligible for an additional grant of £1,500 plus £20 per pupil in the special class or classes.</P>
    <P>(f2&gt;b) Phase 2 Grants:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Ordinary and Special Schools:</i> A grant of £7 per pupil to facilitate both the purchase of educational software for classroom use and the purchase of ICT equipment for teacher professional development</P>
    <P>
      <i>Primary Schools:</i> A grant of £700 in respect of each full-time remedial teacher and resource teacher for children with disabilities for the purchase of relevant ICT equipment.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Second Level Schools:</i> Grant aid to support the equipment and Internet connectivity needs of the career guidance service &ndash; £1,850 for schools with 799 or less pupils and £3,700 for schools with 800 or more pupils &ndash; and development of computerised school administration systems &ndash; £2 per pupil for equipment.</P>
    <P>The above relate to new schools only. However, existing primary and second-level schools not previously having a special class(es) and setting one up for the first time are also eligible for a grant of £1,500 plus £20 per pupil in the special class(es) as set out above. In addition, existing primary schools are eligible for a grant of £700 for ICT equipment in respect of each newly appointed full-time remedial teacher or resource teacher for children with disabilities.</P>
    <P>A special fund is also in place to cater for the ICT needs of individual special needs pupils, including those who are fully integrated into ordinary classes. Applications for funding are submitted by schools to the special education section of my Department and are assessed on the basis of priority of need.</P>
    <P>ICT equipment is provided to support the work of each full-time teacher in the visiting teachers for travellers service. This scheme is being extended in the current year to cover the work of visiting teachers for children with disabilities.</P>
    <P>With regard to teacher training, the National Centre for Technology in Education has, to date, provided over 50,000 training places in a range of &ndash; mainly introductory &ndash; ICT training courses for teachers under the Teaching Skills Initiative element of Schools IT 2000. Expenditure under this initiative will amount to over £2 million in the current year. There is also a significant information technology dimension to a wide range of in-service provided in the context of curricula and school programme changes which covers the use of IT as a tool for learning in particular subject areas. Funding is also provided for complemen<Col N="494" /> tary training proposed by various providers to meet particular needs.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Other schemes for Primary and Special Schools</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>My Department operates a devolved grant scheme for minor works to national school properties. Payment is made to all primary schools on an annual basis at a rate of £3,000 per school plus £10 per pupil. The scheme is intended to cover minor improvements to school buildings and grounds, replacement of mechanical and electrical services, the purchase of furniture and the provision of floor coverings and blinds. If there are no outstanding works to be undertaken at the school under these headings, the school authorities may expend the grant on items of equipment such as computers, overhead projectors and photocopiers. Subject to compliance with the terms of the scheme, expenditure of the grant is entirely at the discretion of the school authorities.</P>
    <P>The special education section of my Department also makes funding available for the purchase of equipment, including computer equipment, for individual pupils with special needs. All applications for such funding are assessed on the basis of priority of need. The total funds available for this purpose in 2000 are £845,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Other schemes for Second Level Schools </i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The post-primary building unit of my Department supplies computers, printers, peripherals and software in all instances where a computer room is being provided as part of a new school or a school extension. The unit also responds to needs presented by schools generally for computer equipment on the basis of priority of need. Funding for this purpose is provided from the second-level capital allocation for school buildings.</P>
    <P>Grants of up to a maximum of £22,000 which are mainly for the purchase of IT equipment, are available to schools on introducing the leaving certificate vocational programme and-or the leaving certificate applied. The leaving certificate applied and leaving certificate vocational programme support services assist schools in the identification and purchase of equipment, which will best meet their individual needs. The Department pays the grant to schools or Vocational Education Committees following this process.</P>
    <P>An amount of £640,000 has been provided under the school administration project in the current year for the purpose of assisting second-level schools in acquiring information technology equipment and software for administration purposes. Schools are invited to participate in the project by way of letters of offer of equipment or software or, more recently, of grant-aid issued by the IT unit of my Department.</P>
    <P>A grant scheme for the purchase of equipment, including computer equipment, for second-level pupils with serious physical and/or communicative disabilities is administered by the post-primary administration section of my Department. <Col N="495" /> Application for the grant is made to the section by school authorities. The 2000 provision for this scheme is £370,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Further Education Section</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Education and training programmes in the further education sector, including the Youthreach, VTOS and senior traveller training programmes incorporate Information Communications Technology (ICT) related modules as an integral part of the course.</P>
    <P>To conform with EU requirements all PLC programmes must include a minimum of least 40 hours training mainly in new technologies. In addition, approximately 80 PLC centres throughout the country are providing a variety of dedicated ICT courses. Funding for these courses and the necessary equipment is provided to vocational education committees as part of the normal running costs of the programmes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Adult Education Sector</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Recognising the growing importance of computer literacy for adults generally, my Department will provide for a national adult basic ICT skills programme as part of the Back to Education Initiative. This programme will be the first national campaign in IT training for Irish adults.</P>
    <P>As proposed in the White Paper on Adult Education, the Government will also provide for a specific capital allocation for the further education sector. This will increase on a phased basis to a level of at least £10 million per annum. The funds will be used for investment in ICT facilities and ICT networks, and upgrading of equipment; purchase where necessary of additional facilities for adult education use and development of centres for adult education. In supporting arrangements under the Back to Education Initiative, the Department will provide pro rata funding for tuition, equipment, materials and technician support, especially in the area of maintenance of IT equipment and of other educational aids.</P>
    <P>The first report of the expert group on future skills needs highlighted emerging skill shortages in computer software, electronic and technician training, and in language skills for the teleservices sector. On foot of this the Government is committed to a major investment programme aimed at increasing the supply of software graduates and technicians allied with investment in the PLC sector to promote training in teleservices and languages.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Other</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Third level institutions provide a wide range of courses in the information technology and computing areas. Some of these courses are specifically designed to meet business training needs. Some schools have also developed links with local businesses and other groups in their local community and support them by providing access to IT courses or facilities on school premises. Some <Col N="496" /> local businesses also, of course, support the schools in their area by providing them with donations of equipment and services, including technical assistance in some cases.</P>
    <P>The Institiúid Teangeolaíochta Eireann operates a resource centre for language teachers &ndash; Irish, French, German, Italian etc. One of the functions of the resource centre is to offer advice to language teachers on developments in the area of the use of new technologies for language learning.</P>

It also provides for the establishment of a National Educational Welfare Board and a nationwide educational welfare service with a view to ensuring that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives an adequate level of education.</P>
      <P>As a first step in the implementation of the Act, I am establishing a designate board on a non-statutory basis for an interim period, to draw up detailed plans for implementing the various functions to be assigned to it under the Act. Following this interim period, the board will be put on a statutory footing and the various provisions of the Act will be commenced as appropriate. It is envisaged that membership of the designate board would, as far as possible, mirror that of the final board.</P>
      <P>My Department has requested nominations to the board from the education partners and relevant Government Departments. I will be in a position to establish the designate board once all of these have been received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="497" /> The staffing and resourcing requirements for the interim board are currently being considered by my Department.</P>

The Deputy will be aware that the White Paper on Early Childhood Education attached particular importance to the issue of early educational intervention where children with special needs are concerned.</P>
      <P>In September 1999 my Department established the national educational psychological service &ndash; NEPS.

This service has a particular focus on students with special educational needs.</P>
      <P>In pursuing its objectives, NEPS is co-operating with the clinical services which identify pre-school children with special needs. It is also developing a training module for teachers to assist in the screening of children from infant classes. In addition, in co-operation with the National Disability Authority, NEPS is continuing to provide a psychological service for children with sensory and physical disabilities.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to a request by the school for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme and for a resource teacher.</P>
      <P>I have set the tackling of educational disadvantage as a priority and will be bringing forward proposals for a major initiative to address the needs of pupils who are encountering educational disadvantage in primary schools. As a first step in this process, the Educational Research Centre issued a comprehensive questionnaire to all primary schools in April of this year, including the school referred to by the Deputy. The analysis by the Educational Research Centre of the responses from the schools is nearing completion. This will allow for an accurate identification of levels of disadvantage in every primary school that responded to the survey.</P>
      <P>Based on the levels of need identified, my objective is to introduce a range of significant and specifically targeted interventions, which will ensure that disadvantaged children receive the support they require to enable them to succeed in school. The interventions in question will take the form of extra teacher support or extra funding, or both, depending on the nature and level of need identified. I expect to make a further announcement in relation to this matter in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have requested a report on the special educational needs of pupils enrolled in the school in question from my Department's inspectorate.

The school will have its own principal and staff. Every effort is being made to have temporary arrangements in place to enable the school to commence operation in September 2001.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the third level student support schemes, a candidate's reckonable income for the purposes of the means test is his/her gross income from all sources and the gross income of his-her parents or guardians where applicable, with certain specified social welfare and health board payments being exempt.</P>
      <P>My Department has been in contact with Sligo Vocational Education Committee, the body responsible for the assessment of means in this case, and it is understood that the reckonable income in this case exceeds the current income limits for the award of a grant in respect of the 2000-01 academic year. Accordingly, the candidate to whom the Deputy refers is ineligible for grant assistance in respect of the current academic year.</P>
      <P>The terms and conditions of the student support schemes are of general application and, accordingly, it is not possible to make exceptions in individual cases such as this.</P>

    <P>Each special class can cater for up to 11 pupils. My Department does not have up-to-date data on the number of children actually attending each specific class at present. However, additional special classes will be established where a need is identified.</P>
    <P>Many children with dyslexia are capable of attending ordinary schools on a fully integrated basis with the support of the remedial or resource teacher service. Since the commencement of the current school year, the remedial teacher service has been extended to all first and second level schools with a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or more. In addition, over the past two years the number of resource teachers supporting children with special needs in the primary system has increased from 104 to more than 560.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I recently established a special task force on dyslexia. This task force, which is comprised of experts in the field, <Col N="508" /> has been requested to review my Department's current response to the educational needs of children with dyslexia and to make recommendations on the measures which should be put in place to ensure that the needs of such children are fully addressed for the future. The task force has already commenced its work and has been requested to report to me within three months.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the report of the task force will provide a basis for ensuring that the needs of all children with dyslexia are fully met in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial services in primary and secondary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978 scheme for the employment of school secretaries in the larger schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. A pension provision, introduced in 1985, applies to secretaries under this scheme. This scheme is, however, being phased out, as posts become vacant.</P>
      <P>The 1978 scheme has been superseded under the PESP Agreement of 1992 by a more extensive scheme that provides grants to primary and secondary schools towards the cost of secretarial services. The scheme by its nature is flexible and gives schools discretion as to the manner in which secretarial services are provided. Secretaries employed by schools are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role regarding how they are employed. These individualised arrangements preclude a central superannuation scheme.</P>
      <P>Three secretaries in primary schools and two secretaries in secondary schools, who were employed under the 1978 scheme, have retired from their positions in the past two years. The schools concerned now qualify for assistance under the PESP scheme.</P>
      <P>The funding arrangements for the VEC and C&amp;C school sectors include provision for secretarial services to schools. In the case of vocational education committees, administrative and clerical staff are allocated on a scheme wide basis. It is a matter for the VEC to deploy staff in the best manner possible to meet the needs of the committee and its schools. Retiring staff are replaced on the basis of the agreed staffing complements. In the case of the C&amp;C sector three secretaries have retired in the past two years and in accordance with staffing arrangements for the sector were replaced.</P>
