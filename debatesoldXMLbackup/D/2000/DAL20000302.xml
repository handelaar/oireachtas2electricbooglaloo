      <P>What plans does the Taoiseach have regarding the number of days to be set aside for discussion on Committee Stage of the Planning and Development Bill, given that it re-enacts section 5 of 1976 Act which requires the Planning Board to take account of Government policy and given the Taoiseach's statement that a development being examined by An Bord Pleanála in oral hearing is, in his words, a monstrosity? Does this involve an interference by the Government in the work of an oral hearing and does the Taoiseach believe the oral hearing should be ended because he has declared Government policy on the Spencer Dock development in a fashion which&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise this matter with the Taoiseach on the Order of Business. I suspect he was not necessarily aware that his comments as a <Col N="1171" /> Dubliner and as a public representative for the area affected would be interpreted in the manner they have been. Having regard to the enormous amount of litigation already surrounding the national conference centre, the fact that it is being located on this site, the cost to the taxpayer and the forfeiture of EU moneys designated for this purpose, will the Taoiseach consider clarifying the matter so as not to prejudice the outcome and give succour or comfort to any party which may feel aggrieved if the ultimate decision of An Bord Pleanála goes against their interests and results in litigation against the State and the taxpayer? That is the enormity of the issue. It is not about whether one agrees or disagrees with the desirability of the project. It is a project which has bedevilled three Administrations which have attempted to launch&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Time is of the essence and I am not sure the Taoiseach was aware that his one comment of many during that journey would be carried by RTE. Legal advice is urgently needed and corrective measures should be taken by the Taoiseach so as not to add to the saga of litigation which already surrounds this project.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Government on the action it has taken on Mozambique. Will it raise the issue of the total cancellation of the outstanding indebtedness of the Republic of Mozam<Col N="1172" /> bique having regard to the precedent that was brought into play with Honduras when it was subject to a massive natural calamity? Can this matter be raised by the Taoiseach with his European colleagues to achieve cancellation of the $60 million Mozambique must repay each year, which is more than its primary health care and education budgets combined?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill which responds to the many challenges facing a changing Ireland. Our economy has grown dramatically in recent years. The predictions of forecasters have been way off the mark. The country has seen record employment growth and rising living standards, and incomes per head of population have reached EU levels. This is good news for a country whose economy has had more than its fair share of struggle and strife. Unemployment and emigration were the norm for too many people for too long. The levels of unemployment have changed dramatically since 1987. There are now 500,000 more people in work than in 1987. Unemployment has dropped from 17% to less than 5%.</P>
      <P>Recently the Government concluded negotiations on a new social partnership agreement. Such agreements over the past 12 years have proven to be the basis of our economic success. Since 1988 take home pay has increased by 35%. However, a number of people have not benefited as much as others from our economic progress. This Bill, along with a number of other measures, is designed to ensure that all workers partake in the economic boom.</P>
      <P>In three budgets the Government has removed 135,000 people on low pay from the tax net. This compares to the removal of just over 30,000 during the lifetime of the rainbow coalition Government. It also did little to move people on modest incomes out of the top tax rate. During its administration, those on low incomes remained in the tax net. The history of Fine Gael-Labour coalitions shows their record on taxation has always been defective. In the mid-1980s, when emigration was at its highest since 1950 and unemployment reached 16%, the Fine Gael-Labour response was to raise personal tax rates to 40% and 65%.</P>
      <P>When this Government came to office a single person entered the tax net at £77. However, this has now been increased to £110. Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, people earning less than £200 per week will not have to pay PRSI. As a result, almost 500,000 low paid employees will gain up to £5.67 per week from April. The Government's objective is to remove from the tax net all those who earn the minimum wage. The investment of £40 billion under the national development plan will improve people's standards of living in all sectors of society. These measures are significant in the move towards social inclusion.</P>
      <P>A minimum wage of £4.40 per hour will encourage long-term unemployed people to join the workforce. Low rates of pay and high taxation have often been a barrier in this regard. Businesses which may have difficulty finding staff will welcome the availability of extra workers. A statutory minimum wage will encourage people not only to enter the workforce but also to remain there. It will also be instrumental in helping people to move from welfare to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1180" /> I welcome the provision which allows the Labour Court to grant a temporary exemption to businesses from paying the minimum wage. This provision will be necessary to secure jobs at a critical stage for a company. The Labour Court will make the decision so the provision is not abused.</P>
    <P>Some employers' representatives have expressed opposition to the £4.40 rate and have stated that 15,000 jobs could be lost. A responsible Government could not introduce measures which would result in such job losses. The Government, through agencies such as IDA Ireland, Forfás and others, has begun to implement policies that will ensure a move from a low to a high wage skill economy. Trade union leaders have agreed that job losses will be absorbed by other sectors of the economy. Policies developed by this Fianna Fáil-led Administration have created a climate which makes this country a desirable and sought after location in which to do business.</P>
    <P>Business is doing well out of Ireland and Ireland is doing well out of Irish business. The introduction of a minimum wage is a very small price to pay for the continuation of such a climate. The Government has a good record in terms of encouraging and promoting business. Major investment continues to be made in roads, ports and airports and in our technological and telecommunications infrastructure. Supports and services to businesses from State agencies are generous.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government on the introduction of the National Minimum Wage Bill. It has been introduced at an appropriate stage in this country's development and it will help to consolidate our economic progress even further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Johnny Brady for sharing time. The introduction of the national minimum wage is a momentous step forward in the life of the nation. It represents a break with the iron laws of supply and demand as a means of determining the rates at which a worker must be paid. This Bill is, therefore, a historically significant development in the life of the nation because it marks a new departure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arrival on the scene in the past 150 years of the trade union movement helped overcome the weak position held by workers <i>vis-à-vis</i> the strict application of the iron law of wages. However, notwithstanding the existence of trade unions and the good work the trade union movement has done in balancing the rights of powerless workers against the prerogatives of powerful employers, there remain areas, even within a tiger economy, where real wage exploitation still exists. For example, after a recent national lecture from a spokesman from the hotel industry I received a telephone call from constituents in Wicklow with experience of that industry who indicated the existence of near Dickensian conditions and a certain meanness of spirit. I do not <Col N="1181" /> suggest that these are universal in that industry, but there are pockets within it and other industries based outside the main urban areas where workers are exploited.</P>
    <P>No industry has the right to prosper from exploitation and there is an understanding among members of the workforce that the State has a responsibility to protect them in this regard. In spite of our new-found national wealth and our new confidence in some areas, we have not progressed far beyond the days of the unique Irish humiliation of the hiring fair. However, the Bill helps to dispel that nightmare once and for all.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome because it marks an important point of principle. The weak and the vulnerable workers will be given a right which will ensure that they will receive a minimum hourly rate of pay and which will be enforceable in law. We can quibble about the level of the rate or the manner in which it is being introduced, but the reality is that a right is being created and that is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the investigation of complaints where the rate is not paid. It creates an offence for employers who refuse to meet the rate and it affords protection to workers against victimisation by an unscrupulous employer who offends against the minimum rate principle. The Bill is also welcome because it represents yet another delivery by the Government of an important undertaking in the programme for Government. Moreover, it represents an effort by Government not only to honour a commitment it gave in the programme but to honour it at the earliest possible date. That is an historic first in many ways.</P>
    <P>The National Minimum Wage Commission recommended that Partnership 2000 should be allowed to run its course before the minimum wage legislation was introduced. The Government's action reflects the letter and the spirit of that recommendation. The envisaged commencement date of 1 April is the first possible date on which this important principle can be enacted. The Government, particularly the Tánaiste, and all concerned are to be congratulated on that.</P>
    <P>The Government's action in respect of this matter is in stark contrast to that of the previous Administration which considered the minimum wage rate but failed to introduce it. It is ironic that the Labour Party spokesman, Deputy Rabbitte, should wring his hands and complain about the level of the minimum pay rate when he failed to deliver any such rate. The Deputy held office a few short years ago in the Ministry which could have effected the very change about which he is now posturing. That is ironic but not surprising &ndash; Deputy Rabbitte has always been long on rhetoric and short on delivery, he talks a good game but he fails to deliver.</P>
    <P>The idea of a minimum wage rate is not new, it has been abroad for many decades. The great advantage envisaged for the introduction of the rate is that it will provide a statutory floor for wages. In so doing it will provide a right, enforce<Col N="1182" /> able by law, for weak and vulnerable workers who are frequently outside the protection afforded by union membership. It has been argued by those who oppose a minimum rate of pay that the introduction of this legislation could be detrimental to economic progress, could damage smaller firms, could be inimical to specific industries and could lead to labour market displacement. This would mean that low skilled or inexperienced workers would suffer.</P>
    <P>The first of these arguments belongs to the past. Ireland is no longer a low wage economy and there is no reason that we should hanker back to the days when such an economy existed. We now have a developed modern economy, one of the benefits of which is that the wealth created should be shared through decent wages. The argument that smaller firms or specific industries, such as the hotel and catering industry, will be damaged is equally bogus. No industry has the right to plead that it should be allowed to exploit its workers in the interests of survival.</P>
    <P>The argument that minimum wage rates could displace labour encouraging capital displacement of labour may have given cause for thought in an economy with a surplus of labour and a shortage of work. That was certainly the case when this debate started 20 years ago. In such circumstances, Governments had to be cautious not to introduce measures which would unduly tip the balance. However, such arguments no longer have the primacy they once enjoyed. All one need do is walk around the city of Dublin to realise that there are many work opportunities available and that the time to introduce a minimum wage has arrived.</P>
    <P>There is a fear that another form of labour displacement will come about, namely, that employers will not be willing to take on low skilled workers, young or inexperienced workers or trainees and will demand higher skills and more experience. Again, this argument belongs more to the past than the present. Given that employment opportunities are not evenly spread geographically across the country, some residual validity to this argument might exist in some pockets of the economy. The Bill, however, makes prudent provision in this area.</P>
    <P>There are two specific cases where sub-minimum rates are permitted. In the case of trainees and job entrants, the setting of the rate at 70% is prudent. It will also help to overcome another danger, namely, that wage rates might encourage young people to leave school in search of some short-term gain. However, that is not an issue to be solved through minimum wage legislation or the establishment of an artificially low floor.</P>
    <P>The setting of the minimum rate of pay at £4.40 has been criticised. Deputy Rabbitte, for example, suggested it should be £4.90, but when he was in power he made no such suggestions. So much for his argument. There is an arguable case that a flexible approach will have to be adopted in respect of this issue. Deputy Johnny Brady correctly referred to particular circumstances where <Col N="1183" /> the Labour Court will be able to intervene to ensure that an argument cannot be put forward for artificially low rates. Where workers are prepared to accept a lower rate they should have a right to participate in the long-term and they should be rewarded in some way, perhaps in the form of capital participation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation without caveat. Many items of legislation have been introduced in this House which have been well intentioned but which did not carry the requisite strength in terms of enforcement. In the general area of labour law, the labour inspectorate has been woefully under-supported. For the past 15 years, only ten inspectors have been operating in that area. It is extraordinary that labour law has expanded at a time when the inspectorate is being kept at a minimum. I commend the announcement by the Tánaiste that seven additional inspectors will be immediately employed and that they will be given additional support staff. Although seven inspectors represent an increase of 70%, we still do not have enough.</P>
    <P>This legislation marks, in many ways, a coming of age. I mentioned the old days and the hiring fairs. All the old arguments should be left in the past. I am surprised when I see chambers of commerce or people representing major industries wringing their hands about this issue. As I said, no industry has the right to build its strength by exploiting its workers. Most industries that have progressed have a progressive attitude towards wages and their workers. Since the beginning of the 20th century, all the research, indications and experience in this area have shown that employers who treat their workers decently, who accept they are part of a partnership and see their true value are the ones that prosper, while those who employ Dickensian and mean spirited methods inevitably fail.</P>
    <P>This is good legislation. I commend the Tánaiste and her staff on its introduction.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill. It is not before time that we are providing a legislative framework for a national minimum hourly rate of pay. The Bill will ensure an employee must be paid by his or her employer at rate of pay not below the prescribed minimum hourly rate of pay. The Bill has been long awaited. Along with the other equality legislation introduced by the rainbow Government &ndash; the Equal Status Bill and the Employment Equality Bill &ndash; it will help to protect those who are most vulnerable in our society. Any legislation that will help create a fairer society and give everybody a chance of a decent living and quality of life is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reasons for the Bill are clear. The main need for its introduction is to address the exploi<Col N="1184" /> tation in the labour market. That exploitation is confirmed by a report in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> of a court case yesterday where businessmen were fined for not paying the legal basic wage. That confirms the necessity for this Bill and that, unfortunately, exploitation is continuing to happen in the labour market.</P>
    <P>It is sad that people are being exploited in the labour market. Women will be major beneficiaries of this Bill. Sadly, many women, who were perhaps forced to leave employment because of the marriage bar and were unable to keep their skills updated due to caring for their families, were forced to accept positions which were not permanent and did not have a basic salary structure. As a result, many women worked for a pittance. The only way they could help their families was to work extraordinarily long hours. Thankfully, the provisions in the Bill will protect them from having to struggle to work long hours to maintain a decent income for their families.</P>
    <P>Examples of this are those who work as home helps and provide family support. I met a group of those women some months ago. I was astounded and embarrassed to find they were being paid as little as £2.20 per hour by our health boards. They are expected to do very difficult work which demands physical strength and a strong mental attitude to cope with some of the environments in which they work. In addition, they were being paid 10p per mile for travel expenses incurred in getting to their places of employment. How could anyone afford to run a car and pay for insurance on 10p per mile? That is an example of what was happening without the protection of national minimum wage legislation.</P>
    <P>Their situation was raised in this House on several occasions. I raised it on the Adjournment and it was mentioned in many Second Stage debates. It is amazing that nothing was done about it. Unfortunately, we had to wait for the introduction of legislation to protect these workers.</P>
    <P>It is alarming to learn at one's clinics and from meeting constituents that very profitable institutions often have unacceptable pay rates. I know of people who are stacking supermarket shelves for £1.90 an hour. Our banks, despite the millions of pounds they make per day, employ what are known as &ldquo;yellow pack workers&rdquo;. These are profitable institutions but the profit goes to the owners and top level employees. Those at the lower end of the scale, who do not have skills but are a very important element of the workforce, carry the can and are paid scandalous wages. I am glad this Bill will end that exploitation.</P>
    <P>Students are also suffering without the protection of a national minimum wage. Sadly, many students cannot survive on the maintenance grant and are forced to take part-time work. A huge increase in the maintenance element of the student grant is needed because it does not cater for the alarming increase in accommodation costs. The grant will not help students in Dublin to pay for their accommodation and other costs, <Col N="1185" /> such as transport, survival, books and equipment needed for their courses. Many of these students, while trying to cope with their courses, are forced to take part-time work to survive because their families cannot help them. They almost inevitably earn unacceptable hourly rates of pay. Unfortunately, they have no protection and they need the money. In many cases, perhaps because of their age, they are not strong enough to stand up for their rights. They are glad to have a job and to be able to supplement their incomes while they are pursuing third level education. I am glad this Bill will make life a little easier for them. If we are serious about education, however, students who are entitled to the higher education grant should not be forced to take up part-time employment. They are not using that money to fund a social life because they are at work during the socialising hours, while their comrades are going out and taking breaks. They are working to survive.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Bill will help to create a fairer society and to protect those who do not have the skills or qualifications necessary to get a better standard of employment. However, now that we reached the point of introducing this Bill, it is a pity it is not as near as possible to perfect.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the definition of pay in section 2. It states that pay &ldquo;includes the value of any benefit not in the form of money that is allowed by an employer to an employee in respect of the employee's employment&rdquo;. This is an unfair and unrealistic definition of pay and I am glad Deputy Owen will table an amendment to this section. How will this provision work in practice? If someone who works in a home has their meal with the family, could a mean employer class this as a benefit? If someone stays overnight could that also be defined as a benefit, thus giving an employer scope to reduce the hourly rate of pay? The Bill should be clear and precise and should leave no scope for abuse. However, the Bill's broad definition of pay will be abused and those who will suffer are the people we are hoping to protect.</P>
    <P>This Bill applies particularly to those working in service industries where, because of the definition of pay in the Bill, tips will be considered as pay. All Members recognise that a tip is an individual gesture of appreciation and thanks and I cannot understand and will never accept that a tip is part of the salary paid by an employer to an individual worker. Leaving a tip is a decent and acceptable practice whereby people reward someone who has been extraordinarily helpful, who has done a good job or has put themselves out to accommodate them. The anomaly in the Bill is that if a tip is given directly to the worker it will not be considered as part of their pay but if it is left in a pool it will be considered as part of pay. I hope this anomaly will be corrected on Committee Stage. I would like to make many other comments on the legislation. I welcome the Bill as it provides protection for those workers who need it and are unable to protect themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Theresa Ahearn for sharing time. My first reaction is that at last we have a minimum wage Bill. This is one of the most overdue Bills to come before the House but, sadly, it is also the most obvious attempt to water down a measure which would rightly have had the widespread support of the general public. We have a minimum wage Bill but we do not have a fair minimum wage. We do not even have one minimum wage but a wage structure filled with caveats and conditions which create a series of lesser, paler imitations of a minimum wage.</P>
      <P>The joint labour committees have exposed the central weaknesses in the Bill and have pointed out that the definition provided in the Bill includes 13 elements in the calculation of reckonable pay. They also contend that reckonable pay should consist only of basic pay and that the inclusion of other elements could serve to drive down basic pay to an amount considerably less than £4.40 per hour. The committees also point out that the public expectation of the minimum wage is that it is a basic hourly rate and that there is no perception that it includes other elements such as various premia.</P>
      <P>This latter point is worth emphasising and we as elected representatives of the public have to conform with the public's expectation that we are looking at a basic hourly rate. However, sadly this Bill does not legislate for that understanding and interpretation. We have received no promises to take low paid workers out of the tax net, there is no inflation proofing of the rate and the criteria for its review are massively skewed in favour of employers.</P>
      <P>Many of the thousands of low paid workers believed that this Bill would right a wrong but how will they judge a Government which balked when faced with the decision of guaranteeing workers a basic first step on the road towards a dignified standard of living? This fact must be at the core of our consideration of the Bill.</P>
      <P>This legislation glosses over an important principle. Minimum wages are being set by central Government because employers were paying hourly rates below the so-called competitive level and penalising workers on the first step of the employment ladder. It is worth noting that workers were not seeking recompense for the years of subsistence wages they have received. They were prepared to start afresh buoyed by the promise of Government action on this injustice.</P>
      <P>Many low paid workers are at their posts hours before many of us get out of bed. They are cleaning, fixing and servicing and they are at work when many of us have long gone to our beds. These people work at weekends and on bank holidays. What does this Bill say to these workers? It suggests that there is an understanding of their problem and that expert opinions have been commissioned to deliberate on the issue, but &ndash; there is always a but &ndash; the proposal is to introduce a watered down version of what is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1187" /> The National Minimum Wage Commission published its report for the Minister over one year ago but her first action was to delay implementation of the proposed £4.40 rate until April 2000. The ICTU had sought a minimum rate of £5 per hour which I and Sinn Féin supported. Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness the £5 minimum hourly rate, which is needed now, is to be delayed until October 2002. Hundreds of businesses, particularly in Dublin city, are already paying rates above the £4.40 minimum rate. It must be obvious to the Minister and all concerned with this Bill that it has clearly failed when the market it set out to regulate has already moved on. Now the relatively low hourly rate could have a retarding influence on wages, which is the opposite of what the legislation set out to achieve. I have no doubt that there are unscrupulous employers who will seize that opportunity.</P>
    <P>Why is the wage rate not indexed to the rate of inflation? According to the legislation, it is up to the Minister to review the national minimum hourly rate of pay. The conditions listed are the effects any new rate would have on unemployment, employment, inflation and competitiveness. Is it not strange that there is no allowance for setting a wage rate that allows a worker a decent standard of living? Citing inflation and competitiveness in the criteria for reviewing the minimum rate is grossly unfair. The recent rise in inflation has been shown to have been driven by rising oil prices and other non-wage costs, including budgetary changes in taxation on certain commodities such as cigarettes.</P>
    <P>Why are workers being penalised for rising inflation? How does the Minister propose to measure the national competitiveness aspect of the criteria? I would like an explanation of that. The cynical observer might think it is just another excuse for not setting a just wage rate, and he would be right. How many times have we read over the past decade of double digit wage increases paid to company executives who already enjoy six and seven figure salaries? Why do we never hear of the effect of these wages and salaries on inflation or competitiveness? There is a clear double standard at work. Executives are paid the market rate for their work while low paid workers have their wages drip fed through the mantras of market competitiveness and inflationary pressures. The records show that the only group of workers which has earned wage increases above inflation over the past decade are the State's higher professionals and executives.</P>
    <P>The amount of tax paid by low paid workers is an important factor in this legislation. A range of expert opinion and lobby groups, including the Combat Poverty Agency, recommended removing the low paid from the tax net altogether. The Government, however, has refused to do this and has thus created another crack in its minimum wage strategy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1188" /> When the current deliberations on the minimum wage began three years ago, a report by the Revenue Commissioners showed that the top 400 earners in the State, through the use of what are described as legitimate tax avoidance schemes, paid an effective income tax rate of less than 10%. This is the level of inequity over which this Government presides. The reality is that the low paid are paying proportionately more income tax than the highest paid in society. That is a statistic which will hold up under the Minister's scrutiny.</P>
    <P>Why are there opt outs in the legislation for workers under the age of 18 and employees in their first and second years of work? These opt outs further water down legislation which is already extremely weak.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>This is progressive and enlightened legislation which is long overdue. It is simple enough but it must be recognised that the complex work behind the scenes to get around difficult areas took a long time. The changing social patterns in the State make this legislation timely. There is no doubt the Minister and the trade union movement deserve particular credit. They indicated maturity, a clear vision of where we should be going and a recognition of the social injustice which existed before there was legislation as forthright as this.</P>
      <P>This legislation attempts to deal with marginalised workers. Many have been marginalised because of the nature of their employment and where they work. Surprisingly enough, many of them were marginalised by people who should have known better, who exploited those who had less clout than others. It is only proper that we recognise that and deal with it. It is surprising that legislation is always required to make things happen. It shows the importance of foresight in Government and the need for Ministers with a clear understanding of management of employment affairs.</P>
      <P>Some sectors have not given recognition or fair working conditions to their employees. Two such sectors which have grown significantly over the years are the tourism and catering industries. It is necessary to highlight areas where people suffered. Those people must have felt seriously aggrieved. Many of the skills involved do not require exhaustive training. In recent years, however, the catering and tourism industries have recognised that skills are necessary. It is not possible to survive with unskilled labour. There must be a clear understanding that these workers are here to serve people and to serve an industry and thus contribute to the opportunities in these growing industries. Their success is a recognition of the quality of the people who work in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be acknowledged that people worked in the background, in the kitchens and bedrooms, for low wages. That was regrettable. It happened at a time when it was much easier to exploit workers than it is today because there was high unemployment and beggars cannot be choosers. In those circumstances these people had to work <Col N="1189" /> extremely long hours and engage in very heavy work in the knowledge that someone would step into their place if they were not prepared to accept that.</P>
    <P>Many of the professional services &ndash; the legal profession, accountancy, supermarkets and other industries which thrived in this State &ndash; should be mentioned. Many people worked in those areas and while their jobs may not have been skilled, they made a vital contribution to the employer's profit margin and to the public service. It is regrettable to comment on this issue, but we should be mature enough to recognise our mistakes and drawbacks. We should also recognise that change is inevitable and is being made in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Most comment on the Bill has been on how it will affect the position of women and young people. Other categories of people will be affected, including those involved in home help &ndash; Deputy Theresa Ahearn referred to this. Carers are another category of people who have made an outstanding contribution to the health and social services, often on a vocational and voluntary basis. They did not do it for the money because it was not there. Over the years they have kept large numbers of people out of expensive institutions where services are in short supply. Despite this, they have generally been badly paid by State institutions. That is regrettable, but it must be acknowledged and it must change. I hope this legislation will correct their position because people cared for in the home can be given a quality of life in familiar circumstances that are congenial to recovery and stability. These circumstances can be seriously eroded if support services are not available.</P>

      <P>Section 5 sets out the categories of people who are not covered by the legislation. They include the spouse, father, mother, grandfather and grandmother as well as the half-brother or half-sister of an employer, employed by the employer. Some of these people may be engaged in caring and may have had to give up their jobs to return to employment within the home. Are they equally recognised and provided for in the legislation as persons giving service? Their circumstances may be more painful where they are related to the person requiring care. Given that they may have to forego employment elsewhere, they should be recognised as carers, regardless of their relationship with the person in receipt of care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 also excludes from the terms of the legislation a member of the Defence Forces <Col N="1190" /> under the Defence Act, 1954, in respect of his or her service as such. The Minister should examine the appropriateness of the inclusion of the Defence Forces. Much has changed since the 1954 Act. Light has been shone on some of the dark areas of Defence Forces activities. It is not good enough that the modern Defence Forces should continue to be left behind. I hope peace in the country, in Europe and the world will continue and that our future contribution will be to maintain and support it. However, given the modernisation of attitudes, it is essential we deal with a matter which we did not address previously for many reasons. Recognition of this by the Minister on later Stages of the Bill would be appreciated.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes a considerable number of good legislative provisions and is very well thought-out, researched, planned and complex. The review under section 12 provides a wonderful opportunity for national agreements to continue as a feature in the economy. The section provides for one method to review the national minimum wage, with certain obligations on the Minister while section 13 provides for a second method of review based on the involvement of the Labour Court. This is fair and reflects mature thinking and justice being done in a special way.</P>
    <P>It is only proper that provision is made for employees of 18 years of age. Section 14 recognises sub-minimum and training payments, providing for the first time special recognition of the need to acknowledge people in certain areas of activity and the age below which the minimum wage will be paid.</P>
    <P>We must also take account of enforcement. An essential pre-requisite of enforcement is record keeping which is provided for in sections 22 and 23. These sections impose obligations on employers to keep records, with significant penalties for non-compliance. For the first time employers will have to record what is necessary for each employee. This will contribute towards the proper management of the relationship between employers and employees. To achieve the results which the Bill seeks, it is equally important to ensure employees are satisfied in the knowledge that enforcement will be possible where there are breaches. In this regard I congratulate the Minister on making provision for increased numbers of inspectors and administrative staff in the area of enforcement. I am sure that as the provisions are monitored whatever is necessary will be provided for. At the end of the day people will have no faith or confidence in the legislation unless they are satisfied its provisions will be enforced.</P>
    <P>Reference is made to disputes in section 24, and I am delighted that special provision is made under section 33 whereby a complaint can be pursued by an inspector rather than by the employee who could, in certain circumstances, feel the victim of the employer or in some way marginalised, or worse. It is commendable that provision is made to pursue a complaint on behalf of an <Col N="1191" /> employee, and it warrants recognition and acknowledgement.</P>
    <P>Much reference has been made to what is reckonable. I hope the Minister might consider the deletion of &ldquo;unsociable hours premium&rdquo; as a reckonable component in the Schedule. In fairness, unsociable hours result in considerable stresses, and we are talking about minimum wage employment where people have more difficult employment positions to pursue and more difficult tasks to undertake. Essential as they are, unsociable hours should not be a reckonable component in terms of the minimum wage.</P>
    <P>Another issue is that of tips and gratuities. In the US, where sometimes there are no service charges, tips are a traditional form of showing thanks or gratitude. Here, there is a service charge and tips are not necessarily as widespread, although with more disposable income, changing habits and different attitudes there is an increasing recognition by customers of service provided. People who are excellent and exemplary in their performance and who often give leadership to their contemporaries should not have the opportunity of receiving a few pounds or a few pence destroyed.</P>
    <P>The exemption of one year for employers who will experience difficulties in this area should be considered a recognition by the Minister that the legislation, while described as essential, good and enlightened, will pose difficulties for certain categories of people. The exemption period will allow time to address these difficulties.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that belatedly the National Minimum Wage Bill is before the House, but it is fatally flawed in many respects. Deputy Doherty outlined many of the huge gaps in the Bill which my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, will address through extensive amendments on Committee Stage. The Bill has been overtaken by events. In recent years average industrial earnings have been approaching £9 per hour. This party through its history has argued for a national minimum wage, but it is disgraceful to present a Bill with a minimum wage of £4.40 which is barely 50% of average industrial earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just three and a half years ago the Taoiseach, in a banner headline, stated he was totally opposed to the concept of a national minimum wage. To attract votes in the 1997 general election he went back on that outrageous statement and gave a vague commitment to introduce a national minimum wage. The result is that we have had to wait almost three years for this most basic and fundamental promise to be kept by the Government. In that time we have had the national minimum wage commission, the interdepartmental working group which produced an interim report, an ESRI study and a host of smaller studies and submissions by the trade union movement and employers. Finally, almost three years into the <Col N="1192" /> life of the Government, a fundamentally flawed Bill is before the House.</P>

      <P>He is easily provoked. Minister Margaret Beckett, within months of the formation of the current British Government, outlined plans for a detailed Bill to adopt a national minimum wage. In the interim we have had to cope with a mean spirited campaign by elements in IBEC, ISME and the Small Firms Association and it was only because of the actions of the trade union and labour movement over the past three years that this legislation has been introduced. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness would not be before us if the Government had not belatedly caved in and sullenly brought forward this Bill.</P>
      <P>One of the greatest scandals in our economy over past decades has been low wages. Detailed studies carried out by the ESRI and many international bodies in OECD countries have highlighted the existence of a national minimum wage. The United States first set a national minimum wage of 38 cents or 40 cents per hour in 1938. Our disgraceful record is due to the fact that conservative parties dominated by business have been in the ascendancy in this House. A study was carried out a number of years ago on the number of employees falling below a threshold of 66% of median weekly income throughout OECD nations. A total of 5.2% of employees fell below the threshold in Sweden while the figure was 5.9% in Finland; 7.2% in Belgium; 16.9% in New Zealand; 19.6% in the UK; 23.7% in Canada; and 23.9% in Ireland, second only to the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Joint labour committee reports have also dealt with low wages over the years in the areas in <Col N="1193" /> which they operate. According to a survey conducted by the Dublin Council of Trade Unions a number of years ago, hairdressers earned £142.29 per week; hotel workers, £156.08 per week; retail/grocery workers, £97.69 per week; and agricultural workers, £152.25 per week. These appalling low wages are in evidence in many sectors of our economy and it is appalling that it has taken the Government and the House so long to even introduce outline legislation. Throughout many service industries, including, unfortunately, the tourism industry, there has been a long and sad history of low wages.</P>
    <P>While the powerful development of the Celtic tiger economy over the past five years has demoted Ireland to the middle of the league table of low wages, 13% to 15% of workers in Ireland still probably earn less than 66% of median weekly income. This ongoing problem was highlighted again in an article in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>. Cooke's family-run restaurant was fined in court yesterday having received 15 summonses under the Industrial Relations Act, 1946. The restaurant's minimum hourly rate for workers was £2.68. The defendants' solicitor pointed out that his clients had decided to pay only £3 per hour. This highlights a profound problem in our economy. It is a sad reflection on the House and the Government that it has been so long in office before it addressed this important problem and did something fundamental about it.</P>
    <P>In European economic circles and research institutes, it is reckoned that Ireland's informal-black economy remains one of the biggest in Europe. I asked the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment a number of years ago about a famous study carried out at Linz University in Austria which showed that Ireland's black economy involves 10% to 12% of the workforce. Wages will always be low in such an economy.</P>
    <P>I am proud that the labour movement and the Labour Party throughout its history has bravely and adamantly called for a national minimum wage in conjunction with tax reforms and the abolition of welfare poverty traps. In the early 1980s in England, Frank Field conducted a famous study on the potential dangers of the minimum wage, which demonstrated conclusively that low pay was the primary cause of poverty for between 30% and 40% of those below pensionable age and that low pay and a low tax threshold were a disastrous combination if one sought seriously to eliminate poverty.</P>
    <P>I was privileged to run for the first time as a Labour Party candidate in the 1989 general election. Our party leader at the time, Deputy Spring, argued strongly for a minimum wage of £135 per week or £3.77 per hour, which was 68% of average earnings. That was almost 12 years ago.</P>

      <P>What did Deputy Spring do about it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>He put it forward. Fianna Fáil and journalists that supported that party rub<Col N="1194" /> bished the proposals. My colleague, Deputy De Rossa, when he was Minister for Social Welfare, also set out a programme to introduce a national minimum wage. In recent times as spokesperson for the Labour Party, I conducted an outline study for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business and attempted to draft a minimum wage Bill to force the Government's hand. The difficulty lay with the fact that elements of the Bill which would have resulted in a cost to the Exchequer would have been ruled out of order.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and, in particular, Peter Cassells, Patricia O'Donovan and Des Geraghty, for their campaign over the past four years which has led to this legislation. Their slogans were &ldquo;Fair Pay is Fair Play&rdquo; and &ldquo;Real Jobs Pay Real Wages&rdquo; and they sought a minimum wage rate of £5 per hour. They played a key role in getting us to where we are. They outlined many arguments, which are evident in the legislation.</P>
      <P>Many aspects of the Bill are fatally flawed, particularly section 19. I do not envisage that the legislation will be operational on 1 April given that many important provisions were not teased out before it was introduced in the House. The Minister appears to have made an appalling error of judgment in section 19 by including shift premia under reckonable components of pay. Given the history of low pay in Ireland, an opportunity will be given to unscrupulous employers to run a coach and four over the major part of the legislation. The Minimum Wage Act, 1998, in the UK deliberately excluded premium pay and incentive payments. Therefore, there is a problem with one of the most fundamental aspects of the legislation. Reckonable components also include service pay, unsociable hours, productivity related-pay, allowances for special or additional duty, board at lodgings, etc. That will give great scope to unscrupulous employers, such as the one referred to in one of today's newspaper reports, to include all these things in basic pay rates to the detriment of employees. The second aspect of the reckonable components relates to unsociable hours. Non-reckonable components include overtime premia. There will be grave concerns in the trade union movement and among workers generally as to whether this area can be policed and whether a rogue employer could bring overtime within the unsociable hours premium, particularly given the nature of the part-time work which characterises work in the services area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enforcement and anti-avoidance measures should be a key aspect of the Bill but it does not contain a single section on employers' obligations to maintain current working hours. The Worker Protection (Regular Part-time Employees') Act, 1991, includes a provision whereby the Employment Appeals Tribunal can investigate a deliberate attempt to cut back on working hours as a basis for greater productivity at lower pay rates. The omission of a similar provision in this legislation leaves a huge gap. Deputy Rabbitte stated <Col N="1195" /> yesterday that the Bill is full of holes and that, in many respects, it is one of the worst Bills which has been introduced in this House.</P>
    <P>We are deeply concerned about section 24 which refers to rights commissioners. Section 23 provides that unless an employee has sought a written statement in regard to his or her hourly rates and has asked to see the records, it is impossible to initiate a case to the rights commissioner. At one stage in the past we had 1.1 million workers but the figure has now increased to 1.7 million. It seems that the majority of the additional 600,000 workers are not unionised and so do not have access to a skilled negotiator who can act on their behalf.</P>
    <P>I was proud to introduce the Labour Party's trade union recognition Bill in this House which I understand will be reintroduced as a Government Bill in the near future. We argued that if top businessmen could count on a professional negotiator and representative, workers should be able to do the same. There appears to be a conflict in regard to the role of the rights commissioner in relation to how employees may proceed with cases.</P>
    <P>Section 32 provides that a rights commissioner cannot carry out an investigation unless an inspector has already investigated the matter. There is a fundamental conflict here, which does not appear in the English legislation, in terms of the investigative process, the process of the rights commissioner and the Labour Court. Most observers would ask why it is not possible to have the two investigations by the rights commissioner and an inspector running simultaneously. Why must these processes be mutually exclusive?</P>
    <P>Many people in the labour movement would be very concerned about the size of the inspectorate. The Minister will agree that our past record on health and safety has been appalling and I commend the recent efforts made to provide a comprehensive health and safety system. Major problems have been experienced because the resources available to the Health and Safety Authority were so paltry. The financial memorandum states that seven more inspectors are to be appointed in addition to the existing ten. Those 17 people will be responsible for invigilating an economy of 1.7 million workers. That is very unfair to the workers concerned.</P>
    <P>The other extraordinary aspect of the financial memorandum which I wish to raise is that there is such a high level of low pay in the public service. A special provision has been made in regard to health board employees. Many workers in this House receive very low rates of pay for the heavy workloads they carry. Some people would say Deputies are in the same boat.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about section 25 in regard to legal representation whereby employees would not be entitled to legal representation at the first stage on the route to determination. We are accustomed through the Employment Appeals Tribunal to representation of employees by their trade union officials, professional representatives, <Col N="1196" /> legal representatives and sometimes public representatives. All of us have probably represented constituents or friends at some stage. I do not understand why this issue cannot be addressed in this legislation.</P>
    <P>The possibility of victimisation is a further issue of concern in regard to the necessity for one year's continuous service. Why should this basic service requirement be necessary if there is a genuine feeling that the law has been broken and that the national minimum wage has not been adhered to? We would also be concerned about potential defences for rogue employers and employers who may find themselves in financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>I welcome this belated and flawed Bill to which I will urge my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, to table extensive amendments. The Labour Party will introduce its own Bill if necessary in order that the national minimum wage will benefit Irish workers.</P>

There is another group of trade unions who make a fuss without having a constructive thought in their heads.

      <P>The words do not seem to flow. The same trade unions who voted against every other wage agreement are voting against the new programme. By and large, they do not represent the low paid as they all work in well paid trades. They are negative and destructive. They pretend to be interested in the low paid. However, the trade union movement is about brotherhood and looking after the less well off and those who are vulnerable in employment. It has always been thought that national wage agreements are good for the low paid. Those in well paid jobs and trades could demand more and get it under free collective bargaining. However, the vulnerable fall by the wayside. This is the value of a national wage agreement and it puts to the test the rhetoric of many trade unionists as to whether they are interested in their progression or that of their weaker colleagues.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that some employers' bodies have lobbied against this measure in recent years. While we would all like the economy to result in better jobs for all, we must realise many sectors are still struggling. However, many of the complaints are not being made by employers in these sectors. I am suspicious of some of the campaigns. Some employers are engaged in unfair competition. One of the advantages of a minimum wage is that it results in more competition and helps to create a level playing field. Employers in certain industries have been paying wages under the counter and abusing the family income supplement to pay their employees what they deem to be a fair rate.</P>
      <P>A minimum wage will result in more balance because the rate of pay will have to brought over the counter. I worked in CIE and it was known that small bus operators were paying wages under the counter. According to their pay packets, men with families were receiving what appeared to be a ridiculous rate of pay. Many of them had worked for Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann and their friends still working there knew their official rate of pay was false and the family income supplement system was being milked. The minimum wage will be more fair and equal. There are many fair-minded employers who value their workers and know the way to retain them is to pay them well and offer them good conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness that the minimum wage will be increased to £4.70 next year and £5 after that &ndash; as a minimum rate of pay, £5 has a nice ring to it. Many people would like this to be the introduc<Col N="1199" /> tory rate. However, it will be achieved in two years, which I welcome. I am concerned about how the average hourly rate is determined. I am glad the Minister said the minimum wage will be introduced on 1 April. I cannot understand the employers' organisations who want it to be delayed further. They were given a couple of years' notice and they knew it would be introduced. Times are good &ndash; if they are complaining now, what would they be doing if the employment position was not so favourable?</P>
    <P>I am suspicious of some employers. The enforcement of this measure will have to be supervised. Some employers' organisations are taking a liberal stance and allowing asylum seekers to join their workforces. It is not because they have any humanitarian interest in asylum seekers but because they want a cheaper source of labour. We must monitor this. There are rules regarding work permits but we all know there are people who should not be working who are in jobs in the black economy and are being exploited by employers. I am not against people earning a few pounds from menial night work. I am not preaching, but I am concerned that some employers who will be unable to exploit our workers will exploit this other source.</P>
    <P>They will have to move to this other resource, as they would call it, to exploit them. We have to monitor that and ensure it does not happen. Certain employers are always on the lookout for ways to manipulate their employees to make more money out of them.</P>
    <P>I have certain other concerns. We are introducing a minimum rate of pay, but is there a downside to that? The home helps have been mentioned by other speakers. They will get a considerable increase on 1 April this year, which is welcome, but people in that category will have to realise that if they are paid a proper rate for that job in the future, it will be regarded as a salary. If people were local authority tenants, their income from home help work was inclined to be ignored and not regarded as legitimate money. If the rate of pay for a job improves, people cannot continue to have all the concessions that might have been provided in the past.</P>
    <P>I am concerned also about community employment schemes. I have complained previously in this House about what I see as an unfair practice in that some people can participate in a CE scheme while keeping their FÁS money and their social welfare payment, be it lone parent's allowance, invalidity pension or whatever. Everybody on a CE scheme should be treated equally. They get £30 or £40 per week over and above their social welfare payment for doing the 20 hours rather than the current system where some people get £18 extra while others get £90 extra. Will this anomaly now be extended in that people who get their FÁS and social welfare payments can say they get the minimum rate of pay for their FÁS job? Is that covered in any of the sections? I have not noticed it but if it is, that will increase <Col N="1200" /> the anomaly that currently exists. If that is happening the whole CE scheme should be examined and perhaps this is a time to reform it. It would be extraordinary if, in introducing this welcome measure, we extended an anomaly and did nothing about it. If that potential problem is ahead of us, we should address it now and perhaps reform the whole CE scheme in the process. It is under the remit of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and I ask the Department to take a broader view and realise that what it is doing has resulted in certain pitfalls which should be eliminated.</P>
    <P>Many people have expressed concerns about what is and is not reckonable income, but that does not mean the Bill is flawed. The reference to tips in the Schedule is ridiculous. I am inclined to think that the Minister will withdraw or change that on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not stand up at all or else we should mount an information campaign to inform people that there is no longer any point in giving tips, that they are subsidising the employer and not the employee.</P>
      <P>I understand the reason for including the measure on bonuses, etc. but it will cause a problem with motivation in some industries. There is a danger that employees will say they are entitled to their £4.40 per hour for sitting in their place of work all day and might demand a bonus if they are asked to do something. This will cause individual problems and I hope that workers and employers will act sensibly in this regard.</P>
      <P>On the question of the unsociable hours premium, a narrow unsociable hours premium should be excluded but people now get shift payments and unsociable hours premiums even if they only work the unsociable hours once in every four weeks, or something like that. The definition of &ldquo;unsociable hours&rdquo; is rather generous in some workplaces &ndash; it starts at 6 o'clock, 7 o'clock or 8 o'clock at night. If a person was working from 11 p.m. until 5 a.m. the next day, perhaps that rate of pay should be excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have a concern about public holiday, Saturday and Sunday premiums, perhaps not about Saturday premiums because that is a work day for many people. I am concerned about the way the public holiday and Sunday premiums might be implemented. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, who is in the Chamber, has been dealing with the question of Sunday trading in the retail trade. Is it possible that this measure will be used and abused and that the same young employees will have to work every Sunday? They <Col N="1201" /> might get £4.40 an hour on average but in reality they might only get £3.40 for the other hours they work during the week. There is a slight danger in that unless we can take it that every employer would be fair and reasonable, and that this would only refer to the odd Sunday. I can see this being abused and there should be some provision whereby it could not refer to the person who is working every Sunday because that is what is happening in the retail trade. Many of the people on the higher rate only work five or six days per week and do not work on Sunday, whether by their own choice or that of their employer. This measure should be tightened in some way.</P>
    <P>What is the necessity for the public holiday premium when they only arise now and again? We are all legally entitled to the public holiday premium. Most of us do not work on public holidays but if a person works, it is his or her right to be paid the premium. I can envisage employers having young, vulnerable workers working on those days and it will mean that their normal rate of pay would be less than the £4.40. Some of those reckonable components need to be tightened up. There might be another explanation for the way they appear in the Bill but as I read them, they are open to abuse.</P>

It is clear that the Government has introduced legislation, the substantive sections of which relating to the Schedule do not find favour with the Members who support it. The amendments which will be tabled in the name of my party and other parties will have the support of Government Deputies on Committee and Report Stages. I look forward to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wrong to divorce the issue of a national minimum wage from the issue of tax reform. Colleagues are currently debating Committee Stage of the Finance Act. They are looking at ways it can improve the working conditions and lives of people on low rates of pay. It is wrong to divorce the issues of pay from those of tax reform and conditions. If one is serious about doing something for low income earners, there are only two ways to improve their lot. One can either give them more money or reduce their tax burden. On the latter issue this Government has done virtually nothing for people on low pay. The proposal in the Finance Bill for taxing low income earners has given them an extra tax allowance of just £10. The tax allowance increase from £100 to <Col N="1202" /> £110 gives little relief to people in the lower paid sectors of the economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">

      <P>What about last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important point. Despite this being a time of great opportunity, in the budget the Government gave a paltry increase in the tax allowance for low paid workers. My party published its tax strategy late last year in which we proposed that people be allowed to earn the minimum amount of £170 before they should have to pay tax. The best way to improve the living conditions of the low paid is to take them out of the tax net altogether.</P>
      <P>It is wrong, from an economic and moral point of view, that people on the basic minimum wage of £170 per week should have to pay tax. The Fine Gael position on this is clear. There was an opportunity in this year's budget to substantially increase the tax allowance so people earning £170 per week or less will not pay tax. What did the Government do? It proposed a paltry tax allowance increase to £110 per week. I am aware of the commitment the Government has entered into under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. However, the period of time over which it will be implemented is too long. It should be implemented in this year's Finance Bill. It is wrong that people on the minimum wage of £170 per week are paying tax; it is wrong that they are paying tax on £60 of their salary. We have an opportunity now to do something about that.</P>
      <P>The minimum wage issue cannot be divorced from fiscal policy. Since this Government came into office, the gap between the wealthy and the poor has widened continuously. There has to be a serious discussion on the effect tax reductions have on people on low pay. The gap has widened in the past ten years because any attempt at tax reform ensures that high earners in the economy do substantially better each year. That is the result of the policies which have been adopted by successive Governments and it is something we must address.</P>
      <P>I oppose the minimum wage rate of £4.40 as set out in the recommendations made by the commission. It is unjustifiable that this rate should be set down in law and that it should be sustained in an economy which is currently going through an inflationary phase. The commission set up by the Government made its recommendations in 1998. How is it justifiable that the rate of £4.40 is regarded as appropriate for the national minimum wage two years later? It is nonsensical. The commission was asked to do a job and it did it. However, that recommendation is two years out of date. If it had been made for the year 2000, I might accept it but it was made for two years ago. It is unjustifiable, therefore, of the Government to argue that it is acting in line with the commission's recommendations.</P>

    <P>I am aware that, in the context of the negotiations with the social partners, the rate next year is to increase to £4.70 and to £5 in the year 2002. <Col N="1203" /> Once again, however, we do not know the inflationary difficulties we might encounter. Anybody with even a small knowledge of economics knows that when inflation increases, the people it affects most are people on fixed incomes, low wage earners and pensioners. Given the new inflationary difficulties in the economy and the fact that the commission's recommendations are now two years out of date, we must seriously consider increasing the minimum wage to at least £5 per hour. If we are serious about doing something substantive for the low paid, the commitment to £5 per hour should be part and parcel of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Look at the UK where the minimum wage is at least £4.70 in Irish punts. The gap between the UK and Ireland is already visible and one could argue that it is cheaper to live in parts of the UK than in Ireland. We must increase the rate to at least £5 per hour, a recommendation which has also been made by ICTU.</P>
    <P>The Schedule of the Bill deals with reckonable components in determining whether employers are paying the minimum wage. As has been said by other speakers, this is where the Bill is fundamentally flawed. It is wrong that the reckonable components should include shift premia, unsociable hours premia, tips and public holiday, Saturday and Sunday premia. These will have to be deleted from the Bill on Committee Stage. It is unfair that the small amount of tips earned by people in the service sector should be part of determining whether an employer is paying a minimum wage. It is equally wrong that people who give up their Sundays to work, at huge expense to themselves and their families, or people who work on public holidays and earn two days pay for doing so, should have their resulting earnings calculated as reckonable components in determining if they are paid the minimum wage. This provision must be carefully examined to make the Bill more fair and to put it on a sounder footing.</P>
    <P>The shift premia, tips and unsociable hours premia mentioned in this Bill are not included in the UK legislation. There is a gap, therefore, between the two labour markets. The UK labour market has a minimum wage, as is now being introduced here, but there are substantial differences in how the minimum wage can be determined on the basis of reckonable components. We will have to follow the UK legislation in this respect particularly in view of the close proximity of the two labour markets. This issue must be dealt with and the Schedule must be amended on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>If the Minister of State is gracious enough to accept Opposition amendments, he will be doing a good day's work.</P>
    <P>I know many people in my constituency on low pay. They are people who left school at 16 or 17 and who did not undergo the full senior cycle. They will always be in low paid jobs because they do not have the educational qualifications and training required to find better paid jobs. I know <Col N="1204" /> of one case which highlights the problems in the labour market. A 21 year old man I know has had three jobs in the past two years. It is easy to change jobs at present because of the flexibility in the labour market. He has decided to stay with his new employer, a security company, because it was the first to offer him training. He will go on a six month training course in the security industry and his employer will give him the time off for that and will pay for the course. That employer is showing responsibility for that young man. He realises that, if he is ever to get a sense of corporate responsibility, he will have to offer better terms and conditions of work.</P>
    <P>The message which must come from the House as it debates this legislation is that employers have substantial responsibilities to improve the working conditions of people on low pay and that it will not be done merely by setting a minimum hourly rate of pay but by other measures such as training opportunities, allowing people time off to be close to their children, affording people opportunities to partake in sports and leisure and providing crèche facilities for their children. It is not just the issue of pay, and employers must face this reality. If a new form of responsibility is to be developed between employer and employee, employers must improve the conditions in the factory-place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It affords me the opportunity to mention that. The young man I know is staying with his employer because he is being given training and educational opportunities for the first time. Employers will have to go that route in future. Many of the great firms in Dublin went this route. Guinness at the turn of the century provided employees with homes, food, health insurance and proper sports and leisure facilities. That is what we must encourage and, if people are serious about developing corporate responsibility in this area, we will have to encourage employers to provide these opportunities for people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other speakers referred to the expansion in the labour market and the fact that the labour force has grown by an additional 600,000 people from 1.1 million to 1.7 million. The best way to deal with poverty is to remove people from social welfare and get them back to work. One of the downsides is that there is a considerable amount of poaching in that young people are being encouraged to forgo their education at 17 or 18, not to proceed with the senior cycle, to leave school and take up a low paid job in the economy. They will be the new poor because if there is an economic downturn in future, which inevitably there will be, these people will quickly lose their jobs and will not have the experience or training opportunities to sustain the type of shocks the economy will suffer. I understand that about 20% of people in schools do not go through the senior cycle. We <Col N="1205" /> must track that 20%, provide them with educational opportunities and give them the space for study to ensure they are not poached from the education system because it is the only opportunity they will have of improving their lot. It is an insidious development which has emerged recently in the labour market.</P>
    <P>There is also a new problem whereby part-time and low paid work is encouraging more students out of full-time education. We all know of such cases in our constituencies and it is manifestly the case in every school where children of 15, 16 or 17 work Thursday and Friday nights and all day Saturday in supermarkets. How do they find the time for study and recreation? It is a serious issue which must be addressed because employers cannot be allowed to poach children from schools. It is a worrying development. Perhaps the Minister of State will collaborate with his colleagues in Government to see if something can be done in this area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the concept of a minimum wage and the fact that we will set a minimum ceiling for wages in the economy. However, the amounts set out are too low and unrealistic given inflationary pressures and they must be negotiated upwards. The Schedule to the Bill must be amended on Committee Stage because it is fundamentally unfair. I hope the Government will be open on Committee Stage to accepting the amendments to which I referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. It is high time that a minimum wage was set across the board. Minimum wages have been set in various sectors for some time, such as the hotel and catering sector where the wages are especially low. Enforcement of the laws in that sector is haphazard and many employees do not receive the rates of pay laid down. People regularly visit my clinics with various difficulties with tax and other matters. When we investigate their wages, we often discover that they are not aware that minimum wages apply to the sector in which they work. Part of the regulations for those sectors state that minimum wage rates should be displayed where employees can see them. I am not sure to what extent that is complied with. If those rates were displayed where employees could see them, it would go a long way towards helping the situation. It is something which must be addressed and when the Bill is enacted, I hope there will be additional enforcement to ensure employees know the position. The hotel and catering sector is one for which I foresee difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another group which receives low pay is shop workers, especially part-time shop workers who work a few hours a week. A new group of people known as franchisers is emerging in the grocery sector. Will they be covered by the legislation? They operate franchises within shops. They are employed by large companies like Coca Cola to stack supermarket shelves and are paid a certain rate for doing the job regardless of how long it <Col N="1206" /> takes. Young people who take on such jobs have to work long hours to do the job required. How will the minimum wage be applied in that sector where a great deal of exploitation exists?</P>
    <P>While mushroom pickers are entitled to the minimum agricultural workers' wage, many of them are not aware of their entitlements. During a radio interview about 12 months ago I stated that mushroom pickers are entitled to the minimum agricultural wage, holiday pay, and so on, and I was astounded at the response. Very few people working in the industry were aware that they were entitled to a minimum wage and many of them were not receiving it. A system of performance pay, whereby people are paid for the amount of work they do, has crept into that sector. How will the new minimum wage apply to that sector? If mushroom pickers are paid by the quantity of mushrooms they pick and that is below the minimum wage per hour, will they be entitled to a top-up under this legislation? We need clarification on that issue.</P>
    <P>We also need to examine the position of petrol pump attendants and car washers. The car washing industry is mushrooming with many young people operating power washers in the evenings and at weekends. How will the Minister ensure such young people are not exploited? </P>
    <P>On an unrelated matter, I thank the Minister of State for his initiative in postponing the regulations on kerbside petrol pumps. I hope there will be a worthwhile conclusion to this matter by the end of the year and that those who operate such petrol pumps, particularly in rural areas, will not be put out of business. If the kerbside regulations were introduced as initially intended huge areas of the countryside would not be serviced by petrol pumps. I hope the Minister of State's good work in this area will not be suspended. I am going off on a tangent, but this came to mind while speaking about petrol pump operators.</P>
    <P>The State is responsible for low pay to those who provide the home help service. These people are the human face of the Department of Health and Children and society in general in that they provide a service to many housebound people who are unable to look after themselves. The rate of pay they receive is derisory. The Midland Health Board recently agreed that on the introduction of the minimum wage people in the home help sector would be paid accordingly. However, there may be a shortage of money and I suspect the number of hours worked by such people will be reduced to compensate for the increase in wages. That would be intolerable and an insult to the recipients who generally receive the service for only one hour per day. The hours of contact with these people should be extended. The Minister of State should stipulate that there should be not be a reduction in hours worked by home helps because of the introduction of the minimum wage.</P>
    <P>The hairdressing sector will also encounter difficulties with the introduction of the minimum wage. I was approached recently by a hairdresser <Col N="1207" /> who employs two young trainees and pays them £60 each a week. She is concerned about what she will do when the new rate is introduced. While there is provision for paying reduced rates, from her point of view trainees are of little use to her during the first eight to ten months of training. They can sweep the floor, stack towels, and so on, but their contributions in terms of enhancing the service and bringing in returns are very small. She feels she will have to reduce the number of hours worked by these people and employ them only at busy times. We need to address this area.</P>
    <P>One of the great difficulties with people on low pay relates to taxation. We slip into the taxation net very quickly in this country. A single person does so after earning only £110 per week. Fine Gael proposes that people on the minimum wage should not pay tax up to approximately £170.</P>
    <P>I was contacted recently by a couple making up their annual returns. The husband runs a small business and the wife is a carer in the home on the reduced rate of £42 per week. She wanted to know if she had to include the carer's allowance for tax purposes. The £42 a week she receives will be taxed which will leave her with £32 a week. The irony of this is that she does not qualify for the PAYE allowance. Even though her carer's allowance is classified as pay for tax purposes, it is not classified as pay for the purpose of a PAYE allowance. This is something the Minister of State might bring to attention of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>Many Members, including some on the Government side, raised the question of including tips and bonuses as part of wages. That is ridiculous. It is a mean-minded provision and should be excluded from the Bill. It is also unfair to include work on Sundays and bank holidays.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister gets the message that this should be removed from the Bill.</P>
    <P>An increasing number of immigrants are getting work here in low paid jobs. What effort will we make to ensure they know the minimum rate of pay? I do not want to see immigrants used and abused by exploitative employers. There must be a concerted effort to ensure that people who work are paid the minimum rate.</P>

      <P>Although it has been a long time coming, I welcome the Bill in principle. For too long people, particularly vulnerable people, were exploited. This was particularly true during times of depression when there was a high level of unemployment. Our competitiveness has led to an improvement but people are still being exploited. Many of them do not have the capacity or the skills to move out of their areas of employ<Col N="1208" /> ment. Some people feel trapped, particularly those who are middle aged and close to retirement. Some people, particularly women, in the legal and accountancy professions, who do not have qualifications but have high levels of skills, are not paid a salary commensurate with their skills. They are often paid less than the proposed minimum wage.</P>
      <P>I got a telephone call this morning from a woman in employment who was extremely concerned about the fact that special payments are included. A person on the basic pay of £130 who gets a shift allowance of £42 will receive a total payment of £172. However, a person on the basic pay of £130 who does not get a shift allowance will now receive the same total payment as the person who gets a shift allowance because of the introduction of the minimum wage. The Minister must reconsider the inclusion of tips, gratuities and overtime payments because it is unfair. It will also cause difficulties for companies. The solution must be to exclude allowances for working unsociable hours.</P>
      <P>I do not share the concerns expressed by employers about the minimum wage because our competitiveness has already resulted in the minimum wage being paid by many of them. Employers must pay to get staff. People, particularly women under 25 years of age, are still being exploited in some places. It is not acceptable, for example, that home helps, who do excellent work in the community and save our health services substantial sums of money, are paid between £2 and £3.50 per hour.</P>
      <P>There is no point in introducing this legislation if it is not enforced. The 1946 Act outlined areas of employment where minimum wages should be paid. However, that was not enforced because the personnel was not available in the inspectorate. It is wrong for anyone to suggest that the 1946 Act was successful in ensuring that people who worked in the catering and hairdressing industries, for example, got a minimum wage. We did not see advertisements informing people of their right to a minimum wage as was provided for in that Act. I hope the Minister introduces amendments and accepts Opposition amendments on Committee Stage which will ensure that the Bill is effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concern was expressed about training courses. Training can be interpreted differently depending on the organisation. I worked for 23 years in training in industry. What is often labelled as training on the factory floor might not be so as the person involved could be performing at the level of other operators, but it is labelled &ldquo;training&rdquo;  because of a time constraint on the course. For example, it takes 12 months to become effective and efficient in a certain motor activity, whether it be assembly or disassembly, as I was involved in, in the meat industry. By imposing a time for training on something, for example, three years, even though the person might be effective after one year, because the training course runs for three years, the principles of the <Col N="1209" /> Bill could be circumvented because under the Bill 75% of the minimum wage need only be paid for the first 12 months, 80% for the second 12 months and 90% for the third 12 months. There should be strict guidelines on the interpretation and evaluation of training.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with the question of people with low skills and those who remain unemployed because they are middle aged and unskilled. People, regardless of their age, can be trained as long as the right area of expertise is chosen for them. Training involves motor skills, but it also involves people's attitudes. Attitudinal training is very important. People who partook in community employment schemes have stated that they did not receive proper skills training in many areas. I do not accept that because the success of community employment schemes often has more to do with attitudinal training than training in motor skills. People who worked on community employment schemes were reintroduced to the workforce and gained confidence in themselves following years of believing that they were unemployable.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that people are unemployable. The challenge we face is to bring the people to whom I refer back into the workforce. We should not be saying to unskilled people who reach 50 and who lose their jobs because they have been replaced by machines that we do not need them. We need to encourage these people to retrain for their own well-being and that of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the National Minimum Wage Bill. I agree with the Government's decision to introduce a minimum wage but it is sad that it has decided to tax that wage. I applaud the idea of a minimum guaranteed income &ndash; this is probably the rationale behind a minimum wage in the first instance &ndash; but it makes no sense to establish a rate of pay and then decide to claw some of it back in order to further stuff the State's coffers. The Government has scored an own goal. I call on the Minister for Finance, possibly on Report Stage of the Finance Bill, to change his approach and exempt people on the minimum wage from paying tax.</P>
      <P>My other criticism of the Bill is the haste with which it is being pushed through the Oireachtas. I accept that this is due to the deadline of 1 April which has been set for the introduction of the minimum wage. However, the authorities in Britain have decided to increase the rate of the minimum wage in that country from £3.60 to £3.70 with effect from next October. They have given everyone involved &ndash; employers, workers, administrators etc. &ndash; almost seven months to prepare for a 10p increase in the minimum wage. Here we will be lucky if we have seven weeks to prepare people for the initial introduction of the entire concept of the minimum wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was about the short timescale involved that the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, the only national body which initially accepted the prin<Col N="1210" /> ciple of a national minimum wage, complained. I accept that the Tánaiste and others have stated that the introduction of this legislation has been flagged for some time. However, the detail of the legislation was not known. We are not even sure when Committee Stage of the Bill will be taken. It was originally to have been taken tomorrow but I understand it may be postponed. Therefore, we still do not know when Committee Stage will be taken. The Government's handling of this vital issue has been slipshod and I wonder how serious it is about the legislation.</P>
    <P>Ireland is one of the last countries in Europe to introduce a national minimum wage. What impact will that wage have on employment when it is introduced? We know that different countries have different minimum rates and we also know that the higher the rate, the greater impact it will have on young people and job creation.</P>
    <P>The greatest problem employers face at present is shortage of skilled workers and many of them have difficulty attracting suitably qualified people. The Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs is present in the House and I ask him to consider ways of training older people. We need to start putting in place mechanisms to allow us to train older workers. Perhaps the Minister of State will encourage the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to ensure that the staff of his Department begin treating unemployed people with civility. Such people are receiving letters informing them that their payments are being stopped because they are not available for work. They are given no prior warning and they must undergo a long appeals process before their payments are restored. That is ridiculous. The Government is using a stick instead of a carrot. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs should appoint officers who will interact with and encourage unemployed people and identify vacancies in the workforce for them. In the main, these are the people who will be affected by the introduction of the national minimum wage.</P>
    <P>There are different types of workers in our society at present. There are those working in high-tech and multinational industries who are earning substantial wages. Increasing numbers of workers are being sucked into companies involved in these industries, and that is fine so long as the sector is performing well. However, if there is a downturn we will be in serious trouble. Indigenous Irish companies are competing for workers with those involved in the sector to which I refer. Whereas in the large multinational sector between 5% and 10% of a company's turnover might be spent on wages, in the small indigenous sector this might be as high as 80%.</P>
    <P>In introducing a national minimum wage we must consider the supports we can give to small Irish businesses. There is a danger that small companies might decide it is cheaper to buy a machine than to pay someone the national minimum wage. That is not because they are mean, it is because their survival is based on economic <Col N="1211" /> necessity. We must consider the full impact of the national minimum wage. I call on the Minister of State to ensure that a system is established immediately to monitor its impact on all companies in all sectors. That is very important and I see no provision for it in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another step we must take immediately is to ensure that information is readily available to employees and employers in respect of the national minimum wage. Information on rights and entitlements must be made available to every worker who is likely to be affected. We must also put in place supports for workers in the event that they may wish to make complaints. For example, if they wish to bring an employer before a tribunal or a court they must know to whom they can go for advice. Many of these workers who will be on the minimum wage do not have the requisite skills, the wherewithal or the knowledge and they will be approaching the Minister of State and me to seek help.</P>
    <P>The other difficulty with the Bill is that the introduction of the national minimum wage will increase the burden of red tape imposed on employers. We must be careful that we do not smother small companies with red tape. Perhaps the Minister of State will indicate in his reply the action he intends to take to ensure that this does not happen.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Defence Forces are not catered for under the Bill. It is sad there is no recognition of the long hours many soldiers and sailors work. We must remember that these people have families and expenses. Everyone is aware that the Army and Naval Service are experiencing difficulties in recruiting staff because they are also competing with other sectors in terms of attracting employees. That is a major problem.</P>
    <P>The inspectorate is inadequate and we need more inspectors than are provided for. While I welcome the increase, it should be monitored very carefully. If there is a need to increase the number of inspectors, it should be done sooner rather than later. These inspectors have many functions under labour law apart from the national minimum wage. This will place a huge additional burden on the inspectorate which is already understaffed. The additional inspectors will only serve to allow the inspectorate to carry out its current functions. However, we are now adding a further burden with this Bill. That must be looked at very carefully and addressed.</P>
    <P>I agree with my colleagues who spoke about tips and bonuses, which are excluded. That is mean-minded and perhaps we can look at it on Committee Stage. Voluntary bodies often depend on people who work for low wages. It has been said that they may be particularly hard hit by the introduction of a minimum wage. I am not saying such bodies should pay below the minimum wage. However, we should be aware of the impact this may have on voluntary associations, such as groups working with the disabled and the less for<Col N="1212" /> tunate. The Government should look at a way of assisting voluntary bodies to offset the introduction of the minimum wage. Will au pairs be covered by this legislation?</P>
    <P>I look forward to Committee Stage. When will Committee Stage be taken?</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to participate in this debate. As the previous speaker indicated, the schedule for delivering the commitment contained in the Programme for Government to introduce a national minimum wage by 1 April 2000 is very tight. However, I have no doubt, particularly with Opposition support for the Bill and its implementation by 1 April, we can achieve that. As Chairman of the Select Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, which will be dealing with Committee Stage, I have been asked when that Stage is likely to be taken. A tentative date was set for tomorrow. If the Bill passes Second Stage today, I have no doubt we can accommodate it tomorrow. If not, it will be taken next week. Let us see how far we can progress today. As Chairman of the select committee, I will do all I can to accommodate Committee Stage. I am sure, with the support of the House, we will be able to deal with any issues that might arise on Committee Stage as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I place great importance on the Bill. There is exploitation of certain people in the workforce. The Bill will ensure that a large percentage of the workforce, especially the lower paid, will secure a reasonable increase after 1 April in their hourly pay that should reflect the current economic climate and their participation.</P>
      <P>We recognise the tremendous transformation of our country and economy in recent years. We have gone from a period of economic struggle when we joined the EEC to the current position. Our efforts have been crowned by a success which was almost unimaginable in those days. Our economic success is viewed jealously by our EU partners.</P>
      <P>Many people have gained from that success, but not everybody. Regrettably, some people who never failed to participate have been excluded and marginalised with regard to personal economic gain. The Bill is an attempt to help those low paid workers but, of course, it will not include everybody. The last speaker referred to the position of au pairs. I would be interested to hear from the Minister if any study has been done on people participating at that level in the economy. There are many people working in homes throughout the country who are not earning a reasonable salary or paying PRSI and other contributions, which it would be in their interest to do. However, that matter is for another day. I would welcome it if the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs considered that vast issue. I believe there are abuses in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious of the huge amount of voluntary contributions made in society, particularly for people with disabilities and the elderly. I pay par<Col N="1213" /> ticular tribute to participants in the home help service who have done tremendous work throughout the country. I acknowledge the contribution in my constituency of people who go far beyond the call of duty in giving the necessary support to those in need. I pay tribute to every home help and the organisers of the service in the Dublin North Central constituency. They do a tremendous job.</P>
    <P>However, I am disappointed that the funding authority for the home help service is currently proposing to pay the basic minimum rate of £4.40 per hour. This is referred to in other areas in the Bill but I want to focus on home helps. There is no recognition of the important job they do. There is no training or support for such home helps. Some people require the home help service late at night and at weekends. Home helps must work unsocial hours because elderly people, for example, might require assistance in the early hours of the morning to get out of bed or have breakfast at any time between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m. They might again require assistance at lunch-time, tea-time and between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. That would mean a home help would have to work four or five shifts throughout the day. The home help might also call to such individuals outside those hours to see how they were.</P>
    <P>Such an input cannot be costed. A set £4.40 per hour cannot be put on such commitment and unsocial hours because it warrants special recognition. The first move the Minister should make with regard to unsocial hours should be for the home help service. The entire community benefits from such tremendous participation.</P>
    <P>There is reference in Part 1 of the Schedule to the public holiday premium. It is unacceptable to make that an ingredient of the minimum wage. I ask the Minister of State to table an amendment in this regard on Committee Stage. It is appropriate that people are given a premium for working on public holidays and other such work, but it should not be included in their minimum wage. The Minister should acknowledge this point and make a public announcement in this regard as early as possible, even before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Many Members worked in pubs, shops or wherever while studying and the money earned helped them through college. One assessment of how well one did one's job was the level of tips one received and I was shocked to see that tips are to be considered as reckonable income under the Bill. The Minister should look at the effect of such a provision. I do not know how it would be implemented or controlled and it is a farce. Legislation or regulations introduced should be practical, pragmatic and logical. We are taking from the real issue by asking people how much they earn in tips or other benefits. We should look at the hourly rate of pay and strike an acceptable rate but make separate provision for unsociable aspects of work and public holidays. When considering the basic hourly pay we have to protect employment so that we continue to enjoy our current competitiveness. There is a delicate balance <Col N="1214" /> to be struck and it is important that we strike the right balance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Stanton raised the issue of skills shortages. We need to take stock of the current situation in which we talk of full employment, yet people find it difficult to understand that over 200,000 are unemployed and on benefit. There are thousands of others in different categories such as those on pre-retirement, invalidity, disability and other such benefits.</P>
    <P>Employers are increasingly bringing to Members' attention the difficulties they face in obtaining skilled workers. It is time to take stock and make appropriate provision for future years concerning our skills needs. There are some moves concerning accommodating non-nationals in the workforce &ndash; I raised this point recently. The current procedures for issuing such permits are not user-friendly and do not accommodate the individual or company making an application. The long delays are totally unacceptable as these people have an important contribution to make. We need appropriate, user-friendly, easily accessible procedures so that we can avail of people with the necessary skills as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>We also need to look at the important issue of training. We need to have appropriate training, apprenticeship and other such courses and the Minister should examine the rates of pay for trainees. I am not sure what consultation has taken place in this regard. I have a vested interest in this issue in that my wife is in the hair and beauty business in which some employees are on relatively low rates of pay. However, most of these workers who qualify acquire a good skill. In the case of my wife's business, she has been able to retain the workers who trained with her.</P>
    <P>What consultations have taken place with the appropriate training and apprenticeship authorities such as the Irish Hairdressers Federation and others? Are we satisfied that we are striking the right balance as regards ensuring that those on training courses will not be disenfranchised by the level of contribution required to give them the skills and appropriate supports during their training and apprenticeship so that, at the same time, they can enjoy an appropriate wage which reflects their contribution to the workplace? The Minister and the Minister of State are trying to ensure that we strike the right balance in ensuring that we protect employment and competitiveness, but we must do so across the board. I welcome the Bill and look forward to Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>This legislation is a con and is one of the most dishonest Bills to come before the House in a long time. We are being told that it will introduce a national minimum wage which will start at £4.40 per hour. In effect, the Bill does <Col N="1215" /> nothing of the kind as the small print takes away whatever benefit there would have been in such a rate.</P>
      <P>If a legislative stunt such as this was being pulled on the better off, the Press Gallery would be full, there would be television crews on the plinth interviewing Fianna Fáil backbenchers and the telephones, fax machines and e-mails would be hopping with outrage. However, this stunt is being pulled on some of the poorest in society. These are people we meet every day, hairdressers, shop assistants, petrol station attendants and those engaged in the caring professions. These people are not being told by those who should be telling them that this Bill will not give them a minimum wage of £4.40 per hour but much less than that.</P>
      <P>The definition of hours worked includes holidays and any period of sick pay. An average worker gets four weeks holidays and may be sick for one or two weeks in the year. Under the Bill such a worker's pay will be reduced by 10% so the national minimum wage is already less than £4 per hour. The Schedule indicates that the £4 rate will include a range of benefits which most workers consider as extras on top of their basic pay. It includes a shift premium. Such premia can be over 30% in some cases and will be factored in. It will also include unsociable hours so, for example, a petrol pump attendant or someone working in a 24-hour shop being paid extra because they are working nights or on Sundays, will have their premia included in the national minimum wage. It includes productivity payments such as piece rates, incentive rates, commissions and bonuses.</P>
      <P>Workers in the clothing or construction industries who are paid piece rates in relation to productivity will see those payments taken into account. The minimum wage will also include any amount distributed to the employee in tips, gratuities and service charges. When we go into a restaurant, if the bill says that there is a service charge of 12.5%, the proceeds of that service charge go toward making up the national minimum wage. When those factors are taken into account, the national minimum wage is a total con. There will not be a £4.40 per hour national minimum wage. The minimum wage provided for in this Bill is at best £3 per hour for most of those workers. It is utterly dishonest for the Government to publicise the idea that it is about to give workers a national minimum wage of £4.40.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the criticism of the £4.40 figure. It is less than the Minimum Wage Commission recommended some time ago. If one updated the figure it recommended it would be closer to £5, the amount which trade unions and voluntary organisations agree should be paid. The low paid worker will not even get £4.40. That is the ultimate con in the Bill. It is a shameful act on the part of the Government to introduce a Bill that is so dishonest. It pulls the wool over the eyes of those on low incomes who do not get rent allow<Col N="1216" /> ance for their accommodation. Those in private rented accommodation face rents of at least £100 per week but they will not be able to pay them on this national minimum wage.</P>
    <P>If all that was not enough, the Minister claims the right to set the minimum wage at any level and to take into account a range of factors when setting it, such as interest rates and the effect on employment and industry. She even claims the right to unilaterally vary a recommendation of the Labour Court in setting the minimum wage.</P>
    <P>The wage itself is virtually unenforceable. If a worker is not paid it he has, in theory, the right to go to a rights commissioner, but he can only go to a rights commissioner if he has asked his employer to give him a statement in writing detailing his hourly rate of pay. If the employer does not give him the statement in writing he can be prosecuted. If the employer is prosecuted and the matter is taken before the courts, the rights commissioner is prevented from hearing a complaint while it is being processed. The enforcement and dispute processes provided for cannot be enforced.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a con. The poorest people in society are being tricked by the Government into believing that a national minimum wage is being introduced when nothing of the sort is about to happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Low paid workers have awaited this legislation with some hope, but unfortunately they have been conned, sold a pig in a poke. They will not get the national minimum wage they have been led to believe they would. This Bill must be amended if it is to be effective in guaranteeing the rights of the lowest paid workers.</P>
      <P>The debate on the introduction of the legislation has centred on the rate of pay and the date of its introduction. This focus has been too narrow and has avoided crucial points, such as policing the rate and ensuring there is an adequate complaints procedure for those who wish to report breaches of the legislation.</P>
      <P>This Bill, which purports to be pro-worker, is fundamentally flawed. It is punctuated by cop-outs and opt-outs for employers and it broadens the definition of a minimum wage to include service pay, premium rates for unsociable hours and productivity based pay such as commission and bonuses. If this Bill is passed unamended, it will create some very hostile workplaces where employers will use every trick in the book to maintain low wages. The introduction of a national minimum wage on this basis will affect the lowest paid sectors, contract cleaners, home helps, restaurant and shop workers and a host of other occupations which are dominated by women and others who have been disadvantaged, such as early school leavers and those with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of these people's jobs are not just low paid, they offer little security of employment, atypical work arrangements, lack of pension provision and few rights for paid leave. This legis<Col N="1217" /> lation is not about making the workplace better for these people.</P>
    <P>The Government's record in enhancing conditions for workers has been abysmal. Since the debate on Second Stage commenced yesterday, those on the Government benches have continued to mention that the last Administration made no attempt to introduce a minimum wage. The reality is that the record of the last Government in worker protection was far better and reflected the demands of workers. The Organisation of Working Time Act and the Protection of Young Persons in Employment Act were just two of the major reforms introduced by Eithne Fitzgerald as Minister with responsibility for labour affairs. In Opposition the Labour Party published and introduced the Trade Union Recognition Bill, the Protection of Shop Workers Bill and the Health, Safety and Welfare (Amendment) Bill. This record belittles the Government's half hearted attempts to improve the workplace.</P>
    <P>When the Minimum Wage Commission produced its report two years ago, the Labour Party made it clear that the introduction of the wage would only be of real benefit if it was matched by tax cuts for the low paid. Like most workers, the low paid care more about what they take home in their pocket; they are not concerned about the gross payment which they only see on their pay slips. The tax cuts announced in the budget failed to consider the importance of a low tax take from the low paid. The budget had a clear focus, to give more to high income earners and give as little as possible to the low paid. How can the Government tell the House that it is proposing this Bill in the name of the low paid while it is prepared to give as little as possible to low income earners in terms of tax reductions? The effect of the tax changes in the budget was to give a single person on the minimum wage a miserable £3.50 per week in tax cuts. A person on the handsome salary of £50,000 was bought by the Government for £25.60 per week in concessions. Against this backdrop, the will of the Government to help the low paid is questionable.</P>
    <P>The provisions for enforcement and policing of the minimum wage are seriously flawed. The policing function is being handed over to the labour inspectorate attached to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Despite the decision of the Government to increase the number of inspectors to 16, this remains inadequate. More inspectors are needed to police existing legislation, never mind the minimum wage. A separate minimum wage inspectorate should be established and, given that many of the likely breaches of the legislation will take place in the service sector, which operates at its peak after office hours, this inspectorate should be active during unsociable hours.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not contain adequate provision for a complaints procedure. Making it necessary for an employee to obtain a written statement of hourly pay rates from their employer before pur suing a complaint with the rights commissioner is <Col N="1218" /> a means of discouraging workers from exercising their right to complain.</P>
    <P>The majority of workers targeted by the legislation are in poorly regulated employment with few rights. In the main they are not represented by a trade union and making a complaint in the first instance is very difficult. This requirement should be removed if there is to be an effective complaints procedure. As a way of strengthening it, I suggest the establishment of a minimum pay unit attached to a telephone hotline. This unit could provide workers and employers with information on all aspects of the legislation, as well as being in a position to advise workers on how they could pursue a complaint. I understand that such a unit was established in the UK following the introduction of the minimum wage there and the demands on it underlines its importance.</P>
    <P>Other speakers referred to the importance of implementation and policing and the need to let people know of their rights under the legislation. The people who will be covered often do not have access to the kind of information they need to vindicate their rights. We are concerned here with those who have benefited the least from the current prosperity. They should have been given a great deal more than what is on offer in this Bill. It needs to be seriously amended before it can represent a base line of equal rights in terms of wages.</P>
    <P>Home helps and other such workers are abysmally badly paid by the various health boards. The boards should be given an appropriate allocation so that they can pay their home helps a decent income without having to take money from other parts of the health service. This is a Government commitment. Allocations should be provided to ensure that those who are currently paid below the minimum wage in public service employment or in jobs paid by the public purse are properly paid without the money being taken from another sector of society.</P>
    <P>We are very disappointed with this legislation, which we thought would offer a base line equality measure for people in employment. That will not now be delivered and I urge the Minister to consider the points made in the House and those that will be raised on Committee and Report Stages. This is an opportunity that must be grasped in a way that will ensure some degree of equalisation in our society. While the rich have become richer, unfortunately the poor have been left behind. The tax measures in the budget have cemented the difference in our society and this legalisation, which could have offered so much, has not offered what we hoped for. I urge the Minister to accept amendments that will make the legislation effective in terms of equality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the principle of the Bill. The two previous speakers ably pointed out its deficiencies, nevertheless, it establishes an important principle. Given the economic situation, now is the time to introduce it. As recently <Col N="1219" /> as five years ago it would have been very difficult to do so, but the economy is now robust enough to take it. I also welcome the commitments to increase the hourly rate over the next two years. Coupled with the increases provided for in the PPF the lower paid will be better rewarded and will be better motivated than previously, when it was as attractive to stay on social welfare.</P>
      <P>I addressed the issue of taxation of the low paid in the debate on the Finance Bill. I referred to figures produced by CORI which demonstrated the unfair way in which the budget provisions were skewed in favour of the upper income earners. The Minister made a mistake here. He should have looked first at the lower paid and skewed the tax concessions towards them. The provision of an extra £10 per week in the tax free allowance was insulting in the context of his £1 billion giveaway. We reminded him of this during Committee Stage of the Finance Bill. I hope the Government will make a policy decision in the next budget that all of those earning the minimum wage of £170 per week will be exempt from income tax. That would make this legislation very effective.</P>
      <P>I come from the north eastern part of County Kerry, an area that was traditionally the farm belt of the county. Unfortunately, because of the decline in farming the buoyancy in the economy has suffered and we have been unable to rejuvenate it with new industries. The small industries in the region are under pressure to survive. I am very familiar with one company that was threatened with closure two years ago. I was able to put an arrangement in place to save it, but even then the company was only able to break even &ndash; that is all it wanted &ndash; by paying low wages. I contacted the company accountant before attending the House and he told me it was implementing the minimum wage from 1 March. This illustrates that the Bill is already having an impact.</P>
      <P>There will be job losses following the implementation of the minimum wage. People in robust economic areas, such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford, will find alternative employment. However, if employers in rural areas are forced to let people go alternative employment will not be readily available. This should be taken into consideration by decision makers.</P>
      <P>The Minister and other speakers mentioned the ESRI study on the impact of the implementation of the minimum wage which acknowledged that unemployment could increase by 14,000. Since then the economy has become even more buoyant and I hope that will not happen. However, it must be taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that income levels per head of population are approaching the EU average, it is important that this legislation be implemented. However, the Government must take account of possible negative factors, such as those pointed out in the ESRI report, and take appropriate action, in the same way as it has created the new <Col N="1220" /> BMW region under the national development plan.</P>
    <P>According to the ESRI, the average family on low income could gain £30 per week from the implementation of the minimum wage. That is substantial. The Minister said that 163,000 people will benefit. It is clear, therefore, that the legislation will provide a major boost to lower income groups. Given the proposals under the PPF and future budget commitments, the lower paid will get a better deal.</P>
    <P>The trend involving school children who go to work is a recent phenomenon. In the US it is natural for people attending high school and university to work two or three days per week. I see more and more of the school going population starting work at 14 years of age in tourism, restaurants, bars and the other places mentioned by previous speakers such as filling stations. Many of these people are working in the black economy. I know there will be supervision, but will it be sufficient at ground level to ensure control of the black economy? Many jobs in tourism are in the black economy and I wonder what assurances can be given in this regard. How can people in the black economy be penalised for not complying with the minimum wage? Is the Minister confident that there will be enough people on the ground to properly implement and supervise the minimum wage and ensure unscrupulous employers do not continue to exploit workers?</P>
    <P>This is just one of the many measures we must introduce to address low pay and a workforce which is at times not motivated. Profit sharing, employee share ownership and gain sharing must become par for the course if we are to continue to motivate the workforce and properly reward workers for their efforts. During the bleak periods in the 1980s and 1990s it was the low paid who drove the country forward. In particular, I refer to those working in the tourism industry. At a time when revenue from other sectors was declining, our tourism industry was improving with numbers of tourists increasing. The people involved in the related service industries were the lower paid and it is now payback time for them.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will respond to the number of legitimate issues raised by Deputy Gilmore. I am sure there is goodwill on the part of the Government, but it is important that people do not see the Bill as purely aspirational or a political gimmick, although I doubt it is. Following three years of consultation I feel this is a genuine effort to address the issue. I think the Government adopted the proper procedures by having the matter examined by an interdepartmental group, the ESRI, etc. Nevertheless, in order to ensure the credibility of the proposal the opt out clauses must be carefully examined. It must not be too easy for an employer to find excuses to opt out. No doubt employers may shorten working times as a way of ensuring they can pay people. Other methods, such as shortening opening hours, might also be considered. Such developments could change the ethos of country towns <Col N="1221" /> and the hospitality which we extend to tourists who find premises open at 10.00 a.m. There is a fear that employers may reduce their level of service because of an inability to pay the minimum wage. We must raise these legitimate questions which should be addressed by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for the broad welcome they have given the Bill. Some concerns were expressed that the time afforded for the debate may not be commensurate with the importance which Deputies attach to the issue. However, at design and drafting stages the Bill was the subject of lengthy consultation, first with the social partners and latterly with the parliamentary draftsman. In the normal course of events I would prefer if Parliament was granted as much time as it wished to reflect on draft legislation, but in current circumstances I intend to ensure that the deadline of 1 April is observed and I thank the Deputies who support that aim.</P>
      <P>I wish to express sincere thanks to ICTU, the unions and IBEC whose contributions throughout the preparation stage were considerable. There is no doubt that historically trade unions may have had different views on the merits of a national minimum wage system, but the clamour for action has been considerable in recent years, predating the commitment in the programme for Government. I also totally reject the contention by Deputies Gilmore and O'Sullivan that in some way the Bill is a con job. I think Deputy Deenihan has acknowledged this is not the case. It is a genuine effort by the social partners to deal with the problem of low pay and intensive consultation took place. In such circumstances some degree of compromise is necessary.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore also suggested that if it was a different Bill we would have a group of backbenchers speaking and making a bigger effort. I totally reject that. I have been here for the debate today and I note that a sizeable number of my colleagues spoke from considerable experience in their own areas, something I welcome.</P>
      <P>Deputies in their contributions identified sectors of the economy where low pay persists despite the existence of a booming economy. Deputy Ring pointed out that women workers suffer low pay disproportionately in comparison to male workers. Deputies Browne <i>(Wexford)</i> and Daly highlighted the fact that young workers are particularly vulnerable to low pay, especially those leaving school. Women and young workers have been identified by the ESRI impact study as the main beneficiaries of the implementation of the national minimum wage. Deputies Doherty and Noel Ahern referred to potential areas of abuse. Deputy McGrath among others raised the issue of immigrants. I wish to confirm that as employees they will have the same entitlements as other employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1222" /> Deputy Joe Higgins described the extent of workers subject to low pay as being of epidemic proportions. The ESRI impact study states that 13.5% of the workforce, some 160,000 employees, will benefit from the introduction of the national minimum wage on 1 April. Deputy Stanton among others also referred to this matter. The ESRI will be commissioning a follow-up survey. The Deputies also spoke about monitoring, which will be jointly carried out from the outset with the involvement of ICTU and IBEC.</P>
    <P>Market forces have improved wage levels, but the need for the Bill is still warranted, as Deputy Gerry Reynolds pointed out. The Deputy also said that the cost base for small enterprises has been increasing in recent years resulting in a reduction in margins, thereby eroding the incentive to employ workers. It is important that the economy remains competitive, as has been said time and again in the House, to continue to create wealth and expand employment. The provisions of the Bill and the initial national minimum wage rate strike the right balance to ensure employees are not exploited and that employment and competitiveness are not jeopardised. The ESRI impact study highlighted the potentially detrimental effect on the economy of introducing a national minimum wage. It is because of this potentially negative effect that I have included a provision for employers in financial difficulty, which was welcomed by Deputy Owen among others.</P>
    <P>Regarding the initial rate, employment impact was assessed by the ESRI, not on the basis of 1997 data, but on the basis of the 1997 findings being projected to 2000, on assumptions which were valid.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputies Hayes and Stanton who drew attention to the apparent dichotomy between introducing a national minimum wage and levying tax on it. The taxation provisions of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provide a response. Over the next two years the Government will introduce changes in taxation which will ensure all workers on a minimum wage will be taken out of the tax net entirely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>This, coupled with the changes relating to the rate of the minimum wage, will ensure that the low paid will benefit from our economic success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Owen referred to section 16 which provides for an employer paying an employee reduced rates if the employee has reached the age of 18 years and undergoes a prescribed course of study or training. The Deputy questioned whether a new employer could send an employee on a prescribed course of study or training if that employee had been paid the sub-minimum training rates by the previous employer. The National Minimum Wage Commission stated that the structure of the national minimum wage legislation should provide encouragement and induce<Col N="1223" /> ment for employers to take on unskilled staff and to involve them in training. Section 16 implements that recommendation. Under the section a new employer could send an employee on a prescribed course of study or training, whether the employee had previously been paid sub-minimum training rates. Deputy Owen stated that she has tabled an amendment to this section in order to prevent an employer from paying the sub-minimum training rates to an employee who had already been paid such rates by a previous employer and I will examine that in light of the commission's view on training offered by employers to unskilled employees.</P>
    <P>I share the concern of Deputy Hayes regarding the dangers of young people leaving the education system too early and taking up employment. The fear that young people may be sucked out of the education system lies behind the sub-minimum rates for young persons and new entrants. I am already co-operating with the Minister for Education and Science in seeking to ensure that students complete senior cycle at second level under other legislation.</P>
    <P>As regards reckonable and non-reckonable pay components in calculating the minimum hourly rate of pay, we have attempted to be responsive to several strands. According to the Minimum Wage Commission, legislation to introduce such a national minimum wage should take account of pay and other forms of remuneration along the lines of practices in employment regulation orders of the joint labour committees. It seemed that the commission wished to ensure that the pay arrangements operating in particular sectors would not have to be changed merely to comply with the particular statutory definition of pay.</P>
    <P>Having examined the scenario in the UK and discussed it extensively with the social partners, the interdepartmental group came to the conclusion that any premium paid to an employee in regard to his or her normal or standard working hours should count towards the national minimum wage. Any premium earned and paid to an employee for working hours in excess of such hours should be excluded from minimum wage pay. Thus, shift premium, unsociable premium, Saturday and Sunday premia and any payment in excess of basic pay for working on a public holiday should be included for minimum wage pay if earned in regard to the employees normal or standard working hours but overtime premia would be excluded.</P>
    <P>The line adopted in relation to benefits in kind, tips and gratuities and when they should be included was informed by reference to the relevant employment regulation orders. The Bill does not prohibit an employee from retaining a tip paid by a customer directly to him or her. However, if the employer distributes tips from a central fund managed by the employer, such payment is only reckonable if paid through the payroll. I listened carefully to the contributions of Members and I am prepared to consider reason<Col N="1224" /> able proposals for change on Committee Stage. Some Deputies noted the exclusion of certain categories, including the Defence Forces. The Bill follows the general line of labour legislation. The working time legislation also deals with this issue. However, I am also prepared to listen to reasoned arguments in regard to this matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputies Stanton and Callely raised the issue of au pairs. My advice is that in general au pairs are not employees. Deputies Carey, O'Flynn, McGrath, Stanton and O'Sullivan referred to an information campaign and, in particular, the questions of a help line and website. An intensive information and publicity campaign is planned as soon as possible after the legislation is enacted. It will encompass targeted television, radio and press advertising, a telephone help line, information leaflets distributed to and available from a broad range of sources and locations and a dedicated section of my Department's website will also be devoted to this issue.</P>
    <P>Deputies Rabbitte, Owen, Carey, Daly, Reynolds and Deenihan referred to the need for effective enforcement and policing of the national minimum wage. The need for additional resources for the labour inspectorate arising from the national minimum wage was acknowledged by both the National Minimum Wage Commission and the interdepartmental group. The Government has agreed to my proposal that the current number of inspectors should be increased from ten to 17 and three additional support staff are being assigned to the inspectorate, which is currently dealing extensively with the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996. The work organisation and targeting operations of the inspectorate have recently been revised to enable it deliver a more flexible enforcement service which will not be confined to office hours and will match the working hours of those sectors on which it focuses.</P>
    <P>Deputies raised the issue of the overtaking of the proposed rate of £4.40 per hour by market forces, given that that figure was first mentioned in April 1998. I remind them that the ESRI study undertaken in early 1999 was based on the impact of a rate of £4.40 per hour on the economy and employment in April 2000. The assumption made in early 1999 on the changes in the economy between then and April 2000 have been broadly accurate and the conclusion of the study in regard to employment, unemployment and inflation effects of the introduction of a national minimum wage are still valid. Some Members implied that a minimum rate of £4.40 per hour would not benefit many workers but the ESRI concluded that 163,000 workers would benefit on 1 April 2000.</P>
    <P>Deputies Owen and Rabbitte raised the issue of introducing specific anti-evasion measures. It is a matter of striking a balance between what is aspirational and what would constitute a new labour market rigidity. Above all, we want measures that will work in practice and I will pay heed to <Col N="1225" /> proposals on Committee Stage. Most Members raised the question of home help. I was particularly struck by Deputy Theresa Ahearn's reference to low rates of pay and travel allowances for this group. My understanding is that home helps will benefit fully from the provisions of this legislation with effect from 1 April.</P>

      <P>Section 4 of the Broadcasting Act, 1990, provides that I have the power <Col N="1226" /> to draw up and amend, from time to time as I think appropriate, codes governing standards, practice and prohibitions in advertising and other forms of commercial promotion in broadcasting.</P>
      <P>Chapter 14 of the current codes imposes a number of restrictions on advertisers with regard to advertising and children's programmes, including prohibitions on advertisements which exploit children's inexperience or credulity or advertisements which encourage minors to persuade their parents or others to purchase or make inquiries about goods or services being advertised. Chapter 14 reflects the requirement of Directive 98/522/EEC, the television without frontiers directive. I have no plans at present to introduce further restrictions in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the standards she has outlined are being adhered to in this country? Has she examined the situation which obtains in Sweden which has primary legislation prohibiting the direction of advertising at children under 12 years of age? Is the Minister satisfied that the standards which apply here are adequate and are being properly enforced?</P>

      <P>The Broadcasting Complaints Commission deals with possible breaches of the code which are investigated and adjudicated upon. Sweden will assume the Presidency of the EU in January 2001 and has had a prohibition on commercial advertising directed at children under 12 years of age since 1996.</P>
      <P>This prohibition has been diluted to a large extent because of the provisions of the television without frontiers directive which directs member states to ensure, among other provisions, freedom of reception and retransmission of television broadcasts from other member states. While Sweden has already expressed its intentions to seek an EU wide provision on children's advertising during its Presidency it is not clear how it will pursue this objective. However, I understand it is unlikely Sweden will secure an amendment to the television without frontiers directive between now and the end of its Presidency. The Department will continue to monitor developments in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister assure the House that any Swedish initiative in this regard will be supported by her and the Government? Will she comment on the practice of merchandising, whereby sportswear and sports equipment are advertised and their value is expressed by their designer name or by their identification with a football club and so on? In Sweden, such advertisements are banned from being shown directly before, after or during children's programmes. Is the Minister satisfied that undue pressure is not being exerted on children who in turn pass it on to their parents given that goods with an illusory added value are being bought by large numbers of consumers?</P>

      <P>Chapter 14.1 of the present code states that advertisers must exercise the utmost care and discrimination with regard to the content and presentation of advertisements transmitted during breaks within, near or adjacent to programmes designed for children. It also states that advertisements shall not exhort children to buy a product or service by exploiting their inexperience or incredulity. Chapter 14.3 states that advertisers shall not exploit the special trust minors place in parents, teachers or other persons. Chapter 14.4 states that advertisements shall not directly encourage minors to persuade their parents or others to purchase or make inquiries about the goods and services being advertised. Chapter 14.5 states that advertisements shall not unreasonably show children in dangerous situations. This code was revised in October 1999 to give effect to the provisions of the 1989 and 1996 directives dealing with the new definition of advertisements and the application of the restrictions to teleshopping. The Government is monitoring any proposals which may be made by Sweden when it assumes the Presidency.</P>

      <Quest>the reason for her recent statement concerning changes in the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, as published; her views on whether the Select Committee on Heritage and the Irish Language has spent several months considering this Bill under wrong assumptions; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the Adjournment debate of 23 February 2000 on newspaper reports relating to RTE's involvement in the new digital transmission entity during which the Minister of State, Éamon Ó Cuív, indicated that no fundamental change in policy has been proposed to Government. Nevertheless, as the Minister of State pointed out, certain difficulties have arisen in the structuring of the transaction and I am consulting with Cabinet colleagues as to the most appropriate way forward following which I may bring the matter to Government for decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I was disappointed that a priority question on another matter was not taken by the Minister, even if only she was to tell me it was the responsibility of another Department. The Minister could not be contacted in Los Angeles yet the Minister of State could read a statement from her regarding a fundamental change to the Broadcasting Bill. Will the Minister explain what is going on? This Bill was published last May &ndash; public statements were made and it was discussed on Second Stage, during Question Time and when dealing with the Estimates. It was stated that RTE would have a 40% shareholding in Digico, the company which will operate the new <Col N="1228" /> digital terrestrial television network. On the steps of the aeroplane, the Minister shone some light on the matter and she made a statement, which she clarified later, that a newspaper report was 70% true. Why has the Select Committee on Heritage and the Irish Language spent months dealing with this Bill under the false assumption that the national broadcaster would have a 40% share in Digico? Will the Minister explain to the House and her party colleagues on the committee what is going on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I left for Los Angeles, I said that certain difficulties regarding RTE's involvement in the digital infrastructure had arisen during the discussions, particularly those relating to the project management group. I said I was examining these issues and that when I had done so and consulted my Cabinet colleagues I would make a statement. I did not confirm or deny the statements made in some of the daily newspapers. I wish to take this opportunity to categorically state that on 22 July 1998 the Government decided that arrangements would be made for the introduction of digital terrestrial television and the separation of the existing transmission function from RTE. The subsequent entity, in which RTE would retain a stake, would be mandated to construct and operate the DTT infrastructure and promote the development of multi-media services and the information society.</P>
      <P>This decision also provided that the manner of the sale &ndash; the selection of the purchaser and the criteria for such-would be decided by the project management group, which is headed by my Department and also includes the Department of Finance, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Public Enterprise and RTE. In parallel with the publication of the Broadcasting Bill and its completion of Second Stage, the project management group has begun separating the transmission network from RTE and selecting the investor in the digital transmission entity envisaged by the Government decision. Given the importance and complexity of this task, the group selected a consortium of advisers, led by AIB, to manage the project to its conclusion under the direction of the group.</P>
      <P>An informative memorandum has been prepared and arrangements are being made to ensure the decisions of the project management group will be informed by the concerns of the staff of RTE who are likely to be transferred to the new digital transmission entity. The development of a transaction process which satisfies all the requirements of the project management group and the Government objectives to introduce digital terrestrial television has proved difficult and complex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the advice of the project management group, I am now considering the best way forward to establish a DTT platform and have sought the observations of my Cabinet colleagues. I hope to meet the RTE Authority tomorrow morning and following those dis<Col N="1229" /> cussions, I will put the proposals to Cabinet and the decision of Cabinet will be made public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an extraordinarily long reply by the Minister in view of the arrangements for priority questions. The Minister did not confirm or deny the statement she made on the steps of the plane taking her to Los Angeles, which appeared in the newspapers. The Taoiseach, in response to questions from me twice in succession on the Order of Business, said that the Minister was making observations and having consultations and that, after her meeting with the RTE Authority next week, she might bring proposals to Government. He said that no fundamental change was being considered by Government at that stage. Will the Minister now confirm or deny a few simple matters? Will she confirm or deny&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my response to Deputy Howlin's Question No. 91 of 1 February 2000, before consideration can be given to establishing digital audio broadcasting in Ireland it will be necessary to develop a national policy <Col N="1232" /> for its introduction. This will require extensive consultation with all relevant organisations in the sound broadcasting sector.</P>
      <P>My current priority in the broadcasting area, however, is the enactment of the Broadcasting Bill, 1999. When this has been achieved I will pursue the consultation process to which I have already referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>We have dealt with a broadcasting Bill. This question relates to digital audio broadcasting. Will the Minister make arrangements in the revised Bill to cater for digital audio broadcasting? This is a fundamental matter also. Why not build in a policy entitlement for digital audio broadcasting? Will the Minister confirm the concerns that have been expressed by local radio stations under ICI in respect of the new company to be formed in whatever capacity, given the difficulties the Minister brings to Government, that the multiplexes available for digital audio broadcasting in the future will be under the control of somebody other than that company? Will the Minister clarify that? Will she also comment on the pilot scheme introduced by RTE in respect of digital audio broadcasting? Has she analysed whether that was successful and does she see that being the model for the development of digital audio broadcasting in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer the last question first, the pilot scheme RTE has undertaken will be very useful. I have yet to see the results of that scheme but we will examine it when we have an opportunity to set about putting a policy in place for digital audio broadcasting. There are those who believe that the Broadcasting Bill refers to digital audio broadcasting, but it does not. I took the opportunity to meet a number of groups, particularly those representing local radio stations, the IBI as it is now known, on 31 January this year and I explained to them that there was no question of referring to digital audio broadcasting in this legislation, that we need to draw up a policy on the question of digital audio broadcasting because it is something new and that we would need significant technical and regulatory planning involving all the relevant organisations in sound broadcasting, including the ODTR, the Independent Radio and Television Commission, RTE, IBI, the Department of Public Enterprise and my Department. All this is needed before a policy is drawn up. On foot of that policy we will then have an opportunity to draft legislation but specific legislation is needed to deal with digital audio broadcasting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the issues raised at the meeting but also publicly by other Deputies. There are the concerns of IBI, one of which is the availability of frequencies for digital audio broadcasting, to which the Deputy referred. The Department confirmed at the meeting with IBI &ndash; the ODTR was present at the meeting &ndash; that the provisions of the Bill would not affect <Col N="1233" /> the availability of frequencies for digital audio broadcasting.</P>
    <P>We understand some of the concerns and are prepared to make a number of amendments which we will put forward on Committee Stage. I will bring forward an amendment which will specifically refer to analogue sound broadcasts in section 11. It should put anxieties to rest and make clear the intention of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am waiting to hear further from the IBI. A number of different proposals on this legislation came in from the IBI and it was agreed that IBI would reconsider its position with regard to the proposed amendments in light of its discussions with me and the Department. We have yet to hear further from IBI on the basis of its proposals.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked about the licences. I am aware of the debate taking place and the concern among local radio operators about renewal of existing sound broadcasting contracts. This is an important issue for local station operators. Their view is that any station which commits to going digital should have its analogue contract extended automatically and the Bill should provide for this. When meeting with the IBI, the Department's officials stressed that the renewal of existing contracts was a matter for the Independent Radio and Television Commission. That is the position I outlined when I met the IBI and other groups. Renewal of licences is one step removed from the Minister of the day and is the business of the Independent Radio and Television Commission.</P>

      <P>Is eol don Teachta go bhfuil mo Roinnse díláraithe den chuid is mó cheana féin, le 26 ionad i mBaile Átha Cliath ina bhfuil 852 ball foirne lonnaithe, mar aon le 107 ionad scaipthe ar fud na tíre ina bhfuil 903 ball foirne lonnaithe. I measc na n-ionad sin tá Rannán na Gaeltachta agus na n-Oileán, atá lonnaithe sna Forbacha, Gaillimh, le fo-ionaid i dTrá Lí agus i nGaoth Dobhair.</P>
      <P>I measc na hEagrais a thagann faoi mo chúram, tá dhá cheann lonnaithe sna réigiún. Is iad sinn An Chomhairle Oidhreachta I gCill Chainnigh agus Bord na Scannán I nGaillimh. Chomh maith le sin, beidh ceanncheathrú Uisecebhealaí Éireann, nuair a bheidh sé bunaithe, in Inis Ceithleann, le hoifigí réigiúnacha i gCora Droma Rúisc, An Scairbh agus Baile Átha Cliath.</P>

Nach bhfuil sé fíor go bhfuil talamh i seilbh Chomhairle Chontae an Chláir agus i seilbh Chomhairle Bhaile Chill Ruis chun forlíonacha na Roinne Airgeadais a chur i gcríoch?

The Minister's initial reply cannot exceed two minutes, the supplementary question and the answer to the supplementary question cannot exceed one minute each and each question is subject to an overall time limit of six minutes. The Chair has no discretion but to operate the rules adopted by the House and agreed to by the Members.

      <P>The Minister, in a press statement announcing the establishment of the consortium, said she hoped negotiations would be concluded with a suitable partner or partners within six to eight months. Have any negotiations taken place with a suitable partner or partners in relation to Digico?

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The contract with AIB Corporate Finance has not been finalised. As a consequence, AIB Corporate Finance has not submitted a claim for an instalment of the fee. The delay in finalising the contract between the Department and AIB Corporate Finance has resulted mainly from the amount of time it has taken for AIB Corporate Finance and the other members of the consortium to reach agreement on their own contracts.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of the consultancy, AIB Corporate Finance is responsible for the provision of all aspects of the advice and assistance required and other members of the consortium act as subcontractors to AIB Corporate Finance. A considerable amount of time and effort has been devoted to finalising the contract and it is expected that a contract will be signed within the next week or two and that AIB Corporate Finance will then apply for payment of a significant portion of the total fee.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred in the previous question to the difficulties with regard to the valuation of the assets of RTE in terms of its potential share in the company to be set up, that is, Digico. In that context, has the Minister received any advice from AIB Corporate Finance and its subcontractors as to the valuation of RTE's assets, based not only on the existing sites and tower networks but upon the future potential business that could be done not merely by television transmission but also in terms of interactive business by way of return paths and so forth?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department, with the Departments of Finance, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Public Enterprise as well as RTE, has set up this group to see how best to proceed. As Deputy Kenny said, the project management group has been set up to see what potential such business has for the future. As I have already said, difficulties with regard to RTE's involvement in the digital infrastructure have arisen. It is due to those difficulties that I must decide how best to proceed on the basis of the information I have been given and the work which has already been done by the management group. When I have that fully assessed and when I have finished my deliberations and discussions with groups such as RTE, which I am meeting tomorrow, I will put forward my views to Cabinet.</P>

It is a straight and direct yes or no answer, and if the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, will she say with whom those discussions have taken place?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Many heritage sites are monitored by the existing corps of conservation rangers in my Department. These rangers are employed to monitor natural sites and they also provide advice to landowners and others to safeguard that heritage. A similar level of service is required for the archaeological heritage and I am examining proposals in this regard in the context of the overall protection of archaeology. I expect to make significant progress in the matter this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Deputy that natural heritage areas and special areas of conservation are monitored by the conservation rangers and I am glad we now have 90 conservation rangers. We had 60 up to July 1999 and I was then in <Col N="1238" /> a position to create a further 30 vacancies, 11 of which remain to be filled. They are in the administrative process at present and should be filled soon. It is the best approach because not only are special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas involved, which are very important, but also 120,000 recorded monuments and sites throughout the country, and we want to see how best we can monitor those sites. Rather than setting up a new set of staff to do this, it is best to build on the resources of the existing conservation rangers. There is a provision in their job specification to extend their duties in this regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>No. We also need to address this in terms of archaeological heritage. Anyone assigned to such a task would obviously need to be trained in this area because it is a special area and we need qualified archaeologists to be assigned to the regions. I am discussing the provision of such staff with the Minister for Finance. The Deputy is correct in saying that I spoke in my last reply of availing of assistance from local interest groups and those involved in historical and archaeological societies throughout the country which have proved to be excellent in taking an interest and being professional in their approach. When I have concluded my discussions with the Minister for Finance about employing people with specific archaeological qualifications, we will contact local organisations to see how best to proceed.</P>

      <P>I wish to clarify that the study in question was undertaken by the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London and was commissioned jointly by the Department of Education and Science and my Department. The specialist in question is a member of the staff of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. The fee for this work was £14,000 sterling which was <Col N="1239" /> paid to the Guildhall school on completion of the report. The consultants' vouched expenses were also recouped.

      <P>As the Deputy will be well aware, the Guildhall School of Music and Drama was chosen because it had done a good deal of work up to that point and we believed it had the expertise and knowledge. Mr. Renshaw has excellent qualifications in this regard. He was formerly principal of the Yehudi Menuhin School and Gresham Professor of Music and has lectured widely in Britain and overseas in education and training. He is a member of the board of the European League of Institutes of the Arts. It was important in the interests of transparency and fairness to obtain outside advice independent of the country. Otherwise we could have been accused of taking one specific interest on board. With regard to the Arts Council's involvement, I understand that in terms of music and dance, both officers of the Arts Council were involved in the initial discussions which took place with Mr. Renshaw's people.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister investigate who commissioned the Deloitte &amp; Touche report? Who presented it to the Guildhall School of Music and Drama? The steering committee established by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in co-ordination with the Department of Education and Science comprises personnel who are the direct beneficiaries of the Government's decision.

Sa staid polaitíochta atá ann i láthair na huaire ba dhearmad mór d'Aire ó dheas feidhmiú as féin glan in aghaidh socruithe maidir leis an bhForas.

      <P>the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands the action, if any, she is taking on foot of the recent report by the Heritage Council indicating a stark decline in the population of some of Ireland's rarest birds, such as the grey partridge and turtle dove, the virtual extinction of the corn bunting and an alarming drop in the number of previously common birds such as yellowhammers and linnets. [6428/00]</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Birds of agricultural areas such as grey partridge, turtle dove, corn bunting, yellowhammer and linnets have, as a group, been affected more since Ireland's accession to the EU than other groups and, as the recent report by the Heritage Council highlights, many species have suffered serious contractions in their breeding range. Dúchas have been partners in and co-funders of the countryside bird survey since its inception in 1998. This is a nationwide annual monitoring programme which quantifies population changes of common Irish birds and will be a valuable database for assessing the impact of agricultural changes on farmland birds in the future.</P>
      <P>The protection afforded by the designation of special protection areas and special areas of conservation will contribute to the maintenance of suitable habitats for wild birds including the birds in question. This, together with the environmental benefits from improved practices under the rural environment protection scheme operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, will represent a significant benefit for the protection of all our wildlife, including birds such as the corn bunting, yellowhammer, linnet, grey partridge and turtle doves.</P>
      <P>My Department has also supported specific conservation initiatives on two endangered species of farmland birds, the grey partridge and the corncrake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grey partridge project, part-funded by Dúchas since 1991, is a programme of survey, research and management of remaining wild populations. The REP scheme and the corncrake <Col N="1243" /> grant scheme, funded by Dúchas since 1993 in partnership with BirdWatch Ireland and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, encourages farmers with nesting corncrakes to farm in a corncrake friendly manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not doing a proper job to protect our wildlife heritage. Has she any strategy to stop the extinction of a number of bird species? It is apparent that a number of species have been eliminated in the past 20 or 30 years. Is there personnel in the Department who can design a strategy to protect our wildlife? This report is indicting. I am sure a number of species have become extinct which are not mentioned in the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his questions. I am aware of his interest in this area. The Heritage Council has sent me the report. We need to see what can be done to protect our birdlife not just on foot of the report but also the other information Dúchas has at its disposal. It is important to have rangers, particularly in the SPA regions. The directive refers directly to birds. The more personnel we have the greater our monitoring. Dúchas has part-funded schemes, particularly the grey partridge project. The fact we have SPAs, SACs and MHAs means that certain protection will be given to our birdlife. The REP scheme and farm practices will be a positive influence on our bird population.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no positive moves to conserve wildlife. Every day of the week I see areas of wetland being drained and hedgerows being removed. For all the good intentions of the REP scheme, it is not serving the purpose for which it was set up, namely, to protect our habitats and wildlife in general. I ask the Minister to do something about that. It is ridiculous that there is only one wildlife ranger in County Waterford. We need 12 or 20 rangers given that there are two mountain ranges and lots of moors in the county. The Minister must get more money because we need more personnel. She has not tackled the Minister for Finance in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that we need more personnel. However, the Deputy must acknowledge that since July 1999 the number of conservation officers has increased from 60 to 90. That was only done through the good offices of the Minister for Finance who believed the arguments we put forward. We will continue to advance such arguments because 90 conservation officers are not sufficient. We are trying to improve that number in every way we can. I do not accept that the <Col N="1244" /> two directives, the SPAs and the SACs cannot be of immediate benefit to habitats generally and to birdlife in particular. As regards the hedgerows, we have written to the local authorities.</P>

      <P>Seals are a protected species under the Wildlife Act, 1976, and it is an offence to hunt or kill them, save under a licence or permission granted by me as Minister under the Act. No official seal cull has been carried out since the Wildlife Act, 1976, came in to force and I have no proposals to carry out a seal cull. The scientific advice available is that culling is not an effective method of control. Large numbers of seals migrate from Scotland to the west coast of Ireland but I have no definitive figures in relation to the numbers migrating to the north Mayo coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From time to time representations are received in relation to the control of seal populations, usually arising from the problems caused to fishing interests by seal damage to fish caught in nets. Section 42 of the Wildlife Act provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that where damage is being caused by a protected wild animal, in this case seals, to a fishery, the Minister may cause to be taken, by a person auth<Col N="1247" /> orised by her, such steps, as are necessary to stop the damage. Permissions issued under section 42 of the Act provide for the shooting of seals within 100 metres of the nets, which are subject to damage. Permits are issued in response to specific applications and each application is considered on its merits.</P>

While no official seal culls have been carried out, a number of unofficial culls have been carried out. This is a cause of great controversy at certain times.</P>
      <P>If experienced fishermen see rogue seals constantly obtaining easy food by raiding salmon drift nets, are they entitled to apply to the Department to have such seals killed? I have been on a number of fishing boats and I have seen fishermen trying to patrol their nets. If a salmon is caught in a legal drift net, they must act quickly to obtain it before a seal does so.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's knowledge of this matter is far greater than mine. I am distressed by his statement that unofficial seal culls are taking place. If he has information about such activity he should forward it to the Department because seals are protected wild animals.</P>

      <P>That sort of anecdotal information is not very useful. However, if he has more concrete evidence I would be interested in hearing it.</P>
      <P>In respect of the Minister of the day's responsibility in this area under section 42 of the Act, as already stated, each case is considered on its merits. It is interesting to note the number of applications made and the number of permits granted. Five permits were granted in 1992, six were granted in 1993, eight were granted in 1994, eight were granted in 1995, eight were granted in 1996, 15 were granted in 1997, seven were granted in 1998 and ten were granted in 1999. No permits have been granted as yet this year and there are two outstanding applications in respect of which decisions remain to be made.</P>
      <P>As stated earlier, the situation must be monitored carefully because seals are a protected species under the Wildlife Act, 1976. It is not just a question of a Minister making decisions lightly, each case must be taken on its merits.</P>

      <P>Is cúis áthas domsa bheith anseo chun an Bille Árachais seo a chur faoi bhrád an Teach. Tá mé ag súil go mbeidh spéis mór ag Teachtaí go léir agus go mbeidh an spéis chéanna sa Seanad nuair a bheidh sé ansin.</P>
      <P>The objectives of the Insurance Bill, 1999, are to allocate regulatory responsibility for insurance intermediaries to the Central Bank of Ireland and to utilise the regulatory powers available to the Bank under the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, to enable the Minister to make disclosure regulations to require both insurance undertakings and intermediaries to make relevant information of a specified nature available to insurance consumers; to strengthen the existing system of notification by reinsurance undertakings and to enable the Minister to make regulations for the authorisation and supervision of reinsurance undertakings, and to update existing provisions for offences and penalties and to enhance the powers of &ldquo;Authorised Officers&rdquo; for the purposes of the Insurance Acts and regulations.</P>
      <P>It might help the House if I were to summarise briefly the general background to the proposals contained in the Bill. I will then proceed to explain in more detail the content of some of the more complex provisions for the benefit of the House.</P>
      <P>Insurance undertakings employ almost 10,500 people in Ireland today. In addition, there are approximately 6,500 insurance brokers, agents and tied insurance agents, many of whom are employers of staff. Gross insurance premium income for 1998 amounted to £7.5 billion, of which 66% related to life assurance and the remaining 34% to non-life. Gross premium income increased in 1998 by 36% on the previous year's figure.</P>
      <P>In round figures, there are 1,900 insurance brokers, 1,500 insurance agents and 3,200 tied agents, as well as the sales forces of the undertakings themselves, involved in the sale of insurance products. Of life assurance business, 50% of annual premium is transacted by brokers, 2% by agents, 22% by tied agents, 25% by company sales forces and 1% is effected directly with the insurance undertaking. Where single premium is concerned, brokers transact 75% of insurance business, agents 1%, tied agents 15% and 9% of the business goes directly to the undertakings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the non-life side, the insurance industry has advised me that approximately 70% of this business is transacted by intermediaries. Some 55% of non-life business is accounted for by motor insurance, of which approximately one third is transacted directly with the insurers by phone, tax or over the Internet. The percentage of direct insurance has been increasing significantly in <Col N="1250" /> recent years, with several new companies specialising in this format of business.</P>
    <P>Provision for the regulation of insurance intermediaries was first introduced into law by Part IV of the Insurance Act, 1989. This provided for a relatively simple system of self-regulation by the insurance industry itself, under the overall responsibility of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    <P>The 1989 Act defined three separate categories of insurance intermediary. First, the insurance broker, who acts primarily as an agent of the client and must hold appointments from at least five life companies to transact life assurance business and-or from at least five non-life companies to transact non-life business. Second, the insurance agent, who acts as an agent of the insurance company and who may not hold more than four appointments from life companies to transact life business and-or no more than four non-life companies to transact non-life business. Third, the tied insurance agent, who enters into an arrangement with a particular insurance undertaking, whereby he or she undertakes to refer all proposals of insurance of a particular form, that is, life or non-life, to that undertaking. The insurance undertaking concerned is responsible for any act or omission of its tied insurance agent in respect of any matter pertaining to a contract of insurance offered or issued by that undertaking, as if the tied agent were an employee of that undertaking.</P>
    <P>A notable feature of the retail insurance industry is the overlap between brokers and agents, with many individuals or firms acting as brokers for one form of insurance business and as agents or tied agents for the other form.</P>
    <P>The Irish Brokers Association, IBA, as a body recognised by the Minister for the purposes of the Insurance Act, undertook supervision of its members' compliance with the Insurance Act, while the Insurance Intermediaries Compliance Bureau, IICB, was established by the Irish Insurance Federation, IIF, as a central compliance checking facility for all other insurance intermediaries. In addition, a major regulatory function fell to the insurance undertakings themselves, in that they may not appoint a person to market their products or pay commission other than to an intermediary who is either a member of a representative body of insurance brokers, recognised by the Minister, whose rules require compliance with the Insurance Act, or a person who otherwise complies with the provisions of the 1989 Act.</P>
    <P>The Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, introduced detailed procedures for the regulation of investment intermediaries, with regulatory responsibility allocated to the Central Bank and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Under the Central Bank Act, 1997, the supervisory role allocated to the Minister in respect of certain categories of investment intermediaries was transferred to the Central Bank, with effect from April 1997.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1251" /> In recent times, there has been considerable blurring at the margins of investment and insurance products, and a significant number of intermediaries have been engaging in both investment and insurance business for some time.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank is well equipped with a robust regime of regulatory and enforcement powers under the 1995 Act to supervise investment intermediaries and has been carrying out this function effectively since 1995. The impact of this Bill, when enacted, will be to bring insurance intermediaries within the same regulatory regime as investment intermediaries under the remit of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that I want to outline the reasons I believe it is necessary to restructure the system of regulating insurance intermediaries and to allocate responsibility for this function to the Central Bank. The system of self-regulation is no longer appropriate to an area of such fundamental importance to the consumer. The existing regulatory provisions under the Insurance Act, 1989, are inadequate to regulate the activities of insurance intermediaries. The powers available to the Central Bank under the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, are more comprehensive and robust than those available to the insurance regulators under the Insurance Act, 1989. The considerable overlap between the activities of insurance intermediaries and investment intermediaries requires that the same regulator should now cover both activities. There is a need to minimise the opportunities for regulatory arbitrage, that is, an intermediary using the existence of different regulators to place itself under the least onerous regulatory regime. There is a need for a level playing field of regulation for insurance intermediaries and investment intermediaries, who are now facing into direct competition, particularly in the area of single premium life insurance. Both insurance and investment intermediaries are now equally bound by the provisions of the Investor Compensation Act, 1998. Finally, the proposed establishment by the Government of a single regulatory authority for all financial service providers will, in any event, bring insurance and investment intermediaries together under the one single regulator. This Bill will launch the initial stage of this process.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that in its report to the Government on the single regulatory authority, the implementation advisory group recommended that the legislation then under preparation to transfer responsibility for insurance intermediaries to the Central Bank should be enacted urgently and be in place before the establishment of the single regulatory authority.</P>
    <P>I would now like to proceed to the provisions in this Bill to facilitate making disclosure regulations. The prime objective in introducing these measures is to provide accurate and proper information to consumers to enable them to make rational and informed choices when purchasing <Col N="1252" /> insurance. This should lead to greater competition on the market, thus reducing the price of insurance. The proposed legislation provides for measures to strengthen and enhance existing consumer disclosure measures made under European legislation. The proposals will lead to a simplification in the presentation of insurance products. The regulations that I will make after the enactment of this legislation will make any attempt at the mis-selling and the churning of life assurance policies more obvious to the consumer and, therefore, more difficult to achieve. Thus the regulations will clarify the implications and costs involved in taking up life assurance products, including the payment received by the intermediary selling the product before the consumer signs along the dotted line.</P>
    <P>In light of the changes proposed for the taxation system as it applies to life assurance which will come into effect from the beginning of next year, it is important that the temptation to mis-sell new insurance products that might attract more favourable taxation treatment than a client's existing policies is removed by this Bill. Experience has shown that many purchasers of non-life insurance are equally at sea when it comes to understanding the precise nature of the product, its constituent elements and of the price being charged. Enabling provisions relating to non-life insurance will provide for regulations to be introduced detailing elements such as policy loadings, restrictions, discounts, excesses, commission payments and any other amounts payable. Some of these elements can have a significant effect on the cost of insurance cover and in particular the cost of compulsory motor insurance cover. The introduction of such transparency measures will assist consumers in controlling costs and alleviate the unnecessary cost burdens which result from a lack of information at point of sale and/or at renewal. As was the case with the drafting of the life assurance disclosure regulations, it is my intention to consult widely with industry and consumer interests before finalising similar non-life disclosure regulations.</P>
    <P>The Bill will provide the statutory framework for the introduction of regulations requiring the provision of information to insurance consumers before the conclusion of contracts and on an ongoing basis thereafter. Under the new regulations consumers will be entitled to comprehensive information from the insurer or insurance intermediary on the terms and conditions of the proposed insurance policy which will include the type of policy, the benefits and options, the cooling off provision, the purpose, intention and cost of the policy, the means and duration of payment of premiums and, vitally, the consequences of early surrender.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that late last year I abolished the cap on the remuneration paid to intermediaries. This was done for a number of <Col N="1253" /> reasons. First, there was a danger that other forms of payment might be devised to circumvent the maximum commission levels. Second, it was brought to my attention that other EU insurers might be deterred from entering the Irish market because of the cap on commissions.</P>
    <P>Since it is clearly in the interests of consumers to have as many insurers as possible active in the market in order that the best possible choice of product and price is available, I considered it important to abolish the cap. However, although the removal of the cap has these advantages, it gives rise to the risk of a rise in commissions in the absence of other controls. The best control in the context of a more competitive market is disclosure and transparency for the consumer. Consequently, as part of this overall comprehensive disclosure package, I am proposing to introduce mandatory disclosure of insurance intermediary and salespersons' remuneration as a separate item of disclosure.</P>
    <P>I will now address the reinsurance provisions in the Bill. Due to the absence of any direct consumer interests in reinsurance, the supervisory authority has imposed a light regulatory regime on this branch of the industry until now. At present an informal system of authorisation of reinsurance companies operates based on a simple statutory notification requirement and an administrative arrangement whereby such companies will not be registered by the companies registration office if the information in the strategy notification gives rise to concern. While the current informal system has worked satisfactorily to date, it is considered necessary to expand the requirements and to make provision for a more formal regime that could be introduced if necessary at short notice.</P>
    <P>The position regarding reinsurance companies has changed significantly in recent times, particularly with the development of the Irish financial services centre. I intend to impose more stringent obligations on reinsurance companies to ensure the continuation of the excellent international reputation of the international financial services centre and the Irish financial services sector in general.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides for making regulations that will require reinsurance companies registered in Ireland to provide detailed information to the Department at the time of their establishment and subsequently to notify any changes in their situation on an annual basis. It also makes provision for the possible future extension to reinsurance companies of some or all the provisions in national legislation governing the authorisation and supervision of insurance undertakings. The main purpose of the new provisions is to prevent the registration or establishment in Ireland of reinsurance companies of dubious standing. We also anticipate the introduction in the medium <Col N="1254" /> term of EU legislation on the regulation and supervision of the reinsurance industry.</P>
    <P>For the same general reasons I have outlined, this Bill will also change the provision included in the Insurance Act, 1989, which exempted contracts of reinsurance or insurance intermediaries solely engaged in reinsurance contracts from Part IV of that Act. Reinsurance contracts and reinsurance intermediaries will in future be subject to all insurance legislation.</P>
    <P>With regard to authorised officers, the revised provisions of the Bill in this area will apply to the Insurance Acts, 1909 to 1989, and subsequently to the proposed disclosure regulations to be made under this Bill. The provisions in the 1989 Act governing the appointment of authorised officers gave rise to concern when we sought to use these provisions in the past. Questions were raised in regard to the appointment of authorised officers and the restricted manner within which they were required to carry out their tasks. I have decided to update the provisions to address the concerns referred to previously and to bring them into line with the analogous provisions for authorised officers contained in the more recent Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, and the Consumer Credit Act, 1995.</P>
    <P>The more notable changes contained in the provisions are as follows: the Minister may appoint a person who is not an officer of the Department as an authorised officer; there is a specific reference to persons in respect of whom powers may be exercised by an authorised officer; there are several new categories of information which will be open to the authorised officer to inspect; duties may be imposed on specified persons, particularly professional persons such as an examiner, liquidator, receiver and others to provide information to an authorised officer; and an authorised officer may be empowered by a court warrant to enter a private dwelling.</P>
    <P>The various provisions covering offences and penalties of the Insurance Acts, 1909 to 1989, have been reviewed and updated on the basis of experience and other relevant factors. Some of these provisions date from as far back as the Insurance Act, 1936. The most significant changes are as follows: prosecutions for summary offences may be taken by the Minister; there is an extension of the timescale within which prosecutions can be commenced from six months to two years, and beyond this period in specific circumstances; and the Second Schedule to the 1989 Act which sets out the amount of penalties that can be imposed by the courts, is being replaced by a new Schedule containing significant increases in penalties.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the Bill itself. Section 4 amends section 3 of the Insurance Act, 1989, by updating and increasing existing offences and penalties, respectively. Under current insurance legislation, the prosecution of offences is ham<Col N="1255" /> pered by the six month prosecution deadline from the date of the offence. This section enables the Minister to bring summary proceedings for any offence under the Insurance Acts and insurance regulations at any time within two years from the date at which an offence was committed, or at any time within six months from the date on which sufficient evidence is available to justify proceedings, subject to a limitation period of five years from the date on which the offence was initially committed.</P>
    <P>This section also empowers the court to order persons convicted of an offence to pay the costs and expenses incurred by the Minister in relation to the investigation, detection and prosecution of the offence.</P>
    <P>Section 5 expands the obligations on reinsurance undertakings contained in Section 22 of the Insurance Act, 1989, and sets out the various headings under which notification to the Department is required. The amended text is intended to include reinsurance undertakings that are registered or attempting to register as non-resident companies in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Section 6 allows the Minister to make regulations for the supervision and regulation of reinsurance undertakings, should he or she consider this necessary. It is intended, however, to provide ample opportunity for the provisions of section 5 to operate effectively before making use of this section and bringing reinsurance undertakings formally within the regulatory regime. The proposals to proceed along the lines set out in sections 5 and 6 above have been discussed with the industry representative bodies. These have indicated their broad agreement to our proposals on the basis that they balance the need to protect the reputation of the financial services sector with the desirability of not imposing an unnecessary regulatory burden on reputable reinsurance companies.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides a firm legal basis for introducing regulations on the provision of information to insurance consumers before, during and after the conclusion of insurance contracts. Current insurance legislation and consumer legislation have proven to be deficient in this regard. This section sets out in precise terms the nature of the obligations that may be imposed by regulation on insurance undertakings and intermediaries in so far as the mandatory provision of information to their clients is concerned. For added clarity, information requirements about the insurance undertaking and the commitment of clients are set out in a separate Schedule &ndash; Schedule II &ndash; to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the repeal of Part 4 of the Insurance Act, 1989. The essential elements of this Part, as amended, will be incorporated in the amended Investment Intermediaries Act. This will provide a single reference point for both <Col N="1256" /> insurance and investment intermediaries from a regulatory viewpoint.</P>
    <P>Section 9 amends section 59 of the Act of 1989 by providing for the appointment of authorised officers by the Minister. The amendment provides that the Minister will not be restricted to appointing officers of his or her Department and, accordingly, may select authorised officers with the specific skills and qualifications necessary to carry out the particular task in question.</P>
    <P>Section 10 extends the scope and enhances the powers of authorised officers to carry out investigations on behalf of the Minister under the Insurance Acts. Experience has shown that the current authorised officer system of our Department encountered difficulties that hindered investigations into unauthorised insurance business and breaches of the Insurance Acts. The amended provisions clearly state the entities that are subject to the powers of an authorised officer and expand on the actions that an authorised officer is empowered to carry out.</P>
    <P>This section sets out specific obligations on persons to whom this section applies to co-operate with an authorised officer. A person who obstructs, misleads or fails to co-operate with an authorised officer in the exercise of his or her powers shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 13 repeals section 110 of the Insurance Act, 1936, which specified the time limit within which the prosecution of offences could be initiated. In accordance with section 4 of this Bill, common time limits will be introduced for the prosecution of offences under the insurance Acts. The existing legislation requires that a prosecution be initiated within six months of the date of the offence. This was impractical and I consider that the extended time limit of two years, or up to five years in specific circumstances, is more appropriate to modern day circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides for transitional provisions to apply to life assurance proposals and policies entered into before the commencement of section 6 of this Bill. The proposed additional policy holder information requirements cannot be applied retrospectively. This brings me to the amendments to the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, an Act that is already administered and enforced by the Central Bank of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Section 16 amends section 2 of the 1995 Act to include definitions that are relevant to insurance. Two important definitions in this section are the proposals to include insurance policies within the meaning of investment instruments and also a client of an insurance intermediary in the definition of investment business firm. Arising from these amended definitions, an insurance intermediary will be captured by the definition of an investment business firm and will, accordingly, be brought into the area of regulation and supervision of the Central Bank of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Section 17 amends section 9 of the Act of 1995 <Col N="1257" /> by replacing subsection 2 of that section. The original subsection proved to be confusing by attempting to define when an investment business firm was not regarded as operating within this State. The revised text defines when an investment business firm is regarded as operating within this State. It shall meet the necessary criteria where its registered office is in the State, it has a place of business in this State, or it is providing investment business services or investment advice to private individuals in this State.</P>
    <P>Section 18 inserts a new section 13A after section I3. Section 13A outlines transitional arrangements in relation to insurance intermediaries existing on the day before this section comes into effect. Provided that they apply to the supervisory authority, the Central Bank, for authorisation within a period of three months, these will stand authorised pending a decision from the supervisory authority. While the supervisory authority is considering an application for authorisation it has the power to impose conditions and issue directions to the intermediary. An intermediary may appeal any such directions or conditions to the court.</P>
    <P>Section 19 amends section 17 by removing the necessity for the supervisory authority to keep separately a register of investment business firms which are deemed authorised since, for regulatory purposes, no useful function is served by keeping separate registers for authorised and deemed authorised firms.</P>
    <P>Section 20 presents section 25 in a simpler format. In addition, this section states that an investment product intermediary will also provide the service of receiving and transmitting orders in tracker bonds and in insurance policies.</P>
    <P>Section 21 amends section 25 by the insertion of new subsections outlining specific requirements for insurance intermediaries. Essentially, these subsections restate the provisions relating to brokers, agents and tied agents which were part of Part 4 of the Insurance Act, 1989, now being repealed. Section 25A provides that an intermediary shall not place, or attempt to place, insurance other than with an undertaking. It also requires an intermediary to make his or her intermediary category known to a client. Sections 25B, C and D define the activities of a broker, an agent and tied agent. Section 25E defines the scope of agency in relation to insurance agents. It also governs the acceptance by an intermediary of insurance proposals. Where a premium is paid to an insurance intermediary in respect of a renewal of a policy invited by an insurer, or is paid in respect of an accepted proposal of insurance, it is deemed to have been paid to the undertaking.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it also provides that where a premium is paid to an insurance intermediary in respect of a renewal of a policy invited by an insurance undertaking, or in respect of an accepted proposal of insurance, it is deemed to <Col N="1258" /> have been paid to the insurance undertaking. Section 22 amends section 26 (1), as amended by the Investor Compensation Act, 1998, by outlining the specific services that a restricted activity investment product intermediary &ndash; RAIPI &ndash; may provide and by the addition of receiving and transmitting of orders in tracker bonds and insurance policies to this list. Insurance undertakings are added to the list of bodies to which a RAIPI may transmit orders. Subsection 2A provides that a person who is an insurance intermediary on the day prior to the coming into effect of section 15(c), and who remains within the definition of a RAIPI, shall be deemed to be an authorised investment firm. Other than where acting as a deposit agent or a tied insurance agent, a RAIPI is not permitted to handle customers' cash.</P>
    <P>Section 23 removes the provision in section 27, whereby a representative body approved by the supervisory authority would regulate its members. This section requires investment product intermediaries who are acting as insurance intermediaries to comply with the provisions of the insurance Acts. Allowance is also made for the supervisory authority to exempt certain classes of intermediary from the requirement to hold professional indemnity insurance where it considers that the clients of the intermediaries are otherwise adequately protected.</P>
    <P>Section 24 provides for the substitution of the existing section 28(1), by a new text which simplifies the amendment of section 28(1), made under the Central Bank Act, 1997, and extends the obligations on product producers to insurance matters. The provision in section 28(1) whereby a product producer was permitted to appoint an investment product intermediary to act on its behalf on the basis that the intermediary was a member of a representative body, approved by the supervisory authority, is removed since the supervisory authority will be engaged in direct regulation and will no longer be issuing such approvals to representative bodies. This section also amends section 28(2) by permitting a product producer to assume, for the purposes of section 28(1), that any investment product intermediary who has been authorised by the supervisory authority complies with the provisions of the Insurance Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 25 amends section 29 by qualifying the specific advertising in which RAIPIs must indicate that they are not permitted to accept cash and by adding tied agents to the category of RAIPI that is permitted to accept cash. Section 26 amends section 30 to provide for the form of receipt to be issued by the intermediary to the client, the manner in which this format may be altered by the supervisory authority from time to time and the time period for which an intermediary must retain a record of the receipt. The requirements set out in this section may be aug<Col N="1259" /> mented from time to time by codes of practice issued or approved by the supervisory authority under section 37 of the 1995 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 27 inserts a new section 31A, disapplying Part IV of the investment Intermediaries Act to travel agents and tour operators. This is a similar proviso to that which was included in Part IV of the Insurance Act, 1989. Section 28 repeals section 51(5)(<i>e</i>) of the 1995 Act, which provides that a single body may cover the bonding obligations of an investment business firm that is also an insurance intermediary. Since insurance intermediaries are now included within the definition of investment intermediaries and since in any event the requirement to hold a bond under the Insurance Act, 1989, was repealed by the Investor Compensation Act, 1998, this subsection is no longer necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 29 amends section 74(2) by expanding this section to include certain information provision requirements for persons acting as insurance intermediaries or as insurance agents, the format of which information may be modified by the supervisory authority within the remit of section 74(1).</P>
    <P>In the course of the preparation of this Bill over the past two years, I and my officials met a broad range of interest groups who have represented the interests of the industry bodies concerned and insurance consumers. These included the Irish Insurance Federation, IIF, the Irish Brokers Association, IBA, the Professional Insurance Brokers Association, PIBA, the Insurance Intermediaries Compliance Board, IICB, the Society of Actuaries, SoA, the Consumers Association of Ireland, CAI, the National Pensions Board, NPB, the Director of Consumer Affairs, DCA, the Insurance Ombudsman and the Central Bank of Ireland, which will be taking over responsibility for the regulation of insurance intermediaries.</P>
    <P>Altogether, we have had a total of 30 separate meetings with representative groups from both the insurance industry and consumer groups. My officials also provided a presentation on the broad outline of the Bill last November to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business.</P>
    <P>I thank all the various interest groups who furnished their opinions to us during the consultation process and, in doing so, contributed to the final outcome of this Bill. I look forward to hearing the contributions of the various Deputies on the contents of the Bill and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to respond on behalf of my party to the Minister of State's introduction of the Insurance Bill, 1999, which is intended to allocate regulatory responsibility for insurance intermediaries to the Central Bank of Ireland. We note it is intended to use the <Col N="1260" /> powers available to the Central Bank under the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, and that both investment and insurance intermediaries will come under the same regulatory regime. This is an enabling Bill to allow the Minister to introduce further provisions with regard to the financial services sector and life and general policies.</P>
      <P>The proposed new powers to appoint authorised officers and the powers granted to them under sections 9 and 10 are very wide. Concern has been expressed that this may result in discrepancies in the powers and procedures provided for in the Insurance and Companies Acts. Better safeguards should be provided for the Minister and his officials to guard against the abuse of such powers. These should include court approval of authorised officers, as provided for in the Companies Acts, including the right of appeal against the appointments.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State believes a single regulator will provide a more efficient and effective regulatory regime. While it may appear that insurance intermediaries are involved in both the insurance and investment industries, there is a difference between the two types of intermediary. In streamlining the regulatory system, there is the danger of overregulating insurance intermediaries.</P>
      <P>Since the enactment of the Investor Compensation Act in 1998, all insurance intermediaries are obliged to comply with its provisions on payment of compensation to their clients. While welcome, the provisos in this Bill are short of what is required, especially in view of the huge amount of time spent on this issue over the years. These only amount to a halfway house in dealing with the industrial insurance aspect. In effect, the legalisation only covers the lacuna that previously existed with regard to the misappropriation of client moneys or where policies were incorrectly set up.</P>
      <P>I understand that insurance intermediaries will now come under two categories, those who do not accept cash &ndash; restricted activity product intermediaries &ndash; and those who accept cash &ndash; investment product intermediaries. In view of this I strongly urge the Minister to ensure that the regulatory system is appropriate and not overregulated as that may lead to a loss of jobs and the closure of smaller companies, especially in rural areas.</P>
      <P>Insurance intermediaries play a vital role. They are the champion of the consumer in certain areas against the might of the large institutions. The Minister of State is already aware from the proceedings of the Committee of Public Accounts of the powers at the disposal of large institutions when dealing with consumers. The recent inquiry by the committee revealed huge anomalies. In view of this, any proposed regulatory provisions should incorporate the larger financial institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1261" /> Care is required regarding attempts to increase the powers of these institutions at the expense of the insurance intermediaries. Such a move would disadvantage consumers. It is important to introduce a level playing field. Regulation is important but we must ensure it is not at the expense of the smaller broker, especially in view of the huge size of the business. I did not realise that billions of pounds are involved. It is important that any watchdog role should not be confined to brokers.</P>
    <P>All the banks deal directly with insurance companies. They have the facilities to go through their accounts and they know who is doing business. It means they can pirate business away from brokers by dealing directly with clients. The Minister of State is well aware of this. Banks are selecting clients and in the process branch managers can receive paybacks if they pirate business. That should not be allowed and it needs to be addressed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>By offering an independent forum, insurance intermediaries provide a valuable service to the State. They encourage the consumer to take out life protection and pension cover and to save for the rainy day.</P>
    <P>This reduces the burden on the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs as it allows consumers to be financially independent in the face of a tragic death in a family or an unexpected illness. Figures show that 40% of males and 48% of females do not have life cover, while average life cover is totally inadequate at £50,000 per person. In addition, only 52% of employees, 27% of the self-employed and 12% in of the agri-sector have pensions. People have been very fearful of insurance companies due to lack of regulation and stories which they have heard. However, given property prices, etc., £50,000 is not adequate and I hope the Minister will establish an independent body to advertise and promote the benefits of doing business with legitimate companies and to stress the safeguards of cover.</P>
    <P>Group pensions are huge business and this is where real growth exists, but they are not covered by the Bill, except that regulation will come under the Pensions Board. However, it would appear that the Pensions Board does not come within the regulations of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister should encourage consumers to have adequate protection for death, illness and retirement. If the Bill is enacted in its current form, it will discourage consumers from taking out policies and lead to confusion because of the overload of facts and figures which result in excessive paperwork. It will make both selling and buying insurance unnecessarily cumbersome and time consuming.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to support independent advice, which is very important, to ensure the proposed new legislation is simplified and does not become so onerous for insurance intermedi<Col N="1262" /> aries that they decide to leave the market to larger players. Such a situation must be avoided as it would not be desirable. Independent advice is very important, particularly given the statistics which indicate the lack of cover. Cover is vital given taxation on estates, endowment policies, etc.</P>
    <P>What does the Minister mean by the call in section 6 for adequate levels of capital to be maintained by insurance intermediaries? For example, in the case of a restricted activity intermediary, the level of capital is immaterial to the consumer as it is not proposed that they handle cash. I ask the Minister to explain this provision and to ensure that such requirements are not imposed without due consultation with the representative bodies of insurance intermediaries.</P>
    <P>We note that the insurance industry has undergone many changes in preparing for the enactment of the Bill, involving a smoothing out of changes which offer better up front value to consumers. Given that the industry has corrected the problem of early surrender values, the Minister should take the co-operation of the industry into consideration.</P>
    <P>Under the new section 43B, the Minister should be aware that the surrender values can only be given following the issue of an actual policy, as the cost of policies will vary depending on each individual's age and medical profile. I suggest, therefore, an amendment to annex II in the Third Schedule so that the disclosure regulations are issued with the policy document and the cooling off notice. The Consumer Association of Ireland would support this policy.</P>
    <P>In future the Pensions Board will not come under the single regulator, unless the Minister intends introducing a change in this.</P>
    <P>New section 43D, set out in section 7, states that new units must be purchased in the case of pension, investment and life products. Therefore, any information at point of sale can only be indicative, and I ask the Minister to provide for this in the Bill. New section 43D(1)(<i>b</i>) seems to impose considerable additional time on the insurance intermediary to make additional visits to the consumer to verify his requirements and acceptance of policy conditions. This is not workable in practice as time costs money and insurance intermediaries cannot make three or four visits to a client to sell one policy, especially in this age of tele-working with it becoming increasingly difficult to meet appointments due to traffic. This should be simplified. Many intermediaries use the telephone or e-mail to clarify points at various stages in the sale of products. Therefore, it is appropriate that the declaration should be attached to the policy application form and worded in such a way as to give the consumer an &ldquo;out&rdquo; in the cooling off notice should that be required. We are entering a new era of Internet <Col N="1263" /> banking and insurance, and the Bill should take due consideration of the enormous changes in this regard.</P>
    <P>Regarding new section 43A(2)(<i>a</i>), I note that the Minister and his officials have relied heavily on the Society of Actuaries of Ireland in drafting the disclosure guidelines. However, I am not convinced that a level playing field has been achieved in relation to disclosure of costs, overheads, sales and remuneration. Too much discretion seems to be left to individual actuaries in large institutions, allowing them present their disclosure information in the best possible light. Insurance intermediaries are not allowed this facility as their commission is shown in a separate column in returns. It is important that there is a level playing field in terms of the payment of commission for large institutions and smaller intermediaries. Car or mobile telephone salespeople are not obliged to inform anybody of their commission, and while I believe in transparency, large institutions can off-set high cost factors and it is important that the cost of products is clearly established. The Minister is demanding that insurance intermediaries declare commission in bold print, and it is important that large institutions do likewise and are not allowed off-set costs against other things. Regulation will be very difficult in this context.</P>
    <P>The Minister is taking the proposed disclosure regime too far. For example, disclosures on pure protection products is totally unnecessary. Both the professional insurance brokers association and the Irish Brokers Association have explained this to the Minister in correspondence. Pure protection products do not carry a value. The insurance intermediary commission has no material effect on this guaranteed product. The consumer will be paid in full on death or serious illness regardless of what or when the insurance intermediary is paid. Even the consumer association is prepared to accept non-disclosure on pure protection products, and we will be tabling an amendment in this regard.</P>
    <P>I would like to see two further amendments introduced, namely, providing for the appointment of an independent authority to which cases can be submitted where it is perceived that actual guidelines have been ignored or manipulated. Insurance intermediaries are given the facility to state what their commission covers, ie, payment of office, overheads, staff costs, time, etc. Consumers must be informed that commission is not a perk, but the equivalent of a salary or fee for doing a job. In order to create a level playing field between direct sellers and insurance intermediaries, the Minister must ensure that the broker distribution channel is fully compared to institutions.</P>
    <P>In the context of new section 43F(1)(<i>a</i>)(i)(IV)(ii), I note the Minister is suggesting that commission payable be subject to a <Col N="1264" /> statutory notice. Is the Minister proposing to regulate commission payments? If so, then it is anti-competitive and I will very strongly oppose it.</P>
    <P>Regarding new section 43F(1)(<i>b</i>), I suggest the Minister discuss it with the industry and the insurance intermediary representative bodies and agree to issue all finalised information with the policy and cooling off notice.</P>
    <P>Banks can cherry-pick clients to take up house and car insurance because a massive volume of business goes through them. They are diversifying and are currently acquiring insurance companies. It is a popular element of their operations and it is clear from recent takeovers that insurance is seen as part and parcel of banking. It is important that that sector is also regulated.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State ensure that only those who comply with this legislation can sell insurance or give advice on insurance and that any professionals who dabble in the insurance business will be prevented from doing so in future unless they comply with the Act? Members of the accountancy profession dabble in insurance. They give referrals and recommend clients to insurance companies.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the regulation whereby restricted activity intermediaries do not handle cash. In discussing this with insurance intermediaries, it seems that many of them do not have bank accounts and, therefore, cannot facilitate direct debit payments. I seek clarification on this issue. This means that insurance intermediaries are given small amounts of cash from time to time. If this practice is discontinued a large number of people will be disenfranchised from using the services of insurance intermediaries and will not be able to avail of independent advice. The less well off will be unlikely to purchase insurance products because they feel intimidated by banks to a certain extent and many of them use credit unions.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a duty to ensure that all consumers can avail of the services of an insurance intermediary. Such individuals do not just sell products. They provide personal advice and point the consumer in the right direction. This Bill is welcome but it is not comprehensive enough as it does not cover all the sectors of the insurance industry, particularly in regard to buying and selling a house, borrowing money and other personal financial transactions.</P>
    <P>The proposed abolition of section 48, which deals with life accounts, will lead to intimidation of the vulnerable consumer who will be forced into a bank to clear his funds in order to obtain a draft. A section 48 account is a client account which brokers use and it has worked very well to date. It will be unsatisfactory if they are abolished as the banks are competing with insurance intermediaries and I will table an amendment to this section. It will be extraordinarily difficult for the <Col N="1265" /> transfer of funds if a person decides to cash in his or her policy because the cheque will have to be forwarded by the insurance intermediary to the client who, therefore, will have to go to a bank to get the cash if he or she wishes to transfer from one company to another whereas currently he or she can switch through his or her broker. This will be restricted. I also seek clarification on whether that is the purpose of the abolition of this section as it refers exclusively to client accounts.</P>

      <P>On Wednesday, 19 August 1998 William Brady died in London. Police were called to the location of the man's remains. PC Paul Lancaster stated:</P>
      <P>.[The male was recognised by PC2877R Christianson as WILLIAM THOMAS BRADY, date of birth 4/8/68 of 137 Morley Ave N22. A PNC name check was carried out and his identity was confirmed by the descriptions of his tattoos on the PNC.]</P>
      <P>It is clear from an early stage that this young man's identity was established. The police said they called to his last known address and were told by the person residing there that Mr. Brady no longer lived there and the person then provided them with details of a relative. The police claim that they carried out a public advertising campaign through which they asked people to come forward in order to identify this young man but it came to nothing.</P>
      <P>Mr. Brady's mother was concerned when she had not heard from her son, although he had been in difficulties and it was not unusual, and she asked somebody who was visiting London to check up on him. She then discovered that her son had been dead for nine months. The police authorities claim that when they had no success with their advertising campaign, William Brady was cremated on 29 October 1998. At that point his family was told that his ashes were dispersed at the rear of the police station. The family has since been told that those were not the circumstances and his relatives were given his ashes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In May 1999 the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, on foot of correspondence and representations from the Taoiseach, asked the Irish Embassy in London to seek information from the Coroner's Court on the circumstances surrounding Mr. Brady's death and an explanation as to why the Garda was not contacted. Following advice from the Minister, Mr. Brady's mother immediately made a complaint to the Police Complaints Authority. As far I am aware, there has been no follow-up correspon<Col N="1266" /> dence on foot of the Minister's request that an inquiry should be carried out. When Mrs. Brady lodged her complaint with the authority she received a reply in June 1999 which stated that it was not a matter for the authority and that before a complaint can be investigated the chief constable of the force must decide whether to record it. It was, therefore, referred to the chief constable. If the chief constable decides not to record the complaint, the authority has no power to overrule the decision. Mrs. Brady has still heard nothing from the authority.</P>
    <P>This is an extremely tragic case. This young man had a number of children, but he had difficulties. He was a drug abuser and was on a methadone programme when he died. His family does not know how he died. His mother has received the coroner's report but found it extraordinary that it suggested that, although all his organs were intact, he may have died as a result of a methadone overdose. Family members are finding it difficult to come to terms with his death. The police knew he was Irish because they had a record of him and were able to identify him at the scene of his death. It is unbelievable that they did not find it worth their while to telephone the Garda, inform it that they had the body of a young Irish man and ask whether his relatives could be traced.</P>
    <P>Mrs. Brady feels that her son's life did not even amount to the cost of a telephone call by the British authorities to the Garda. I spoke to her recently and although she has ashes which were given to her by the police authorities in England, she does not believe fully, because of the tragic circumstances, that they are her son's. That is an absolute travesty of justice and the Minister should ascertain why a simple telephone call was not made to trace this young man's relatives. His body was held for ten weeks, and nine months after he died Mrs. Brady discovered that her son was dead after she asked someone to make inquiries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, who would like to have been in the House to hear the matter raised by Deputy McGennis and to express his condolences to this man's family on his tragic death, on the way in which they learned of it and of the cremation of his body. I, too, express my condolences to the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, was informed of this case in May 1999 and was asked to try to get an explanation of the circumstances of the death, why the Garda Síochána was not contacted and why the remains were disposed of. The embassy in London wrote to the coroner for the northern district of London who, in reply, described in detail the <Col N="1267" /> efforts made by the police and his office to establish the identity of the man's next of kin.</P>
    <P>The address which the deceased had given in connection with reporting on bail while facing charges of theft was checked by the police but it was found that he had not lived there for some time and a woman at that address did not know of any next of kin. Formal identification was made by fingerprints but such identification did not reveal any next of kin on record. The coroner stated that &ldquo;it would have been quite unreasonable simply to give the Garda a name of someone thought to be an Irishman and ask it to try to trace relatives.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The coroner's office inquired of all the local hospitals but they had no records which were of help. Representatives of that office then spoke to the solicitor who had represented the deceased in connection with theft charges who said he had a sister who used to be a bar-maid at a certain pub, but inquiries there showed that she had left six months previously without leaving a forwarding address. The dead man's probation officer was contacted but he had no information on next of kin. The coroner's office then spoke to Pentonville Prison where the deceased had served a sentence but he was not listed there under his correct name, apparently because he used a false name. According to the coroner, when it was realised that the information on record in connection with bail was false, other people were interviewed in an effort to establish the man's identity but to no avail. His doctor had been incorrectly informed by the deceased that his father was dead.</P>
    <P>The coroner was satisfied that assiduous inquiries were made to establish the identity of the deceased but that the police and his office were hampered by the fact that the man had given false names and other false information to all the authorities.</P>
    <P>An inquest held on 14 October 1998 found that the cause of death was methadone overdose. The coroner informed the embassy that the body was retained until the end of October 1998 and that when by then no next of kin had made themselves known it was released to the local authority for disposal. His office some time afterwards gave members of the family a full explanation of all the inquiries that had been made.</P>
    <P>The Deputy assumes that the man's name and nationality were known to the London Metropolitan Police, but according to the coroner, that is not correct. Deputy McGennis has informed the House that the officer who went to the location at which the deceased died was immediately able to identify him. That is a new factor in this case which I know the Minister for Foreign Affairs will follow up.</P>
    <P>Although at this stage the Minister does not know anything about the role of the police beyond what has been communicated to him by <Col N="1268" /> the coroner, he is inclined to agree with the Deputy that they should have contacted the Garda. It is open to the family to make a formal complaint and it has done so. If the family wishes the Minister, through the embassy in London, to seek more information from the police, he will be happy to do so. Should the family wish that contact be made with the local authority, the Minister is also willing to get the embassy to do that.</P>
    <P>I reiterate our condolences on this very sad death. A life is a life and this man was somebody's next of kin. In spite of the sad circumstances in which he found himself, it is my belief and that of the Minister that every effort should have been made at the time of his death to trace the man's next of kin. I hope that raising this matter in the House will emphasise that point to the police authorities, the coroner and others who should have made greater efforts in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity, however brief, to raise this matter and I am very appreciative of the Minister's attendance in the House. I realise the Minister is very busy but the fact that she has not asked another Minister to deal with the matter is significant and indicative of her concern about this issue.</P>
      <P>The consequences of the closure of the three peat-burning power stations in County Offaly have not been fully realised throughout the community. A question mark now hangs over the relationship between the ESB and Bord na Móna. The House will be aware of the huge importance of those twin industries to the provision of employment in County Offaly in recent decades. Towns such as Kilcormac, Daingean, Ferbane, Banagher, Shannonbridge, Rhode and Edenderry have relied almost exclusively on Bord na Móna and the ESB for employment since the 1940s and 1950s. We are now witnessing, through the stroke of a pen on the part of the ESB, a huge change in that relationship and in employment patterns throughout the county.</P>
      <P>The ESB has announced the closure of Ferbane power station, and the closure of Rhode power station is beyond doubt although the date has not been finalised. I understand that the closure of the stations in Shannonbridge and Lanesboro, County Longford, is also imminent, although the exact dates on which the gates will close have not been announced. These closures will adversely affect more than 1,000 employees and their families who have depended on the ESB and Bord na Móna for their living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in a statement last week, stated that the ESB had informed her of its intention to build two new peat-burning power stations to replace the four which are being decommissioned. While that news is to be welcomed, it is cold comfort for the people of County Offaly. <Col N="1269" /> Only last week a national report revealed that income levels in the county are the second lowest in the country, with Roscommon at the bottom of the league. There is a clear need for all Government agencies and for the Minister and her colleagues to ensure that employment creation ventures are targeted towards the reduction of unemployment levels in County Offaly in an attempt to soften the blow of the huge changes which are to be carried out by the ESB and Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>The announcement of the two new power stations has occurred in a climate of uncertainty. We do not know where they will be located, how many people they will employ, the timescale for their start-up or their completion dates, nor are we certain of the ESB's future in regard to electricity generation from peat-burning stations. I hope the air can be cleared on this matter. I challenge the Minister to make a categoric statement in regard to the Government's future policies and the ESB's future plans in regard to peat-burning electricity generation.</P>
    <P>The consequences for Bord na Móna are also quite bleak in so far as it seems that some of the plant in mid-Offaly will have to shift to the west of the county to accommodate a new station if or when one is built. That will result in redundancies and other problems in the middle and north of the county.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna will shortly announce a rationalisation plan which will affect the peat briquette stations in Offaly. While I understand two new stations are being built &ndash; although I await clarification from the Minister &ndash; nothing is planned for north Offaly consequent on the closure of the Rhode station which will add to the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Flanagan for raising this matter. All the Deputies in his constituency, including my Cabinet colleague, Deputy Cowen, and Deputy Enright have raised this matter with me. The Deputy asked about the future of peat-burning power stations in Offaly and the Government's policy on the use of peat. Peat plays and will continue to play a strategic role in Irish energy policy. There is no change in Government policy on the continued use of peat on security grounds in the generation of electricity. The bulk of the peat used in electricity generation is taken from the large peat reserve in the midlands, which includes large tracts of County Offaly. That will continue to be the case in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our energy policy has three primary objectives; the supply of a choice of fuels to consumers as efficiently as possible at internationally competitive prices; the consumption of this energy as efficiently as possible; and the production of as much of national energy requirements from indigenous sources as is economically possible. Our natural gas reserves off the south coast will run out in the next few <Col N="1270" /> years. The Corrib gas discovery off the west coast is the subject of further exploration to test its commerciality. In the meantime, peat will be our only native source of fuel. Ireland is almost totally dependent on imported fuels to meet its energy needs.</P>
    <P>Security of supply is, therefore, a very important consideration. Imported fuels are subject to international fuel price volatility. Peat, as an indigenous fuel, offers certain advantages in this regard in that it is produced domestically. The value of peat was particularly noticeable during the oil crises of the 1970's and 1980's when it was cheaper than oil, at times significantly so, for many years. Security of supply is also one of the main planks of the European Union's energy policy. It recognises the need for diversity of fuel supplies and has accepted that account must be taken of the need to develop indigenous energy sources. This is reflected in the EU electricity directive which provides that up to 15% of the fuel mix used in electricity generation can be reserved for indigenous sources. The directive also makes separate provision for a public service obligation mechanism relating to security of supply.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Flanagan said, on 17 February I announced a new milestone framework for the electricity market in Ireland. I indicated that, following consultations with the EU Commission in Brussels, two new state of the art peat stations, to be owned by the ESB, would be built over the next few years in addition to the state of the art peat-fired plant currently under construction in the east midlands by Edenderry Power Limited. In the meantime, those existing peat stations currently producing electricity will operate on an increasingly efficient basis under an interim PSO arrangement to facilitate orderly closure, dovetailed with the coming on stream of the new stations.</P>
    <P>The ESB has informed me it intends the new stations will be at Shannonbridge and Lanesboro. I spoke to them this afternoon and they said this will be announced before the end of March. They will also announce the establishment of a project team to plan the two new plants. The scenario I outlined is an optimum one which guarantees the continued use of peat as a fuel in the generation of electricity, provides necessary environmental and efficiency improvements and underpins longer term employment in the production of peat. The effect of the foregoing framework is that the country will continue to have a dynamic peat industry contributing to electricity generation with a corresponding social and economic spin-off in the midland region, particularly in County Offaly. The unions, management and Department officials signed the framework document in the belief that the ESB and Bord na Móna have a viable future in the midlands.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buiochas a gabháil leis an Aire as ucht teacht isteach chun páirt a glacadh sa diospóireacht tábhachtach seo. The resignation of three members of the Arts Council appointed by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands has been the subject of much media coverage and analysis in the past few weeks. Opinions differ on how the crisis at the Arts Council emerged. There are various opinions regarding how much responsibility the Minister should bear for the controversy. The Minister appointed the council and is solely responsible for its composition and membership. In this respect, she is responsible for the discord and disharmony between the members of the council.</P>
      <P>There is a consensus that whatever difficulties existed on the council, more fundamental issues are at stake, including the appropriateness of the current council mode, particularly its size and its perceived failure to adhere to a well-defined strategy as opposed to one based on short-term considerations. The Minister stated she will introduce legislation to reform the 1951 and 1973 arts Acts. However, as we are all aware, legislation takes time. In the meantime, the Minister must be held accountable for the performance of the council and must ensure it is in a position to perform its duties effectively. That responsibility is hers alone.</P>
      <P>The powers to which this motion refers, under section 13(7) of the Arts Act, 1973, are drastic. They empower the Minister to appoint and dismiss members of the council. Obviously, they should be used with the utmost caution. However, they exist for one purpose &ndash; to give the Minister the power to ensure the Arts Council can function effectively. Considerable evidence suggests this is not the case. The resignation of three members which brought the crisis in the Arts Council into public view was caused, to some extent, by the excessive number of meetings. There were a reported 90 meetings last year. The resignation letter of one of the members of the council which found its way into the public domain cites concern about the role being played by the board, arising from administrative difficulties. These issues must be urgently addressed by the Minister if her reputation and that of the Arts Council are to be restored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The controversy has affected the officers and support staff who carry out the daily work of the council. The staff are dedicated and hard-working. It would be unfair and unrealistic to expect them to function effectively with such a cloud hanging over the council. Governance of the arts is extremely important. The arts have provided a creative, vibrant and exciting dynamic in Irish culture. Not only have Irish artists generated new revenue for the State in recent years but they have also succeeded in projecting a modern image of this country across the world. I wish the new chairman and members of the board well. <Col N="1272" /> The onus is on the Minister to put right whatever is wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Arts Council is now a significant State body. It has moved from the role of advocate and supporter of a relatively limited constituency to that of a centrally important national development and resource agency for the arts in all its forms.</P>
      <P>In appointing the Arts Council in 1998, I was very conscious of the need to demonstrate clearly the inclusiveness of the arts. The members came to the council with experience and a broad range of disciplines and must bring this broad spectrum of experience to the table to enable the council to function as a cohesive body in the service of the arts generally.</P>
      <P>This council has been extremely active in its work in promoting quality and innovation in all aspects of the practice of the arts since appointed in June 1998.</P>
      <P>To give the Deputy some idea of the workload of the council, I can advise him that the council met 15 times in plenary session in its first year, which included a number of induction meetings as well as very intensive working meetings on the development of the arts plan. It has long been the tradition of the council to meet ten times a year. Also, council members are on four standing committees that have been established by the council, as well as being members of expert panels and working groups. For any council member this has meant attendance of up to 70 meetings in a 12 month period.</P>
      <P>The development of a new arts plan was a priority for the council for the first 12 months after its inception. The level of diligence and commitment displayed by all the council members was enormous in undertaking this task, and the arts sector should be indebted to them for it. The council adopted a multi-faceted approach in the development of the plan and was informed not only by an independent review but also by numerous meetings with the arts sector and other interested groups as well as submissions and much research.</P>
      <P>The Arts Council has adopted a strategy which aims to re-evaluate, reorganise and radically reinvigorate the place of the arts at the heart of society. I support this new strategic approach which has the aim of providing more focused and targeted resources to the arts sector. This approach by the council will, I hope, assist the sector to develop in a more planned way. I am keenly aware that the new plan is a challenge to both the Arts Council itself and to the arts sector. A new strategic approach and change in direction is not something that can be effected in the short-term. I am of the view, however, that the arts plan provides a good framework to facilitate the Arts Council in its aim of moving from being a broadly funding agency to becoming a more focused developmental agency for the arts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1273" /> The Arts Council is committed to carrying out this process of change in conjunction with all the key players involved in the arts. The plan is about strategic partnerships and the success of the plan is very much reliant on the success of these partnerships. One of the key goals set out by the council in the plan is the further development of the arts at local and regional level through the establishment of more strategic partnerships.</P>
    <P>All these are a remarkable record of achievement by this council, representing an enormous personal commitment by each member. The willingness of individuals to serve in the Arts Council is an expression of a spirit of public service and a decision to resign is ultimately a personal one. All three who recently resigned cited pressure of work and referred to the volume of demands being made on them.</P>
    <P>In October, I announced that I was arranging for a review of the current arts legislation which will examine the effectiveness of the Arts Acts, 1951, and 1973, in providing the necessary support for the ongoing development of the arts. The review will incorporate an examination of the current policy and executive structures and their effectiveness. The review is being lead by my Department and will involve consultation with all the partners involved in the development and support of the arts, including the Arts Council, the arts sector and individual artists, State agencies and local authorities, and the general public. The outcome of this comprehensive review will inform proposals for any new arts legislation and I hope to be in a position to finalise the review later this year.</P>
    <P>I have every confidence in the Arts Council and its members. What we now have in Ireland is nothing less than a thriving, lively, world-class arts sector in the making, which embraces all disciplines and whose achievement is the equal of anything to be found anywhere else. I am acutely conscious of the wealth of our contemporary arts scene, for its own intrinsic merit and for its contribution to economic and social well-being and development. Long may it continue with the appropriate and continuous support of the Arts Council.</P>
    <P>It is a little disingenuous for the Deputy opposite to comment on the arts Acts. I have already said we need a review of that legislation. If the Deputy believed they are in such need of reform, it is amazing that he and the party to which he belongs, when it was in power some years ago, did not initiate it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Riverbank Courthouse in Dublin, across the Liffey from the Four Courts, was specially established to allow the Circuit Court deal with family disputes primarily between estranged husbands and wives. There are two Circuit Courts in the building and a number of consultation rooms. This building, since it was first opened, has proved to be inadequate to meet the needs of the people who come there. On a daily basis there is often between 15 and 20 couples awaiting hearings of judicial separation cases, disputes over custody of children and also divorce proceedings, and the consultation facilities are grossly inadequate.</P>
      <P>The problems relating to this building have been greatly exacerbated over the past two weeks. Effectively, the building has been deprived of heating and the conditions within the building can best be described as arctic. In the courtrooms in particular, it is practically impossible for business to be conducted to allow people sort out their problems.</P>
      <P>The kernel of the difficulty is apparently that this building, on a nightly basis, is invaded by drug addicts who take up habitation in the boiler house of the building and spend their evening shooting heroin and taking other drugs. It has been a problem for the staff of the court building for some time that they have been finding needles in various locations. I understand it is also a problem for the judges who sit in the courts.</P>
      <P>This problem has now reached ludicrous proportions. It appears that a courthouse opened to deal with sensitive and distressing family cases cannot be secured by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda, or by the security firm which I understand is paid to secure the building, to prevent regular incursions into it by people who behave in an illegal manner, taking drugs, and who apparently, when the boiler house gets too hot, switch off the heating system. Apparently it is beyond the wit of the Office of Public Works or whoever is responsible for this heating system to either secure the building or to ensure, at the very minimum, that the heating system is put on at a sufficiently early time in the morning in the middle of winter to ensure that the building is functioning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an extraordinary state of affairs. I want an explanation as to why the building cannot be secured. I want an explanation as to what is being done to exclude drug addicts from the building. I want an explanation as to what will be done to ensure that proper security is functioning in the building. I want a guarantee that the heating system will be reinstated and that it will work on a daily basis, not just on an occasional basis. The House is entitled to an explanation of this state <Col N="1275" /> of affairs from a Minister who made so much of the concept of zero tolerance prior to taking up office.</P>
    <P>It is a tribute to the staff of this courthouse, to the judges who sit and, in fairness, to the lawyers also that they have continued sittings in these appalling conditions. In the context of my making a declaration of interest, I am one of the lawyers who occasionally represents clients in these courts. We all know husbands and wives who have found themselves in court because their marriages have broken down under great pressure. They are greatly distressed. They are particularly upset on the day when the court case is being dealt with. They are entitled to have reasonable, humane, warm facilities in which they can await their court hearing, and they are entitled to be in a courtroom that is habitable and is not so cold that people are literally shaking with the cold. Judges, lawyers and husbands and wives are all shaking with the cold. I hope the Minister can shed some light on why this problem has been allowed to fester and give a guarantee that it will be immediately addressed, if it has not been addressed by now. I first sought to raise this issue on the Adjournment last Tuesday. I am grateful to be able to do so and I hope the fact that it has been on the agenda for a possible Adjournment debate has resulted in some remedial action being taken yesterday or today.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, cannot be present and she sends her apologies to the House and to Deputy Shatter. She asked me to take the debate for her.</P>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the Circuit Court family law building at the Riverbank Courthouse in Dublin. I have made inquiries from the Courts Service and it informed me that there have been ongoing problems with people sleeping rough in the side entrance to the building. However, the Courts Service and the Garda have confirmed that there is certainly no occupation of the building by drug abusers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A member of the Garda Síochána is assigned permanently to the Riverbank Courthouse and a <Col N="1276" /> service officer is located at a desk in the main hall of the building. There have been difficulties for those using the side entrance and the Courts Service has had to arrange to have the area regularly cleaned. The local Garda authorities have also been informed of the problems caused by people sleeping rough in this area. More recently, the power supply to the building was interfered with and this in turn affected the time settings for the heating system in the building, which in turn led to the cold conditions referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>This matter is being addressed urgently by the Courts Service through the Office of Public Works to ensure that no one can tamper with the power supply to the building. A steel door to the boiler house will be fitted tomorrow to prevent access by unauthorised persons to this area. In addition, security fencing is being provided to prevent public access to the side entrance of the building.</P>
    <P>In the longer term, the Courts Service has decided to locate all its family law business in Dublin in a purpose-built family law centre. A site at Ormond Quay has been identified and will be developed by Dublin Corporation on behalf of the Courts Service. Planning is already under way for this project and consultations have taken place with court users in respect of the project. Preliminary sketch plans should be available within the next month or so which will form the basis of further discussions with all family law court users. The new building will have modern court and office accommodation and proper facilities for the Judiciary, staff, the legal profession, litigants, the public and all those who have an involvement in family law cases. Sufficient courtrooms will be provided to meet the foreseeable demands in the family law area of the District, Circuit and High Courts.</P>
    <P>When this building has been constructed, the family law business currently carried out in the Riverbank Courthouse will be transferred to the new family law centre together with all District and High Court family law business being held in Dublin at present.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 7 March 2000.</P>

    <P>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera): As the Deputy is no doubt aware, I have just returned from Los Angeles where I met US film industry leaders.</P>
    <P>Meetings and contacts took place with Twentieth Century Fox; HBO; Warner Brothers Pictures; William Morris Agency and MGM Pictures. These companies were selected on the basis of their potential to contribute to the development of the film industry in Ireland. I also visited the Screen Commission of Ireland stand at the Locations Expo. I also hosted a reception for US film industry leaders and Irish industry professionals visiting Los Angeles for the American Film Market.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of the importance I attach to further developing and strengthening the links between the US film industry and the Irish film industry and of my strong view that meetings and events such as those recently held in Los Angeles are vitally important in ensuring that Ireland is kept very much in the minds of decision makers in Hollywood when considering making a film in Europe. During my visit, I availed of every opportunity to emphasise that Ireland is a rich source of talent and creativity and that opportunities exist for US producers to work with Irish producers in developing stories for the international market. I received very positive reaction and I am confident that my visit has created opportunities which will be pursued by the Screen Commission.</P>

      <P>A draft memorandum for Government on the official languages equality Bill will shortly be circulated for observations to all Departments. The purpose of this memorandum will be to seek the approval of the Government to prepare a general scheme of the Bill. In the meantime work on the preparation of the general scheme, the heads of the Bill, has commenced. I anticipate that those heads will have been prepared by early summer for submission to Government and that the Bill itself will be published by the end of the present year. This matter was also previously discussed in a general way at a specially convened <Col N="1281" /> meeting of the interdepartmental committee on the Gaeltacht, Irish language and islands.</P>

      <P>I propose that Questions Nos. 22 and 28 be taken together.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 the Government is committed to facilitating the further development of the State's arts and culture infrastructure. The previous programme of development under the cultural development incentive scheme, which was part funded by the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999, has facilitated an increase in the number of arts facilities and venues in the regions, the provision of which will facilitate greater access and participation in the arts for all our citizens.</P>
      <P>I am finalising a new support capital programme to assist further necessary development in this area. The new programme that I will be putting in place will have three strands, first, the provision of new regional, city and county projects to fill gaps in existing facilities, second, the redevelopment of existing arts and culture infrastructure and, third, the programme will assist the development of community based projects. The regional provision of facilities will be taken into consideration in all strands of the programme.</P>
      <P>The programme will have an application and assessment process and I hope to be in a position to formally launch the new programme and to make a call for applications in the near future.</P>

      <P>I met the Arts Council on 22 February. While I am happy to meet the Arts Council from time to time to discuss issues of mutual concern, I have no plans to meet the council again in the near future. The willingness of individuals to serve on the Arts Council is an expression of a spirit of public service and the decision to resign is ultimately a personal one. All three who resigned cited pressure of work and referred to the volume of the demands being made on them. The review of the arts legislation recently announced by me will, <i>inter alia</i>, examine the appropriate relationships, roles and functions of the council and the executive.</P>

      <P>It is intended that the national biodiversity plan will be published by the end of 2000.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it was important to have the widest possible participation in the development of the plan. Towards that end, public notices were placed in the national press inviting submissions from interested parties or individuals. Submissions were also invited directly from relevant organisations, including third level institutions and NGOs, representative of both conservation and sectoral interests. Approximately 50 submissions were received, quite a number of which were comprehensive. These were reviewed and incorporated, as appropriate, into the draft plan.</P>
      <P>A key element of the plan will be the appropriate integration of policies for the promotion and protection of biodiversity into the policies and approaches of other relevant Departments. It is, therefore, necessary to fully consult with those Departments and to reach agreement on the final content of the plan. A working draft has been informally circulated to the key players and discussions on the text are ongoing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view, there has been no undue delay in the preparation of the plan, and the time taken to date reflects both the need for consultation and the complexity of the exercise. It is intended that <Col N="1283" /> the national biodiversity plan will dovetail with the national heritage plan, which is also in the course of preparation.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my replies to previous parliamentary questions in relation to flooding problems on the River Shannon, Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, is responsible for navigation only on the river and one of its principal duties is to ensure there is adequate water depth for the navigation of boats on the system.</P>
      <P>Water levels in the three main lakes on the river, viz. Lough Allen, Lough Ree and Lough Derg are controlled by the ESB while water levels-depths in the river between these lakes are controlled by Dúchas for navigation purposes by means of a series of weirs with sluices. These weirs are so constructed as to retain water at a level adequate for navigation and Dúchas is satisfied that this level does not give rise to flooding. When the water level rises in the river above that necessary for navigation purposes, the sluices are opened and any weir-boards removed so as to aid the flow of water. Every effort is made to keep these sluices free of debris. The weirs are overtopped in times of flood and, when water is flowing freely over the tops of the weirs and all the sluices are open, Dúchas is not in a position to exercise further control on water levels.</P>

      <P>Having been consulted by South Dublin County Council regarding a planning application to demolish Riversdale House and other buildings in the grounds of the former residence of W.B. Yeats, officials of my Department inspected the property. In their opinion the house dates to the early 18th century and is itself of architectural heritage value. The association with Yeats adds to this value.</P>
      <P>On 9 February 2000 my Department, on my behalf, advised South Dublin County Council that Riversdale House should not be demolished and, furthermore, recommended that the house be included in the council's record of protected structures. Inclusion in this record places a duty on the owner to ensure that the building is not endangered in any way.</P>
      <P>Planning authorities must have regard, under section 4 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999, to any recommendations made by me. However, a decision may be made not to comply with a recommendation, provided that an explanation is made outlining the reasons why inclusion in the record of protected structures is considered inappropriate. I understand that the council has initiated the process to place the building on the record of protected structures.</P>
      <P>In response to my recommendation the council passed a motion that the State acquire the property and develop it for heritage purposes. In addition, the council requested a meeting with my Department to discuss this and other implications. I am happy to facilitate this request for a meeting and the necessary arrangements are being made. However you will appreciate that the protection of the architectural heritage is primarily a matter for the planning authorities. It is simply not possible to safeguard our built heritage by the State itself acquiring and presenting to the public each important structure.</P>
      <P>The final decision on whether or not the planning application should be accepted or rejected rests with South Dublin County Council and its decision in the matter is awaited.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, for a number of years now, Údarás na Gaeltachta has, in co-operation with the North Western Health Board, provided a scheduled winter helicopter service to Tory Island, County Donegal. Recently I came to an agreement, after discussions with Údarás na Gaeltachta, to reimburse it the cost of <Col N="1286" /> providing this and the Tory Island ferry service as part of my Department's policy of bringing all access services to the islands under the auspices of the one body. In addition to the scheduled Tory Island helicopter service, an arrangement exists with the Department of Defence for the provision of an emergency helicopter service to the islands where feasible on occasions when no other means of access are available.</P>
      <P>While there are, with the exception of Tory Island, currently no scheduled helicopter services to the islands, quite significant progress has been made in improving the access requirements of the islands since my appointment and I intend to continue with this work for the remainder of my term of office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the 1994 Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, as amended, planning authorities are obliged to notify certain prescribed bodies of planning applications received by them, depending on the nature and effects of the proposed development on the interests of the body concerned. My Department, as the State authority charged with the protection and conservation of the nation's natural and built heritage, is one of the prescribed bodies. Where such applications are referred to my Department they are assessed by Dúchas, the heritage service, whose views are conveyed to the planning authority where they are warranted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of planning and development proposals-applications received by Dúchas in January and February was 1,500. The figures for 1995 to 1999 were 2,700, 3,100, 4,500, 6,100 and 7,500 respectively and represent a 178% increase over those years. The increase is as a result of the growth in the economy over the same period as well as an increased awareness of heritage matters generally. Advice on planning and development proposals-applications is required from a number of disciplines within Dúchas. Rangers-ecologists provide advice in relation to the natural heritage, engineers provide advice in relation to inland waterways and both architects and <Col N="1287" /> archaeologists provide advice in relation to the built heritage.</P>
    <P>Generally many proposed developments are discussed with my officials in advance and this has given the opportunity to provide advice at an early stage to balance development with conservation. Very few applications affecting the heritage are opposed and this pre-application consultation mechanism can help avoid delay. The volume of consultations has grown considerably, however, and it is not possible to offer this detailed level of advice in all cases. In the case of architectural heritage it is now recognised that this preliminary advice is best given at local level and planning authorities now have funds and sanction to recruit architectural conservation officers in this regard.</P>
    <P>Where a proposed development would impact on an area of heritage importance, Dúchas may have no objection to the proposed development; or recommend to the planning authority the incorporation of conditions in the grant permission that would address their concerns in relation to this site; or object to the proposed development and recommend to the planning authority the refusal of planning permission. In cases where Dúchas have no objections they advise the planning authorities only when requested to do so. In the other two situations it is a matter solely for the planning authorities to decide whether or not to accept such recommendations and I would hope that the planning authorities in their decisions would address any concerns raised with them by Dúchas.</P>
    <P>I believe that the advice offered by Dúchas is professional and it has helped save aspects of our heritage from damage through inappropriate development. For the most part there are sufficient resources to deal with planning applications in an efficient manner although I am preparing proposals to recruit additional staff for archaeology to deal with a number of pressure areas in this discipline.</P>

      <P>The project management group established by Government to oversee the establishment of a digital terrestrial television entity in Ireland is chaired by an official of my Department. The project management group also includes representatives of my Department and the Departments of Finance, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Public Enterprise, along with RTÉ.</P>
      <P>A considerable amount of work has been done in identifying the assets to be transferred to the new entity. The preparation of an information memorandum was put in train. Arrangements were made to ensure that the decisions of the project management group would be informed by the concerns of the staff in RTÉ who would likely be transferred to the new digital transmission entity. Considerable work in developing the structure and management of the transaction to select the majority partner in the DTT, platform was carried out. The transaction structure had to be such that it ensured that RTÉ and Teilifís na Gaeilge would obtain fair value for the assets to be transferred to the new entity. In addition to this requirement, it is crucial that the transaction framework satisfied legal and regulatory requirements at both a national and European Union level.</P>
      <P>The development of a transaction process that satisfied all the requirements and the participants on the project management group and met the Government objectives in introducing digital terrestrial television has proved to be a difficult and complex task. I have, with the advice of the project management group been considering how best to progress the establishment of a DTT platform and have sought the observations of some of my Cabinet colleagues on a possible way forward. If and when I decide that it is necessary to bring proposals to Government to progress the matter further, I will do so.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the payments which were made by my Department in December 1999 to compensate hill sheep farmers for any losses incurred in 1999 as a result of destocking by 30% at the end of 1998, in accordance with the interim national commonage framework plan.</P>
      <P>My Department has prepared a general scheme for compensating farmers and other land owners for losses experienced in areas designated for conservation, including commonages. Approval for the scheme, in the context of State aids, has been sought from the EU Commission. Consultations with the Commission are continuing with a view to concluding them successfully as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Because farmers implementing the interim national commonage framework plan had experienced losses of income in 1999, it was necessary to give priority to compensating them before the end of the year, in advance of implementation of the general scheme.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to report that, with the co-operation of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, more than 3,400 farmers received from my Department the payments to which they were entitled at the time of the year when they were most needed. Payments made under the scheme were Exchequer funded and not part of an EU scheme.</P>

      <P>The Worldwide Fund for Nature has not informed my Department of any concerns it may have regarding Ireland's fulfilment of obligations under the EU habitats and birds directives.</P>
      <P>The Habitats Directive requires member states to propose relevant natural areas for designation as special areas of conservation and to protect their favourable conservation status. It was transposed into Irish law in 1997. Since then my Department has publicly advertised 335 proposed candidate special areas of conservation; it has formally transmitted 252 of these sites to the European Commission for inclusion in the Natura 2000 network. I anticipate the public advertisement of marine SACs, together with the remaining terrestrial SACs later this month. The Commission has instituted legal proceedings against Ireland for failure to transmit sites by a deadline and these proceedings are still in place.</P>
      <P>The European Commission agrees with me, and with the Government, that the viability of the Natura 2000 network of sites is dependent on the co-operation of the landowners and land users whose lands are included in the sites. All those whose lands are proposed for SAC designation must be given an opportunity to object to the proposals, on scientific grounds, before I formally transmit the list to the commission. To this end I have established a formal independent board, chaired by Mr. Michael Mills the former Ombudsman, and comprising representation from the landowners and the conservation organisations, to independently assess appeals and to advise me on these matters.</P>
      <P>The European Commission has been notified of our proposals in relation to SACs and the reasons for the failure to meet the deadline for transmission of the list of sites to the commission. The Commission is also aware that, while Ireland is technically not in compliance with the directive, the advertised sites receive full protection under our national legislation.</P>
      <P>I anticipate that prior to the completion of the legal proceedings Ireland will be in full compliance with the directive. Ireland has designated 111 special protection areas under the EU Birds Directive. Recently the Boyne estuary special protection area and the Tolka estuary Sandymount strand special protection area have been extended. Additional survey work will be carried out this year with a view to determining whether additional sites should be designated, or existing sites extended.</P>

      <P>Separately, non-repayable grants of £157,702 and £399,511 were paid to RTE as a contribution to the cost of the Tullamore medium wave transmitter and the Raidio na Gaeltachta transmitter network in the 1970s', respectively.

In the intervening period, representatives of the contractors have held consultations with representatives of Scoil Chaoimhín on 26 occasions dealing with a variety of issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1300" /> A fire, not an explosion, occurred at this site on 24 February 2000. The location of this fire was at a building known as the Clock Tower which is 33 metres, 108 feet, from Scoil Chaoimhín. The fire, which caused limited damage to the Clock Tower and injured no-one, was due to a leak of gas in the supply from a single gas cylinder, providing temporary heating to the Clock Tower, which ignited. This is the only such incident that has happened. The contractor has a strict health and safety regime in place at the site in compliance with his statutory responsibilities which was verified in an inspection by officials of the Health and Safety Authority on 25 February 2000. In addition, and as advised by the Minister for Education and Science in his reply to Question No. 233 on 24 February 2000, a working group was established <i>ab initio</i> comprising officials of the Department of Education and Science and the Office of Public Works, together with staff and parents' representatives from Scoil Chaoimhin, to monitor all aspects of the contract works that might affect the school in any way. This working group meets regularly to address any issues of concern. Furthermore, the consultant architects, engaged by the commissioners to manage the project, monitor compliance by the contractor with his commitments under the building contract. I am satisfied that these safeguards provide sufficient protection to the occupants of adjoining properties, including Scoil Chaoimhín and to the workers on the site and I see no requirement for the appointment of an independent health and safety officer.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply dated 23 February, 2000 to Parliamentary Question No. 34 on the subject of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme.</P>
      <P>A variety of requests have been made for the medical criteria to be relaxed so as to extend the range of qualifying disabilities to include other categories and those suffering from other ailments. In addition, there are continuous requests to allow persons not fully meeting the current criteria to be admitted. The number of potential beneficiaries is unclear, but according to groups representing the disabled, there are as many as 350,000 persons in Ireland who could be regarded as disabled to some degree. The scheme cannot possibly be extended in its current form to such numbers who suffer from some form of disablement or disability and who wish to benefit from tax free cars and fuel.</P>
      <P>The scheme is under review by an interdepartmental group which is chaired by an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This group is trying to resolve the issues involved.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has no role in determining whether a person satisfies the medical criteria laid down in the regulations governing the scheme. That is a matter of judgment on the part of the senior area medical officer in the local health board. Where the issue of such a certificate is refused, the person concerned may appeal that decision to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal, an independent board whose decision is final. This is not the National Rehabilitation Board as the question suggests. It should also be noted that there are other State funded schemes aimed at mobility, namely a mobility allowance and a motorised transport grant, both of which are payable by the health boards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the form C45 has now been replaced by a new form known as the form RCTDC, relevant contracts tax deduction card. This form is part of the relevant contracts tax, RCT, system which applies to payments to self-employed subcontractors in certain industries, including the construction <Col N="1302" /> industry. The system does not apply to employment contracts, which come within the PAYE-PRSI system. Before entering into a contract to which RCT will apply, the subcontractor and principal contractor are required to sign a declaration to the effect that, having regard to guidelines issued by the Revenue Commissioners. they have satisfied themselves that the contract they are about to enter into is not a contract of employment.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the Revenue Commissioners consider that the RCT system is a valuable tool in their fight against tax evasion in the construction industry. The system was introduced in 1970 as a means of countering the lump system in the industry.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners undertook a special project in 1997, 1998 and 1999 to check on the operation of PAYE-PRSI in the construction industry. This campaign included site visits to more than 7,000 contractors and entailed an examination of the declarations by reference to the particular circumstances of the person employed. Where the sub-contractor status was considered to be inconsistent with the terms of employment the principal was asked to deduct PAYE-PRSI and levies. In the course of the campaign, the tax status of over 61,000 subcontractors was considered.</P>
      <P>The results of the campaign indicate that 88% of principal contractors visited had either correctly classified all employees-subcontractors or agreed to abide by the ruling of the Revenue as to the correct classification. A number of follow-up visits will be made to ensure continued compliance in a sample of these cases. Cases in which workers were incorrectly classified and which did not accept Revenue's ruling in the matter are being dealt with in the course of the Revenue audit programme for 1999-2000. It is considered that the results of the campaign do not justify a further campaign of this nature, in the short-term at least. Such a campaign would tie-up significant Revenue resources, which would mean that other areas of possible evasion would not receive the attention they might deserve.</P>
      <P>The operation of PAYE-PRSI is one of the items checked in the course of routine Revenue audits. By implication, that check entails a check on the use of forms RCTDC. Where an employer is found to have failed to operate PAYE-PRSI in respect of payments to employees, the employer is liable for the tax, PRSI and levies which should have been deducted on payment together with the employer's portion of PRSI, interest and penalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that the continuing debate regarding the use of forms RCTDC is in reality a debate concerning the issue of self-employment in the construction industry. The Revenue Commissioners do not have the authority to regulate the nature of employment relationships within the industry. This is a matter for the parties to any particular contract. The role of the Revenue Commissioners is to ensure that the correct tax, <Col N="1303" /> PRSI and levies is paid, whether by deduction or payment following the issue of an assessment.</P>

      <P>The Irish Kidney Association, with the support of National Lottery funding allocated by my Department, conducts an ongoing national organ donor campaign and produces a multi-organ donor card. This has contributed to Ireland's position of having one of the highest rates of organ donation in Europe. The association's public awareness programme is recognised throughout Europe as being very effective and has been used as a model for donor campaigns in other countries. Notwithstanding our strong record in this area I am concerned by a reported decline in <Col N="1304" /> organ donation and transplant rates in this country last year. I have been informed by the Irish Kidney Association that, in collaboration with other donor support groups, they are in the process of launching a new campaign aimed at heightening public awareness of the importance of organ donation. I would stress the continued need to highlight the importance of organ donation and the resulting benefits for patients who are fortunate to receive a transplant.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by Beaumont Hospital that the approximate cost of maintaining a patient on haemodialysis is £30,000 per annum and maintaining a patient on peritoneal dialysis is £25,000 per annum. This compares with a cost of £20,000 for a kidney transplant with a continuing cost of £5,000 each year after transplantation.</P>

      <P>Heart transplant operations are performed at the national cardiac surgical unit, Mater Hospital, Dublin.

The hospital has also confirmed that the number of heart transplant operations dropped from 17 in 1998 to nine in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the capacity of the Mater Hospital to undertake heart transplant <Col N="1305" /> operations is dependent on a number of factors including the availability of suitable heart donations. In this regard, I have previously indicated to the Deputy my concern regarding a decline in organ donation rates in 1999.

      <P>The administration of the registration system is a matter for An tArd-Chláraitheoir (the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages) and for local registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Registration of Births and Deaths Acts 1863 to 1996 and the Marriages Acts of 1844 and 1863 provide that An t-Árd Chláraitheoir shall retain certified copies of the records of births, deaths and marriages returned to him on a quar<Col N="1307" /> terly basis by local registrars and that he shall compile and make available an index to such records at his office. Persons are entitled to search these indexes on the payment of the approved fees and to obtain certified copies of entries identified from the index.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my reply on 8 February steps are being taken to maintain and improve indexes to the records of births, deaths and marriages, including the special project for the capture of the records of births, deaths and marriages and associated indexes in an electronic format which has been ongoing in Roscommon for some time. This major project will improve the efficiency, flexibility, access to and management of the archival records and will provide potential for the development of a range of services, which would not be possible in a system reliant on printed indexes. It will benefit all customers of the registration service throughout the country, including persons who currently avail of the services of the reading room in the General Register Office. There is also an ongoing review of the registration service to identify changes necessary to provide a modern and effective service based on the electronic recording of vital events.</P>
    <P>As I have also indicated in recent replies regarding this service, additional space was provided in the public reading room in Joyce House in July 1999. Tenders have been sought for the further refurbishment of the General Register Office which will include additional improvements to the environment of the reading room and the improvement of customer services on the second floor of the office.</P>

The initiative was introduced in 1998 with a target of 100,000 sites and a budget of £39 million over the three years 1998, to 2000. Coupled with local authorities income from development levies, this funding will mobilize total spending to the value of almost £100 million. A total of £2.3 million was recouped to local authorities for schemes in progress to the end of 1999. From local authority returns, to date 25 schemes with 9006 sites have been completed, 43 schemes with 24, 931 sites are at construction, and a further 76 schemes with 70,159 sites are scheduled to get to construction this year. In January 2000, local authorities were invited to submit additional new proposals for consideration under the initiative in areas where there is a genuine requirement for additional housing development.</P>

      <P>The C45 system, which has been replaced by the relevant contracts tax system, applies to persons who are self-employed sub-contractors in the construction, forestry and meat processing industries. Primary responsibility for the operation and control of this system lies with the Revenue Commissioners. However, my Department's inspectors make some 7,500 visits each year to employers, many in the industries already referred to, with a view to ensuring that their obligations under social welfare legislation are being met. One element of those inspections is to ensure that the correct class of PRSI is applied to persons found in employment.</P>
      <P>My Department has no particular policy requiring an unemployed person to take up employment under the relevant contracts tax system. The conditions for receipt of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance require,<i> inter alia,</i> that a person must be available for and genuinely seeking employment. To satisfy these conditions, all reasonable efforts must be made to secure suitable, full-time employment or self-employment. Each case is decided on its own merits within the framework of the relevant social welfare legislation.</P>
      <P>My Department provides a range of employment support measures to assist unemployed people to return to the workforce. The back to work enterprise allowance is specifically designed to support unemployed people who wish to take up self-employment opportunities. The allowance which is available to those who are signing on for 12 months or more lasts for a period of four years and is paid at the rate of 100% of the unemployment payment for the first year, 75% for the second year, 50% for the third year and 25% for the final year.</P>

      <P>The treatment benefits scheme administered by my Department provides assistance towards the cost of dental, optical and <Col N="1312" /> audiology services to people, and their dependent spouses, who satisfy the relevant statutory PRSI conditions. People who have sufficient contributions to qualify at age 66 remain entitled to benefits under this scheme for the rest of their lives.</P>
      <P>In the case of hearing aids, my Department pays half the cost subject to a maximum of £250 per hearing aid. In 1999, 3,003 insured persons and 923 dependent spouses benefited under the scheme at a cost of some £1.1 million.</P>
      <P>An increase in the level of assistance payable would have significant cost implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the 14 visitor sites open to the public in the Dublin area listed in my Department's Heritage Sites 2000 booklet. One of these sites, Dublin Castle, is the responsibility of the Office of Public Works. The remaining 13 sites comprise the following: The Casino, Marino, Kilmainham Gaol, Lusk Heritage Centre, St. Enda's National Historic Park, Phoenix Park, Rathfarnham Castle, St. Audoen's Church, St. Mary's Abbey, National Botanic Gardens, Iveagh Gardens, Garden of Remembrance, St. Stephen's Green, War Memorial Gardens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an annual programme at each site of ongoing minor maintenance and presentation works including improvements to roads and paths, drainage, cycle lanes, improved visitor facilities and restoration/improvement works to buildings, gardens and grounds. In addition, there is a number of large scale projects currently under way or expected to commence in 2000 as follows: National Botanic Gardens, a contract for the provision of new visitor facilities, including an audio-<Col N="1313" /> visual theatre, quality restaurant and tearooms and adjacent car and coach parking is well advanced. The facility is due to open mid-summer 2000; planning of the restoration of the Great Palm House is in train; Rathfarnham Castle, the final phase of restoration works under the current operational programme for tourism includes restoring the ballroom to its eighteenth century proportions, providing a new staircase in the north east tower and some repairs to interior finishes. These works will be completed in advance of the castle opening for the 2000 tourist season; Phoenix Park, work has commenced on the restoration of the walls in the Walled Garden of the Phoenix Park Visitor Centre. This project is being undertaken in partnership with FÁS; work will commence on much-needed staff facilities in 2000, improvements will be carried out to the entrance to Áras an Uachtaráin from the Phoenix Monument; St. Stephen's Green, restoration of the perimeter footpaths will commence in 2000; St. Enda's, it is planned to undertake repairs to the roof of the Pearse Museum in 2000.</P>

      <P>Temple Bar properties under licence from my Department has recently carried out a number of archaeological excavations in particular in the western sector of their area. It has produced a series of summary reports on the results of their excavations entitled Archaeology in Temple Bar. The Deputy may be aware that many artefacts from these recent excavations are included in a permanent exhibition of findings from the Viking period in the National Museum of Ireland, Kildare Street. Research findings and artefacts from earlier and later excavations are on display in Dublinia and the Viking Adventure Centre run by Dublin Tourism, in association with the National Museum of Ireland. The likely developments of these sites in the future and the matter of public tours are primarily matters for consideration by the developer and the local authority.</P>
      <P>Summary accounts of all licensed archaeological excavations can be found in the excavations bulletin series, which have been funded by my Department. These publications edited by Isabel Bennett and published by Wordwell Limited are available from all good booksellers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All licensed archaeologists conducting excavations are required to lodge a detailed report of their excavations with both the national monuments and historic properties section of my <Col N="1314" /> Department and the National Museum of Ireland. This report should include a fully detailed account of the excavations.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the national monuments Acts 1930-1994 all archaeological finds must be reported and handed in a timely fashion to the National Museum and the licensee must consult the museum regarding the temporary storage and curation of excavated finds. The professional conservation of finds in consultation with the national museum is also a condition of the excavation licence.</P>
    <P>I am arranging to provide the Deputy with a copy of my Department's guidelines entitled Policy and Guidelines on Archaeological Excavation which I trust will be of assistance to him.</P>

      <P>Second Stage consideration of the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, 1999, commenced in Dáil Éireann on 17 December last. In my address to the House on that occasion, I indicated that I intended to make a number of changes at Committee Stage to the published text of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 46 of the Bill as published proposes a ban on the use of lamps and similar devices in the hunting of any animal. A strong case has been made that this would restrict an existing practice whereby landowners control certain pest species and I therefore propose to amend this section so as to apply this control only in respect of protected species.</P>
      <P>I also propose to amend the published text of section 51, which would have made it an offence to hunt with a dog, ferret or bird of prey, or to have control of a pack of hounds, on land without the owner's permission. It has become clear that this would impose new controls on existing legal forms of hunting, which were never intended, and I therefore propose to remove this change.</P>

      <P>The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Bill, 2000 provides that the commission will undertake its work through two committees &ndash; the confidential committee and the investigation committee. These committees will be formed from the members of the commission itself. Each of the committees will make a report to the full commission and the commission will publish a report based on those reports. The commission's report will be published directly to the general public by the commission itself. Accordingly, neither the Minister for Education and Science nor the Government will have any role to play in the content or publication of the commission's report. This approach is designed specifically to ensure the independence of the commission.</P>
      <P>Apart from recording findings of fact made by the commission, the report will also contain recommendations, including recommendations as to how the needs of victims of abuse can be addressed. It is the intention of the Government that those recommendations will be acted upon.</P>

      <P>Early in 1997, Waterford Regional Technical College was redesignated as the Waterford Institute of Technology and arrangements were put in place to carry through the process leading to the delegation to the institute of authority to make awards. This process was initiated through the appointment of a review team chaired by Professor Dervilla Donnelly. The results of this academic review, published in March 1999, recommended that Waterford Institute of Technology become one of the first institutes to have the delegated power to make awards in respect of all existing NCEA-validated national certificate and diploma courses.</P>
      <P>The Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999 enables me to formally implement this recommendation for delegated authority. The arrangements for the implementation of the Act, which will enable the delegation to take place, will be completed as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the setting up of the designate National Qualifications Authority of Ireland was announced on 26 January last. The new authority is being set up on an interim basis pending its establishment on a statutory basis as provided for in the Act. The task of the new authority will be to commence work on the establishment of a national qualifications framework and to advise on and support the transition to the new certification system as provided for in the Act. The first meeting of the new authority is due to take place shortly.</P>

A new apprenticeship facility is expected to be finished by September of this year. Funding has been approved for major infrastructure works this year and next year, which will include carparks and the culverting of the stream that crosses Waterford's main campus. In addition, funding has also been made available for refurbishment works, which will allow for additional lecture theatres.

      <P>The steering committee on the future development of higher education was asked to advise on the future development of the higher education sector and to examine, within the overall national context, the needs for higher education on a regional basis and the appropriateness of the current institutional provision by region to meet these needs.</P>
      <P>As a response to the higher education needs of the south east region, the report recommended an increase in student places in what was then the regional technical college, Waterford, an increase in degree level awards and a change of title. The report also recommended that the major focus of expansion be at degree level. It stated that such provision would place the college at the top end of the spectrum by comparison with other regional technical colleges in terms of provision of degree places and would enable the region to reach the national average participation in degree programmes.</P>
      <P>The Government accepted these recommendations with the result that provision in both the total number of places and in degree level courses is being expanded annually and incrementally in line with available resources. These measures, combined with the change of title of the college to institute of technology, provide the necessary status and capacity for the institute to meet the identified higher education needs of the region over the coming years.</P>
