      <P>Following the circulation of the report of the Wise Men, officials from my Department made contact on my behalf with the French Presidency in relation to the measures implemented by the XIV against Austria, indicating my satisfaction with the report and my support for the immediate lifting of the measures and a renewal of high-level contacts with Austria. I have no plans at present to visit Austria, however I will meet Chancellor Schüssel during the forthcoming EU Councils. We have long-standing positive relations with the Austrian Government, both at political and official level. We have maintained positive working relations, particularly in an EU context over the past year. Official level contacts have been maintained with the Austrian Embassy throughout and I am pleased to announce that preparations for a working visit to Dublin by Chancellor Schüssel on 23 November are in hand.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be glad to. Following the circulation of the report of the wise men, officials from my Department made contact on my behalf with the French Presidency in relation to the measures implemented by the XIV against Austria, indicating my satisfaction with the report and my support for the immediate lifting of the measures and a renewal of high level contacts with Austria. I have no plans at present to visit <Col N="6" /> Austria. However, I will meet with Chancellor Schüssel during the forthcoming EU Councils.</P>
      <P>We have long standing positive relations with the Austrian Government, both at political and official level. We have maintained positive working relations, particularly in an EU context over the year. Official level contacts have been maintained with the Austrian embassy throughout and I am pleased to announce that preparations for a working visit to Dublin by Chancellor Schüssel on 23 November are in hand.</P>
      <P>As I outlined in my comprehensive statement to the House on 27 June, I attended the European Council in Feira on 19 and 20 June. The Feira summit, the second of the Portuguese Presidency, sought to build on the positive outcomes from the Lisbon summit of March last, while developing the agenda for the French and subsequent presidencies.</P>
      <P>Together with other parties, I was pleased that the Portuguese Presidency invited a representative of the convention charged with drawing up the draft charter of fundamental rights to attend the summit and to report on the progress made to date. It was clear from our discussions that a majority of member states wish that the charter would remain a political declaration. It was decided that a draft of the charter should be prepared in advance of the informal European Council which is to be held in Biarritz on 13 and 14 October. The draft was formally submitted by the convention to the Council yesterday.</P>
      <P>I expressed strong satisfaction with the report produced by the Portuguese Presidency on the Intergovernmental Conference, as it sets out clearly the main options and areas where possible solutions may lie which are now being further pursued under the French Presidency. There is increasing acceptance, which we share, of the need to retain one Commissioner per member state. This is an essential link between member states and Brussels based institutions of the Union. We will continue to argue strongly that nothing should be done to weaken this link, especially at a time when the governments of each of the member states are seeking to bring the Union closer to its people.</P>
      <P>The Intergovernmental Conference will also address issues such as the extension of qualified majority voting, the reweighting of votes in Council, the allocation of seats in the European Parliament and the reorganisation of the European Court of Justice, the Court of First Instance, the European Court of Auditors, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. At Feira, we also formally added the issue of flexibility to the Intergovernmental Conference agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Together with my EU colleagues, I stressed the importance of ensuring that the work of the conference can be successfully concluded at the Nice summit in December. A successful conclusion to the Intergovernmental Conference is essential if the Union is to ready itself by end 2002 for the accession of new members. I have especially <Col N="7" /> emphasised the need for a balanced outcome which takes into account the interests of all members of the Union.</P>
    <P>The European Council welcomed the Portuguese Presidency's wide ranging draft progress report on the follow up to the Helsinki conclusions and mandated further work to be conducted during the current French Presidency. The report and its four annexes represent, from an Irish point of view, a balanced outcome acceptable to us and to other neutral and non-allied EU members. The report focuses on military and civil aspects of crisis management and, importantly, incorporates references to the role of the UN and the importance of the EU co-operating with the UN and other relevant security organisations in both military and civil fields.</P>
    <P>As regards military aspects, the report records progress on the elaboration of the so-called Headline Goal target whereby the EU wishes to be in a position by 2003 to field a force of 60,000 personnel. Such a force would be equivalent to that operating in Kosovo at present. I welcome this ongoing progress, including the decision to hold a capabilities commitment conference in November where member states will make initial national commitments. We have a proud history of peace-keeping and current developments are in keeping with our practices in this area.</P>
    <P>Apart from the issue of capabilities, the Helsinki conclusions called for progress in relation to the Union's decision-making structures. The report submitted at Feira noted the progress to date in the establishment of the interim political and security committee and the interim military committee. At Feira EU leaders called for an overall report to be presented to the European Council in Nice on the ongoing work in this area and for the interim structures to be put on a permanent footing as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
    <P>The individual annexes to the Presidency report dealt with consultations and relations between the EU and third countries. I am happy to say that the recommendations in this regard for consultation with European non-EU members of NATO are in line with Ireland's open approach to having inclusive and transparent consultations with such countries, provided the EU's decision-making competencies are respected. Similarly, the issue of EU relations with NATO and the use of NATO assets are also dealt with satisfactorily from an Irish point of view.</P>
    <P>I welcomed the concrete target for the provision of policing support for UN authorised military crisis management missions, for example, the KFOR operation in Kosovo. Together with my EU colleagues, I was satisfied to adopt the capability target whereby the EU collectively aims to be able by 2003 to provide 5,000 police officers to international missions across the range of crisis prevention and crisis management operations. I argued, of course, that EU developments in this area should take place in close co-operation with <Col N="8" /> the UN and should avoid duplication of the work of the UN and the OSCE.</P>
    <P>The Lisbon summit was extremely significant in seeking to define the input by the European Council into the general economic and social strategic management of the Union. Clearly, each of the specific Council formations has unique treaty based roles, and particular expertise in the execution of their responsibilities. It is important that EU leaders provide political direction in the form of a contextual framework for the work of ECOFIN and the other Councils to which it falls primarily to achieve the strategic goal set in Lisbon, namely, to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.</P>
    <P>At Feira we were able to review the progress which has already been made in this regard and to take note of a number of important documents, including the Europe Action Plan and the Charter for Small Enterprises. It is important that the Luxembourg process relating to employment and the Cardiff process relating to structural reforms are mutually compatible and inform the development of the annual broad economic policy guidelines. I look forward to the synthesis report which is to be produced by the Commission each year in the run up to the spring Council which, in line with the decisions taken in Lisbon, will allow Heads of State or Government to review in a holistic way the progress made in achieving the Union's strategic goal for the next decade. The annual spring Council will also allow for strategic directions to be taken across a range of horizontal issues, such as the information society and social inclusion, while providing EU leaders with an opportunity to give political guidance in the drawing up by the Commission of the first draft of the broad economic guidelines. The guidelines were welcomed by the Council. The general and country specific guidelines presented no difficulties from an Irish point of view.</P>
    <P>ECOFIN had a number of formal and informal meetings during the course of the European Council with a view to progressing two key items. The first was Greece's entry into the Euro which will take effect from January 2001 and the second was the tax package, which has been under discussion for some time. The tax package consists of three elements, a draft directive on the taxation of the interest on savings, a code of conduct on harmful tax competition and a draft directive on the taxation of interest and royalties. The first of these items has been under intensive discussion over the past six months and on which an agreement was finally reached at Feira. The agreement sets out a timetable by which an exchange of information system will be established for the taxation of savings income of non-residents. I strongly supported the decision taken by ECOFIN to reach a comprehensive agreement on all three elements of the tax package as soon as possible and no later than the end of 2002.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Feira Council, in addition to <Col N="9" /> meeting informally with President Mbeki in the margins of the Feira Council, I took the opportunity for discussions with President Sampaio, President Prodi and each of my EU colleagues. I also held a formal bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Blair. We discussed a range of issues relating to Northern Ireland, including the work of the Assembly, the Executive and North-South institutions. We also reviewed the situation in relation to the police Bill when I again emphasised the importance of the Bill faithfully reflecting the recommendations of the Patten Commission. The marching season, in particular Drumcree, were among the other issues discussed. The Prime Minister and I discussed the tragic death of 58 refugees at Dover. This human tragedy underlines the need for governments to take firm, decisive and tough anti-trafficking measures. Ireland is co-operating fully with other EU member states and third countries in working together to defeat the traffickers.</P>
    <P>I met President Stephanopoulos of Greece in Dublin on 4 July. I welcomed the President to Ireland and highlighted the positive relationships which I have enjoyed in Council with Greek Ministers and Prime Ministers over the years. I congratulated him on the decision at the Feira European Council to confirm Greek entry to EMU with effect from next January and noted the substantial efforts which the Greek Government has made in recent years to put its economy on a sound footing. We discussed a range of issues, including enlargement, the Balkan Stability Pact, the Intergovernmental Conference process and the ongoing discussions in regard to Cyprus.</P>
    <P>Following my visit to South Africa in January, I was in communication with Commission President Prodi on the issues of HIV/AIDS in developing countries. On foot of my visit to Australia I wrote to President Prodi in relation to the proposed establishment of a centre of EU studies in Canberra. I also spoke yesterday with the President, who wished to inform me about his statement to the European Parliament today concerning the importance of maintaining the momentum behind enlargement and the need to ensure that the institutional reform which it will necessitate is appropriate. He argued that the Biarritz and Nice Summits must address both the short-term reforms of the current Intergovernmental Conference and the more long-term institutional issues which arise in the debate on the future of Europe. He cautioned against a drift towards intergovernmentalism and putting at risk the Community model which has served the Union well. I assured him that these were sentiments which Ireland as a small country could support.</P>
    <P>I wrote to President-elect Fox on 14 July 2000 congratulating him on his success in the Mexican presidential election. President-elect Fox replied to me on 31 July expressing his thanks for these congratulations and his intention to maintain the friendship between our two nations.</P>
    <P>With regard to other meetings and engage<Col N="10" /> ments, my attendance at the UN Millennium Summit from 6 to 8 September is the subject of separate questions. On 13 September, I received President Persson of Sweden in Dublin on a working visit, which focused primarily on the current EU agenda and the prospects for the Swedish Presidency which starts next January.</P>
    <P>I will attend the Special European Council in Biarritz on 13 and 14 October. I will also travel to Seoul on 18 October for the ASEM III Summit which will take place on 21 and 22 October. On my return I hope to meet President Museveni of Uganda during his visit to Ireland from 23 to 25 October. On 23 November I will meet Chancellor Schüssel and on 24 November I will participate in the EU-Balkan Summit in Zagreb. As part of the Presidency's tour of capitals I will meet President Chirac of France in Dublin on 30 November to discuss the agenda for the Nice Summit. On 1 December I will travel to New York to present a gift from Ireland, the &ldquo;Diaspora Ship&rdquo;, to the UN. I will also attend the European Council meeting in Nice on 7 and 8 December.</P>
    <P>In addition to considering the draft EU charter which has been submitted to it, the Biarritz informal council will take stock of the ongoing Intergovernmental Conference negotiations, give leaders an opportunity to assess the progress that has been made and, I hope, it will also allow for the identification of areas where possible solutions may be found. There has been much discussion this year about the future of Europe, by which is meant the long-term future of the Union, and leaders will have the chance to exchange in an informal way their ideas about the working and shaping of a Union with 25 to 30 members, albeit that these matters will not fall to be dealt with in the context of the current Intergovernmental Conference. The ongoing situation in the Middle East and Yugoslavia is also likely to be discussed.</P>

Does the Government as a whole believe there is undue interference by EU bureaucrats in Irish affairs? Has Deputy de Valera's verbal frustration anything to do with the fact that Ireland is in breach of EU directives regarding wildlife habitats, water quality and the disposal of toxic waste? Does the Government find itself uncomfortable with having to comply with EU views on keeping clean, the water that Irish people drink?</P>

      <P>She was pointing out that there is a European debate in every country and that the EU will almost double. We will move to a <Col N="11" /> Community of 500 million people. Enlargement, as she said, is a positive thing which is strongly welcomed here but integration is also happening, as a result of which Ireland is part of the euro 11. In her subsequent interviews she also cited some examples where issues create difficulties and are not always in line with the views of member states. People have to compromise on these matters, however, and that is why subsidiarity is there in some respects. In other respects it is a matter of integrating one's policies and sharing one's sovereignty, which is what happens. The Minister, Deputy de Valera, cited broadcasting as being such an issue. She thought it would be extremely difficult to have just one broadcasting directive for the whole community. I looked to her views as a welcome contribution to the ongoing debate taking place throughout the Community this year. This morning's speech by President Prodi should be seen as a further example of that, along with the contribution last week by our Commissioner, Mr. Byrne.</P>

      <P>The essential point and the serious element of Deputy Bruton's question is that under the treaties we voluntarily agreed to share powers and sovereignty in a number of areas and to submit to the authority of the Commission and the Court of Justice in areas of Community competence. We are doing that and as we go forward into an enlarged Europe there will be far more of that. The debate in Europe has moved on now to a position where perhaps we will have a group of countries working on integration while others remain static. It is something that we should address and it would be far better to address it. In the past 14 years, I have been through three campaigns concerning the Single European Act and the Maastricht and Amsterdam treaties. At the end of the debate in this country, people said, and probably rightly so, that they were not aware of this, that or the other. As we go into this Intergovernmental Conference and a subsequent Intergovernmental Conference on major issues of integration it would be far better to at least know what the issues are. That is the essential point of what the Minister, Deputy de Valera, rightly said.</P>

For example, when Italy had the Allianza Nazionale in Government, a former fascist party which was a direct political descendant of Mussolini's party, there was no attempt made to impose any sanctions on Italy because it was a big country. However, when the Freedom Party acceded to Government in Austria, which is a small country, the European Union took action which was not legal because it was not taken at an EU Council meeting. Does the Taoiseach agree this failure to treat large and small countries consistently did great damage to the cause of those promoting the euro in the referendum in Denmark because people there felt that as another small country they would not be treated as well as Germany, for example, just as Austria was not treated as well as Italy? </P>

      <P>Last January, after the elections and the prolonged debate in Austria, all the countries in Europe believed that some clear markers had to be put down about the stated policies and leadership of the parties in Government in Austria. That was subsequently done. A similar view would be taken, regardless of where it came from. The Portuguese held the Presidency and they co-ordinated the efforts to employ the <Col N="16" /> sanctions. If it had gone on indefinitely, it would have become negative. The point was made, policies, leaderships and structures were changed and a different position was achieved. Some argued &ndash; we argued strongly against this when the wise men report was published &ndash; that to continue it unnecessarily would have been a mistake. Some countries refused to talk to Chancellor Schüssel or to co-operate with him in any way during that period, but I took a different view which was well publicised at the Council meetings. I am glad the position has now been reversed. I welcome him here to the first country he will visit since these difficulties arose.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach answer the question I asked him concerning the contrast between the treatment of Austria and Italy when the Italian Government contained a former fascist party, the MSI, and a party, the Lega Nord, whose leader, Umberto Bossi, had made a number of remarks which were at least as bad as those made by Jorg Heider? Yet the big country, Italy, was not sanctioned whereas the small country, Austria, was. Why did the Taoiseach agree, as the leader of a small country, to this discriminatory treatment of a small country when a larger country had got away with it? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of Italy, there was no sanction proposed and there was no great debate on the issue. Perhaps there should have been. However, there was in the case of Austria. There was great disenchantment not only in Europe but also in Austria. There were monster marches and protests on this issue which went on for several weeks in the cold of the winter. That had to be responded to and it was. The EU should send a message. Deputy John Bruton wishes me to say that perhaps that should be the case regardless of the country involved. I agree it should be the case and that policy should be consistent whether it is a large or a small country.</P>

Does the Taoiseach accept that in the next 12 months the same problem will arise in regard to Italy if the centre right wins the election because the centre right coalition in Italy will include Lega Nord and the party led by Gian Franco Fini, the former fascist party? What proposals is the Taoiseach making in regard to the <Col N="17" /> Italian situation in order to be consistent with the position to which he agreed in regard to Italy?</P>

      <P>Sorry, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I was just correcting the error the Deputy made. I want to answer the question. As the Deputy is aware, last December the European Council stated it would deal with this charter. We are able to move to a position now where it will go before the Biarritz summit &ndash; it is a draft &ndash; for consideration. The final text has taken on board our concerns, principally with regard to possible duplication of the conflict with the role of the European Court of Human Rights, that might arise from the charter, which was the particular point Deputy O'Kennedy was making. We will now support it. This matter came up originally at Cologne where it was decided that the charter would draw together the existing rights of the Union, not new rights. The convention has now done that. The procedures, the time scale etc. will be discussed either in Biarritz or in Nice. It is not a legal document but the way it will be taken when it is completed will be an issue also to be decided in Biarritz. I believe a political binding declaration in this area is important. I support it and I will support it in Biarritz.</P>

      <P>In reply to the questions put to him by Deputy Bruton, the Taoiseach said that he would welcome a debate on European issues, to which the Minister, Deputy de Valera, contributed. The Taoiseach also referred to the report of the three wise men and he could have referred to the Cologne Declaration, the St. Malo Declar<Col N="19" /> ation and the appointment of Javier Solana, the former Secretary General of NATO, as Mr. CFSP, and his double-hatting as Secretary General of the Western European Union. For example, my party and others have clearly set out positions on security and defence in policy documents, from the time of Sean Lemass to Deputy John Bruton as Taoiseach. Why is this Taoiseach the only one not to have set out his position on this matter? Given that he is participating in these discussions at European level, as part of the debate can we anticipate that he will now set out his stall on European security and defence matters?</P>

      <P>In both. The arguments made by President Prodi and others that the veto should exist but should be used only in a limited number of cases are fair. In a Community that works efficiently and effectively the threat of the veto in other than very important areas should not be used. Deputy Bruton attended European <Col N="20" /> Councils for several years. If the veto was maintained in an extensive area with regard to 26 or 27 countries, I do not know how we could do business. I do not know how that would work, therefore, I am in favour of moving a considerable distance on that.

In allowing this to happen and in allowing the Western European Union to grow ever closer to the EU, will the Taoiseach admit that he is allowing further significant steps to be taken regarding the EU forming a military wing, an EU army?

      <P>On the other issue, I have outlined in detail what is happening with the capabilities convention and what the Political and Security Committee is doing on one side while the Military Committee works on the other side. Nobody in Europe is taking over anything. There is co-operation on the Petersberg Tasks and NATO's assets and data are used and pooled so that the community can move to a stated objective of being able by 2003, in approximately two years, to put a force of approximately 60,000 people into a difficult situation.

It was not about where we are on qualified majority voting in advance of that; Deputy Bruton asked me specifically about the areas where I felt it should be removed and where the veto should be kept. I said we should keep it in very few areas, but there is still considerable debate and disagreement on precisely which areas. Deputy Quinn should specify which areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="22" /> As Deputy Bruton correctly said, it is hoped this will come to a stage where there is a trade-off, but we are not at that stage. The larger countries have not yet conceded on the Commission, so why should I concede on aspects of the veto? Regarding the overall question of qualified majority voting and weighted voting, I am in favour of this because, to be frank, I am a strong supporter of the Commission and believe it is the right way to go in the future. I am glad of President Prodi's comments today about the strength of the Commission. It should not be pulled left, right and centre, because it has looked after the small nations.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid-October to mid-April regardless of the temperature. Some £8 per week is paid in smokeless zones.</P>
      <P>The national and smokeless fuel schemes were reviewed in 1998 as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The review group took the view that improvements in the national fuel scheme cannot be looked at in isolation from the improvements in the primary weekly payment rates.</P>
      <P>The group concluded that the current rates of payment should remain unchanged if improvements in primary payment rates fully compensated recipients for all price inflation, including fuel price inflation. Increasing primary payments gives people greater flexibility in meeting their needs and the increased rates are payable for all 52 weeks of the year and not 26 weeks, as with the fuel allowance.</P>
      <P>In that regard, substantial increases in all the social welfare primary payments of either £3 or £6 per week were paid from June 1999 with further increases of either £4 or £7 which came into effect at the beginning of May 2000, a month earlier than last year. This is equivalent to increases ranging from 10% to 16% over the last two budgets.</P>
      <P>In addition, the qualified adult allowance was increased by amounts ranging from £3.80 for people on disability benefit, £4.70 for old age contributory and retirement pensioners and £8.50 for invalidity pensioners where the qualified adult is aged 66 years or over.</P>
      <P>Fuel price inflation was much lower than general price inflation up to last year, with an overall cumulative increase of less than 10% over the 14 years between 1985 and last year. However, as the Deputy points out, an increase of almost 7.9% was recorded in the fuel and light component of the consumer price index in the 12 months up to last August.</P>

      <i>
      </i>The increase recorded for energy products was 13.4%, although that is not entirely relevant to the fuel allowance as it includes petrol, motor oil and other products. I am concerned about the extent to which general price inflation, including fuel price inflation, is impacting on the significant improvements in social welfare payments I have mentioned. The Deputy will know that I cannot give specific details of the measures that will be <Col N="24" /> contained in this year's budget but I assure the Deputy that improving the overall position of social welfare recipients will receive a very high priority in that budget.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I would point out that fuel allowances are not the sole mechanism through which assistance is provided to people with heating needs. There is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>
    <P>Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment. Exceptional needs payments are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister believe the allowance should be reviewed at this point and that a change of policy is required given the impact of inflation on those dependent on social welfare, that the cost of fuel and light has increased by 7.9% in the past year and that those dependent on fixed incomes and social welfare have been particularly hard hit by inflation, are falling behind other groups and are finding it increasingly difficult to have a standard of living similar to other people given the effect of inflation on their incomes in the past year particularly? There is a real danger that the standard of living of social welfare recipients will fall substantially behind other people. The price of coal has gone up by £25 per tonne in the past year and the allowance barely covers a bag of coal. In that context, does the Minister believe the allowance needs to be reviewed as well as the overall rates of social welfare?</P>

      <P>As I said, a review of this scheme took place in 1998, only two years ago. I fully accept, in view of the increase in inflation, particularly in relation to fuel, that this scheme should be looked at. I am currently examining the scheme, as well as other social welfare schemes, in consultation with the Minister for Finance in the run up to the budget. It has always been my view that rather than give people an increase in the fuel allowance for only 26 weeks of the year, it is preferable to give them a higher increase in their normal weekly rate. That is why, rather than increase the fuel allowance for the 26 weeks, we gave a larger increase in the general increases over the 52 weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> The review also pointed out that the more we increase the fuel allowance, the more difficult it is for families in poverty when they lose that amount. For instance, if we were to double it to <Col N="25" /> £10, in mid-April families would lose £10 per week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's recognition of the difficulties people face. The scheme operates from October to April. Is there a need to review that because many elderly people, in particular, need the fuel allowance for a longer period. It is a rather miserly allowance for people and, as the Minister said, the cut off point is quite sharp and early given the needs of many people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure for extending the allowance is £1.7 million per week. To give the fuel allowance for the full season would cost £7.1 million for every £1 increase. It is a better policy to give old age pensioners, in particular, higher increases which they will get for 52 weeks of the year as opposed to the fuel allowance which is for 26 weeks of the year only. There are arguments on both sides to extend the period from 1 October to the end of April or to change it in some way. All those issues will be considered in the run up to the budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the Government's commitment to carers, as set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium, an overall review of the carer's allowance was completed by an interdepartmental committee, chaired by my Department, and was published in October 1998.</P>
      <P>The review of the carer's allowance noted that it is difficult to estimate the number of full-time carers in the country. While care groups have stated this figure to be around 120,000 carers, they have provided no supporting basis for this figure. The high number may be due to their definition of carer, whereby, for example, a person visiting or assisting an older person may consider themselves to be a carer. However, for the purposes of the carer's allowance, a person is required to be a full-time carer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Based on the research carried out in the review, the current number of full-time carers is estimated to be around 50,000 people, covering carers of older people and adults and children with disabilities. There are currently 16,127 carers in receipt of carer's allowance which indicates that 32% of carers are in receipt of a payment. This is an increase of 75% in the number of carers in receipt of the allowance since this Government <Col N="26" /> took office. The large increase is reflected in the expenditure on carer's allowance, which was £36.5 million when I became Minister and which is projected to be £78.3 million this year, representing an increase of 115%.</P>
    <P>Based on an additional 34,000 carers qualifying for carer's allowance, the complete abolition of the means test would cost in the region of £179 million annually. If one were to use the estimate of the care groups, this figure would rise to £547 million annually. As with all other social assistance schemes, a means test in which the income of the applicant and his or her partner is assessable, is applied to the carer's allowance to ensure that limited resources are targeted at those most in need.</P>
    <P>The means test has been significantly eased in recent years, most notably with the introduction of disregards of income from employment and other sources. The effect of these changes means that a couple with two children could have an income of up to £19,500 and still qualify for the minimum carer's allowance, an annual respite care grant and the free schemes.</P>
    <P>The review of the carer's allowance noted that the allowance is an income support payment and not a payment for caring. It examined the means test and considered that it should be maintained as a way of targeting resources towards those most in need. A wide range of services is required to support carers in their caring role, including community and respite care. It is doubtful if a payment to all carers, regardless of their income, could be considered the best use of resources. However, the position in regard to the means test will be kept under review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the vast majority of carers receive no payment from the State? Does he also accept that when one examines the total number of carers, as assessed by the Carers Association and others, the carer's allowance means test is set at a very low level and excludes many people? The Minister has not changed the means test in the past four years. Does he consider the time is right to ease that test so more carers can be included?</P>
      <P>As regards the cost of institutional care, and in terms of investment by the State in care, is the carer's allowance not a better alternative than institutional care, given the cost of institutional care and the quality of life issues involved? Is the Minister considering a further examination of the means test disregard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the carer's review made many recommendations, all but one of which I implemented over the past two budgets. Since the Government took office there has been a 75% increase in the number of recipients of the carer's allowance &ndash; up from 9,000 to more than 16,000. There has also been a substantial increase in the amount of money allocated &ndash; from £36 million when I took office up to £78 million at the end of the year. All those in <Col N="27" /> receipt of the carer's allowance receive all the free schemes, again as a result of changes.</P>
      <P>The needs assessment still has to be addressed. This is a substantial issue which was dealt with in the review and involves the Department of Health and Children and health boards. This issue is being examined. I have stated during previous Question Times that I will examine the disregard in the context of the upcoming and future budgets.</P>
      <P>Some, but not all lobby groups have called for the abolition of the means test. Some Members of the Deputy's party do not call for the total abolition of the means test. Apart from child benefit, all social welfare assistance schemes include a means test. Abolishing the means test would mean that a very wealthy family, for example, one with 300 acres and many cattle, would receive the same payment as someone on social welfare. I do not agree with that. Whatever resources we have should be targeted at those most in need. That is as it has been since the scheme was started by my predecessor, Deputy Woods, and I would hazard a guess that the same will be the case after the next election, no matter who will be in office.</P>

      <P>The National Economic and Social Forum's Opinion No. 8 commented that 25% of children live in households with below half the average income and that Irish children have the highest rate of income poverty in the EU. Based on the 1997 figures, this places Ireland in a similar position to the UK and Portugal as regards income poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The PPF provides an opportunity to progress a number of policies on the needs of children. Under the terms of Framework III of the pro<Col N="28" /> gramme, new targets will be considered under the various NAPS themes, including child poverty. These targets are to be considered in consultation with the social partners.</P>
    <P>The view that child benefit represents a key instrument in tackling child poverty is widely acknowledged. The 2000 budget provided substantial increases in monthly rates of child benefit resulting in a full year increase in investment of £106 million &ndash; a record increase in child benefit. This brings the total investment in the scheme to £575 million.</P>
    <P>The PPF also contains a commitment to substantially increase child benefit over the lifetime of the programme with a priority focus towards £100 per month for the third and subsequent children. This year the basic monthly rates for child benefit have risen to £42.50 for the first two children and £56 for the third and subsequent children.</P>
    <P>I have always stated that employment is the best way out of poverty for adults and children. The Government's policy is to ensure that everyone has an opportunity to fully participate in society and work is the key to achieving this objective for those who can work. Measures such as the family income supplement have helped to encourage parents back into the work force By increasing income from work, the individuals themselves are not the only ones to benefit, but also the families and communities in which they live.</P>
    <P>On a more general note, all policy proposals across Departments are poverty proofed to ensure the needs of children along with other target groups are kept to the fore in the design of policy.</P>

What measures will the Minister take to address this situation? Has he set new targets for the elimination of child poverty? Does he believe that child dependant allowances should be restored in addition to significant increases in child benefit to begin to deal with the disastrous effects child poverty has on the lives of children over their entire lifetime, as we know from research? What priority is the Minister giving this issue? Is this his key priority area?</P>

      <P>ESRI figures published last Friday by myself and the Taoiseach at the launch of the second annual report on NAPS show a sharp decline in poverty in recent times. Those figures were based on 1998 and the ESRI indicates there has been a further substantial reduction in the past two years. The Government has decided to include child poverty under the new NAPS targets. Under the PPF we have agreed to consult the social partners in this respect.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the issue of including it, and the parameters in that respect, are being discussed with the social partners. That is the agreement under the PPF. In 1994, households with children accounted for more than half those below the 50% relative income level. This figure fell to 28% in 1998.</P>
      <P>I recently launched an evaluation report on the one parent family payment in which I indicated we were taking steps to assist lone parents. Children in single parent families are the most likely to fall into poverty because the parent has less ability to work. Parents in two parent families have a better chance of participating in the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to a fall in the figures for consistent poverty. However, is it not the case that despite the fall in consistent poverty, relative poverty remains a major problem and that children are particularly at risk, as is pointed out by the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>Statistics can be used. Relative poverty is not accepted on its own as an indication of poverty. Consistent poverty is probably the best indicator. Everyone in politics knows that 110,000 people have come off the live register since this Government took office. Given that in 1990 one million people were working and now there are 1.5 million people working, it is obvious that this has assisted, particularly in geographic areas where up to recently people could not even get a job interview because they had given a certain estate as their address. Such people now have equal opportunity. Because of that the pattern of intergenerational unemployment and the consequent intergenerational poverty is broken. That is not to say we do not still have difficulties. We do. However, if one looks at the latest statistics from the ESRI and the indications from the ESRI for the future, it can be seen that we are tackling poverty in a sustained, targeted and strategic way. It is not something at which one can wave a magic wand and solve the problem overnight.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Since it was formed in 1997, this Government <Col N="30" /> has demonstrated a commitment to the process of social inclusion and has introduced policies to help ensure that every individual has the opportunity to participate fully in society. Last Friday, 29 September, I launched the second annual report of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy Inter-Departmental Policy Committee, with the Taoiseach, which outlines the progress which has been made to date. The latest information available from the Economic and Social Research Institute from the Working Paper on the Living in Ireland Survey 1998, shows that the number of people in consistent poverty has almost halved, falling from 15% when the National Anti-Poverty Strategy was launched &ndash; based on 1994 data &ndash; to approximately 8% today &ndash; based on 1998 data. Our commitment to an inclusive society is reinforced by the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness which provides for an updating of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy, including a review of the underlying methodology, a review of existing targets and consideration of new targets, including child poverty.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Forum's opinion makes a number of recommendations in relation to the extension of the national anti-poverty strategy to local level. These will be considered in the context of the roll out of the strategy to local authorities, being jointly undertaken by my Department, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Combat Poverty Agency, under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Four seminars were held earlier this year to initiate this process and the response from local authorities and other relevant bodies has been encouraging.</P>
    <P>In relation to poverty-proofing, a review of the poverty-proofing process is currently being carried out by the National Economic and Social Council with a view to strengthening that process. Following this review, poverty proofing will be extended on a phased basis to local authorities and health boards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>I propose to circulate the monthly farm assist statistics requested in tabular form in the Official Report. The farm assist scheme, which introduced the special arrangements for farmers on low incomes, was provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1999, and came into operation with effect from 7 April 1999.</P>
      <P>On 22 September 2000, there were 7,650 farm assist claims in payment, with a further 79 claims under investigation. A further 242 claimants are still in receipt of smallholders unemployment assistance. It should be borne in mind that the numbers receiving smallholders assistance had for various reasons declined from 9,900 in 1995 to 6,600 in 1998, that is, by more than 1,000 per year. It seems likely that this decline would have continued so that the 7,900 people now receiving payments reflects a significant reversal of the trend in numbers who benefited from support.</P>
      <P>To date 626 claimants have transferred from other schemes, comprising 582 from pre-retirement allowance, five from widow's and widower's &ndash; non-contributory &ndash; pensions and 39 from disability allowance cases. I believe that the scheme has brought about a worthwhile improvement for low income farmers and particularly for those with children. The Social Welfare Act, 2000, made a number of important changes to the means test for the farm assist scheme. The child-related disregards have been increased from £100 to £200 for the first two children and from £200 to £300 for each subsequent qualified child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="33" /> Furthermore, instead of 80%, only 70% of self-employment income, including off-farm self-employment, is now being taken into account in the assessment of means. There are also changes in the way capital is assessed, with the first £10,000 held by a claimant disregarded and the balance treated more favourably than heretofore. The effect of these changes is that the majority of farm assist claimants will receive an increase in their payment from 27 September.</P>
    <P>The scheme clearly makes a valuable contribution to supporting those who are at the lower end of the farm income spectrum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>This scheme has been a farce from the start. It was heralded as a scheme which would bring many thousands more out of poverty and give them some support. A sum of about £25,000 was allowed as an increase for the remaining part of the year the scheme was introduced. The means test has not been adjusted to take account of the downturn in farm income generally and the costs they incur. When will the Minister consider changing the means test to take the same account as the Minister for Finance takes when farmers apply for clearance for taxation purposes? Why is there a difference between the means test for farm assist and that for tax purposes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy that this scheme is a farce. The figures speak for themselves. Some 7,900 farmers do not believe it is a farce because they are all in receipt of it. As I said earlier, before I introduced the scheme the numbers in receipt of smallholders' dole were decreasing by 1,000 a year from 1995. We have reversed that trend because the numbers are now increasing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read some comments about farmers not participating because of pride but it was not me who heralded this scheme as the be-all and end-all. I made it quite clear to the farmers' bodies when they met me that they were dealing with social <Col N="34" /> welfare, which ultimately is a safety net payment for people on very low incomes.</P>

      <P>The Combat Poverty Agency, Teagasc and the ESRI undertook a study of low income farm households which was launched at the National Ploughing Championships. It states that overall farm poverty has been falling in the late 1990s, reflecting recent improvements in off-farm employment opportunities and the long-term decline in the number of farm households.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the reason for the decrease in the number of farmers applying for farm assist? The reason the Minister gives is that many farmers have left agriculture because they cannot make a living at it. How many people applied for farm assist last year? Of those who applied, how many gained and how many lost? I would like that figure first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if these figures are correct. The number of new applications received to date is 3,361, comprising 2,601 in 1999 and a further 760 up to 22 September. As I said before, approximately 7,900 people are in receipt of farm assist.</P>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy a figure for the number who have received an increase, If he tables a parliamentary question, he can get that information. However I can give him the following information. Up to 22 September, the number of former smallholders who transferred to farm assist is 4,891. The average payment is £88.24, which represents an average increase of £13.64 per week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>It was made clear to the farmers' associations that as a result of the farm assist scheme people would have to fill up forms again. It had been the policy with smallholders' dole not to review farmers too often and their conditions could have improved or disimproved in the intervening years when farm assist was introduced. It was made clear that in the review it was possible they might lose out, given that people's <Col N="35" /> circumstances had changed since they had last been assessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the way it was sold. It is like the 40 hours, the new scheme the Minister introduced. That is causing problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is clear. The Minister heralded this as a great benefit to the 40,000 farmers who marched on this city. Many other farmers thought they might get it but once the first numbers applied and found they could not, others simply did not bother to apply.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister prepared to look at how the means test is carried out? He stated that a review had not been carried out for a long number of years. Why have some people, who were assessed for farm assist last year, already been reassessed although they were told the reason some of their moneys could not be accepted as debts was that there were debts for a long number of years. Can the Minister tell us when the assessment for farm assist will be brought into line with other farm assessment, where proper allowances will be made for costs?</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that there are 7,900 involved and he has also admitted that 626 are involved. Therefore, there are only a couple of hundred extra on farm assist. How many left small farms over the years, and even farm assist since, to take up FÁS schemes? That is the only reason the numbers are falling.</P>

      <P>The scheme was introduced after the 40,000 walked the streets of Dublin. It was the representatives of the farming organisations who said the scheme, as brought forward and negotiated by them with me and the Government, was the answer to the farmers. I was surprised when I made a number of press releases encouraging farmers in need to apply because we were told that about 15,000 farmers would apply. However, 15,000 did not apply, 7,900 farmers applied for it.</P>
      <P>That is the reality. I can do no more. We have issued a myriad of press releases about it. The farming organisations have publicised this scheme copiously. There have been press releases issued all over the place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the Deputy's figure of 626 transfers. I do not know to what he was referring <Col N="36" /> there but, as I stated earlier, 626 claimants have transferred from other schemes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the commitments made prior to the 1997 general election was to address the issue of people who narrowly failed to qualify for a pension. The group referred to by the Deputy was marginally excluded from entitlement to an old age contributory pension as those involved were aged 56 or over when compulsory social insurance was extended to the self-employed in April 1988. These people could not, therefore, satisfy the governing qualifying condition of having entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In delivering our commitment, I examined various options in arriving at a formula that would address the specific problem faced by this group <Col N="37" /> of pensioners. Of these, I considered that a flat rate payment of a special old age contributory pension was the most equitable and practical way of addressing the situation, taking account of all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Since April 1999, a special old age contributory pension has been available to those self-employed people who were aged 56 or over in April 1988 and who have at least five years contributions paid since then. Payment is at a flat rate of 50% of the standard maximum rate with equivalent increases for adult and child dependants, where applicable.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress that this special arrangement represents a positive and reasonable response to the situation in which this group of people found themselves. The rationale behind the five year paid contribution condition is to ensure that entitlement to a pension is limited to those who have made a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of their careers. I consider this threshold to be eminently fair, reflecting as it does a certain consistency of commitment to the social Insurance fund.</P>
    <P>With regard to the specific question asked by the Deputy, there is no provision within the social welfare system for retrospective payment of contributions to achieve entitlement to a contributory pension and I have no plans to change these arrangements.</P>

We accept that a reasonable number of stamps and contributions are necessary but there is a small group who feel hard done by as a result of the Social Welfare Act, 1988. Will the Minister look again at what the cost might be and give some relief to that group of senior citizens who were born in 1932 or before?</P>

      <P>Lest my silence on the issue of inflation be taken as unwillingness to answer the question, I was more than willing to answer the question today but I do not make the decision on whether questions are taken. As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has pointed out, those who framed the Private Members' motion should have thought about their ability to ask questions when putting down that motion. It is quite clear what attitude the Ceann Comahirle would have adopted to it. I will find out the cost for the Deputy but it will not include those people with less than five years contributions. However, I would not want that to be taken as an indication that I will not do anything about it. The Deputy will be aware that when his party was in Government, Deputy De Rossa was Minister and refused quite blankly to break the principle of the ten years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 and 801 together.</P>
      <P>All the major anomalies in social welfare have been dealt with by this Government.</P>
      <P>There are two aspects to these questions, i.e. the position of one-parent family payment recipients who wish to marry or cohabit and people who are separated and involved in joint custody or parenting of their children.</P>
      <P>The social welfare system, in general, is contingency based and also assumes that there are economies of scale where two people are married or cohabiting. In the circumstances, under the present system, in means tested arrangements, a reduction in income is inevitable where a person changes status from being a lone parent to one where he or she marries or cohabits. Clearly, a payment which is based on the contingency of lone parenthood cannot continue where the person marries or cohabits.</P>
      <P>The report of the working group examining the treatment of married, cohabiting and one parent families under the tax and social welfare codes, which was published in August 1999, set out the losses which can be experienced by a couple who decide to marry or cohabit where one or both receive social welfare payments. Where both receive social welfare payments the losses can, to some extent, be eased by the payment of a qualified adult allowance. The position here will be improved by my commitment to increase the level of the qualified adult allowance to 70% of the personal rate in line with the findings of the research undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute on behalf of the working group.</P>
      <P>Payment of the one parent family payment is based on the contingency of a person parenting alone without the support of a partner. To qualify for a payment a person must, among other things, have &ldquo;main care and charge&rdquo; of at least one qualified child. This means that, for instance, where one parent has care of a child for most of the week the parent may, subject to the other qualifying conditions, receive payment of the one parent family payment. In cases where both parents claim joint equal custody, neither can be considered to have &ldquo;main care and charge&rdquo; of the child and so a one parent family payment cannot be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the review of the one parent family payment recently published by my Department looked at both issues but concluded that because of the contingency based nature of the one parent family payment issues relating to mar<Col N="42" /> riage, cohabitation and joint custody of children cannot be dealt with by the scheme. In relation to joint custody arrangements, the review group looked at a range of measures to afford these arrangements some recognition within the system. However, it was unable to suggest any solutions which did not compromise the basis of the one parent family payment, erode the value of other social welfare supports or create other anomalies within the system. Obviously, these are extremely difficult and sensitive issues, as acknowledged by the review.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>There is considerable validity in the point made by the review regarding the nature of the one parent family payment as a contingency based payment. Disincentives to form relationships can only be resolved where the status of individuals is not relevant to the support received and we must, in the future, examine options in relation to universal child support and individualisation of payments. I will pursue these issues, in so far as possible, in a budgetary context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>What action does the Minister intend to take to address these issues? The review recognised that the payment as it is currently organised is problematic in relation to joint custody or shared parenting and that it militates in many ways against couples having joint custody and sharing parenting. It is a difficulty and no solution was suggested other than to move towards individualised payments. Does the Minister envisage this happening? What changes, if any, will the Minister introduce in relation to this allowance in the coming year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy acknowledged, the review could not suggest a solution to this difficult issue without creating a disincentive to marriage. As a result the report indicates that the way to proceed is through individualisation of social welfare payments. I have already made clear my views on that. In addition, there is a commitment in the PPF to progressing to administrative individualisation and a working group is looking at that issue. That there is a greater level of contribution to the social insurance fund will ultimately mean that many more people than heretofore will be entitled to a payment in their own right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister given any thought to a new parental care payment, such as was advocated last year and in previous years by the Labour Party? It would put emphasis on the parenting side of the parent's role and, to an extent, would seek to equalise the playing pitch for all parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the children most at risk of poverty are children of lone parents? We should examine ways of encouraging lone parents to find a partner and cohabit, to seek a potential father or mother for <Col N="43" /> their child. At present, lone parents are afraid to seek a partner or cohabitant for fear they will lose the lone parent allowance. Does the Minister or his Department have any views on how that situation can be changed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about my ability to encourage lone parents to find a partner, I can encourage them to find a job. If the Deputy reads the review of the one parent family payment, which we launched a couple of weeks ago, he will see it contains significant suggestions in relation to assisting lone parents back into work. That is the best way out of poverty. I accept that children in family structures where there is only one parent are in greater danger of falling into poverty than where there are two parents. That is one of the reasons for the report, to see how we can assist lone parents into the workplace and give them support there.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Broughan's question, child benefit is a universal payment to care for children and is the best way to prevent child poverty. That is one of the reasons the Government gave a record increase of £106 million in child benefit in the last budget to bring the allocation for child benefit to £575 million this year. That was an incredibly increased allocation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of extreme sadness to every Member of the House that we recently experienced the loss of a young mother who was also a Deputy of this House, Deputy Theresa Ahearn. Theresa Ahearn, with enormous courage, battled against an extremely serious illness over the past three years. She showed tremendous character in the way she faced this, the most severe challenge a person could face. Her courage was the greatest inspiration to everybody whose privilege it was to meet her during those three trying and difficult years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair to say that in many respects Theresa Ahearn was at her most effective, as a politician, in the past three years. The illness she suffered, the fear it engendered and the sense of her own mortality gave her a perspective as a politician which enabled her to be even more effective than she had been hitherto. She believed in life and lived life to the full. Her interest in politics was insatiable. I recall visiting her during the week or so before she died and her interest in what was happening in the Dáil, what was and was not being said in the newspapers, what was being said fairly and perhaps less fairly and even the gossip of Leinster House was insatiable. As I said at her <Col N="45" /> graveside in Grange, on that occasion she was able to tell me a few things that I did not know were happening in the House.</P>
    <P>Theresa Ahearn as a politician served at all levels of Government and was very proud to be a member of Clonmel Corporation. The ancient city of Clonmel was besieged by Cromwell but has not yet fallen and will not fall through any other attempts made to overcome it. She was proud of her membership of Tipperary South Riding County Council. I think it is fair to say she was intensely proud of her membership of the Fine Gael Party. She was someone who believed very much in the ethos which we as a party seek to uphold, an ethos of public service.</P>
    <P>I feel the loss very deeply as I know all Members of the House feel it very deeply. However, probably the women Members of the House in all parties feel the death of Theresa Ahearn in a deeper way perhaps than anyone else, because she was a women who triumphed in politics without the aid of any previous family connection. She succeeded in politics in a rural setting where it is argued the election of a woman politician is not as easy as it might be in a more urban setting. Theresa Ahearn overcame all those obstacles to become a proud Member of this House.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to her work as a Member here. She was most recently the spokesperson for the Fine Gael Party on persons affected by disabilities. That she was suffering from the disability of a life-threatening illness during most of the time when she operated in that capacity helped her to do her work even more eloquently, effectively and inspiringly than would otherwise have been possible. She was also spokesperson for the Fine Gael Party on higher education. It may not be known to Members of the House that she promoted the idea of free third level education within the Fine Gael Party before any of the other parties who subsequently adopted it did so. Unfortunately for her and perhaps for Fine Gael, her ideas were not heard as effectively as perhaps they ought to have been. In that she was very much before her time.</P>
    <P>Speaking about Theresa Ahearn as a politician is quite difficult for me because my memory of her is not so much as a politician but as a woman, a friend, someone who was a devoted mother to her four young men and a devoted wife to Liam. Our thoughts are very much with them at this time. I hope everyone who can be of assistance to them in coming to terms with their immense grief will be of assistance, which I know they will. Nothing we can say or do here will fill the gap in their lives caused by the death of Theresa Ahearn. However, it may be of some small help for them to know that she was beloved and held in high esteem on all sides of this House and that this is a very, very sad occasion for all 165 surviving Members of the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Bruton in the expression of sympathy on the untimely death of Theresa Ahearn. Deputy Bruton is correct in say<Col N="46" /> ing that she fought her illness so bravely. I had an opportunity in this House a year ago to welcome her back following illness. I recall talking to her that day when she thought things were looking up for her and that was the case for a while. I know from talking to members of my party, particularly the women Members of the House, that she shared her ups and downs with them.</P>
      <P>It is with profound regret that we meet today on our first day back following the summer recess. This is a sad event for the entire House. Theresa was always well capable of arguing her case and testing our positions. As spokesperson on many issues, she was always well briefed on her subjects. Having attended University College Dublin, Saint Patrick's College, Maynooth, the Presentation Convent, Cashel and having been a teacher of mathematics, she was very eloquent in putting across her views. It is always sad to lose a Member of the House but in circumstances where one fights so hard and puts up such a battle, a person so young, a young mother, a person who is enjoying her job so much, it is even sadder. To her husband, Liam, and her four sons, Patrick, Liam, Garret and Scott, I extend the sympathy of the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>Looking back at Members of the House one can see the huge public service they have given. It is extraordinary to look back at all the positions Theresa held. She was a member of many groups and bodies, including Clonmel Corporation for many years. She gave much time and effort to these organisations and while they may not be world shattering organisations, they are very important to local areas. These are bodies dealing with agriculture, youth, vocational education committees and health committees. These services would not function properly if people like Theresa Ahearn did not put a great deal of time and energy into them.</P>
      <P>On my behalf and on behalf of the Government, I offer my deepest condolences to Liam, her boys, the Fine Gael Party, the leader of the Fine Gael Party and all her colleagues. To lose a colleague during the lifetime of a Government is extremely difficult. We share the loss of our Fine Gael colleagues who are suffering more on this occasion and extend our deepest sympathies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is poignant that I am on my feet again this year speaking on the sad occasion of the death of a Deputy for south Tipperary. It seems incredible to think that this constituency has suffered the loss in one calendar year of two outstanding public representatives. In the context of the by-election which took place earlier this year, Theresa Ahearn's presence, vibrancy, <i>joie de vivre</i> and <Col N="47" /> commitment to the spirit of politics seemed to indicate to us all that she had won that hard, tough battle. So it was with extraordinary sadness and a sense of disbelief that we heard she had entered into a relapse of which she was aware and with which she dealt with the courage I do not think I could sum up, quite frankly. For that and for the courage she displayed as a public representative in this Republic, we will all be eternally grateful.</P>

      <P>I join the Taoiseach and the leaders of Fine Gael and Labour in extending my sympathy and that of the Progressive Democrats Party to Theresa's husband, Liam, and her four sons. I also extend my sympathy to Deputy Bruton and the Fine Gael Party.</P>
      <P>Theresa Ahearn was a very sensitive, hard working and committed person. She did not maintain the <i>status quo</i> too often. She was very forthright and had very strong views. It is fair to say that perhaps the women in this House know each other somewhat better than the men for a whole host of reasons. Although there are more women here now than there were when I first came into Leinster House in 1977, there are still relatively few. There was rarely an Order of Business in the past three years when Theresa Ahearn was not sitting opposite. Invariably, on the first day of a new session she would have a new outfit because Theresa adored clothes and was always smartly dressed.</P>
      <P>I was amazed when I heard during the summer that she was ill again because just before we broke for the summer recess Theresa, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, and I had a discussion for three or four hours one evening. I recall being inspired going home that evening because she spoke about her cancer and the manner in which she confronted it. Deputy O'Donnell and I, while having different issues on our minds, were very inspired by the courage she displayed. There is no doubt she showed remarkable courage and she is a great example to anybody confronted with serious illness.</P>
      <P>If Theresa Ahearn was present now she probably would not want us to go on too long, but she made one of her most moving speeches when the late Michael Ferris died. I recall distinctly not so much what she said but the manner in which she spoke about him and I know how genuinely heartfelt that was and how upset, hurt and devastated she was when he died.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether her speaking skills were honed in Macra na Feirme but she was an outstanding speaker. She always spoke eloquently in the House and did not just fill in time. She genuinely had something to say and she was a thoughtful politician. She was a woman of real substance. Everybody will miss her, particularly Liam and her four sons of whom she was so proud. She also spoke on many occasions about them. They will miss her most but her party and <Col N="48" /> everybody in Leinster House will miss her. We will remember her for a long time to come. When people are confronted with serious illness we should remember the remarkable courage she showed, which will, I hope, be an inspiration to others in the future. That is something for which Theresa would have wished.</P>

Our sympathies go to her husband, Liam, her four sons and the Fine Gael Party, in particular, of which she was proud to be a member. She always spoke with conviction in this House and was always worth listening to. Given that she had such difficult times with her illness, what she did as well as what she said will continue to earn her memory the respect and love of both her family and her people in Tipperary.</P>
      <P>I know she would not have minded me saying this but during her illness a number of us in the House prayed together with Theresa and I know she took real comfort from that. She was a deeply spiritual person and in turn her bearing, attitude and bravery will always be an inspiration to those of us who knew her. I thank her for that. Many people in the House will always remember her and be inspired by everything she did and said.</P>

      <P>As the only surviving Member in the constituency from the 1997 election I reflect, as should all of us, on the fact that whatever we do in public life we are all mortals. Unfortunately, two colleagues have died in the past six months. I recall Theresa Ahearn as a young girl cycling four or five miles to secondary school in Cashel and also when she began teaching in the vocational school. She took a keen interest not just in the good students but also in those who were not as good and who needed a great deal of help. She did tremendous work in that area and that was highly respected throughout the area. That was reflected in the extraordinary feat of her election to the corporation even though she lived four miles outside the town. It was a tribute to her teaching abilities and the interest she took in the children of the school.</P>
      <P>She was elected to the county council, on which I served with her. We did not always agree but she made me step up a gear or two on many occasions. While I could take things for granted with some people, I could not with her. I found her to be an extremely articulate colleague who was very honest and forthright when she spoke. We worked together for the constituency on those occasions and she was a tremendous worker on behalf of the constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last time I spoke to her was before the House broke for the summer recess. We discussed some constituency matters, normal housekeeping, a Cheann Comhairle, as you would understand, and she was so looking forward to coming back with other things to be done in the constituency and plans she had for it and for her<Col N="49" /> self. Unfortunately that was not to be, but the bravery and strength she displayed during her illness will be an inspiration to all.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton mentioned her love of politics. It was only following a car accident, in which she and Mary Banotti were involved, that she first discovered her illness and we all thought she was okay as was evident in her conviction and willingness to come back to the House &ndash; other things would be on my mind if I was faced with such an illness.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to her husband, Liam, who was not just her husband but her best friend, and her four children in whom she instilled strongly a respect for politics as well as a love for her party. It is vitally important that we leave here with that message regarding her respect for politics and politicians.</P>

      <P>I join with previous speakers in expressing my sympathy and sadness on the death of Theresa Ahearn. I was a colleague of Theresa's on Clonmel Corporation, south Tipperary County Council and, for all too brief a period, in Dáil Éireann. She was always friendly and helpful and when I arrived in the House at the end of June she was the first to greet me and give me good advice and information on the House and its workings.</P>
      <P>I found Theresa Ahearn over the years to be particularly supportive of families throughout south Tipperary who had their own health difficulties. I thank her, Liam and the family for the support they gave me and my wife over the past period. She was always a powerful advocate of her views and those of her party. We were of different political persuasions but we always got on and she was a very honest and powerful advocate of her point of view and that of her party.</P>
      <P>She is a huge loss to Liam and the boys, the wider Ahearn and Scott families and the people of south Tipperary. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a h-anam uasal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Most Members will remember John Boland &ndash; if one ever met John Boland one would never forget him. In my estimation he was among the most, if not the most, intelligent and imaginative politicians ever elected to this House. He could look at a problem from a wide range of angles and see a wider range of possible solutions than any conventional thinker in political life. He had immense courage and had no fear of confrontation with anybody or anything, if he felt that confrontation was necessary to achieve an objective in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>John Boland was single-handedly responsible for the abolition of corporal punishment in our schools, something for which generations of young people have reason to thank him. When <Col N="50" /> we hear so many frightening stories of things that might have happened in institutions in the past, the prescience of John Boland in abolishing corporal punishment seems all the more important and significant with every day that passes.</P>
    <P>John Boland was also responsible for producing a major blueprint for the reform of the public service. He produced a White Paper on the public service which was responsible subsequently for restructuring the way the service works, making it more open and unified. It created a sense in which, for example, Department of Education officials were not just working for that Department but also for the overall objectives of the State. That was achieved by virtue of the fact that John Boland introduced a top level appointments commission which created the possibility of people moving from one Department to another. He created a sense of a wider <i>esprit de corps</i> in the public service, of working for a common objective, and thus achieved a diminution of that demon of &ldquo;departmentalitis&rdquo;, thinking only of the interests of one's own Department. That was achieved directly as a result of a well chosen initiative of John Boland's in establishing the top level appointments commission.</P>
    <P>John Boland also had a vision of what Dublin might become for its citizens; a sense of a beautiful and proud city. These were ideas of a future for Dublin that were at least 15 years before their time. It is interesting that somebody whose training was in commerce &ndash; as I recall he did his degree in commerce &ndash; and who had a parallel training in journalism, also had the capacity to be a spatial planner envisaging what Dublin might look like. Most unusually, he was able to combine commercial, political and oratorical skills with architectural and engineering skills which are so rarely found combined in one person. That is why I say, with some reason, that John Boland was one of the most accomplished politicians ever to have served as a Minister in this House.</P>
    <P>It is a tragedy that his political and ministerial career did not last longer. At the same time it is a great tribute to John that he was able to move, although certainly not effortlessly, successfully through a number of professions in his life. He went from being a politician and a political junkie &ndash; there was nobody plugged into the adrenaline of politics more than John Boland &ndash; to withdrawing from that completely and reinventing himself as a barrister. He was a very successful advocate who won the confidence not only of his legal colleagues but also of his clients.</P>
    <P>John Boland had three careers while most of us have only one. He had a successful career as a journalist in various capacities. Starting as a student journalist, he was editor of the magazine <i>Awake</i> which was a very important student publication in the minds of those of us who were in college at that time. Some might say that he brought tabloid journalism to Ireland, particularly those who were at the receiving end of any criticism in that magazine. He was successful as a <Col N="51" /> journalist, a politician and a barrister. Few people could do all that in a short life.</P>
    <P>I know that Kay Boland, who is here, and Grace and John, who are also here, miss John senior very much. It will be some consolation to them, however, to know that he is admired so much by so many people for what he achieved. It has been said by many that John did not suffer fools gladly. He spoke directly and if he believed someone had done something he or she should not have done, he would not be behind the door in saying so. Equally, he was totally loyal to anyone to whom he had pledged his loyalty. One had the sense that he would literally go through fire if he believed it was deserved and was morally right.</P>
    <P>He will be greatly missed. I thank the House for giving me the opportunity of paying this tribute to his memory. I thank the Taoiseach and others for facilitating that. It is sad for us in Fine Gael that on this occasion we are expressing our grief on the loss of one Member of the House, a former Member of the House, and a former member of our party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Bruton in extending our deepest condolences to the late John Boland's family, Kay, John and Grace. I remember John Boland very well as I was spokesperson for public service matters during his period as Minister. It was a mixture of fun and grief. On some days, a person would get on well with him, while on others the same person could be the subject of his wrath. I remember the White Paper on the public service reforms very well and I knew the difficulties involved in what he was trying to achieve. My great enjoyment was going on and on about the delays, as one does in Opposition. However, public servants would literally lift me out of it afterwards because when I had a go at John they were criticised subsequently. Therefore, they would appeal to me to stop. He got the White Paper published, however, and I agree with Deputy Bruton that it was a very fine document for reform. I know how hard he worked on it, quite apart from the parliamentary tactics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that stage he was trying to reform a very old system, dating from before the foundation of the State. He enthusiastically took over that brief and set about establishing a strong, efficient and innovative public service. He removed the anonymity from officials dealing with the public and humanised the face of the Civil Service. It was not an easy task. He reformed the appointment of higher civil servants and introduced greater mobility in the higher levels through a promotional system. Although it may not be considered so now, the big change at the time was setting up the Office of the Ombudsman. The debate on that Bill kept us here for long hours. I feel happy with the contribution I made in Opposition but I know that John Boland did far more <Col N="52" /> than I could have in introducing that reforming legislation.</P>
    <P>People who are new to the House might think that all these matters were easily achieved but they were not. They were major elements of reform. For example, when I started to work in the public service back in the late 1960s, and was later elected to the House, most people who reached senior positions in the public service were in line for retirement on grounds of age. That changed forever after John Boland's reforms. I should probably argue now that they are too far away from the line when they finally retire, but it changed the system. The seven year rule for which he was responsible is now accepted in all areas, but it was an enormous change.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to forget that Deputy Barrett and I were Whips almost 20 years ago and worked with John Boland in changing the system of remuneration for Members of the House. It was a change from the situation where whenever Members got an increase, it was announced ten times. The public used to think we had received ten increases in a row. John Boland changed the legislation and that was difficult at the time. However, we are all reaping the benefits despite the significant arguments at the time. While John Boland might have been a very tough person, he thought about many important matters.</P>
    <P>When people talk about whether young people can get on in public life, it should be remembered that he held many records in that regard and was an example. He began his life in the public service in 1967 when he was elected to Dublin County Council. He was chairman of the council in 1971 at the age of 26. He was the youngest councillor ever to become chairman. He chaired the council again from 1973 to 1974 and from 1976 to 1977. He was a Senator from 1969 to 1977 and was first elected at the age of 24. He was the youngest ever Member of the Upper House at the time, although that record was later defeated by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney. He was also a young and energetic man when he entered the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge Deputy Bruton's point that John Boland abolished corporal punishment in the education system. He had many achievements. I used to have good arguments in the House with him because of the respective positions we held. I and Deputy Barrett as Government and Opposition Whips spent many long nights working &ndash; it was often a very long night &ndash; but we enjoyed the company and had some good fun. We used to listen to horrendous abuse about many things, including myself occasionally, but it was all in good spirit.</P>
    <P>John Boland made a huge contribution to his constituency of Dublin North and in terms of his work in the city. I particularly remember the four years I worked opposite him before he took charge of the Department of the Environment. I will remember him for all those good reasons. He will be very sadly missed and we can only extend <Col N="53" /> our sympathies to Kay, his son, John, and his daughter, Grace. We understand their loss.</P>
    <P>For the second time today, I extend our sympathies to his colleagues in the Fine Gael Party. He was the life and soul of the party when he was a Member of the House and I am sure he remained a committed member and interested person outside the House. We extend our sympathies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was elected to Dáil Éireann on the same day as John Boland. We were a rare breed in that we entered the House against the avalanche that brought in a 22 seat majority for the Fianna Fáil Party. They were difficult and strange circumstances.</P>
      <P>It is just over 11 years since John Boland ceased to be a Member of the House. Some Deputies did not serve with him, but the comments made by the Taoiseach and the leader of the Fine Gael Party are an indication to those who did not work at first hand with him of the extraordinary impact he had. He was somebody one would never forget meeting in whatever capacity. He left an image, an impression, a soundbite &ndash; sometimes it was a bite in terms of the ferocity with which he would argue his point of view.</P>
      <P>He believed passionately in what is now called civic society. He believed passionately in service to the community. He held very strong views, some of which I disagreed with and others which I fully supported. He never failed in his determination to articulate his point of view or to try to persuade one of its validity. Regarding the Civil Service where, uniquely, he was the only ever Minister for the Public Service, he saw his task as the historic task for which the position was created. The Cabinet post was created to lay the foundations for a modern, open, outwardly serving Civil Service. He knew the difficulties involved in change. For example, he got rid of Buggin's turn. This move met with extraordinary resistance among so many different parts of the Civil Service. It broke down the loyalty to a particular Department rather than the Civil Service and opened up new career opportunities for people who brought skills, experience and work practices from one Department to another. If there is a better Civil Service today &ndash; I believe it is better &ndash; it is undoubtedly due to the work of John Boland during that time.</P>
      <P>I succeeded him in the Department of Public Service when it was relinked to the Department of Labour and I served with him in Cabinet for just under four years. The Custom House Docks project as a physical architectural project would not exist today but for the leadership of the late Deputies John Boland and Fergus O'Brien. Its financial manifestation came later, but its physical manifestation was due to the fortitude and determination those Deputies brought to bear on the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rejuvenation of the quays of Dublin city and the introduction of urban renewal schemes resulted, as Deputy Bruton said, from John Bol<Col N="54" /> and's foresight, that extraordinary combination of a commercial sense of what could be done and a passionate commitment to ensuring that urban renewal would take place. When one looks at the cities and towns of Ireland now, one sees the transformation in places such as Limerick, Galway, Dublin and many other areas. Sowing the seeds of tax incentives for urban renewal in Upper Merrion Street was on occasion a very barren task. Sowing the seeds in 1986 and 1987 was almost an impossible task. It took the tenacity of somebody like John Boland to argue the case and see it through.</P>
    <P>He was also a superb member of Dublin County Council. My colleagues on that council, of which I was not a member because I was in the city, often testify to his knowledge and skill. Many city officials who shared offices with the county council because of the structure of the county council and the corporation at that time said he knew more about local government law than the law agent on many occasions. They frequently consulted the chairman rather than the law agent in relation to an arcane point of local government law.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I extend our sincere sympathies to Kay, Grace and John, who are present this afternoon, and to the Fine Gael Party, which has lost a hero in terms of the values for which that party is recognised and to which he was so completely committed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to express my sympathy and that of the Progressive Democrats to Kay, John and Grace Boland on the sad death of John Boland. I share Deputy Bruton's view that he was one of the brightest people ever elected to this House. John Boland was not interested in the trappings of ministerial office. It is fair to say, as other Members said, that he approached all his ministerial responsibilities with a real determination to deliver change.</P>
      <P>The vigour with which he pursued public service reform in particular will always stand to his memory. It is incredible to think that less than 20 years ago public servants were not supposed to give their names or numbers when they were engaging with the public. It was a simple reform at one level but that and many other things he did in the public service were enormously important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was appointed to the Seanad in 1977, as the Taoiseach said, I took the record from John Boland for being the youngest Member of the Seanad. However, he was elected to the Seanad and that clearly was more difficult at the age of 24 than being nominated. It stands to the type of skill he had that, at that young age, he was elected by the Fine Gael members of local authorities around the country. He became chairman of Dublin County Council at the age of 26. He performed his duties in that role with great distinction. He is still spoken about in county council circles, not so <Col N="55" /> much with great love as great admiration. People admired the manner in which he chaired the council.</P>
    <P>He was a person who wanted to get things done. I said earlier that Theresa Ahearn was not happy with the <i>status quo</i>. John Boland was a challenger. He was fearless, as Deputy John Bruton said. He showed remarkable courage. Populism was alien to John Boland. Perhaps the type of courage he showed was seen more as a quality in the 1970s than it is today. He would take on any group if, as Deputy John Bruton said, he believed the cause was right and he did it skilfully and successfully.</P>
    <P>I extend my sympathy to the Fine Gael Party on the loss of someone at a young age. I was away on holidays when John Boland died but on my return I saw a programme which had been recorded with him a number of years ago. He spoke on that programme about how important it was to move on and to do other things in life and not to necessarily always stay in the one career. He did that successfully.</P>
    <P>I remember in the early 1990s before he began his Bar career, probably while he was studying for the Bar, he was a journalist and a panellist on many programmes. He showed great incisiveness. What struck me above all else was how fair he was in the manner in which he commented on politics. Notwithstanding his own political persuasion and the fact that he adored the party to which he belonged, I remember remarking to others at the time about how fair he was in the manner in which he commented about the political activities of the day. That speaks volumes for the type of person he was.</P>
    <P>I extend my sympathy to Kay and their two children, John and Grace. They will miss him enormously. I know he had a difficult death. He had an illness which he also fought with great courage but, unfortunately, it took him away from us all at such a young age.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Green Party I extend sincere sympathy to Kay, Grace and John, their families and friends, John's brother, Cathal, who continues the political tradition in the area, and the Fine Gael Party in general.</P>
      <P>During the early 1980s and my teaching days in Balbriggan John Boland was the political giant in the area. He was not only known and spoken of wherever one went but he was also known as a pioneering reformer. The ban on corporal punishment has already been mentioned. He was also appreciated for the home improvement grants and, more controversially, for the car registration system which he also pioneered. He championed many issues and he firmly put his stamp on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He can best be described as an intellectual ambassador for Dublin North. He was known for his intellectual capacity as much as for where he <Col N="56" /> came from and the people he represented. That is a rare and wonderful reputation to earn. His ability to do an excellent job, whether in journalism or as a Minister or barrister, is something few people can say they have achieved in their lives, although John Boland's life was short.</P>
    <P>The sense of loss was palpable at his funeral, particularly among those present, but also in the town he made his own where he enjoyed his leisure time as well as his work. The town of Skerries is a sadder place for his passing. That time will be remembered but not repeated. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam uasal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Members in expressing my deepest sympathy to Kay, Grace and John on the death of John Boland.</P>
      <P>I first came to this House at John's invitation when I was being considered as a candidate for the local council elections in 1979. A relationship in any constituency where a party manages to win and hold two seats always has two sides. John Boland could not have been a better example for a new person who was elected both to the county council and Dáil Éireann. He had a commitment to public service and he was always willing to share. As others have said, he would sometimes let a person know if he or she was making the wrong decision but he did so in the hope that he or she understood there was a better way to do it.</P>
      <P>He was a man of the sharpest intellect. I watched him at meetings in Dublin North and elsewhere take the germ of an idea put forward by someone who could not advance it and make it a policy issue. Those of us who were lucky enough to share our time with him on Dublin County Council &ndash; there are quite a few members still in this House &ndash; will know that in 1979 when the council became larger and many of us were novices John Boland's leadership made it one of the most dynamic councils in the country.</P>
      <P>Many people will have forgotten that it was John Boland's initiative which set up the first parks department in any council, an example which many councils have still not emulated. He was the instigator of the council's purchase of Malahide Castle, Ardgillan Castle and Newbridge House. These parks and facilities are now available to everyone and they are a living memorial to him.</P>
      <P>I regret that John moved from politics into another career. He associated with lawyers, many of whom I have met and who said he was a remarkable advocate. They could not believe that someone who had taken up law at a late stage in his career could do so with such vibrancy and intelligence and be able to make it his own. I often heard people say they would like to have John Boland on their side if they were in court because they knew he could make a good case for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin North is a sadder place without John Boland. It has lost a good representative and someone who will be remembered for the many <Col N="57" /> things he did for the constituency, the many innovative ideas he brought to that constituency and the thousands of people he helped as a public representative about which most of us do not know. Every so often I meet one of them who reminds me that John Boland helped them or their son or daughter to get a house or helped to get a road built which improved the area.</P>
    <P>I am sad that his death has been so untimely. Both John and Theresa Ahearn died long before their time. I hope John will be remembered for the many fine things he did but also for the great man he was at home and in Skerries. I extend my sympathy to Kay, John and Grace.</P>

      <P>I pay tribute to John Boland whom I got to know through politics and social and sporting events in the Dublin North constituency. John left politics at an age when most people are commencing their careers. He dedicated 22 years of his life to public service. It has already been stated that he spent 12 years in this House, eight years in the Upper House and 15 years in Dublin County Council, of which he was chairman. It was also mentioned that the parks department of the council, which is the success story of all councils, is a tribute to his time, dedication and efforts. He was also involved in the purchase of Malahide Castle and other regional parks which are enjoyed by thousands of people on a weekly basis.</P>
      <P>He was a member and chairman of the VEC. He was involved in formulating the policy which set up community colleges and which brought together the archdiocese, teachers and parents. That is a tribute to him.</P>
      <P>I know of his organisational ability and his analytical skills that brought about successes in political terms in Dublin North. On three occasions he brought about two-seat successes for Fine Gael in Dublin North. Today's children are benefiting from his policy on corporal punishment as a Minister. Many other policy decisions that will stand the test of time were made in his other ministries. The constituency of Dublin North has benefited from his time on the local authority, as a Dáil Deputy and as a Minister. The quality of life we currently enjoy in Dublin North is a testament to John Boland.</P>
      <P>John Boland enjoyed life &ndash; sailing, having a pint, attending every sporting event and especially a day at the races where I got to know him and Kay very well. He was a person who cut through the difficulties that came before him. He was gifted with a sharp mind and, at times, a sharper tongue. John Boland packed into 55 years what it would take most of us 100 years to do. Our constituency is at the loss of all the work he carried out. I was reminded yesterday by his colleague and friend, Sean Barrett, of a quote he used on many occasions: &ldquo;It's nice to be important; it is more important to be nice&rdquo;. I extend my sympathies to Kay, Grace and John.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will have learned with sadness of the death of Joe Sheridan, a former Member of the House. May he rest in peace. The late Deputy and Senator Joe Sheridan was a distinguished and respected representative of the people of Westmeath for many years. Originally from the parish of Colmcille in Longford, he later moved to Kilbeggan in Westmeath. It was in County Westmeath that he entered public life and was so successful, first as a county councillor, then a Senator and finally as a Dáil Deputy for 20 years, from 1961 to 1981. Before entering politics I understand Joe was a very successful livestock dealer and would have been well known in the marts of the midlands in the 1940s and 1950s, and I know he was well known in the Dublin cattle mart and in the Smithfield area.</P>
      <P>He entered politics as a Fine Gael Member and was a representative on the Westmeath County Council and Seanad Éireann, but as an Independent he entered this House in 1961, supported the minority Sean Lemass Government to 1965 and continued his service in the Dáil uninterrupted until 1981. Throughout his time in politics Joe was a tireless representative of his constituents and the concerns of rural Ireland in general. He is acknowledged as an authority on farming and the interests of rural families were always dear to his heart.</P>
      <P>It was only in the last period of his time here that I knew him, and the time he stayed in my area when he was out of the House, but from those experiences I know he always considered that the time he managed to survive in public life so successfully was an enormous achievement. He strongly represented rural issues.</P>
      <P>Joe's wife Sarah passed away some years ago so today I extend our sympathies to his children Farrell, Bridget, Pat, Mary T, Kathleen, Joseph, John V, Anne and Mel. This is the second loss for the Sheridan family because his brother, Fr. Pat, died a short time ago. On behalf of the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party I offer our deepest condolences to his sons and daughters. The Deputy Leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, knew Joe extremely well and she asked me to offer her condolences as she is attending the Transport Council today. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the expressions of sympathy to the Sheridan family on the death of Joe. I have known Joe Sheridan for many years. He was first elected to the Seanad as a Fine Gael Senator. He was a member of the Fine Gael Party for many years prior to that. He was not successful at a convention in 1961 and he decided to take politics into his own hands and see if the people of Longford-Westmeath would have more wisdom than the people of Fine Gael. It would appear that they did because Joe was elected, and <Col N="59" /> he held his seat time and again. Joe Sheridan may have been assisted in his political success by the fact that he was born in Longford but lived in Westmeath. He lived in several different parts of Westmeath, which assisted the extension of his political base.</P>
      <P>As some Members of the House know, I am connected by marriage with Joe. I remember attending the marriage in question and it showed his fine political judgment that he had invited representatives of all three main political parties to the wedding. I happened to be the groomsman at the wedding so it was obviously important that I should be marked but he had prominent members of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Labour Party at the wedding to make sure that there was no question of any political lack of balance being displayed. Furthermore, he had some say, although my cousin possibly had to be consulted, in the fact that the church ceremony took place in County Westmeath but the wedding reception took place in Longford, so both parts of the constituency were properly covered. That was part of the success of Joe Sheridan. Joe Sheridan was a man who would enjoy the joke. He would see the humour in all of this. He would do what was necessary to cover all the political bases but he would not mind people pulling his leg about it.</P>
      <P>It was interesting that at the removal in Mullingar cathedral last night three former Taoisigh were present to pay tribute to his memory, which is quite significant in itself. I do not know whether Deputy Albert Reynolds would agree with this, but it is probably fair to say that Deputy Albert Reynolds was a political apprentice at Joe Sheridan's knee because Deputy Reynolds emerged into political life from the Independent political organisation of Westmeath and Longford which had been created to sustain the political career of Joe Sheridan. Deputy Albert Reynolds, in a sense, occupied subsequently the seat of Joe Sheridan in the Dáil. He inherited, to some degree at least, the political mantle of Joe Sheridan and it could be said that it took a Taoiseach to replace Joe Sheridan. He was somebody quite significant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Taoiseach has mentioned, Joe's brother, Fr. Pat, died earlier and I know his family are living all over the world. Monsignor Sheridan is in California and other members live in different parts of the world. The Sheridan family have given great service in different areas, in the church and in public life. Joe had a very large family; the Taoiseach named them all. They are people who are very much involved in the public and business life of several counties. One of his daughters is very successful in journalism, Kathy Sheridan. Another is very successful at the Bar as a barrister. I will not go on any further because I would make invidious comments. Joe and his wife reared a very talented family with a strong sense of values, a sense of belief in themselves but also a belief in the needs of others. Members of the House who know members of Joe's family as well <Col N="60" /> as I do will agree that he and his wife passed on something very radical to their children, something that is a privilege which all of us who know them well appreciate.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach said, Joe Sheridan was a cattle dealer who became a politician. I come from a family with a similar heritage. The ethics and ethos of that profession puts a higher premium on deeds than on words. Joe Sheridan was a man of many deeds but few words. The ethos of that profession was also one that believes that if one wants to get value, one must give value. Joe Sheridan had a reputation for giving value. People were prepared to do business with him again because they knew he was a fair dealer, someone who dealt fairly with people. He earned that reputation. In a sense it is a profession in which one's reputation is put to the test every time one does business. Joe Sheridan's reputation was enhanced through his professional career in the cattle business.</P>
    <P>He will be greatly missed. He led a full life. It would be fair to say he did not die at a young age, unlike the other Members we have been mourning, but he lived his life to the full. He enjoyed his life. He had a very positive attitude and Members who spoke to him recently told me he was looking forward to the long promised pay increase and the consequences that might have for his pension and perhaps was a little disappointed that his good friend had not yet delivered on it. His good friend knows about whom I am talking.</P>
    <P>Those of us who knew Joe Sheridan enjoyed his company and we can, with sadness, but not with the same poignancy of sadness we have regarding the two people to whom Members have just referred, celebrate a good life well lived.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I wish to express our deep sympathy to the Sheridan family and the extended family on the death of Joe. As the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Bruton, said, that while Joe originally came from Longford he lived in various parts of Westmeath, which was a way of ensuring he was in contact with the local people. He garnered a significant level of electoral support because of the diversity of places in which he lived, and he used to crack a joke about that.</P>
      <P>He liked to portray himself as a simple man. That was his motto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does that too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am moving on to that. As a young lad supporting the late Jimmy Benneton and the late Jack Coleman in the 1969 general election &ndash; Deputy McGrath will also remember this &ndash;  we were steamrolled by Joe's great independent electoral machine. Joe sent out one message only, &ldquo;Vote for Joe the man you know&rdquo;. He did not use any other paraphenalia. I am sure Deputy Belton would remember that famous time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="61" /> Behind that simplicity there was a tremendous rustic wisdom and intellect. As the Taoiseach and Deputy Bruton said, he was a man who learned and hued his experience at the fairs and cattle marts throughout Ireland. He was as well known as anyone could be in the old Dublin mart and as a result was well known in agricultural circles.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Bruton said, he stood for Fine Gael, but in 1961 when he stood for election there was a long election count and that was his first lesson in garnering preferences, which he got from all quarters, to edge out his great friend, Gerry L'Estrange. They were great friends even though they fought for the same votes. It was amazing how they kept up such a great friendship despite the usual rivalry that exists when one is trying to get elected. Joe headed the poll in 1969, which is a tribute to the massive electoral machine he mobilised throughout Counties Longford and Westmeath, but particularly in Westmeath. One met people one thought were Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour supporters, but on the day of the election they were in Joe's camp. The people Joe mobilised into his great electoral machine fought for every vote and I know some of them well. They were worth 200 or 300 votes. He was last elected in 1977.</P>
    <P>During one period he held the balance of power and no shrewder Independent held the balance of power. If I was an independent, I would like to have learned from Joe how he managed to be in that position because his constituents benefited a good deal and there were no formalised deals at that time. Joe did not believe in long speeches or long contributions in the House. When I was elected to the House he said to me, &ldquo;Young Penrose, you'll talk yourself out of that place quicker than you'll talk yourself into it&rdquo;. It was a salient piece of advice. Some Ministers, including the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, might remember he spoke directly and cornered Ministers when he had to on behalf of those he represented. The balance of power he held gave him major clout. He had a common touch. That is the way he would like to be remembered, a man of the people, as they say down my way, a real rural midlander who never forgot his roots. As he told me one time, his simple motto was, &ldquo;if you can't do a person a good turn, don't do him a bad turn&rdquo;. That is a great epitaph and tribute to him, and it is the way he would like to be remembered.</P>
    <P>He was accessible to all in the vast constituency of Longford-Westmeath. The position is now easier for the three Deputies who represent Westmeath in that it is a specific geographical unit, but it was a vast area when the constituency included County Longford. On many a Sunday the avenue to his house in Carrick, near Dalystown, was lined with cars. When going off to play football we would wonder what politics is all about when an elected representative does not even get the time to have Sunday dinner. As Deputy McGrath will attest, the same applied to Joe's great colleague, the late Gerry L'Estrange from Killentown. <Col N="62" /> There was great competition between representatives at that time and the people who supported representatives made sure they worked very hard.</P>
    <P>His late wife Sarah and his family were a great political family. It made me, and I am sure many others involved in politics, realise that if one does not have the full backing of one's family, one will not succeed. I went to school with some of his sons and the minute an election was called and the flag was lowered, they were out on the streets and it was hell for leather. Every vote was garnered and every house had to be canvassed. That was the secret of his success. The greatest tribute that could be paid to Joe is that any person who could garner support from every quarter of his constituency election after election was a true Independent in every sense of the word.</P>
    <P>There was always a floating vote in Westmeath, the &ldquo;detached vote&rdquo; as it was called. A significant element of that vote floated back to its roots, but some of it remained truly Independent. Following my election to the Dáil in 1992, he told me, with a twinkle in his eye, that I captured a fair portion of his vote in Westmeath and that I had better look after the constituents. I knew I got some of that famous vote and I was acutely conscious of the task of trying to fill the shoes of Joe Sheridan and trying to match his achievements for the constituents.</P>
    <P>To his immediate family, Farell, Bridget, who was a very successful barrister like the late John Boland, whom I can attest were great opponents at the Bar &ndash; I think she was called to the Bar a year or two before John &ndash; Pat, Mary T., Kathleen, who is a journalist here, young Joe, John V , Anne and Mel, and to his extended family I offer our sincere sympathies.</P>

His political longevity as a Deputy from 1961 to 1981 is something from which we could all learn a great deal.</P>

      <P>I too want to extend my sympathy to the Sheridan family on the death of the late Joe Sheridan, who was a Member for almost 20 years. The manner of his departure from Fine Gael and his election has already been outlined by Deputy Bruton. At his funeral yesterday evening many stories were told about Joe Sheridan and a number of them could not be told in the House.</P>
      <P>One interesting story related to the difficulties people had at the time in getting a telephone, which many Members will recall. One could not get a phone installed in one's house, but Joe Sheridan, as an Independent Deputy from a rural constituency, held the balance of power to a certain extent and everyone wanted to look after him in case things were not good after the next election. He was from north Longford and one of his great friends was Larry Cunningham, who had a song at the time called &ldquo;Put Your Sweet Lips a Little Closer to the Phone&rdquo;. That was Joe's favourite song and he sang it at election rallies at the time. That got the message across that if one wanted a phone, Joe was the man who could get it.</P>
      <P>We all like to think we are men of the people and Joe was close to his constituents. He knew what they were thinking about, their concerns, difficulties and worries. We all say we know that, but Joe Sheridan was able to empathise with his people. He could relate to them and understand what they were thinking. Not only that, he was able to do something for them. His personality and strength of character meant he could motivate people and get them to work for him. Many Members will recall that in rural elections of that time there was a tradition of painting slogans on the roads on election day. That is gone in our part of the country, but at the time Joe had the best machine for writing slogans on the road. I remember them still &ndash; as Deputy Penrose said, they said: &ldquo;Vote for Joe, the man you know.&rdquo; That would be painted on hills everywhere and how successful it was.</P>
      <P>On his first outing as an Independent in 1961 there was a famous long count and he got transfers from Sinn Féin which brought him over the line ahead of his great friend and colleague, Gerry L'Estrange. He did not have to worry too much about elections thereafter because he polled extremely well, topping the poll in 1969.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="64" /> His method of work was not like ours now, speaking in the House on the Adjournment and issuing press releases. That was not for Joe Sheridan. He did not do radio interviews or issue press releases. He took the problem a person had and dealt with it. He would arrive in the House on a Tuesday or Wednesday with a pocketful of cigarette boxes and notes and would go to the office of the Minister responsible, saying: &ldquo;There you are now, you must look after them and that's it.&rdquo;  It was said yesterday that on some occasions he used some good language to ensure the Minister would deliver on what he wanted.</P>
    <P>Joe Sheridan came from a very respectable family. He had three brothers who were priests and one sister who was a nun. Someone told me yesterday that he canvassed with Joe Sheridan in the convent in Ballymahon before an election and when talking to the nuns Joe mentioned his three brothers who were priests and his three sisters who were nuns. On the way out his colleague said he did not think Joe had three sisters who were nuns. Joe said that in the convent he was able to add on a couple to make sure he got the vote.</P>
    <P>Joe Sheridan was a man who could read a situation and respond to it. He had nine children. I was privileged to go to school with a couple of them and they are fine people. I offer my sincere sympathy to his family. Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam dílis.</P>

      <P>I too would like to pay tribute to the late Joe Sheridan. He was a well known cattle dealer in his early life before becoming a very successful politician. He represented the constituency of Longford-Westmeath for 20 years, being elected on five different occasions. He was a very generous man and a loyal friend. He was a true Christian in every sense of the word. Some stories told about Joe Sheridan may not be true, but they could have been &ndash; he was that sort of character. His great political machine was mentioned this afternoon and many of the members of that machine were ex-Fianna Fáil, ex-Fine Gael, ex-Labour, ex-what you like. Joe was once asked how he could keep them all from fighting, as they all came from different backgrounds. He said it was like carrying a basket of eggs, if one dropped it there was a disaster.</P>
      <P>I know most members of his family and they have all been very successful. He will always be remembered as a unique personality. He was there before the time of the spin doctor, the soundbite or the e-mail, but he will always be remembered as &ldquo;the man you know.&rdquo;</P>

The Taoiseach has kept the first promise and we are back on the appointed day but things are not ready.</P>
      <P>In the 1920s and 1930s Deputies operated without secretaries, with perhaps one telephone for the entire parliamentary party to use and wrote all their letters by hand, but we are not in that age any more. We are in an age when this is supposed to be a modern institution using modern communications. It is not possible for the Opposition to do its job when there is no typewriter operating, no Internet access and when most of the telephones are down and people cannot ring outside the House for information.</P>
      <P>It is not right that Ministers have gone on radio today and yesterday saying that everything was ready when it was not. I cannot understand how the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, is still in office&mdash;</P>

How can this Government have credibility in talking about spending £14 billion on transport and doing all that on time when it cannot even get the refurbishment of this House completed on time? It has no credibility in so far as managing any major construction project is concerned. It cannot manage its own house, so how could it manage other people's houses?</P>

The information I received from the senior commissioner who has been overlooking this work all summer was that the union representing a number of Members' secretaries undertook an inspection of the new building in the company of Office of Public Works officials earlier today. The union commented favourably on the quality of the facilities and confirmed it was generally satisfied with the working environment for staff. However, the union indicated it would require enhanced ground surfaces outside the three fire exits. The Office of Public Works undertook to address this issue and work is in hand and will be completed later tonight. On this basis the union recommended that staff occupy offices in the new block from tomorrow morning.</P>

      <P>In addition to the new building, Members will be aware that a significant refurbishment of the five storey block is finished. Work on the 1932 annex in the engineering block was also undertaken. All this work has been successfully completed without any complaints today. Outstanding work on telephones, faxes, monitors and computers is being addressed as a matter of priority and all staff involved will work throughout the night.</P>
      <P>Overall it is important to acknowledge what has been achieved in an extremely tight timescale. It is a £25 million project.

      <P>The Government gave approval to the drafting of the Road Traffic Bill on 26 July. The purpose of the Bill, as has been stated, is to provide for the introduction of a penalty points system. The penalty points system will track minor breaches of driving regulations with a view to improving the behaviour of those who recurrently commit such breaches. The design of the system, as stated in the Government's roads strategy, will require careful consideration because of the exclusive constitutional role of the Irish courts in the administration of justice. This required protracted examination of the legal position. The drafting of the Bill is now proceeding as a matter of urgency with a view to publication before the end of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In common with other industrialised countries, Ireland is set to experience a significant ageing of its population over the coming decades. The resulting increased dependency ratio will give rise to serious budgetary issues. In particular, it will put severe strain on the capacity of future Governments to continue to fund social welfare and public service pension liabilities on a pay-as-you-go basis. The purpose of the Bill before the House today is to put in place a mechanism to address this issue. It aims to meet part of the escalating cost of pensions by providing for the establishment of a national pensions reserve fund. The Bill marks a radical departure in the management of the public finances and introduces a new strategic long-term element into budgetary planning. It will help to ensure that the fruits of the economic success we are now enjoying contribute to the long-term well-being of our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to increased life expectancy and declining birth rates we are set to experience significant <Col N="78" /> ageing of our population over the next half century. Today we have a ratio of one person aged 65 or over for every five persons of working age. By 2016, this ratio is projected to increase to one person aged 65 or over for every four persons of working age. This trend will continue and by mid-century it is projected that the ratio will have risen to one person aged 65 or over to every two persons of working age.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that this greying of the population will have profound implications for Exchequer spending on pensions, health care and other services. The social welfare pension issue was considered in the National Pensions Policy Initiative, a report by the Pensions Board to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs in May 1998. That report recommended the partial pre-funding of the projected growth in social welfare pensions. This issue and the wider budgetary issues posed by ageing were considered by a number of groups in my Department, principally the Budget Strategy for Ageing Group, whose report was published in July 1999. Taking the work of these groups together and updating conclusions to take account of the most recent data, the position in which we are likely to find ourselves can be summarised as follows: the current Exchequer cost of public service and social welfare pensions is 4.7% of GNP; by 2026, the Exchequer cost of broadly maintaining this level of pension provision will rise to 8.1% of GNP; and by 2056, this cost will have risen to 12.4% of GNP. This increase is merely to maintain the existing level of service. Any relative improvements that might occur in pension provision would, of course, add further to the cost.</P>
    <P>The prospects of funding the increased expenditure, which I have outlined above, for economic growth are not bright. As the population ages, we will not be able to fuel growth through an expansion of the labour force as we have done over recent years. In this changed scenario, growth will have to be sustained by productivity gains alone and levels are likely to converge to the norm for advanced industrial societies.</P>
    <P>Of course the issues raised by the greying of the population are not unique to Ireland. They are common to other industrial societies as the post-war baby boom generations reach retirement age. Awareness of the fiscal and economic risks implied by these developments has led to debate about the structure of the pension system in other countries. For example, Germany, which is set to experience a more immediate and severe demographic problem than we are, is currently considering plans for pension reform. The plan includes a reduction of benefits from the pay-as-you-go system, support for private pension funds and more support for company pensions.</P>
    <P>I have tried to illustrate the magnitude of the task facing the country. Fortunately because of our predominately young population and the economic boom, we have both the time and the capacity to prepare for the burden. Indeed, our young population and the resultant increase in <Col N="79" /> the labour force has been a significant contributory factor to our current strong economic performance. These favourable conditions are set to continue into the next decade and we can expect to achieve significant budget surpluses over the next few years. The consolidation of our budgetary position through the running of surpluses and the consequent decline in our level of indebtedness will, of themselves, improve our capacity to deal with the issues posed by ageing. However, we have the opportunity to go further &ndash; to take advantage of these favourable economic conditions and to provide now for more normal circumstances as the growth in the economy tapers off when the bulge in the young population passes through.</P>
    <P>Up to now, the Exchequer costs of social welfare and public service pensions have been met as they arise &ndash; that is, like many other countries Ireland operates a pay-as-you-go approach to funding these costs. If a pay-as-you-go system is to be stable, there must be sufficient workers, who are sufficiently productive, to finance the cost of pensions for those who have retired. In the past, this requirement has been met in this country and it will continue to be met into the medium term. However, we now know that it will not be met in the long term. If we do nothing to anticipate that development now, the consequence will be either that taxes will have to rise dramatically when that time arrives or else the value of pensions in real terms will have to be reduced. This Government does not want to leave future generations of pensioners in a position where maintenance of the current level of pension cover could be put at risk.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is, therefore, to move from complete reliance on pay-as-you-go and introduce part-funding of our future liabilities. Put simply, the Bill involves setting aside some of the revenues generated by the strength of the economy and our favourable demographics, investing them and drawing them down in the future when growth rates are likely to be slower and the age dependency burden very much increased.</P>
    <P>However, given the magnitude of the prospective costs involved and the many other competing demands on the State's finances, it would be unrealistic to expect the Government to fully fund the increased costs of ageing in advance. The budget strategy for ageing group estimated that about 3.5% of GNP would have to be set aside annually to equalise the Exchequer burden of health and pension costs over the next 50 years. This is simply too much to expect of any generation.</P>
    <P>What I am proposing in the Bill is more modest but also more achievable. It involves the setting aside and investing of 1% of gross national product annually to meet part of the cost of future pensions. The Bill will also allow the Government to make additional contributions to the fund. We have already decided that the net proceeds of the <Col N="80" /> sale of the former Telecom Éireann are to be paid into the fund. This money has been lodged to the temporary holding fund for superannuation liabilities under the control of the NTMA. Once this legislation has been enacted, it will be paid into the reserve fund.</P>
    <P>The assets of the reserve fund will be drawn down by future Ministers for Finance commencing in 2025. The size of these drawdowns will increase in line with the growth in the percentage of over 65s in the population. In this way, the fund will help to smooth over a very long time the Exchequer burden arising from our additional pension commitments.</P>
    <P>The extent to which the fund will contribute to the increased cost of pensions in the long term depends on a number of factors, principally the extent of the additional payments into the fund on top of the annual 1% of GNP and the return the fund achieves on its investments.</P>
    <P>While we know that the contribution will be substantial, it is impossible to forecast exactly how large it will be. The Bill provides in section 6(1)(h) for the regular assessment of the State's long-term pension liabilities and of the capacity of the fund to meet these liabilities. It will be a matter for future Governments to monitor this relationship and to take appropriate action.</P>
    <P>I should stress that in earmarking such substantial moneys for the fund, the Government is in no way neglecting the current needs of our society. Contributions to the fund are not being made at the expense of other goals and commitments. Due to our economic success we are in the happy position of being able to prefund within a sustainable budgetary strategy which will also allow for substantial infrastructural and other capital investment under the national development plan, for continuing the implementation of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, for further improvements in public services and for ongoing reduction in the national debt. In short, the economic success which we have worked so hard to achieve allows us to make provision for future pension liabilities without compromising on our more immediate economic and societal goals.</P>
    <P>While making an annual 1% of GNP contribution to the fund poses no difficulties for the Exchequer at the moment, I recognise that Deputies may have concerns that the contribution could cause problems in more adverse economic circumstances. However, it is the Government's opinion that any short-term difficulties that the payment may cause the Exchequer are more than offset by the long-term gain. To leave discretion in the making of the 1% contribution in times of economic difficulty would, I am convinced, undermine the whole basis of the fund. I do not need to remind the House of the straits in which prioritising short-term interests over the longer-term sustainability of the public finances has left us in the past. I believe that a 1% of GNP contribution is a prudent and sustainable commitment. Once built into the multi-annual budgetary structure it <Col N="81" /> should not cause undue difficulty. To put it into perspective, the contribution is slightly less than our annual contribution to the EU budget and less than one third of the interest payment on the national debt in 1999.</P>
    <P>I wish to set out a few of the key principles which I have enshrined in the legislation establishing the fund. I am extremely conscious that it is the people's money that is being invested in the fund and I have, therefore, purposely structured the fund in a manner which will enable it to match the returns achieved by private pension funds. This is reflected in three key features of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The fund will be managed by commissioners who will be independent of Government. They will control and manage the fund with discretionary authority to determine and implement an investment strategy for the fund. Given the responsibilities to be placed upon the commissioners, it is essential to ensure that those appointed have the ability and expertise to make a constructive contribution to the management of the fund. To this end, the legislation specifies that appointees must have acquired substantial experience at senior management level in relevant areas.</P>
    <P>This investment strategy will be based on a commercial investment mandate with the objective of securing the optimal return over the long term, subject to prudent risk management. On this point, I should state that given its large size in comparison to the size of the Irish market, it is inevitable that most of the fund will be invested abroad.</P>
    <P>In this connection, Deputies may ask if the commissioners should be required to take other national objectives into account when determining an investment mandate for the fund. It is my firm view that any dilution of the commercial nature of the investment mandate, for example, by requiring the commissioners to maintain a certain level of investment in the Irish economy, could seriously compromise the returns achieved by the fund. The purpose of the fund and the justification for asking the taxpayer to make a contribution to it of 1% of GNP each year is to provide, as far as possible, for the costs of future pensions. I believe that the State has a solemn duty to do everything it can in accordance with prudence to maximise the return on this investment. The use of fund moneys for any other objective, no matter how laudable, should not be countenanced. Such objectives, if worth achieving, can be attained in other ways.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that the fund cannot be raided by future Governments for any other purpose besides the meeting of pension costs, I have provided for a prohibition on drawdowns prior to 2025. Drawdowns after that date will be determined under ministerial rules by reference to projected increases in the number of persons over 65 in the population.</P>
    <P>Having highlighted these key features I wish to set out the main provisions of the Bill. In sum<Col N="82" /> mary it provides for the establishment of the fund to provide towards the Exchequer cost of social welfare and public service pensions from 2025 onwards; a statutory obligation to pay a sum equivalent to 1% of GNP from the Exchequer into the fund each year until at least 2055 &ndash; provision is also made for the payment of additional sums into the fund from time to time; the establishment of an independent commission to control and manage the fund &ndash; the commission will have discretionary authority to determine and implement an investment strategy for the fund; a strictly commercial investment mandate for the fund with the objective of securing the optimal return over the long term, subject to prudent risk management; a prohibition on drawdowns from the fund prior to 2025 &ndash; drawdowns thereafter will be determined under ministerial rules by reference to projected increases in the number of persons over 65 and with a view to avoiding large fluctuations in the net Exchequer balance; the appointment of the National Treasury Management Agency as manager of the fund to act as agent of the commission &ndash; the appointment of the agency will be for a period of ten years, following which there will be the option, at five yearly intervals, to extend this further or to appoint an alternative manager; and the appointment by the commission of investment managers to invest and manage portions of the fund and custodians to ensure the safekeeping and security of the assets of the fund.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for the accountability of the commission to the Minister for Finance and to the Dáil. This includes provision for detailed annual reports and for the appearance of the commission chairperson and the chief executive or manager before the Committee of Public Accounts. The Bill also provides for the transfer of the £4.8 billion currently in the temporary holding fund to the reserve fund and the winding up of the temporary holding fund.</P>
    <P>The Government decision of July 1999 to part prefund future pension liabilities envisaged the setting up of two funds &ndash; one for social welfare pensions and one for public service pensions. However, for the sake of simplicity and to minimise administrative costs, the Government decided to proceed with legislation that provides for a single fund to cover both sets of liabilities.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not pretend to address all the issues or to provide a complete solution to the budgetary problems posed by the ageing of the population. However, it makes a start. It ensures that we begin now to provide in a systematic manner for the inevitable increase in the pension liabilities which the Exchequer will be required to meet as the population ages. It will significantly ease the impact of this burden on the taxpayer and increase future Governments' capacity to respond to the other needs which will undoubtedly arise. The Bill is sensible and forward thinking legislation and I commend it to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Pensions Reserve Fund Bill seeks to enact proposals for the partial funding of social welfare and public service pensions. The proposals are radical, the policy implications are signficant and the consequences for future pensioners and taxpayers are important. It is surprising, therefore, there has been so little debate about the content of this Bill since its publication. It is particularly surprising that the debate has been so muted when £4.8 billion has already been put aside in the temporary holding fund, ready for transfer to the pensions reserve fund, and the annual commmitment to the pensions reserve fund is in excess of £600 million per annum, based on the current level of GNP, and will rise as GNP rises. We often debate minor issues but issues of major consequence, such as this Bill, seem to pass without any debate.</P>
      <P>This proposal would not have been made if the Exchequer had been in deficit. This country has no experience of handling budgetary surpluses and I have no doubt that when the proposals contained in the Bill were first mooted, at least part of the motivation of the Minister and his officials was to put part of the budget surplus beyond the reach of persons who either had plans or might devise plans to spend it. That is a prudent expedient but it is not sufficient in itself to justify the Bill.</P>
      <P>Until now public service and social welfare pensions have been operated on a pay-as-you-go basis and have not been funded. The contributions made to their pensions by public servants have not gone into a pension fund and pensions of public servants have been paid from general Exchequer funds, usually through the pay and pensions Votes of individual Departments. While there is a social welfare fund into which PRSI contributions are paid, it is not a pension fund in any real sense. The drawdown, until recently, exceeded the level of contribution and had to be topped up by the Exchequer. Now, when contributions exceed the payout, balances accrue to the Exchequer and are not retained for investment purposes within the fund.</P>
      <P>In future a sum equivalent to 1% of GNP will be paid into a pensions reserve fund. Payments will continue until at least 2055, that is, 55 years hence, and any drawdown from the fund will be prohibited until 2025. The case for proceeding in this way is based on an estimate of an increasing proportion of pensioners in the population between 2025 and 2055, leading to an increased burden on the taxpayer. The nub of the Minister's argument is that the greying of the population will add to the burden on future taxpayers to service pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of questions arise from this. What are the demographic projections on which the case is based? The Minister gave the result of these projections and drew attention to the projected cost if these projections are correct but he did not refer to what the projections were. Is the case based on the number of pensioners in the population or on the proportion of pensioners to <Col N="84" /> taxpayers? Two different results arise from the second rather than the first equation. It is difficult to make the type of demographic projections made by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Since the time of Malthus, projections that are extremely wide of the mark have been made and, with due respect to the Minister and his advisers, their attempts to estimate annual inflation this year have been wide of the mark. They have had to change their opinion three times. That does not inspire great faith that they will be able to give an estimate of the population in 2055 and to assess the number of workers who might be supporting an ageing population in 55 years. The Minister could be right or wrong but he is tying the hands of his successors in a way that has never been attempted before. He has not produced the evidence or sufficiently made the case to justify the proposals he makes.</P>
    <P>It is self-evident that the bulk of people now in their 40s will survive to claim pensions in 25 years. It is not at all clear, however, whether the additional number of persons on pensions will be an additional burden on those paying tax in 25 years. In the last six years, the number of persons at work has increased from 1.1 million to almost 1.7 million. Nobody projected that. Nobody suggested that we would see a more than 50% increase in the labour force over a short period. If this trend continues and if either through an increase in the number of births or immigration the number of people at work increases significantly between now and 2025 and between 2025 and 2055, the difficulty in paying for pensions envisaged by the Minister might not arise.</P>
    <P>This is not simply an academic or statistical argument. In times of surplus, one might as well put surplus funds into a pension fund as pay off the national debt or put it in the post office or into a financial reserve fund. It does not matter in times of surplus but it does matter in times of deficit. What is being proposed is that the current generation of taxpayers will continue to pay pensions on a pay-as-you-go basis but will also contribute, through their taxes, 1% of GNP each year to fund pensions after 2025. The Minister's proposal envisages that the current generation of taxpayers will be obliged to pay twice.</P>
    <P>While the budget is in surplus the 1% contribution will cause no grief. However, if the Exchequer again dips into deficit the choices being made will be stark. It is not so long ago that the expenditure of an additional few million pounds or cuts of a few million pounds led to lengthy and controversial Cabinet meetings. When the Exchequer goes into deficit, as it inevitably will, the real significance of the 1% contribution will be seen. A large amount of money might be set aside for the pension reserve fund against a background of cuts in sensitive areas of public expenditure such as health, education or social welfare.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that a future Minister for Finance will come to the House to propose tax increases, perhaps swingeing tax increases, to deal <Col N="85" /> with an eventuality which we cannot now foresee. However, this Minister will tie the hands of that Minister by legislation so that, regardless of the circumstances of the Exchequer or the pressure which expenditure together with a downturn in the economy might put on it, the first payout will have to be 1% of GNP into a pensions reserve fund. I do not believe the Minister has made the case that this is necessary in current circumstances.</P>
    <P>Much of the research on which the 1998 report is based relates to figures for a few years prior to that year. Considering what has happened in the labour force since then, I would like an up to date projection based on the current level of the labour force and labour force projections to see if the Minister is still right. It is clear everyone is getting older; that is not the issue. The population is greying; that is not the issue. The issue is, will the proportion of pensioners who have their pensions paid by the State be greater in proportion to those at work in the future? I do not think the case is made. I do not know the Government's intentions in terms of immigration but a feature of booming economies throughout the world is that they tend to suck in workers, particularly for the service industries. A modest net immigration to this country over a 25 or 55 year period would throw the Minister's projections out the window. However, we will take the proposal on its merits.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that the fund will be operated under a strictly commercial investment mandate. A fund investment manager operating under such a mandate at present would not invest more than 1% of the fund in Irish investments. The mandate would require him to spread his risks through Europe, the United States and Japan. This gives rise to a further problem for the Irish taxpayer. He or she will not just be paying twice and making double contributions for pensions but no indirect benefit will arise to that taxpayer through better infrastructure or through the opportunities which investment from the fund and the domestic economy, particularly employment opportunities, would give. There is a huge infrastructural deficit in Ireland and, as the economy expands, the deficit is increasing rather than decreasing. We need investment in infrastructure, yet the mandate under the provisions of the Bill will prohibit investment managers from investing in infrastructural projects in Ireland as the Minister has effectively admitted this in his speech this evening. The vast bulk of investment from the fund will be in other economies and jobs generated by this investment will be in Magdeburg, Manchester or Miami rather than in Ballymun, Bohola or the Burren. I use the alliteration just to illustrate that not only can the scriptwriter of the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, alliterate with placenames and quite clearly put his signature on it by doing so, but we can do it on this side of the House also.</P>
    <P>While the current economic boom continues, the type of decisions which are implicit in the Bill <Col N="86" /> will pass without comment. Everyone knows there is money to burn. There is plenty of money for the national plan; there are huge surpluses. Therefore, what does it matter if fund managers must invest abroad rather than at home. There will be more money also for the private sector through the public private partnership, if this ever takes off the ground. That is how the song goes. The superfluity of Exchequer funds available for everything we want to do is a very unique experience in Irish public life and not the experience of those of us who have been here for quite a while. Neither is it the experience of any Administration since the foundation of the State. Over the 55 year period envisaged, there will be downturns and shortages of money. Not only will 1% of GNP be taken every year but the commercial mandate will ensure that, regardless of the needs in schools, hospitals, roads or public transport, that money will have to be invested abroad and cannot be used in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt posterity will pay great tributes to the Minister and all of us in this House to be so farseeing. However, while we have some duty to posterity, I do not agree with the Sir Boyle Roche argument that we should forget about posterity on the grounds they never did anything for us anyway. I think we should have a more farseeing view, but a difficulty arises. The commercial investment mandate of the fund also gives rise to another difficulty to which the Minister did not refer. Does the Minister envisage that the commercial considerations on the rate of return will be the only considerations taken into account by those who manage the fund? Does he envisage investments from the fund being made in what would be considered to be unethical or ecologically unfriendly companies? Will the regulations indicate that such investments will not be countenanced and, if so, will this be a departure from the commercial mandate which the Minister has announced? If the rate of return is good, may investments be made in the armaments industry, nuclear energy or in logging companies cutting down the rain forests in the Amazon Basin, for example? How will the Minister deal with these issues or will they be ignored? Will he leave the actual investment decision totally in the hands of investment managers to operate as they see fit, all decisions being made purely on the rate of return whether by way of dividend or capital gains?</P>
    <P>There is one omission in the Bill which I find difficult to understand. When the Minister originally announced two pension funds for public service workers' pensions and PRSI contributions, I thought he intended moving from the pay-as-you-go system to the funding of pensions. It now seems very anomalous that while he is setting up a pension reserve fund into which 1% of GNP and the proceeds of the sale of State assets will be lodged, the actual contributions made by public servants for their pensions will not go into any fund. Surely this is anomalous if one is moving towards funding. Surely the first line of contribution which would go into any fund would be <Col N="87" /> the contributions being made by teachers, gardaí and civil servants throughout the country. It would stand to reason that in times of high employment, when the PRSI fund is in surplus, that surplus would not be transferred to the Exchequer for expenditure elsewhere but would be retained within a fund and invested by the fund manager of that fund to ensure that pensions were secure in the future. It does not make sense to take legislative power to withdraw from the Exchequer the equivalent of 1% of GNP and put it in a reserve fund while at the same time contributions which put the social welfare fund in surplus are being spent elsewhere and not being used for pension purposes. To continue to operate a pay-as-you-go system up to 2025 and treat the new fund as something which kicks in in 2025 for the eventualities which the Minister foresees arising from an ageing population is not a sufficiently radical measure if he intends departing from a pay-as-you-go system to a fully funded system.</P>
    <P>I now wish to comment on the provisions of the Bill. If we accept the principle of it, it is fair to say that the Bill is well constructed. There are issues which will arise on Committee Stage and I will signal some of them now. However, this is not meant to be a conclusive list. It is difficult at times to understand why there is need for a commission and a manager. At the end of the day all the functions of the commission, which will be an eight person body with the chairman being one of the eight, may be delegated to the manager and carried out by the National Treasury Management Agency for the first ten years. While the commission is not obliged to cede all its powers under the Bill, the manager may do so. In practice it seems this may be the practical solution to its problems. Would it be simpler to say that the NTMA will supervise this fund, hire investment managers from the private sector either by tender or some other appropriate way and run the fund? Why is this extra layer needed when it does not seem to be of any great advantage? When setting up the fund did the Minister consider allowing discretion to his successors to vary the contribution as time goes by against a background of changing Exchequer circumstances? For example, instead of making it mandatory to pay 1% of GNP into the fund, why did the Minister not say that the Minister of the day will pay in a sum in the range of 0.25% or 0.5% of GNP to 1.5% or 2% of GNP, depending on circumstances, with some overall controlling notion that it will have to average 1% over a particular cycle? A better result would be achieved that way.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann &ndash;</P>
      <P>&ndash;conscious that rising prices have cancelled the benefit of the 5.5% pay increase under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, have wiped out the 5.5% increase in social welfare payments announced in the budget and reduced the standard of living of persons on fixed incomes;</P>
      <P>&ndash;concerned that inflation has particularly hit young families who are entering the housing market and face huge child care costs;</P>
      <P>&ndash;alarmed by the impact of rising oil prices on the cost base of the economy;</P>
      <P>condemns the failure of the Government to anticipate the inflationary pressures or to take any real measures to combat inflation, and calls for the introduction of non-inflationary gain-sharing mechanisms, and a coherent strategy to reduce Ireland's exposure to external shocks whether through foreign exchange markets or through energy dependence.</P>
      <P>Ireland's inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, is three times the European average. The ESRI, the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the Irish Central Bank have warned against the dangers this level of inflation poses to our economic prosperity. They warn that a loss of Ireland's competitiveness could turn the economic dream to tears, that the economy will land hard as growth rates fall and that if the Government continues to stand idly by, boom will turn to bust and as the economy slides towards recession thousands of jobs will be lost and living standards will be slashed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has been warned again and again but it still will not act in any realistic or coherent way and continues to trot out the same tired old excuses. The budget introduced last year was politically inept and fanned rather than reduced the rate of inflation. In reacting to the initial budget fiasco the Government spent an additional £500 million more than it intended on <Col N="89" /> budget day to mend its political hand so that the budget which was already expansionary was pushed for purely party political reasons beyond what was prudent and it is now reaping the whirlwind of these decisions.</P>
    <P>I agree not all inflation is caused by domestic factors. Much of Ireland's rising prices are caused by increased oil prices and the weakness of the euro but much of our inflation, particularly service inflation which is running at 7%, is domestically generated. As living standards are reduced by inflation it is no wonder that workers try to maintain their living standards through extra wage demands, which when granted will lead inevitably to a loss of competitiveness.</P>
    <P>The Government has been negligent and incompetent in dealing with inflation. In the early months of the year when the CPI began to increase the Government went into denial. There was no problem, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance informed us. The Minister for Finance urged people to celebrate the country's prosperity, break out the champagne and binge on the consumer boom.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The following month's CPI dampened this party spirit. The Minister for Finance sulked and together with the Taoiseach roundly abused their critics. They were &ldquo;left wing pinkos&rdquo; or &ldquo;creeping Jesuses&rdquo; to dare to draw the attention of the public to rising inflation.</P>
      <P>The CPI continued to rise, however, and before the summer the Government again changed tack. There was now a problem, it said. Price control was introduced on drink after the price of drink had already risen. Sombre speeches were delivered by Ministers and the Tánaiste called for somebody somewhere to make the economy more competitive, forgetting, in an uncharacteristic memory lapse, that she was a Minister with responsibility for ensuring that the economy is competitive. Then everyone went on holidays.</P>
      <P>In the early autumn the governor of the European Central Bank again warned of the dangers of inflation and the Government was dragged towards reluctant action. The problem has been handed to the social partners who have been asked to design the next budget in a manner which deals with the problem of inflation. There have been good and bad Governments in this country and there have been good and bad Ministers over the years, but since the State was founded there never has been such a collection of incompetent persons in charge of the economic Departments of State. In the memorable words of a disappointed Eircom shareholder: &ldquo;These Ministers act like weedkiller, everything they touch withers.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inflation makes people poorer. This year inflation has cancelled the 5.5% increase in wages under the PPF and the 5% average increase in social welfare payments, which were announced in the budget, and the living standards of persons <Col N="90" /> on fixed incomes are being seriously eroded. In launching a counter attack on inflation, its root causes, symptoms and effects must all be addressed. Political action to deal with the symptoms and effects of inflation must not be confused with an attack on the root causes. The social partners have been given the responsibility by the Government to deal with the effects of inflation. The review which is taking place is in part a response to the demand by workers and social welfare recipients to regain the ground lost through inflation.</P>
    <P>The argument between the social partners is not whether this should be done but how it should be done. The package of measures containing pay elements, tax concessions and better social services must be designed to compensate for falling living standards, and we all agree with this, but it must be done in a way as far as possible which does not fuel inflation further. This is not an easy task but a solution within this context is preferable to the widespread industrial unrest and reduction in competitiveness which would result from an extended bout of wages chasing prices in a leapfrogging free for all.</P>
    <P>I hope the social partners are successful and whatever abrogation of responsibility there is on the Minister's behalf they have our good wishes if they succeed in designing a budget which helps to control inflation. However, if they are successful they are still dealing with the effects of the inflation and not its root causes. Many economists warn against treating the symptoms of inflation rather than the disease. By this they mean that measures introduced to reduce the CPI should not be attempted and that such measures are like somebody trying to reduce the heat in a room by tampering with the thermometer.</P>
    <P>This argument is partly true if we deal in economic terms only, but is not true once it is understood that solutions can only come through the political process. The CPI is the accepted measure of inflation. Workers respond to a rising CPI by pressing their unions to demand extra wages. The demand is not based as much on the rise in the price of goods and services in shops but on the CPI which measures the rise. If the CPI reduced wage demands would be more muted. Consequently, it is worth considering reductions in excise and VAT to bring down the CPI even if the effect on the root causes of inflation are marginal.</P>
    <P>When the Government raised the excise duty on tobacco products in the last budget, the CPI rose by 0.8%. That the Government decision was based solely on health grounds and not motivated by a desire to collect extra revenue has been accepted by all of us but was forgotten when wage demands were based on the CPI. The 0.8% increase which has led to some wage demands was artificial because it was introduced for reasons that had little to do with rising prices. Yet, that artificial demand is fuelling real wage increases so it stands to reason that an equally <Col N="91" /> artificial reduction might have the opposite, and a more beneficial, effect.</P>
    <P>Excise duty and VAT are applied as a percentage of the price of fuel oils. Each time the price of oil has gone up this year, an additional increase in price was automatically applied for VAT and excise duty. At the time of the last budget I proposed that, as the Government did not need the revenue it proposed to collect from the excise increase on tobacco, the excise on fossil fuels should be reduced by an amount equal to the additional excise receipts from tobacco. There is still very strong merit in the arguments I made on budget day and those I put forward by way of amendments to the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I also see merit in the reduction of the standard rate of VAT in the budget. I realise the consequences of what I am saying. At 21% Ireland's standard rate of VAT is higher than the European average of 19.5%. As an ancillary issue, the 21% rate of VAT is inhibiting the Government's ambition to take the lead as a European e-commerce centre. A 2% reduction in the standard rate of VAT, if fully passed on, would reduce the CPI by 0.8%.</P>
    <P>It should be made quite clear, however, that reductions in excise duties or VAT will have little impact on the root causes of inflation, even though they may reduce the level of compensation demanded by workers who measure their losses by reference to the CPI. It must also be borne in mind that such cuts would provide a fiscal stimulus to the economy, which might fuel inflation rather than reduce it. Such cuts should be made only as part of an agreement with the social partners that cuts in indirect taxation would be treated as an intrinsic part of any overall tax reduction package designed to compensate workers for the losses they have incurred through rising prices.</P>
    <P>The root causes of inflation in the indigenous economy must be attacked. I have referred to a manner in which the symptoms of inflation may be addressed through reductions in VAT and excise duty. I see the difficulties, however, and it needs a fine political judgment to decide whether to do so or not. I have referred to the action being taken to deal with the effects of inflation &ndash; the primary effect is the reduction in living standards. The current talks at social partnership level are attempting to design a package which will restore those living standards which have been eroded by inflation. However, those discussions between the social partners are not dealing with the problems of inflation, they are dealing with its consequences. We must reflect on how we should deal with the problems of inflation.</P>
    <P>Prior to Ireland joining the euro, the exchange rate and interest rates could be modified to control inflation. These instruments of policy are no longer available to us, but the Government must use the policy instruments that are available. A free competitive market is the best antidote to inflation. In a small country like Ireland almost <Col N="92" /> any level of goods and services to satisfy any level of consumer demand is available provided the goods and services can be imported. If all goods and services were importable inflation rates would tend to be the average for the trading area as a whole. There would be balance of payment problems obviously, but not necessarily inflation problems.</P>
    <P>Our economy is not like that, however. The Central Bank has pointed out that there is now a mismatch between supply and demand in the labour market, and that this impacts very strongly on the indigenous sector of the economy. Service inflation has topped 7% and house prices continue to rise by huge annual increments. The anecdotal evidence in every town explains the problem. Every service industry has job vacancies and competes for workers by raising wages and the increase is passed on by increasing prices to customers. This is true of the bar, hotel and catering trades, the garage business, hairdressing and dry-cleaning, gardening and landscaping, and of every service connected with the building industry. It is true in respect of doctors' and solicitors' fees and will shortly be manifest in the banking and insurance industries where the leading banks have been forced recently to pay a 30% increase to ensure they would get and retain sufficient staff.</P>
    <P>The competition for a decreasing supply of skilled workers is now the main driving force of inflation in the service industries and in failing to deal with this the Government's incompetence is most obvious. Ireland does not have a fully competitive market. The supply of services is littered with licences, cartels, cosy arrangements and professional agreements which increase fees and prices and which work against consumers. The offices of the Director of Consumer Affairs and of the Competition Authority are both under staffed and under funded. The supply of skilled workers is running out and the Government still does nothing to remove the obstacles which prevent a fuller participation in the labour force. With 150,000 persons still on the live register, is there not scope for upskilling many of these to work in the service industries?</P>
    <P>In its fourth year in office this Government has yet to develop a coherent child care policy, and is it not obvious that the lack of such a policy keeps many women from fully participating in the labour force? Is it not obvious also that it keeps some women out of the labour market completely, while others can only take up jobs on a part-time basis because there is no adequate child care programme sponsored or encouraged by the Government?</P>
    <P>The price of houses is the biggest factor preventing young Irish persons from returning to work in Ireland. It is driving nurses and teachers and junior civil servants out of Dublin and is a primary factor in the shortage of workers for service industries in the capital. After three botched attempts this Government has still failed to intro<Col N="93" /> duce measures which would lead to affordable housing.</P>
    <P>The Government has no coherent immigration policy. Last month a publican I know, employed a Russian asylum seeker, who was skilled, competent and anxious to work. The immigration officers had him out in a week. He will now languish on welfare for months while he awaits a decision on his fate from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's Mercedes goes very fast, but when it comes to executive action the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, drives the slowest coach on the road.</P>
    <P>Economies from Great Britain to the United States, from Singapore to Germany, and from Australia to Brazil have in times of boom developed immigration policies to supply workers to their service industries. This Government would run a mile rather than be involved in designing a proper immigration policy for Ireland.</P>
    <P>This Government took over an economy in excellent order but it has failed to manage it. The Ministers with primary responsibility for economic management have failed across a range of issues and continue to fail in controlling inflation. The electorate will not forgive them, but it is a great pity that the people must continue to endure their incompetence and damaging inactivity while we await an election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will focus on the biggest underlying reason for inflation, and particularly for pay demands and wage inflation, which is the increase in house prices from June 1996 to June this year. During that period prices doubled. That happened at a time when the annual increase in the price of houses has been 20% and the annual increase in pay has been of the order of 5%. That unaffordability gap is what is making a whole new cohort of our labour force disaffected, disillusioned and making them seek radical increases in pay. We are seeing that now with teachers and we will see it across the board in the private sector.</P>
      <P>The facts speak for themselves. In Dublin, the average price of a new house is £155,000, while in the rest of the country it is £114,000. Last year, the average industrial wage was £16,000 so banks and buildings societies are saying &lsquo;no' to mortgage requests. We have had three Bacon reports but the solution is blindingly simple. By any factor of economics, an increase in the price is always as a result of demand exceeding supply. The only way to stabilise house prices is to bring the two into balance. The Government is congratulating itself on building 46,000 houses a year when in fact the market requirement between the public and private sectors is between 60,000 and 70,000 houses per year, and a procurement over the relative medium term of an additional 500,000 houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one considers that and asks the building industry what is the impediment, it says land with <Col N="94" /> planning permission and water supply. It is simple. These people make a large amount of money on each house and they say it is not a case of playing with the thermometer or dampening down one element of demand, such as the private rented sector. All that means is that a student or a person on a short-term work contract will rent accommodation and their rents will be higher. Keeping them out of the market will not solve the problems of home buyers.</P>
    <P>One must deal with the simple problems. With regard to planning, there are 350 town planning posts in the local authority sector but 100 of those posts are unfilled. This is because people have walked into better jobs in the private sector and people will not take up new jobs because UCD is only producing 25 planners a year. It is simple. There is a need to recruit people from the UK. People wonder why individuals have not come from the UK, but the reason is that they are only offered two year contracts. Who would come back to Ireland and spend £200,000 on a house for a two year contract? These people must be offered permanent and pensionable jobs.</P>
    <P>The Minister must do what he did with the IT sector two years ago where there was an exemption from the straitjacket of public sector pay and one had to do what the market said. Overtime must be paid if one wants to keep staff and avoid the need to write out every three months for further particulars, thereby delaying the planning process because there is not enough staff. A planning officer cannot be paid overtime at present, so what is the point of working late or working on a Saturday? Any private sector employer would be radical in terms of making the necessary flexibility adjustments to recruit planners.</P>
    <P>When one gets through the local authority process, it starts all over again with An Bord Pleanála. There is a four month legal limit, but in excess of 50% of appeals to the board go beyond the statutory limit because it is short 35 inspectors. It cannot cope systematically with the volume of construction activity. There is a shortage of houses because projects take up to two years to get through the planning process.</P>
    <P>The same problem arises with regard to water supply. I have spoken to representatives of the construction industry, Dr. Peter Bacon and others. I asked where are the 16,000 houses that were to be available under the serviced land initiative and I was told that the biggest problem was lack of water. If one speaks to county engineers and asks about water supply, they say that it takes three years to complete the design stage of a scheme and another three years to go through the tendering process. Other countries have integrated the design, tendering and construction phases into one process and cut down the time involved to two and a half years.</P>
    <P>These are not silver bullet solutions, but they are firing blanks in the Custom House. They are throwing their hands into the air and asking what they can do. However, there are pragmatic and workable solutions to the water and planning <Col N="95" /> problems. Regarding local authority housing, the NESF report clearly highlights what works in Northern Ireland. I listened recently to Ms Maureen Gaffney, the chairperson of the forum, who said they went to Northern Ireland and saw how the housing executive works and delivers houses for people. However, we wonder how the local authority housing construction programme is so constipated and ineffective although money is available from the Custom House to solve the problem. We are committed to building 10,000 houses per year under the social housing programme between local authorities and others.</P>
    <P>The Government took a deliberate political decision that the problems of dropping house prices, negative equity and that there are more house owners than house buyers would be worse than the problem of house price inflation. The market has not been sent the appropriate signal that, irrespective of what it takes, 70,000 houses a year will be built. That in itself would bring down prices. We are committed, following the next general election and in government, to getting the right supply policies that will deliver that quantum of houses and reduce the biggest factor that is driving the engine of inflation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment my colleague, Deputy Noonan, on tabling this important motion. The current rate of inflation is the highest for 15 years. It is now as big a threat to the economy and country's long-term prosperity as the national debt crisis was in the 1980s. Any further sustained rise in inflation would leave the social consensus in Ireland in tatters. If inflation continues at its current rate, the competitiveness of the economy will be seriously damaged and the indigenous sector will take the brunt of the impact. It would also erode the view of Ireland as an attractive location for foreign direct investment.</P>
      <P>Many acres of print have been used to deplore Ireland's high inflation rate. There has been much talk but few solutions. We cannot revalue our currency because we are now part of the euro. Revaluation could have reduced the price of goods and services produced abroad and thereby cut inflation. The only way to cut inflation is to reduce the price of goods and services produced in Ireland. These include houses, personal and catering services and Government services of all types. The only way to cut the price of the goods and services produced in Ireland is to increase their supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party believes that the Government should set up a supply side task force comprising Government agencies with the mandate to increase the supply of all domestically produced goods and services that impact on the CPI. This task force would identify changes in legislation and public administration. The task force should start with housing, as Deputy Yates said. The shortage of planners in councils is delaying the supply of new houses and prices are being driven <Col N="96" /> up because of scarcity. At present, one third of planning positions in local authorities are vacant.</P>
    <P>With regard to services, a shortage of qualified labour is pushing up costs. Immigration is the answer to the labour shortage but immigrants need to be housed. This is why housing is a fundamental part of the war on inflation. There must also be concerted questioning of all licensing arrangements or restrictive practices that limit the supply of goods and services. Some of these arrangements are protected by powerful interests. However, it is possible that these interests might be persuaded by a Government supply side task force to relax restrictions as part of the temporary anti-inflationary drive. The truth is that everybody will lose if Ireland gets caught up in a wage price spiral.</P>
    <P>A supply side task force should, as a matter of urgency, examine areas where there are rates of price increase above the norm, giving priority to areas where factors are determined within Ireland and which are under our control such as housing. It should produce concrete proposals for legal and administrative changes to increase supply of these goods or services on an emergency basis. Where legal changes are needed, these could be prioritised and fast-tracked through the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    <P>The task force should be required to produce a monthly report similar to those produced by the National Prices Commission in the 1970s and 1980s. However, unlike the National Prices Commission, the focus of the supply side task force should be on increasing supply rather than authorising price increases. We should not forget that if asset prices continue to rise at three or four times the rate of inflation, investment will be inhibited and our economy will become sluggish and protectionist.</P>
    <P>However, the Government has run down the staffing in the Competition Authority, the one body that can tackle some of these issues. This has happened to such an extent that when the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment wanted to investigate anti-competitive practices, such as in the beef industry, she had to set up another body because the Competition Authority did not have sufficient resources. This is the priority the Government is giving to these issues and trying to tackle the bottlenecks.</P>
    <P>The policy instruments available to tackle inflation are budgetary policy and pay policy. However, the Government's approach to these has been singularly inappropriate for an economy which is overheating. Budgetary policy in particular has been the cause of inflation rather than the solution. The last budget was the wrong budget at the wrong time. It led to overheating in the economy, which was already at full speed. The Government must change its mindset in advance of the next budget or it will send inflation through the roof. It must put in place measures which will put the brakes on consumer demand by taking disposable income out of the marketplace.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Noonan, suggested a <Col N="97" /> number of provisions for income tax relief by paying them off in interest bearing bonds. Another proposal that should be considered is the incentivisation of long-term saving schemes and pensions by encouraging individual taxpayers to take up long-term savings plans. This would take money out of circulation, dampen demand and provide future security for individuals, particularly in light of the fact that one in every two people does not have a personal pension policy. One way such a measure could be introduced is by reducing the level of taxation on such schemes or other alternatives which have been put in place elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Supply constraints in key infrastructure, such as transport and housing, are adding to the upward pressure on wages as compensation is sought for higher living costs and the supply of immigrant labour willing to take up work in a high cost environment is restrained. This element is fundamental to our long-term economic performance. The national development plan is fundamental to that and it must be delivered on time.</P>
    <P>It will be virtually impossible for the Government to meet its own targets and that will have a double impact on inflation. The only way the capacity demands of the economy, such as traffic congestion, public transport, regional development, water and energy demands and the factors surrounding the housing crisis, can be resolved is through the implementation of the NDP. To try to meet these targets within the current mechanisms will cause increased demands in the construction industry and this will lead to wage demands and further pressures on inflation and housing prices. Foreign contractors could be employed to increase the number of construction workers, but that is not being done at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is more than a year since Deputy Noonan and I warned the Minister at Question Time about the impending rise in inflation. I remember the Minister treated us with scorn. He said we were scaremongering and that we were influenced by commentators and experts who did not know about what they were talking. It is now obvious we were not exaggerating.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Unless inflation is brought under control and the problem is resolved, the future of the PPF will be in doubt. The July figures show price increases of 6.2% over the previous year. Inflation for this year is forecast at 5.25%, which will wipe out the value of the 5.5% increase in the first phase of the PPF.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During 1995 to 1999 inflation was stable, averaging just under 2%. However, following last year's budget, the consumer price index began to climb rapidly. Increased taxation on tobacco caused the initial rise, followed by increases in oil and transport costs and in other goods imported from outside the euro zone. Food prices, alcoholic drinks and some services have also risen by 3.2%. The living standards of workers who <Col N="98" /> received the 5.5% increase in January will stand still during the year but will fall by the end of it.</P>
    <P>The Government's 5.25% inflation forecast was based on the assumption that oil prices and interest rates would not rise further and the euro would stabilise. However, oil prices have increased, the euro has weakened and the European Central Bank has increased interest rates. The PPF was negotiated on the basis of the Government's assessment that inflation would not exceed 3% this year. It now appears that figure will be close to 6%, which will result in a 3% drop in incomes. This can only be redressed by higher wages, larger tax cuts than were initially agreed or a combination of both.</P>
    <P>A review of the operation of the programme is provided for at the request of any of the social partners and this has been sought by ICTU. The PPF promised increases in net take home pay as a result of wage increases and tax cuts of up to 25% over 33 months. If inflation continues at the present rate, the increase will be only approximately 6%. This is unacceptable when the economy is booming at approximately 10% a year.</P>
    <P>First time house buyers are in the worst position as house prices, which are outside the consumer price index, are still rising at approximately 20% per annum. Pensioners and welfare dependants are worst off. They face a severe drop in their purchasing power unless the Minister undoes some of the damage in the December budget. I am also concerned about farm inflation with which I am sure the Minister is familiar. Farmers, particularly dairy and beef farmers, are dependant on oil, the price of which has increased by 30%. This is eroding the recent increases in beef and milk prices. Farmers will face a reduction rather than an increase in incomes at the end of this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Noonan for tabling this motion tonight because it is time this debate took place. The public has been dissatisfied with the Government for the past two years. Spin doctors spun the story that the economy and everyone was doing well and people were afraid to say they were not doing well. I could speak for two hours about the different interest groups which have done badly since this Government took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rich are getting richer, the middle class is being squeezed and the poor are getting poorer. I will give the Minister a few examples. County councils sent letters to people on social welfare who got a £5 or 5% increase last year to assess if their income had increased. They then took money off them. They have also been affected by the price of food. I listened to previous speakers who said they identified when inflation started to rise. Two years ago I questioned the Central Statistics Office about its statistics on the price of food and the increase in living costs. I raised that in the national newspapers, at county council level and in the Dáil. However, I was dismissed <Col N="99" /> by all the commentators and by the Minister. I was told the figures were not correct.</P>
    <P>I am an auctioneer and I see what is happening in my county and in the country. Young couples cannot build a house or buy a site. That is an indictment on the Government. Money has never been more plentiful for water and sewerage schemes. I said two years ago that local authorities should buy green field sites. They should get money from the Department of the Environment and Local Government for water and sewerage services and they should sell the land to builders or build whatever houses are required. However, that cannot be done.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Yates said, the planning process is in disarray. There is a shortage of planners in every county. After two months people are getting letters from the planning authorities requesting further information so they can extend the planning period for two more months. The planning officers in County Mayo will not meet the public for the next three weeks because they do not have enough technical staff or registrars to do the paperwork for them. The local authorities are not able to operate the service. People are paying engineers and architects to do the work for them. However, by the time they get planning permission the price of their house has increased by a further 10%, 15% or 20% because builders have become greedy. They are like the oil companies.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed last week when the Minister did not take on the oil companies. I am not talking about the external price of oil, which is outside the Minister's control. The Minister should have called in Texaco, Shell and all the other companies which, over the past number of months, have put further pressure on inflation. They increased the price of oil when there was no need to do so. Every village and town is selling oil and gas at the highest possible price because the Minister did not call in the big sharks, who are making plenty of money out of this crisis, and tell them that if they did not deal with it, he would introduce price control. That should have been done because these people do not care about this country. Most of them have investments outside the country but they should have been taken on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ndash;conscious that increases in real living standards have been delivered by this Government, for employees and social welfare recipients, through the Partnership process;</P>
      <P>&ndash;cognisant of the progress which has been made in increasing the supply of affordable housing and the major initiatives which have been taken to enhance the quality and supply of childcare;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="100" />&ndash;aware of the fact that taxes on, and as a result retail prices of, petroleum products are among the lowest in the EU and are below those of most of our main trading partners;</P>
    <P>supports the proactive approach of this Government in dealing with the pressures which exist in the economy and has confidence that future measures, under consideration in the context of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and the next budget, will build upon the major gains of recent years and further improve real living standards.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate these issues. This Government has a proud record of economic achievement. Moreover, we have a coherent strategy to address the economic and social problems that we as a nation now face.</P>
    <P>As I have stated on a number of occasions, the Government is concerned about price pressures in the economy and the current rate of inflation. Maintaining stability and social partnership in order to sustain economic and social progress are our key challenges. These are key issues for Government to address, but they are issues that concern us all and require a response from all sections of society.</P>
    <P>Core elements of the Government's response include fostering competition and tackling supply problems but, most importantly, the Government is working to ensure that the successful social partnership model remains on track. Consensus was crucial in tackling our unemployment and fiscal crises in the past and it is also crucial in tackling our current problems. Inflation cannot be successfully addressed outside the partnership framework and the parameters of the current agreement.</P>
    <P>Before I turn to the specifics of the motion before the House, I want to put our current problems in context. These problems cannot be separated from the economic and social progress that we are continuing to make. It may be populist to focus only on the negative and ignore the positive, as the proposers of this motion do, but we should not forget that we are experiencing the fastest and most sustained period of economic growth in our country's history.</P>
    <P>When this Government came to office in 1997, we made promises to the people. Our primary aim was and still is to ensure that the fruits of economic prosperity are prudently availed of to foster opportunities for employment and enterprise. I have always believed that success in these areas would provide us with the revenue that we need to fulfil our ambitious targets to establish an inclusive society to provide for the needs of our elderly citizens, people with disabilities, the unemployed, our children and all in our society who are vulnerable.</P>
    <P>The third quarter Exchequer figures published by my Department earlier today indicate that the economy is strong and getting stronger in a fundamental way. This is no undeserved and fleeting <Col N="101" /> boom. Instead, the economy and our national finances are undergoing a sustained structural change with the result that we can ensure our own and succeeding generations' prosperity.</P>
    <P>A strong economy, sound finances and strong, effective social services go together. This has always been the philosophy of Fianna Fáil, and the correctness of our vision is borne out in the state of the economy today. When we came into office, sustaining economic growth was one of our key objectives. Let us look at the record. The economy grew by 9.3% in 1997, by 7.8% in 1998 and 7.8% in 1999, and growth of 8.3% is projected for this year. Growth has averaged over 8% in the past three years. This is even more remarkable given the performance of our main trading partners. The European Union has experienced growth of just 2.5% per annum during this period. This is one of the longest and most sustained periods of growth experienced by any industrialised economy and we should not lose sight of that.</P>
    <P>Moreover, we have a coherent and solid set of policies geared towards maintaining this success. The national development plan, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and our tax policies are addressing the problems of success we have in housing, infrastructure and the labour market. Their successful implementation will provide the basis for sustainable growth and social progress.</P>
    <P>We will also continue with our sensible budgetary policies. We will continue to run a budget surplus and further reduce the national debt. Since we came into office, we have moved from a deficit of 0.6% of GDP to a projected surplus of 3.7% this year. We have also managed to reduce the national debt from 66% of GDP to a projected 44% while setting aside considerable sums to pay for our future pension liabilities.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that spending these surpluses on larger tax cuts and more expenditure increases would be a popular course of action. Indeed, this course of action is often suggested by the Opposition parties in this House but this Government does not believe in short-termism for popularity's sake. Future generations deserve better and we will not be reckless with the public finances.</P>
    <P>It is inconsistent simultaneously to stand up and criticise a lack of spending in particular areas while blaming the Government for the high rate of inflation. Let us have a little honesty. If it is alleged that loose budgetary policy is responsible for our high rate of inflation, I hope the Opposition parties will outline in this debate the taxes they want increased and the public services they want reduced.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House is also critical of the Government's social policies. I would like to put the record straight. When we came into office we gave a commitment to reduce unemployment. In 1997, unemployment stood at almost 10%. It now stands at 4.3%. Even more spectacular is the fall in the rate of long-term unemployment. The numbers in long-term unemployment have fallen by almost 70% in the past four years. There are <Col N="102" /> now 27,000 persons classified as long-term unemployed compared to 86,000 when the previous Government left office. More needs to be done, however, and the Government is committed to ensuring that unemployment continues to fall. We believe that employment opportunities should be accessible to all, and we continue to strive for further success in this regard.</P>
    <P>Employment grew by nearly 100,000 last year and has grown by over 200,000 since we took office. This is an incredible performance. There can be no doubt that those who now have jobs have benefited from our management of the economy.</P>
    <P>Real living standards have also increased across the board. Real manufacturing earnings before tax reductions are up over 7% since 1997. This is an increase of 2% per annum. Taking account of reductions in taxation, real average incomes for a single person are up over 15% since we took office. This is an average increase of almost 5% per annum. The take home pay of a married one income couple with two children is up over 19%, an average increase of nearly 6% per annum.</P>
    <P>This Government received a mandate from the electorate to reduce personal taxes and this is what we have done. In budget 1998, tax reductions amounted to £517 million; in budget 1999, they totalled £581 million; and in budget 2000, we managed to reduce taxes by £942 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>These significant tax packages have enabled us to meet many of the tax commitments set out in the Government programme. The standard rate of tax has been reduced by four percentage points and the top rate is also down by four percentage points. We have also increased personal allowances and the standard band while introducing tax credits and starting the first phase of individualisation. These policies have removed thousands from the tax net. They have also taken thousands more off the top rate of tax. Our innovative tax policies are rewarding work and effort.</P>
      <P>It is clear that living standards have improved significantly. I accept that increases in inflation will erode some of the expected gains this year, but despite what the motion before the House suggests, real earnings will increase this year. Looking ahead I am confident that inflation should begin to fall. This is also the view of the ESRI, the Central Bank and most forecasters. Accordingly, the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness will support significant growth in real living standards over the programme period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those on social welfare have also seen real increases during our term in office. The personal rate of most social welfare payments has increased by £10 per week or 15% since 1997 while the personal rate for social welfare old age <Col N="103" /> pensions has increased by £18 per week over the same period, an increase of 23% in the old age contributory pension or 27% in the old age non-contributory pension. This is well ahead of inflation. I am sure many people were taken with the debate on pensions at the British Labour Party conference last week and as they apply in the United Kingdom under a Labour Government with a majority of approximately 140.</P>

The first instalment of this increase was included in budget 2000 with a minimum increase in the qualified adult allowance of £3.80 per week, an increase of almost 9% for most recipients.</P>
      <P>Another significant innovation for social welfare recipients was the introduction of the earlier effective date of payment for social welfare increases and further improvements are envisaged. From 2002 all social welfare recipients can look forward to receiving the increases announced in each budget with effect from January in line with the recently announced decision to align the tax and calendar years.</P>
      <P>In addition to all the above, there have been numerous other improvements and initiatives, including reform of the capital assessment procedure for the purpose of the social welfare means test, the extension of the social welfare free schemes to all people over the age of 75 years, the introduction of a respite care grant for carers and many others which are designed to meet the particular needs of many of the most vulnerable groups in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These measures will help to reduce the incidence of poverty. The latest figures produced in the context of the national anti-poverty strategy show that the number of people experiencing consistent poverty has fallen substantially from <Col N="104" /> 9% to 15% in 1994 to 6% to 8% by 1998. Given the falls in unemployment since, the incidence of consistent poverty is now undoubtedly lower still. While this reduction is a very welcome development, the Government is committed to making further progress. We have set ourselves ambitious new targets to further reduce consistent poverty to below 5% by 2004. This will require addressing issues across the five key areas of income adequacy, unemployment, educational disadvantage and urban and rural poverty.</P>
    <P>I regret that higher than expected inflation this year has reduced the impact of the social welfare increases announced in budget 2000. This has affected those on fixed incomes. However, we are committed to ensuring that there will be real increases in all social welfare rates while making progress towards a rate of £100 per week for all social welfare benefits and ensuring continued substantial improvements in the rate of child benefit. I am confident that when we leave office the record will show that we made enormous progress in reducing poverty and improving the living standards of those on fixed incomes.</P>
    <P>With regard to the current inflation situation and the Government's response to it, as the House is aware the latest inflation figures released by the Central Statistics Office show that headline inflation in Ireland remained at 6.2% in August. This is much higher than the Government expected at the time of last year's budget and much higher than anybody else was forecasting at that time. The ESRI, the Central Bank, the European Commission and the OECD all forecast inflation of around 3%, the Government's forecast on budget day.</P>
    <P>This is not intended to deflect attention from the perspective outturn for this year: our inflation performance is disappointing and represents a serious challenge. However, it should be noted that many of the factors pushing up our inflation rate were unexpected. As Deputies are aware, these factors include the weakness of the euro, the upward trend in oil prices, increases in mortgage interest rates and higher inflation in the services sector.</P>
    <P>The budget increase in excise duty on tobacco products also added to headline inflation. This was introduced as a health promotion measure, which was welcomed by this House at the time in spite of its impact on inflation.</P>
    <P>The motion before us expresses alarm at the impact of higher oil prices on the economy. We are all aware of the impact of high international oil prices. Oil prices alone are responsible for 1.2% of our inflation rate. The cost of crude oil has gone from less than $10 per barrel in March 1999 to the current level in excess of $30 dollars per barrel. It was inevitable that this tripling of prices would add to inflation, as it has done across all EU countries. Needless to say, Finance Ministers do not determine the price of oil on international markets. If Deputies Noonan and McDowell wish to spend the next few months touring OPEC capitals pressing the case for lower <Col N="105" /> oil prices, we will provide whatever assistance is required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be good enough for that journey. However, I must point out that none of the increase in energy prices is due to tax increases. Excise duties on unleaded petrol and diesel remain unchanged in my three budgets to date. As the House is aware, Ireland has some of the lowest fuel prices in Europe.</P>
      <P>Falls in the value of the euro and higher ECB interest rates have also added to inflation. The euro is now down over 20% since its launch. These falls have been unexpected and are adding to inflation.</P>
      <P>Much of our inflation is outside our control. This is not to be complacent but to state reality. In economic and monetary union we no longer have control over interest and exchange rates. Changing circumstances will impact upon our economy and we have to deal with these as best we can. This is the reality of the new environment in which we find ourselves.</P>
      <P>While these external factors are crucial, domestic inflation is also increasing. Services inflation is up almost 7% in the year to August. This reflects, to a large extent, the tightness in the labour market. Alcohol prices are also increasing. These rose by 5%, according to the latest figures. Housing and child care costs are also increasing.</P>
      <P>The Government has acknowledged that the inflation challenge is a pressing one at present. We must always avoid any policies that would push up inflation to unsustainable levels. At the same time, we must be mindful of the problems facing people and businesses behind all the macroeconomic statistics. We have to be careful equally not to withdraw from our electoral and partnership commitments on tax and wages due to a misreading of the economic signals.</P>
      <P>In tackling inflation, the Government is taking account of the role of every aspect of economic policy, from tax to competition, price rules and the labour market. It is clear that the best defence against inflation is an even more open and flexible economy where artificial barriers are minimised. There will always be challenges in sustaining a strong economy and sound finances. These challenges and difficulties should not blind us to the tremendous opportunity we now have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the context in which I will frame December's budget, the fourth of five of this transforming Government. It is the context in which we are addressing the issues of the day such as inflation, transport, child care, tax policy, health and education services. We will keep to our ambition that 80% of taxpayers should pay tax at the standard rate only. With support from the social partners, we are introducing a single standard rate income tax band for all individual taxpayers. This is the type of transformation in people's financial situation and the tax system <Col N="106" /> that the Government is making on the basis of our strong economy.</P>
    <P>In June we announced a package of measures that focused on increasing competition in the domestic economy. These included bringing into force immediately the provisions of the Intoxicating Liquor Act when it was passed by the Dáil in June; the establishment of a Commission on Licensing to consider the issue of further liberalisation of licensing; the imposition of temporary controls on the price of drink to provide breathing space for other measures to take effect &ndash; these are having an impact, for the first time in over two years increases in alcohol prices are below the headline rate; and a freeze on increases in charges or levies by public bodies. Ministers have also had detailed consultation about price developments and competition with representative bodies for the main sectors of the economy. The Government is reviewing the outcome of these consultations.</P>
    <P>Given the Government's concern about profiteering, the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs has been given additional resources to start a vigorous programme of price monitoring and publicity. This will highlight prices and encourage greater price sensitivity by consumers and stimulate competition.</P>
    <P>Regarding the cost of housing, I have stated on a number of occasions that development remains a major economic and social problem. The increases in the cost of housing are unacceptable. As the House is aware, the Government has a number of key objectives in this area. These focus on the need to maximise housing output to meet the continuing strong demand, stop short-term speculation, help first-time buyers enter the market, increase the supply of social and affordable housing and improve the supply of housing related infrastructure.</P>
    <P>A new set of measures was announced last June. These included: an exemption on stamp duty for first-time buyers for second-hand houses up to £150,000; a higher stamp duty rate of 9% for all housing transactions for non-owner occupiers; introduction for three years of an anti-speculative tax of 2% per annum on investors purchasing residential properties for non-owner occupation; the use of strategic development zones to ensure the early development of large-scale residential developments; measures to drive key infrastructural projects, together with targeted investment in key water, sewerage and non-national roads infrastructure; measures to increase the capacity of the construction industry, in particular to address shortages of professional and skilled workers; an additional 1,000 local authority housing units per annum from 2000 to 2006; and improvements to the shared ownership and affordable housing schemes.</P>
    <P>It is too early to gauge the impact of these measures. However, previous measures introduced to increase housing supply are having an impact. More than 46,000 new houses were completed in 1999 &ndash; the highest number in the his<Col N="107" /> tory of the State. House completions to the end of June are 5% higher than for the same period in 1999. This means that more than 130,000 new homes have been completed since this Government took office and this figure will exceed 150,000 by the end of the year more than were completed in the rest of the 1990s.</P>
    <P>Child care costs have also increased significantly in recent years and I have introduced measures to improve the supply and affordability of child care places in the budgets of 1999 and 2000. These measures included capital allowances on the construction, refurbishment or extension of premises to be used for child care purposes and the exemption from tax of any benefit-in-kind arising from the provision of free or subsidised child care by employers for their employees. A major package of initiatives to increase the supply of child care places was introduced in the 2000 budget which cost £46 million. We are also committed to the provision of £250 million in the equal opportunities child care programme of the national development plan. Allied to this expenditure, on 27 June 2000 the Government announced the provision of a further £40 million for child care within an anti-inflationary package. Most importantly, however, the Government is making every effort to sustain the partnership approach which kept inflation low. We are considering what further measures to take in the context of the forthcoming budget while consulting closely with the social partners. I am confident that notwithstanding the unwelcome increase in inflation, we can ensure that the PPF will deliver real improvements in living standards while ensuring we maintain our competitiveness.</P>
    <P>On gainsharing, the Government strongly supports plans to reward employees in ways which will not damage our competitiveness. As the House is aware the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness supports the idea of gainsharing. The agreement states:</P>
    <P>. . . the Government and the social partners acknowledge the role of Employees Share Option Trusts (ESOTs), gainsharing, profit sharing and other financial employee incentives in developing and deepening partnership and in increasing performance and competitiveness. . .</P>
    <P>A consultative committee involving ICTU, IBEC and appropriate Government Departments and agencies has been established to prepare proposals for consideration in the context of the budget of 2001 and it has met five times to date.</P>
    <P>Gainsharing is one of the areas the committee has been considering. The whole area of employee financial participation is a complex one and I await the conclusions of this committee with interest. The new economic environment places particular demands on pay determination in the public sector. Good progress has been made to date in the implementation of the public service element of the pay agreement. The public service <Col N="108" /> benchmarking body has been established well ahead of the schedule envisaged in the agreement. In addition, the public service monitoring group, which will act as a forum for discussions of overarching public service pay issues under the programme, has also been established and begun meeting. The public service modernisation commitments in the programme are also being progressed.</P>
    <P>This Government has a proud record of achievement. We set ourselves ambitious targets and we have delivered. We promised to reduce unemployment. Unemployment has fallen from almost 10% to close to 4%. We promised to deliver real tax reform. In the past three budgets we have introduced the largest tax packages ever. We promised to reduce the national debt. The national debt has fallen from 66% of GDP to 42%. We promised to improve living standards and average household incomes have risen substantially since 1997. We promised to reduce poverty. The numbers in poverty have fallen consistently. In the national development plan we have begun the most ambitious programme of investment in the history of the state.</P>
    <P>We also have a coherent strategy for the new challenges we now face. We have introduced a package of measures to tackle inflation. In tandem with the social partners and in the context of the forthcoming budget we are addressing the current rate of inflation and sustaining social partnership. This Government is committed to improving the provision of child care and reducing the pressures in the housing market and we are taking action to relieve those pressures. The package of measures introduced in June will improve the supply of affordable housing, curb speculative demand and help first-time buyers gain a foothold on the property ladder. To sum up, we have increased standards of living, reduced unemployment, reduced taxation and improved the public finances. We deliver what we promise and will continue to do so in the future.</P>

      <P>It is a great pleasure to be doing battle once more with the Minister on this familiar territory on the first day back. I missed my fix of prudent finances and social partnership in recent months and I am glad that nothing happened over the summer to change the way we look on these things. I look forward to debating these matters with the Minister over the next few months. I was disappointed the Minister finished earlier, as I always think when the Minister does so there is a chance he may take three or four minutes to depart from his script and say something that will land him in trouble for a few months, but unfortunately he did not take that opportunity this evening.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not doubt it. It might be useful if I started with a few facts. People on fixed <Col N="109" /> incomes are worse off now than they were this time last year and people who rely mostly or totally on the State for their living are worse off than they were this time last year. Workers who have obtained pay increases in line with the PPF or Partnership 2000 are worse off this year before tax changes are taken into consideration. Savings are worth relatively less than they were this time last year. Many sections of our people such as those looking for their first house or paying for child care are facing a crisis in their lifestyle which they find very difficult to deal with.</P>
      <P>All of this is happening at a time of unprecedented economic prosperity generally &ndash; during an economic boom now in its seventh year and the likes of which has not happened in Europe for 30 or 40 years. In very simple terms, the less well off in our society are even less well off than they used to be at a time when our capacity to do something about that has not ever been greater. Make no mistake, there is no silver lining for these people. The people I am talking about &ndash; pensioners, the unemployed and low paid workers &ndash; are less well off in absolute terms, but, perhaps even more striking, they are immeasurably less well off in relative terms when their standard of living is set alongside the standard of those who are doing well in a booming economy. These are the victims of inflation &ndash; those with little capacity to help themselves to a larger slice of the national cake. They rely on the Minister and his colleagues to look after their interests and he and his colleagues have failed them badly.</P>
      <P>The Minister believes in trickle down economics, as he is not slow to tell us. He believes that if you are good to the better off, the effects will trickle down to everyone else. Whenever he has had to choose between the interests of the better off and those of everybody else, he has chosen to go with the better off. I believe, and have said repeatedly in the past, that he has pursued a policy of actively encouraging inequality. The effects of that policy have been greatly exacerbated by the presumably unintended effects of inflation. Inflation has made a bad situation worse. Inflation has magnified inequality and has created greater relative poverty. The effects of inflation are even more socially divisive and unequal than the Minister's policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an even greater risk, the risk that we could create an inflationary spiral that will, quite simply, bring the whole house down. Much of our inflation has been caused by import costs and domestic demand. We are not yet in a position in most sectors where domestic costs, for example, wages, are pushing up prices in a big way. Once that starts to happen, the game is up. The economy will crash land and double digit wage increases will be eaten away by double digit inflation, our international competitiveness will be undermined and with it our attractiveness as a location for foreign direct investment. I emphasise we are not there yet and, hopefully, we never will be but we must all, not just Government, be <Col N="110" /> aware of that risk and we must all play our part in ensuring that does not happen.</P>
    <P>There are a few things which we can usefully do this evening. We can look at where we are, why we are here and where we should go from here. This crisis of inflation should not have happened. Not all of it is the Minister's fault and I for one will not pretend that it is, but some of it is his fault and he cannot escape responsibility for that. The exchange rate and the oil price are outside the control of Government but fiscal policy is not and there is no doubt that fiscal policy has contributed in no small way to the situation in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>Last year's budget was recklessly expansionary. It was all the worse because it was also unfair in that it put a lot of extra cash into the pockets of the better off. It was inevitable that the budget would impact on inflation. There is little joy in the politics of &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; but it is not unreasonable on an evening such as this to look at what was being said on this side of the House this time last year. During the roughly equivalent debate on a motion also proposed by Deputy Noonan, I said very deliberately there was not unlimited scope for tax reductions. I said later in the year in this House on at least two occasions before the budget that there was not scope for limitless cuts and that the types of cuts had to be aimed at the less well off. I then published on behalf of my party a pre-budget proposal which would have cost the State a lot less than the proposals ultimately implemented by Government. In one sense, we in Labour were alone in the argument we made. Deputy Noonan, it has to be said, advocated a tax policy which I think he costed at £2 billion and which the Department costed at £2.5 billion, albeit over more than one year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>At the core of the package was a proposal which would have effectively reduced the higher rate of tax by what would then have been 11%. There would still have been a higher rate of tax paid by about 5% of the population but the effect would have been to cut the higher rate of tax to all intents and purposes by 11 percentage points.</P>
      <P>The Minister will also be aware that I was slower than most to make the usual Opposition noises in relation to inflation as no doubt he would have done in Opposition. I did so simply because I was afraid of crying wolf. However, just a few days after last year's budget, with the 3% prediction, I issued a statement in the media to point out what I believed was a significant emerging danger that the Minister would ignore at his peril. I will not go on but the point is that the impact of the budget was predictable and predicted not just by me &ndash; it is not a bolt from the blue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An interesting question is why the Minister and his officials did not predict the effect of what hap<Col N="111" /> pened. The inflation forecast in last year's Budget Statement was 3%. This compares to just over half of that during 1999. On budget day the Minister conceded that the increase in tobacco duties alone would add almost a full percentage point to the headline CPI figure. He asked us then, and as far as I understand still asks us, to believe that leaving that measure aside, there would be little or no additional impact on inflation from last year's budget. If that is the contention, then this is a proposition of near revolutionary proportions.</P>
    <P>Are the Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance seriously telling us that they never thought that the most expansionary budget in recent times would have an effect on inflation? I listened to this Minister when in Opposition attacking a budget introduced by his predecessor as grossly inflationary. This was not just a passing theme in one speech &ndash; this was a constant mantra constantly uttered by the Minister when in Opposition. I suggest that he might go back and have a look at some of those speeches because I suspect they would put even his legendary hard neck under a good deal of pressure and this, incidentally, in the face of budgets which introduced tax reductions and spending increases which were extremely modest by the standards of the Minister's efforts in recent years and, most particularly, his efforts last year.</P>
    <P>I have also been told by Department of Finance officials &ndash; many others in this House have had this experience &ndash; that this proposal or that could not be countenanced because of its likely effect on inflation. I do not blame them for that because, in a sense, that is their job but how does this sit with the prediction in last year's budget that the most expansionary budget in recent memory would have no effect whatever on inflation? Is the Minister seriously telling us that he believes that fiscal policy is so essentially unimportant that it will not impact on inflation? Is he telling us now with the benefit of hindsight that last year's budget had no effect on inflation? Is he telling us that he believes that priming the pump, and the pump of the better off in particular, in such a dramatic way would make no difference at a time when retail spending was running at four times the then rate of inflation? Is he telling us now that he believed it was clearly right at that time to cut taxes just as interest rates had been halved and consumer borrowing had gone through the roof? If so, the Minister is almost alone in that belief.</P>
    <P>In recent years all of us in this House have become familiar with the so-called small regional economy argument. It is a very seductive argument, not least I suppose for politicians. The argument goes that since we are an open, trade-oriented economy without an independent monetary policy most of our inflation is imported. I accept, as I think Deputy Noonan does, most of the thrust of this argument. I accept that external factors, which for so long acted as a break on inflation, are now having exactly the opposite <Col N="112" /> effect but that does not excuse the Minister for the misuse of the instruments which are available to him, nor does it excuse or explain his apparent belief that last year's budget was broadly neutral when all and sundry, including the Central Bank and the European Commission, clearly believed the opposite. It does not explain why the Minister took nearly six months to acknowledge that his target would not be met and a further three months before the forecast was formally changed. Even now few people believe that the new target of 5% will be met even if the various caveats are taken into account.</P>
    <P>The Minister's response in the face of the deepening problem has in itself become part of the problem. At first he refused to acknowledge what everyone else knew was a blinding reality. Despite the ignominious <i>dénouement </i>of his 1999 budget, the Minister not only failed to acknowledge that he might have got it wrong, he invited the country to party and described those who sounded a warning note as left-wing pinkos, which, incidentally, I gather is something the Minister regards as a bad thing, although we would have to disagree on that. He gradually became more defensive in trying to explain away what was happening until the trade union movement and, indeed, his colleagues finally forced him to admit that it had all gone horribly wrong.</P>
    <P>The effect of this is, or was, twofold. In the first instance, the Minister recklessly stoked the fire, but more recently he has given the impression that the fire is so hopelessly out of control that there is nothing that can be done about it. Nothing could be further from the truth &ndash; there is a great deal which Government can do but there is no quick fix.</P>
    <P>Times have never been better for corporate Ireland. Corporate profits are at record levels. Corporation tax is in the course of a dramatic reduction as a result of what is effectively all party agreement and that guarantees low tax on profits into the future. Demand, both domestic and external, has rarely been stronger. I say unreservedly that this is a good thing. We all celebrate the success of Irish business and foreign businesses based here. They are the powerhouse of our economy and we depend on the wealth generated by business to provide the goods and services on which we depend. All the more reason then why we are entitled to take issue when there is clear evidence of profiteering, and there is such evidence. There is evidence that some businesses and professionals are charging more for the simple reason that consumers are willing to pay more. This is clearly happening in the catering and building trades and other services such as hairdressing. In the short-term we must all make it clear we are not prepared to tolerate profiteering of this kind. If that does not work the Government should act to control prices.</P>
    <P>Price controls can only be short-term. In the final analysis supply must be increased to meet demand. In many instances this will happen quickly enough. Where the demand for goods <Col N="113" /> and services can be met by imports then clearly there will be little or no problem. However, a real problem arises in cases where it is difficult to get into the domestic market quickly. It goes without saying there is no objective reason to maintain regulatory constraints on supply in sectors where demand is not being met. We must have regard for the interests of those who may have borrowed heavily to get into the existing market. However, the market exists for the benefit of the consumer and suppliers and not for one to the exclusion of the other.</P>
    <P>The motion calls for non-inflationary gain-sharing, with which neither I nor my party has a problem. The advantages of this approach are obvious in that it gives workers a stake in their place of work, it allows a mechanism by which companies can control costs in times of difficulty without cutting basic wages and it allows the country a mechanism to maintain competitiveness in the face of an unfavourable exchange rate. We have always supported these measures and will continue to do so. However, I would enter one significant caveat in that gain-sharing or profit-sharing arrangements should be company wide and not targeted or targetable at a small, select number of workers in any company. It is important that they are an established part of the partnership process and not simply an easy way of rewarding particularly favoured workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be frank and open about fuel prices. I acknowledge what the Minister said, that we have low fuel prices by comparison with the rest of Europe. However, there is an issue which has not been mentioned so far in this debate and which few have been happy to mention elsewhere, namely, the use of environmental or carbon taxes as an environmental measure. I am something of a sceptic on these issues. We would need to pitch increases in excise duties or VAT on fuel at quite a high level before they would have any perceptible impact on the use of fuel and, therefore, on the environment. To that extent I remain to be convinced. However, we have to acknowledge this debate and acknowledge, for example, that the Government will, as part of its Kyoto target plan, look to increase taxes on fuel. We also have to acknowledge that some people, such as the Green Party, hold the view that we should increase taxes on fossil fuels as an environmental measure. I have an open mind on this matter but I am somewhat sceptical. We have to be very conscious that if we go down the road of reducing excise duty or VAT on fuel we might as well kiss goodbye to that argument. I am unwilling to do so for the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps we are in a uniquely beneficial situation in that we can look at the experience of other countries and see whether price increases have <Col N="114" /> the required effect in terms of demand and environmental protection and then make our own judgments. However, if we move decisively in the opposite direction now and subsidise oil prices we would effectively be saying goodbye to that argument and I would be very unwilling to do so, at least at this stage.</P>
    <P>We are at a dangerous time in economic terms. Last week's opinion polls testified to the fact that we have a deeply unpopular Government. Fianna Fail's core vote at 34% is at a very low level for a party of its size and tradition. The temptation for the Minister and, I suppose, the Tánaiste is to up the ante on this front and seek to rescue the Government with one probably popular budget, a give-away if one likes. I do not think that will work politically and it would certainly be economically disastrous. The priorities for the upcoming budget must be people on social welfare, pensions and low pay. The ESRI suggested that no tax cuts should be granted but I do not agree. The Government is already damaged in the eyes of the social partners. It has entered into an agreement which must be honoured. On the tax side of that agreement the Government should do as we suggested last year and seek to remove as much of the minimum wage from the tax net as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister is fond of saying he has always believed in something. He is fond of taking credit for being one of the few in Fianna Fáil to resist the temptation of the 1977 tax give-away which eventually brought that Government to power. I am sorry the Minister is not in the House to answer the question but I wonder if he will be as resolute in resisting the temptation when he is the one with the purse strings in his hands.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy McDowell for sharing time. I wish to speak about the facts of life for those for whom inflation is a most serious matter, a matter of whether one can afford to be properly nourished, kept warm for the winter, pay one's rent and keep a roof over one's head. I am referring to those on basic social welfare incomes and on low pay for whom increases in inflation make a real difference as to whether they can make ends meet at the end of the week. I am talking about people living on £11.07 per day which is what those on disability allowance, unemployment assistance and other basic social welfare payments live on. When these people received their increase in May their payments went up to the miserly sum of £77.50 per week or £11.07 per day.</P>

    <P>It is no harm to reflect on what it means to live on £11.07 per day. I am sorry the Ministers for Finance and Social, Community and Family Affairs are not in the House because I wonder how much time they spend reflecting on what that is like. I am one of the many people who do a weekly shop in a supermarket and £77.50 does not go very far. That is just on weekly shopping. These people also have to set money aside to pay for fuel, rent, mortgages, electricity and so on. We <Col N="115" /> need to focus on what these people contend with and to understand that, for them, inflation means making choices between nourishing food, fuel to keep warm, paying rent or running into debt with local authorities. The items which have increased in price for such people are bread, milk, meat &ndash; bacon went up 10% in the first six months of this year &ndash; sausages, fruit and vegetables, breakfast cereals, fuel and light and medicines. All these items make a real impact on the lives of the people living on the lowest incomes and in real poverty.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it has been debated to any great extent but one issue on which we need to reflect is that, until recently, food inflation tended to be lower than national inflation, but this has changed. This change has made a significant difference to the lives of those people to whom I am referring. About 50% of our food and almost all our detergents are imported and are greatly affected by the exchange rate with sterling. These items matter if one is poor or trying to balance these kinds of issues in one's daily life where one cannot afford luxuries. We must address these issues if inequality is not to increase in this hugely rich and successful economy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Broughan called for a new social welfare Bill. The Ministers for Finance and Social, Community and Family Affairs should put their minds to such a Bill. Whatever happens in the budget we will not have increases until April in terms of the regular social welfare increases. If this year is anything to go by, child benefit will not increase until September next year and a large number of children are living in poverty.</P>
    <P>I wish to address these basic aspects of this debate. I am referring to people whose incomes went up by £4 per week this year and for whom the impact of inflation is real and immediate. This impact has not been properly reflected upon in this House.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Kerry Airport has proved to be a major success and is now playing a very significant and vital role in the economic and social life of Kerry. Its board of directors includes representatives of all the main corporate and public bodies in the county under the leadership and direction of Kerry Group. There was serious concern over the summer months in Kerry regarding the future viability of Kerry Airport following statements from Aer Lingus that it was considering withdrawing its service from Kerry Airport to Dublin. This concern resulted in a widespread public campaign which included the three local authorities of Tralee, Killarney, Listowel, as well as the Tralee and Killarney Chambers of Commerce and the Kerry branch of the Irish Hotels Feder<Col N="116" /> ation. The campaign included a meeting with the Minister on 12 September, at which five Kerry Dáil Deputies, a Senator, representatives of the three local authorities, business and tourism interests in the county were present. At that meeting it was forcibly pointed out that any downgrading of the air service to Kerry would have serious consequences in terms of attracting investment and tourists into the county. It would lead to a general perception of Kerry as an isolated, inaccessible and difficult location in which to do business, as it would greatly increase the time and cost of travel within the EU for potential customers, specialist maintenance and other critical staff.</P>
      <P>In addition, it was pointed out to the Minister that many people who use the service are receiving medical treatment in Dublin. If the present level of service is not retained and improved, it will be an infliction of further discomfort and suffering on those people who will have to make a five-hour journey to Dublin by train or road.</P>
      <P>Today &ndash; I hope it was not a coincidence but if it was I welcome it &ndash; Aer Lingus announced that it is now tendering for the service of the Kerry-Dublin route. This follows an internal study by Aer Lingus which demonstrated that the Kerry-Dublin route had a commercial basis and would give a commercial return. The revised public service obligation for the Dublin-Kerry route, published recently, provides for a welcome expansion of the service. The service must be operated at the rate of at least three return trips per day, seven days per week. A minimum of 150 seats per day each way to and from Kerry to Dublin, that is, a minimum of 300 seats in both directions must be provided seven days per week. The flight schedules must include an early morning flight from Kerry to Dublin and a late evening flight from Dublin to Kerry to enable passengers on business trips to make a round trip within the day. A range of fares may be applied subject to at least 60 seats per day each way to and from Kerry to Dublin being available at a return fare of £87 or 110 or lower and a minimum return fare of £97 or 123 in respect of a maximum of 60 seats per day each way to and from Kerry to Dublin. This is very welcome.</P>
      <P>The scenario as outlined in the communication will result in the provision of three flights from Kerry and a £1.05 million subsidy from 2001. At present 78,000 passengers use the service. With three flights, this should increase over 18 months to 110,000. This should prove very attractive to Aer Lingus, and if they can reduce their overnight cost and other overheads then the route from Dublin to Kerry should become very profitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of Kerry Airport is critical for the future prosperity of County Kerry. It is the most peripheral county in Ireland, with inferior access roads, such as the N69. It has a most inconsistent rail service because of the quality of the line from Mallow to Tralee. Admittedly, this will now be improved somewhat because of <Col N="117" /> recent upgrading. We have no sea port to bring in ferry traffic, except for the Tarbert-Killimer ferry which brings people from Kerry to Clare and back. The continuation and improvement of our airport service is critical for the entire region. I appreciate that there is a commitment to providing financial support for regional airports in the national development plan. This commitment must be delivered on if Kerry Airport is to compete for passengers and other business with the Aer Rianta supported airports of Shannon and Cork. I appeal to the Minister to do everything possible to make the tender very attractive to Aer Lingus and also to plough further money into Kerry Airport to improve the facilities at the airport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to address the House on the subject of the air service between Kerry and Dublin. I compliment Deputy Deenihan on raising this important issue of Kerry Airport.</P>
      <P>The Kerry-Dublin air service is operated under a public service obligation, known as a PSO, in accordance with EU Regulation 2408/92. It will assist the debate if I explain briefly the background to the operation of the PSO regime.</P>
      <P>The aviation market in Europe is now fully liberalised, and it is a matter for airlines to decide which routes they will operate. However, this liberalisation was accompanied by a right for member states to impose a public service obligation when it considers that a particular route, which is not considered commercially viable by the airlines, is vital for the economic development of a region. The member state may specify minimum standards to be met on the PSO route, for example, in relation to the number of seats offered, frequencies and fares. The choice of PSO routes and the standards imposed are subject to the control of the EU Commission. Because PSOs are an exception to the rules governing the liberalised aviation market, Regulation 2408/92 sets down procedures which must be followed in the selection, operation and administration of PSO routes, and these procedures are supervised by the Commission.</P>
      <P>In summary, if no carrier is willing to provide a service to the standards specified in a PSO on a commercial basis, access to that route is confined to a single carrier for three years and that carrier must be selected following a tendering procedure involving all interested airlines. The route must be re-tendered at the end of each three-year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the Kerry-Dublin route, two daily flights from Kerry to Dublin are currently operated by Aer Lingus under a PSO. Aer Lingus won the competition on this route when it was last put out to tender in 1997 and its contract expires in January 2001. The terms of that contract were for two flights daily with a minimum of 200 seats per day offered on the route &ndash; 100 in each direction &ndash; and the PSO standards specified <Col N="118" /> that a pressurised aircraft must be used on the route.</P>
    <P>The Department of Public Enterprise is now engaged on the obligatory re-tendering process for an air carrier on the Kerry-Dublin route. This followed a period of consultation with the EU Commission during which Departmental officials were able to satisfy the Commission of the continuing need for the Kerry-Dublin PSO. However, because of the success of the Kerry-Dublin PSO and the clear benefits for tourism and business interests in the Kerry region, the Minister for Public Enterprise decided that the standards governing this route should be increased compared to the current operation. She was also able to secure Commission approval for this. The improved standards will see three daily return flights on the Kerry-Dublin route and the minimum seat capacity will be increased by 50% to 300 seats. As is the case at present, there is nothing to prevent the air carrier providing capacity above the minimum requirement if circumstances warrant such increases. In addition, we are maintaining the requirement for a pressurised aircraft to be used on the route.</P>
    <P>Deputies will see, therefore, that the Minister for Public Enterprise has been successful in ensuring a much improved air service between Kerry and Dublin.</P>
    <P>The new PSO standards were published by the Commission in the EU Official Journal on 15 September, while the invitation to airlines to tender for the Kerry-Dublin route was published on 16 September. Interested air carriers have until 17 October to submit their bids to the Department and it is open to all airlines to participate in this process. In accordance with Regulation 2408/92, copies of the tender submission must be sent to the EU Commission and a period of two months must elapse before any selection is made.</P>
    <P>Among other measures which this Government is pursuing to assist the regional airports, including Kerry Airport, is that over the past four years, the Minister for Public Enterprise allocated £300,000 per annum to assist Kerry Airport's marketing and promotional efforts, and this was increased by 50% to £450,000 in the current year. In addition, a sum of £3 million is included in the national development plan for the two regional airports, Kerry and Waterford, in the south and east regions. These funds will be devoted to providing assistance for incremental infrastructural improvement works and upgrades in facilities to maintain continued safe and viable operation of these airports.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise is deeply conscious of the importance of a high standard scheduled air service to Dublin for the Kerry region and this has guided her in her decision to increase substantially the level of service on the route. We are confident that significant benefits, both for business and tourism interests in Kerry, will flow from the improved level of access that will pertain when the new service becomes established early in the new year.</P>

    <Col N="119" />
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Chair for the opportunity to raise this issue. The Irish Medicines Board has recommended to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development a number of changes in the classification of animal vaccines. The principal change proposed which has given rise to considerable concern among farmers is that all vaccines for ruminant animals should be classified as prescription only. This would mean that the substantial number of licensed merchants who now supply these medications to farmers would no longer be permitted to do so, sources of supply to farmers would be seriously restricted, competition in the trade would be sharply reduced and there would be a considerable danger of a large price increase, similar to that which happened in the UK when a similar measure was applied in that country.</P>
      <P>I asked the Irish Medicines Board for the reasons behind its recommendation. Specifically, I asked for information on any studies or reports that might have led to the recommendation. I want to compliment, and record my gratitude to, Dr. Hallinin, the chief executive of the Irish Medicines Board, who replied to my query within a week. I wish that all organisations in the public sector would be that prompt in their replies. I also thank Dr. Hallinin for the comprehensive nature of his reply, a model of clarity which I wish the rest of the public sector could imitate.</P>
      <P>The reply gave me the clear impression that there were no studies or reports of the kind which I suspected might be there. The principal part of the reply read as follows:</P>
      <P>The scientific principle needed to be applied at all times. Each decision to vaccinate an animal required that the animal be healthy and free of concurrent disease. It was difficult to establish how this could be achieved unless under veterinary control. Furthermore, given the fact that vaccines can rapidly lose their potency under adverse heat conditions and poor hygiene, and that untrained personnel are unlikely to have a proper understanding of the factors affecting the antigenic activity of the products, it would be difficult to justify the absence of veterinary prescriptions for most products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would consider the remainder of the IMB reply to be pure bureaucracy and I will not detain the House with it. The kernel of the IMB's case, which I have quoted, totally ignores the fact that licensed merchants must satisfy the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development as to the training of their personnel in courses approved by the Department. They are obliged to have premises with facilities for the proper storage of the products, with proper refrigeration facilities and with facilities for the rotation of stock, and they must keep proper records on entries, stocks and disposal of the products. All <Col N="120" /> that is done under the supervision of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
    <P>Licensed merchants advise farmers on the proper use and storage of the products. As I am sure the two Ministers of State opposite will agree, no farmer will go to the expense of buying vaccines and either not storing them properly or not using them properly. It would be nonsense, as the two Ministers of State will know, to require, for example, that a dairy farmer who fears the onset of mastitis would feel he had to call in a vet in every case, and that is what is being proposed by the IMB. The IMB has not been able to point to any human health or animal health problem or, indeed, any evidence of misuse in any way of the products in question.</P>
    <P>The final part of the IMB's reply seems to me to be one to which the Minister should pay particular attention. It states that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development was free to accept or otherwise the proposed category of supply as a result of other considerations such as economic factors which are outside this board's remit.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to operate on the basis of that invitation, ignore this advice on the basis of practical everyday farming common sense, and allow farmers and their suppliers of medicines to get on with their business in peace without this unnecessary proposed bureaucratic intervention.</P>
    <P>
      <b>

    </P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. N. O'Keeffe): I congratulate Deputy Dukes on his appointment as Fine Gael spokesperson on agriculture. He will be like a breath of fresh air and of course he will be very combative as Opposition spokesperson. I wish him well.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the veterinary medicines industry is regulated under a comprehensive body of national legislation which is ultimately rooted in European law. A detailed approval and regulatory framework for veterinary medicines and vaccines has been developed at EU level over the past two decades, which member states are obliged to implement uniformly in the interests of the proper functioning of the internal market. The primary objective of this legislation is the protection of human health. By definition, this is also a complex area which is inextricably linked with technological developments in the pharmaceutical area and the product of research and development by pharmaceutical companies.</P>
    <P>Consumers rightly expect that the food which they eat will be safe and wholesome. They equally expect that those charged with responsibility for the protection of public health will put in place and maintain systems and regimes which will ensure that this will be the case. We are all aware that Ireland is uniquely dependent on export markets for our agricultural output. It follows that in order to command consumer confi<Col N="121" /> dence, both at home and on export markets, our regulatory and control environment must be on a par with the very best.</P>
    <P>My Department has given a high priority in recent years to ensuring that the highest possible standards are applied to our agriculture, food and related industries. In the veterinary medicines area, there is in place a modern and comprehensive body of legislation based on the Animal Remedies Act, 1993. This Act has provided a basis for more detailed provisions, in particular the Animal Remedies Regulations, 1996. I am proud of the sustained efforts which my Department have made over recent years in giving full effect to this legislation and in addressing unacceptable practices in this area. At the most extreme end of the spectrum, the Department's success in this regard is evidenced by the number of successful prosecutions taken in the courts.</P>
    <P>Since 1996, with the coming into effect of the Animal Remedies Regulations, my Department has assumed statutory responsibility for licensing veterinary vaccines. This had hitherto been the responsibility of the then Department of Health under the Therapeutic Substances Act, 1932. With developments in EU legislation over the past number of years, the approval systems which were the basis for licences issued under the Therapeutic Substances Act, 1932, no longer met EU requirements. Consequently, it was necessary to review all vaccines currently licensed on the Irish market in the context of the current EU regulatory environment and with specific regard to the routes of supply of such vaccines.</P>
    <P>There is an inter-agency involvement in the current licensing regime for veterinary vaccines. This involves my Department and the Irish Medicines Board. As provided for in the relevant legislation, the IMB carries out the detailed examination of application dossiers submitted by applicant companies. The requirements imposed under the relevant legislation for establishing the quality, safety and efficacy of individual vaccines are quite onerous and result in voluminous application dossiers which require expert examination.</P>
    <P>Having completed its technical examination of an application dossier, the IMB must make a formal recommendation to my Department on the grant or otherwise of a licence, including the conditions to be attached to a licence. These conditions will include the route of supply. The final decision on licensing rests with my Department, as competent licensing authority.</P>
    <P>I understand that the IMB made an announcement earlier this year outlining its general approach in terms of recommending to my Department what the appropriate routes of supply should be for categories of vaccines. The IMB is, of course, perfectly entitled to outline its thinking in the matter but, as I have said, statutory responsibility for the final determination in each case rests with my Department.</P>
    <P>In approaching the issue of supply routes, my Department does not have a general policy to exclude any particular part of the commercial sec<Col N="122" /> tor which is provided for and appropriately licensed under the legislation. While this has been made clear to a number of concerned parties, I am not sure that this message is as yet fully understood. I want, therefore, to repeat that my Department will look at each case on its merits and in reaching its decisions will have regard to all relevant and valid considerations relating to routes of supply.</P>
    <P>My Department's decisions will be made in the interests of public health and will take account of animal health and welfare considerations and relevant legislative and technical requirements, including the criteria outlined in the Animal Remedies Act, 1993, and, in particular, the Animal Remedies Regulations, 1996. These criteria are comprehensive and cover aspects such as risk to the consumer, the person administering the substance, the animal, or the environment. Aspects such as the need for a prior diagnosis, special storage conditions and professional advice are also among the criteria covered. As Deputies would expect, my Department will have careful regard to the IMB's recommendations in each case and decisions will be taken on a case by case basis. To suggest, however, that henceforth all vaccines will be licensed for supply only through veterinary surgeons and pharmacists would be to misunderstand and misrepresent the position.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Dukes for raising this important matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a broad range of circumstances in which cars used by members of the Garda Síochána in the performance of their duties should be exempt from the speed limits prescribed under the road traffic Acts. Gardaí in pursuit of the perpetrators of crime, gardaí attempting to prevent the commission of a crime, gardaí in pursuit of subversives, gardaí seeking to prevent a prison break-out or to recapture an absconding prisoner or gardaí going to the scene of a serious accident and many other circumstances not only permit but require gardaí to exceed speed limits. It is also accepted that gardaí appointed to drive ministerial cars may exceed the speed limit where reasons of State require them to do so. It is true, but regrettable, that the heavy schedule of Ministers in successive Governments frequently requires that they travel at speed from one location to another and the Garda driver, acting in the course of his duty, is exempt from the speed limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike some of those who made public comment, I will not criticise the Minister for the use <Col N="123" /> by members of his family of the State car allocated to him. There are sound security reasons why the Taoiseach and Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or indeed other Government Ministers may permit the use of their car to transport spouses and children which may not be properly understood by the general public. However, unless the family members being carried in the State car are under a real threat or very exceptional circumstances have arisen, there is no justification for the car in which they are passengers exceeding speed limits imposed by the road traffic Acts.</P>
    <P>I asked yesterday morning, Sir, that this issue be dealt with on the Adjournment tonight because at that time I knew that the car assigned to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform had been pursued as a result of its travelling at 90 miles per hour. I understood that when pursued it had travelled at speeds up to 115 miles per hour. Yesterday morning the Minister refused to state the destination of the car, the passengers in it or the circumstances which compelled the car to travel at such speed. Later yesterday the Minister allowed himself to be interviewed by Radio Kerry. During that interview he came across as evasive and economical with the truth. It was not until 5.45 p.m. yesterday, under pressure in an RTE radio interview, that he admitted his State car was stopped when his wife and children and an unidentified family friend were in the car travelling home from an All-Ireland Hurling Final in Croke Park. He rather curiously stated that &ldquo;it appeared&rdquo; he was not in the car, as if uncertain. He has yet to clarify exactly when this incident occurred and whether his State car has been involved in a short period in more than one such incident.</P>
    <P>Last evening the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform apologised for the incident that he discussed. He should also apologise to this House for his going into hiding for almost 48 hours on this issue, following publication on Saturday evening of the first edition of the <i>Sunday World.</i> He should apologise for his evasiveness and refusal to explain fully the background circumstances. If the Minister had issued a comprehensive explanatory statement early on Sunday morning and assured the general public that State cars would not in future, in such circumstances, exceed the speed limit, that might have been an end of the issue. Instead, he chose to treat the matter as if it was some type of official secret and that national security would be imperilled if he told the full story.</P>
    <P>His failure to be up front about the excessively speeding State car became a Fianna Fáil political mystery. His behaviour during Sunday and most of Monday exposes as shallow political rhetoric Fianna Fáil's professed commitment to a new openness and transparency.</P>
    <P>On average 400 people lose their lives on our roads every year and the majority do so as a consequence of vehicles travelling at excessive speed. <Col N="124" /> The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, is one of the members of the Government centrally involved in the latest road safety campaign and initiatives. One of the central messages of the campaign is that speed kills. The Minister built his political reputation, when in Opposition, with the much-repeated soundbite commitment to zero tolerance. By the manner in which he has dealt with this issue the Minister has yet again shown zero confidence. It took almost 48 hours of relentless publicity and questioning to force the Minister out into the open and to verbally bludgeon him into acknowledging that it was unacceptable that his State car, in the circumstances now known, should travel at such excessive speed. It is also unacceptable that his apology was half-hearted and that he felt the need to explain confusingly that not only are Garda drivers expertly trained to travel at such speeds but that also his driver, on the night in question, did not realise he was travelling so fast until he heard the siren of the Garda patrol in hot pursuit.</P>
    <P>The Minister, by his approach to this issue in the past two days, lacks credibility as one of those fronting the Government's road safety campaign and his professed commitment to zero tolerance in the eyes of many people lies in tatters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already acknowledged publicly that the broad outline of what has been carried in the media about this matter is correct. It would appear from the detail in the original newspaper article that it refers to an incident where the Garda car allocated to me was travelling on the Abbeyfeale to Castleisland road on 10 September when, sometime after midnight &ndash; that is early on the morning of 11 September &ndash; it was stopped by the Garda for exceeding the speed limit. According to the official Garda report supplied to me this afternoon the speed detected was 86 miles per hour.</P>
      <P>I have openly made it known that the passengers in the car were my wife and children along with a family friend, all of whom were returning from Dublin, where they had spent the day with me attending the All-Ireland Hurling Final. I have stated publicly also that while I was not in the car myself on that occasion &ndash; because I had to remain in Dublin for business reasons &ndash; I nevertheless accept responsibility for what happened. I have said that I very much regret what happened and I now do so again in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be all too easy for me to seek to disown responsibility in relation to an incident of speeding over which I had no personal control. I am not a member of an Administration that believes in seeking heads on plates to avoid taking their own political responsibility. I am conscious too, as I am sure are many other Members, of the loyal and dedicated service given by Garda ministerial drivers through the years. For people to seek to claim that an incident of unwarranted speeding by a Garda driver has implications for the formulation or advancement of Government <Col N="125" /> policy, is to stand commonsense on its head and to enter the realms of the absurd.</P>
    <P>Driving at unwarranted speed, no matter who is driving or being driven, is a serious matter and it is perfectly understandable, when an incident like this comes to public notice, that the matter should be the subject of adverse public comment and also the subject of discussion in this House. What is less understandable, however, is the pretence that this was an incident which was totally without precedent. As anybody on the other side of the House who has had the privilege of being in the Cabinet will know, occasions can and do arise where ministerial cars exceed the speed limit. Anybody over there who wants to pretend that this practice only started when this Government came into office is fooling nobody, least of all the public we serve.</P>
    <P>I am acknowledging that this was not the only occasion on which my car was stopped. I am also saying, in no uncertain terms, that other Ministers in the past, including Justice Ministers, have been stopped and that some of them have certainly been stopped more than once.</P>
    <P>I sincerely doubt if there is a party in the House which can claim that none of its Ministers ever had the experience of being stopped in their official cars for exceeding the speed limit. Ex-Ministers in the Opposition benches know this to be true. Many others in the Opposition benches also know it to be true.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter has not had the privilege or experience of being a Minister but if he has a word, privately, with ex-Ministers in his own party &ndash; some of whom, incidentally, retained their official transport when they left office, for which I believe there were valid reasons &ndash; they will put him wise to the fact that they too were stopped for speeding from time to time.</P>
    <P>I have resisted the temptation to ask the Garda for the details as regards speeding involving former Ministers because, quite frankly, they have better things to do with their time than assist the process of political mud slinging.</P>
    <P>Although I have put the facts into the public domain in this case as quickly as I could, there are some people, including Deputy Shatter apparently, who feel that I should have done so immediately the matter received some publicity. As I explained in a radio interview yesterday, I had the difficulty of trying to reconcile the date cited in the media &ndash; 6-7 September &ndash; with the facts. The incident occurred on the morning of 11 September, not on 6 or 7 September. In addition, according to the information in the media report, the garda who stopped the car believed that I was a passenger in the car. I am now certain, however, that this was not the case and I am informed by the Garda authorities that the garda in question cannot say who was in the car.</P>
    <P>I had to have facts before I went public and I make no apology for doing the necessary checks. All Ministers and ex-Ministers are well aware of the risks of making public statements when there <Col N="126" /> is disagreement or confusion about the basic facts. It should be pointed out that people in south Kerry are not fortunate enough to obtain a copy of the <i>Sunday World</i> on Saturday night &ndash; we get it on Sunday morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the legal position in general, my advice is that ministerial cars are Garda cars driven by Garda drivers who have completed special advanced driving courses. The Garda authorities are responsible for the maintenance and operation of the cars. I am also advised that &ldquo;vehicles used by members of the Garda Síochána in the performance of their duties as such members&rdquo; are specifically excepted by regulation from the speed limits prescribed. This is done pursuant to section 46 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, which provides that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government may prescribe by regulation speed limits and such regulations may provide for exceptions to those limits. It is not for me, of course, to decide how the law should or should not be applied in any particular case.</P>
      <P>Much has been made of the fact that the car was being used on 11 September not by me but by members of my family. Again, Deputies know there is nothing unusual in this. They know that State cars are available to the users on a 24 hour per day basis and that it has been the case, historically, that they may be used for both official and private purposes. In this regard it is interesting to look at the Official Report of the Dáil. In answer to a parliamentary question on 10 December 1970, the then Minister stated that an official car is placed at the disposal of a Minister for use as if the car were his own private property, which has been the rule continuously since 1940.</P>
      <P>Deputies also know, or at least should know, that since 1979 the availability of an official car for private use by Ministers has specifically been taken into account by the review body on higher remuneration in the public sector in its recommendations on the appropriate levels of remuneration for the office holder concerned.</P>
      <P>The matter of private use of ministerial cars has been the subject of a force directive by the Garda Commissioner. The directive states: &ldquo;Carriage of civilian passengers in official vehicles is prohibited except in the following circumstances.&rdquo;. A number of circumstances are cited, including: &ldquo;Conveyance of persons in official vehicles allocated to ministerial fleet, VIPs and to senior Garda officers with the authorisation of Minister, VIP or senior Garda officer to whom the vehicle is allocated.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="127" /> If the Deputies believe that this should be changed, by all means let them say so. However, they cannot blame me or anybody else for the fact that they never saw the merit in changing the rules about private use of ministerial cars when they were in office and they cannot now proceed to claim the high moral ground because I have used official transport in the same way they did. I have been more sparing in the use of official cars than were most of them when in office.</P>
    <P>With regard to the public contributions of Opposition Deputies, the comments which will strike most people for the humbug they amount to are those in which Deputy Shatter sought to make play on the fact that, as Minister, I have taken a firm policy on crime. I make no apology to Deputy Shatter for this. My policies have seen the previous years of neglect finally addressed. What for example, did the party of which the Deputy is a member do about the scandal of the so-called revolving door syndrome in our prisons when his party was in office?</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for attending this debate and the Chair for allowing me to raise the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company decided last year to enter into an arrangement with a private company for the construction and <Col N="129" /> management of a new marina at Dún Laoghaire harbour. As part of that arrangement, Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company proposes to transfer control of the boatyard to the private company concerned. This means that the many existing users of the boatyard will have to deal in future not with the State-owned Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company but with the private marina company.</P>
    <P>Many assurances were given by Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company that charges will not be increased and that existing users will continue to be accommodated. However, these assurances do not satisfy the existing users of the boatyard for a number of reasons. First, the transfer of control of the boatyard from the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company to the marina company represents a fundamental and unjustifiable change for the local users of the boatyard and for the coal harbour area in general. The boatyard is a relatively small space. It is already stretched to serve the existing needs of the present users of the harbour. When the new marina comes into operation and the marina users have the right to use this small space, it will overstretch its capacity. Giving control of the boatyard to the marina company means that over time the marina company will inevitably give preference to its clients and not to the general public. Inevitably, too, charges will go up and, as the Coal Harbour Users' Group has been told, market forces will dictate the level of charge.</P>
    <P>The people of Dún Laoghaire feel strongly about this issue. There might be different opinions in Dún Laoghaire about the proposed arena, the traffic it will generate and whether it should be developed by the harbour company or by a private company, but there is virtual unanimity on the subject of the boatyard. That unanimity was expressed at a huge public meeting in the Boylan community centre last Wednesday which unanimously passed a motion calling on the Minister to intervene and to ensure that control of the boatyard is retained by the State-owned harbour company.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the board of the company should not underestimate the strength of feeling on this issue in Dún Laoghaire. Local people will use every legitimate means to defend their rights to this public facility which they have enjoyed for generations. I believe the harbour company made a mistake in proposing to hand over control of the boatyard to a private company. It should correct that mistake by renegotiating its arrangement with the marina company and taking back control of the boatyard. In entering this arrangement with the marina company, Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company is in breach of the Harbours Act, 1996. Section 12 of that Act sets out the general duties of a harbour company and makes it clear that harbour companies are required to have regard to the environment, heritage, traditions and users of a harbour. In transferring the boatyard to a private company, Dún Laoghaire <Col N="130" /> Harbour Company clearly did not have such regard.</P>
    <P>If the harbour company does not change its position, the Minister should use his powers under the 1996 Act to direct the company to do so. I call on the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to intervene in this dispute, to meet the Coal Harbour Users' Group and direct the Dún Laoghaire Company to renegotiate the arrangement it has made with the private marina company and ensure that control of the boatyard is retained in public control and management.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gilmore for raising this issue and making his points well. I am pleased also to have the opportunity to outline some of the facts.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, met representatives of the Coal Harbours Users Group in May this year. On foot of that meeting, the Coal Harbours Users Group met Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company to discuss its concerns regarding the coal harbour and boatyard. Following the meeting the harbour company detailed the position on the future management of the boatyard.</P>
      <P>There is no basis for the proposition that unfettered control of the boatyard is being ceded. On the contrary, the rights of existing users are protected and guaranteed by the imposition of a number of conditions in contractual agreements with Marina Marketing and Management Limited, the company which has the operating franchise for the marina being developed in the harbour. I will list the principal conditions. First, only the boatyard will be managed by the marina operator. The rest of the coal harbour, including all its boat moorings, will continue to be managed by the harbour company.</P>
      <P>The boatyard, which covers an area of 1.45 acres and is situated in the coal harbour area, is used for summer and winter storage of boats. Some boat repair work is also carried out there. At any time there are approximately 120 to 140, mainly small boats, stored in the boatyard of which approximately 80 are paying customers. Total revenue from the boatyard is a modest £7,000 per year and it has been a consistent loss-making operation.</P>
      <P>Second, the boatyard will continue to be run as a public facility. Third, the terms of the existing agreements with St. Michael's Rowing Club, Viking Marine Limited, Irish Youth Sailing Club, Dún Laoghaire VEC and 'Sail in Ireland' will be fully honoured. Fourth, the public will continue to have a right of way over and along the boatyard in order to gain unrestricted access to the slipway in the boatway. A fifth condition is the provision of a site within the boatyard at a nominal rent for the purpose of building a clubhouse by St. Michael's Rowing Club.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Adherence to these conditions, which have been included in the contractual agreements between Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company and <Col N="131" /> Marina Marketing and Management Limited, will ensure the existing rights of users are protected while opening the facility to a wider population. The harbour company's by-laws will be amended to clearly state that the boatyard will continue to be used as a public facility. While the price for boat storage will be competitive with other storage facilities in the harbour, there is no question of arbitrary substantial increases being applied. Access by the public to the coal harbour and other areas of the harbour will not be restricted. In fact, because of the construction of two new breakwaters for the marina, the public will have access to the middle harbour area for the first time. Visitors will be able to walk on both breakwaters and enjoy fine views back towards the town for the first time. The harbour company has recently renovated and improved the slipway in the coal harbour at a cost of approximately £40,000 and without any users' contribution. The harbour company has recently commenced works which will improve public access to the other public slipway in the harbour. Current restrictions on access to the coal harbour during the construction phase of the marina development will be lifted as soon as the development is complete. I am sure the House will appreciate that health and safety precautions are necessary for the duration.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company must operate under its commercial mandate given to it by the Harbours Act, 1996. The Minister is precluded, <Col N="132" /> and rightly so, from interfering with the day to day business of the harbour company. Currently, there are eight State port companies, shortly to be joined by another three at Dundalk, Wicklow and Bantry.</P>
    <P>We must accept the reality here both commercial and by virtue of the statute. The port companies are formed under the Companies Acts. Their commercial mandate is enshrined in the legislation, each company board has 12 directors, including three local authority representatives and two worker directors. When disputes arise, apart from the statutory position, it would be intolerable if the Minister were to interfere with business decisions taken by the boards and undermine their authority and responsibilities under the Company's Memorandum and Articles of Association.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is not open to the Minister under the Harbours Act to give any direction such as suggested by the Deputy. This matter must be resolved by direct discussion between the primary parties. I do not see that a further meeting at this time between the Minister and the Coal Harbour Users Group would help to progress matters as the Minister is not party to the dispute. If, however, the group makes a submission to the Minister which sets out to establish a substantive basis for ministerial intervention, having regard to the Minister's statutory position, such a submission would be carefully considered.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 4 October 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109, 110, 134, 153, 155, 771, 778, 788, 800 and 809 together.</P>
      <P>As part of the Government's commitment to carers, as set out in its Action Programme for the Millennium, an overall review of the carer's allowance was completed by an interdepartmental committee, chaired by my Department, and was published in October 1998. Both the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Finance were represented on this committee.</P>
      <P>The review of the carer's allowance noted that it is difficult to estimate the number of full-time carers in the country. While care groups have stated this figure to be around 120,000 carers, they have provided no supporting basis for this figure. The high number may be due to their definition of carer, whereby someone visiting or assisting an older person may consider themselves to be a carer.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the study carried out by the Western Health Board, Informal Care in the Western Health Board: A study of carers, people receiving care and non-carers, indicates that assistance with mobility and personal care was provided by only a third of the carers in their survey while the vast majority of tasks undertaken by carers were related to domestic chores such as shopping, cooking and cleaning. It should also be noted that my Department officials, on receipt of the Western Health Board report, wrote to the authors and the Western Health Board raising concerns on various issues in the study and noting that the results of the survey in relation to the number of carers in receipt of carer's allowance may be misleading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be borne in mind that the purpose of the carer's allowance is to support carers who <Col N="135" /> are providing full-time care and attention for someone who is medically assessed as having a disability, such that they require, for at least 12 months: continuous supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day in connection with their normal personal needs; or continuous supervision in order to avoid danger to themselves.</P>
    <P>Based on the research carried out in the review of the carer's allowance, the current number of full-time carers is estimated to be around 50,000 people, covering carers of older people and adults and children with disabilities. There are currently 16,127 carers in receipt of carer's allowance, of which almost 2,000 are caring for a child with a disability. All carers in receipt of carer's allowance, including those caring for a child with a disability, receive a respite care grant of £300 in June each year.</P>
    <P>These figures show that 32% of full-time carers are in receipt of a carer's allowance payment, which is an increase of 75% in the number of carers in receipt of the allowance since this Government took office. This large increase is reflected in the expenditure on carer's allowance, which was £36.5 million in 1997 and is projected to be £78.3 million this year, representing an increase of 115%.</P>
    <P>As with all other social assistance schemes, a means test in which the income of both the applicant and his/her partner is assessable is applied to the carer's allowance to ensure that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need. The means test has been eased significantly in the past few years, most notably with the introduction of disregards of income from employment and other sources. The effect of these changes means that a couple with two children could have a joint annual income of £9,152 and qualify for the maximum carer's allowance while a couple with up to £19,500 could still qualify for a minimum carer's allowance, and also receive an annual respite care grant and the free schemes.</P>
    <P>It has been previously estimated that increasing the means disregards to £125 for a single person and £250 for a couple would increase the payment of approximately 2,200 existing carers at a cost of approximately £3.5 million. It is very difficult to estimate the number of additional carers who would qualify as income data are not available. However, additional costs in the region of £15 million would be incurred if an estimated additional 3,000 carers qualified leading to a total increase of £18.5 million approximately in overall expenditure.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost of abolishing the means test and extending carer's allowance at existing levels to all full-time carers would be in the region of £179 million annually. If one were to cost this proposal using the number of carers estimated by the care groups, this figure would rise to £547 million annually.</P>
    <P>The review of the carer's allowance noted that the allowance is an income support payment and <Col N="136" /> not a payment for caring. It examined the means test and considered that it should be maintained as a way of targeting resources towards those who are most in need. There are a wide range of services required, including community care and respite care, to support carers in their caring role. It is doubtful if a payment to all carers, regardless of their income, could be considered to be the best use of resources. However, the position in regard to the means test will be kept under review.</P>
    <P>The question of further improvements to the carer's allowance and for carers generally will be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of our key priorities in the care area, as set out</P>
    <P>in the review of our action programme.</P>

      <P>The publication of the White Paper is the start of the Government's long-term strategy to develop and support the community and voluntary sector. The White Paper formally recognises the role of the community and voluntary sector in contributing to the creation of a vibrant, participative democracy and civil society.</P>
      <P>The White Paper also recognises the need to promote the active involvement of people in community and voluntary groups as an essential component of a democratic society. Volunteering benefits society as a whole, individual communities and the volunteers who offer their services. The contribution of volunteers to the broad range of community and social services throughout the country is recognised. The role of the volunteer is at the heart of the sector's work and, indeed, participation of volunteers is a defining characteristic of organisations in the sector.</P>
      <P>The White Paper provides for an allocation of £400,000 for a research programme which will include quantifying the full extent of community and voluntary activity in Ireland, its contribution to social development, to the economy and to employment. The findings of the research programme will be important in informing the ongoing debate on the issues involved in the relationship between the State and the community and voluntary sector.             </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The year 2001 is the UN International Year of Volunteers. As provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a national committee on volunteering will be established this year, with participation from all the relevant interests and stakeholders. It will devise strategies and actions <Col N="137" /> for supporting and developing volunteering, not just during the international year, but for the longer term. Its work will take account of the importance of proactivity fostering a culture of support for volunteering in schools and third level institutions.</P>
    <P>The international year provides an opportunity to further raise the profile of volunteering in Ireland and progress the Government's policies with regard to development of social capital and encouragement of voluntarism. The committee will have a budget of £1 million for initiatives to further support and develop volunteering.</P>
    <P>The work of the committee will include examining and making recommendations on: the possibilities for recognition and accreditation for voluntary work and for training undertaken as a volunteer; measures to widen the pool of volunteers; the range of supports needed in order to promote, sustain and develop volunteering.</P>

      <P>Among the conditions for receipt of an unemployment payment are that the claimant must be available for and genuinely seeking work. If a deciding officer is not satisfied that the claimant fulfils these conditions the existing claim is disallowed. Such decisions may be appealed to the independent social welfare appeals office within 21 days. When this process is completed and where the deciding officer's decisions are upheld by an appeals officer, the claims are &ldquo;closed&rdquo; on the computer system.</P>
      <P>Statistics on the number of disallowances by decision type are not available. However, in the period 1 January 2000 to 31 August 2000 the number of unemployment claims closed in local offices in County Mayo, after being disallowed on the grounds of not genuinely seeking work and/or not available for work, was 525. The corresponding national figure was 8,889.</P>
      <P>Statistics held in the appeals office are not broken down by appeal type. However, records held in local offices in County Mayo show that from 1 January 2000, a total of 151 decisions relating to genuinely seeking work and availability for work were appealed to the social welfare appeals office.</P>

      <P>The back to education allowance is a second chance educational opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate unemployed people, lone parents and people with disabilities to improve their skills and qualifications with a view to returning to the workforce.</P>
      <P>To qualify for participation in the scheme, applicants must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least six months immediately prior to commencing an approved course of study. While on the scheme, they receive a weekly payment equivalent to the maximum rate of their social welfare payment. Persons who are signing for credited contributions and who, therefore, do not receive any basic unemployment payment cannot receive any payment under the back to education scheme.</P>
      <P>Circumstances can arise where back to education allowance participants, who were in receipt of credited contributions on commencing an approved course of study may in a later year satisfy the contribution conditions for unemployment benefit. Such participants would be entitled to the back to education allowance from the date they became entitled to unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>The back to education allowance has proved to be a very worthwhile scheme to assist people in taking up educational opportunities with a view to returning to the workforce. I am arranging for a review of the scheme to be initiated and the matter raised by the Deputy will be among the issues to be addressed in that review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 114, 136, 141 and 772 together.</P>
      <P>The programme evaluation report on one parent family payment, carried out by my Department and published on 5 September last is the first review of this scheme since it was introduced in January 1997. The review is one of a series of reviews being undertaken under the Department's expenditure review programme.</P>
      <P>The review paid particular attention to the needs of lone parents and their children and to the desire to avoid long-term dependency on social welfare by this group. It also looked at various other issues relating to lone parenthood. The review provides very valuable information which will form a basis for consideration of the future direction of the one parent family payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Key conclusions and proposals arising from the review are as follows: current one-parent family payment arrangements for one-parent families are justified and fulfil a valuable role in supporting lone parents; overall a more proactive approach to this group, especially in the information, training and employment areas, needs to be taken; support programmes &ndash; for example, in the training and educational areas &ndash; would need to be tailored to meet the different needs of different categories of lone parents; the one-parent family payment should not facilitate or encourage long-term social welfare dependency for people of working age and ability; while making receipt of one-parent family payment conditional on seeking employment is not proposed, the increasing cost of the scheme, changing attitudes towards parents working outside the home and international experience suggest that some conditionality on claiming may be introduced at some stage in the future; the increasing cost of the scheme will place more focus on the arrangements for maintenance provisions and the way society views parents who do not take financial responsibility for their children at the State's expense. Proposals are made to improve the one-parent family payment recipient's incentive to seek maintenance; and the current contingency nature of the one-parent family payment, which is a payment to support people parenting alone, does not permit easy solutions to issues in relation to custody of children, co-habitation and the formation of new relationships the current contingency nature of the one-parent family payment which is a payment to support people parenting alone. The group did not support proposals to split child dependant allowances or child benefit in cases of equal joint custody/parenting of children. On the basis of the review's findings, <Col N="140" /> I intend to follow through with policy initiatives in a number of areas.</P>
    <P>The first major action programme that is being prepared relates to employment and education opportunities. I am concerned at the continued high poverty rates for lone parents and their children and at the fact that long-term welfare dependency has become a reality for many of those on one-parent family payment.</P>
    <P>I am, however, encouraged by the significant growth in the number of lone parents at work. I believe that this is the best route out of poverty. On foot of the proposals in the review and following discussions with the relevant agencies, I have been considering a range of measures to address the barriers to employment which still exist.</P>
    <P>The pilot family services project which is under way in Cork, Waterford and Finglas, has as its objective the provision of a high quality information service about the range of supports available to families from State agencies. The provision of information to lone parents about education, training and employment options and opportunities is one of the aims of the family services project.</P>
    <P>I will shortly be launching an information campaign to ensure that all lone parents are fully aware of the various supports which are available to help them to take advantage of education, training and employment opportunities. The information campaign will be the first strand in a planned and comprehensive programme of measures which will form my Department's strategy to motivate, encourage and support lone parents to join the active labour force. This programme will have the following objectives: (a) to encourage and facilitate lone parents who wish to enter the labour market by providing them with access to the necessary education, training and related supports on an individual basis, and (b) to ensure that lone parents are fully aware of the range of options and supports which are currently in place from all agencies to assist them to return to the labour force.</P>
    <P>In relation to the delivery of the service to clients, my Department is developing plans for the localisation of the administration of the one-parent family payment scheme. I believe that developing the administration of the scheme to a local level will be an important step in helping to make the scheme itself and related services more accessible to lone parents. I envisage that the process of developing the scheme will commence, probably on a pilot basis initially, by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>On the issue of maintenance, I believe that support from the &ldquo;absent&rdquo; partner or parent should play a much more important role in providing support to lone parents. The review sets out a comprehensive analysis of the options in this area which I am considering in detail. The review concluded that the &ldquo;liability to maintain family&rdquo; system and procedures specified in social welfare legislation should be enforced more vigorously while bearing in mind value for money consider<Col N="141" /> ations. The administrative and resource aspects of this recommendation are under active consideration by my Department at present. I will also be considering, in the budgetary context, the proposals set out in the review in relation to improvements in the amount of maintenance which lone parents can retain, to act as a further incentive to seek adequate maintenance and to improve their overall income position.</P>
    <P>Rent supplement is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. My Department has no function in deciding entitlement in individual cases. The supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
    <P>SWA is subject to a means test and is not ordinarily payable to people in full-time employment. However, arrangements have been in place for some years now to enable rent supplement recipients to retain their rent supplement and other secondary benefits on taking up employment, subject to certain conditions.</P>
    <P>Prior to 6 April 2000 any person who availed of my Department's back to work allowance scheme, job assist or other employment support schemes could retain their rent supplement for three years, subject to a maximum payment of £250 per month, provided their household income did not exceed £250 per week.</P>
    <P>New conditions for the retention of rent and mortgage interest supplements were announced in Budget 2000 and came into effect on 6 April 2000. These changes include disregarding the back to work allowance and family income supplement in the assessment of means and a tapered withdrawal of rent supplement over four years. Some 75% of the previous rate entitlement will be paid in year one, 50% in year two, 25% in year three and 25% in year four. The £250 per month payment limit was also abolished. Existing recipients may opt for assessment under either the new arrangements or the previous arrangement, whichever is more beneficial to them.</P>
    <P>These measures have been designed to assist and encourage people, to make the transition from welfare into work. The new measures are also particularly beneficial to families with high rents.</P>
    <P>The review of the one parent family scheme is a significant addition to our overall knowledge of this group and their needs. Policy in relation to lone parents has been continually evolving over the past 30 years. I believe that the report and the actions we are taking, and will take arising from it, will make us better positioned to respond to the needs of this group within our fast-changing society.</P>

      <P>The administration of the pre-retirement allowance scheme is being transferred from the Department's Longford social services office to social welfare local offices throughout the country with effect from 12 October 2000.</P>
      <P>As part of the transfer process, all pre-retirement allowance recipients have been fully advised of the new administrative and payment arrangements that will apply. Recipients will continue to receive their weekly payment at their existing post office but will be paid through a post draft rather than a book of personalised payable orders.</P>
      <P>In the case of people who are unable to collect their own payment in circumstances such as hospitalisation, the person can be paid by cheque or into their bank account. If the Deputy has a particular case in mind, perhaps he could advise my Department and the necessary arrangements will be made.</P>
      <P>One of the advantages of the post draft system is that it will provide a household budget facility for recipients of this allowance. This scheme, which is operated for my Department by An Post, allows customers to have deductions made from their weekly payment to pay certain bills such as ESB, gas, telephone or local authority rents or mortgages.</P>
      <P>While the allowance is generally directed at people who have opted to retire from the workforce, pre-retirement allowance recipients may, in certain instances, also wish to avail of the employment support services offered by my Department. In this regard, the transfer of the scheme to local offices will also facilitate such people in directly accessing employment support services should this be required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116, 117, 142, 157, 731, 776, 789 and 807 together.</P>
      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid-October to mid-April regardless of the temperature. A sum of £8 per week is paid in smokeless zones.</P>
      <P>In 1999-2000 approximately 288,000 people received a fuel allowance of £5 per week for the 26 weeks of the fuel season. In addition, approximately 114,000 people also received the smokeless fuel allowance of £3 per week for the 26 weeks of the fuel season. It is estimated that in 2000-2001 approximately 287,400 people will receive a fuel allowance of £5 and approximately 115,000 people will also receive the smokeless fuel allowance of £3 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Expenditure on the national fuel scheme was £42.8 million in 1995, £44.3 million in 1996, £45 million in 1997, £44.9 million in 1998, and £44 million in 1999. This was an increase of approxi<Col N="144" /> mately 2.8% in the five years from 1995 to 1999. This year a sum of £46.3 million has been provided in the Estimates for the scheme.</P>
    <P>To increase the fuel allowance by £1 per week would cost approximately £7.1 million per fuel season. To double the allowance from £5 to £10 per week would cost an extra £35.5 million per fuel season. To extend the fuel season by one week would cost £1.7 million.</P>
    <P>The national and smokeless fuel schemes were reviewed in 1998 as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The review group took the view that improvements in the national fuel scheme cannot be looked at in isolation from the improvements in the primary weekly payment rates.</P>
    <P>With regard to the times of year that payments are made, the group concluded that the current 26 week heating season was generally correct, and the additional cost of extending the heating season on a general basis was not warranted. However, it recommended the duration of the allowance should be extended in the case of people over 80 years of age in view of their increased vulnerability.</P>
    <P>The group also concluded that the present rates of payment should remain unchanged if improvements in primary payment rates fully compensated recipients for all price inflation, including fuel price inflation. Increasing primary payments gives people greater flexibility in meeting their needs and, of course, the increased rates are payable for all 52 weeks of the year.</P>
    <P>In that regard, substantial increases in all the social welfare primary payments of either £3 or £6 per week were paid from June 1999, with further increases of either £4 or £7, which came into effect at the beginning of May 2000, a month earlier than last year. This is equivalent to increases ranging from 10% to 16% over the last two budgets.</P>
    <P>In addition, the qualified adult allowance was increased by amounts ranging from £3.80 for people on disability benefit, £4.70 for old age contributory and retirement pensioners and £8.50 for invalidity pensioners where the qualified adult is aged 66 years or over.</P>
    <P>The current rate of fuel allowance, £5 per week, was set in 1985. Since then, fuel price inflation was much lower than general price inflation up to last year, with an overall cumulative increase of less than 10% over the 14 years between 1985 and 1999. However an increase of almost 7.9% was recorded in the fuel and light component of the CPI in the 12 months up to last August.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the extent to which general price inflation, including fuel price inflation, is impacting on the significant improvements in social welfare payments I have mentioned. The Deputy will know that I cannot give specific details of the measures that will be contained in this year's budget but I want to assure him that improving the overall position of social welfare <Col N="145" /> recipients will receive a very high priority in the budget.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I would point out that fuel allowances are not the sole mechanism through which assistance is provided to people with heating needs.</P>
    <P>There is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>
    <P>Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment. Exceptional needs payments are payable at the discretion of the health board, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>

      <P>As part of the process of mainstreaming services to people with disabilities, the vocational training and employment services formerly administered by the National Rehabilitation Board were transferred to FÁS with effect from 12 June 2000. Whilst responsibility for the operation of community employment schemes is primarily the responsibility of FÁS under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, my Department has an important role in facilitating people on disability payments such as invalidity pension in community employment participation.</P>
      <P>While the conditions for receipt of invalidity pension require that a person does not engage in employment, it is nonetheless recognised that support should be provided for people with disabilities or long-term incapacities to facilitate them in taking up available employment and training opportunities, where appropriate.</P>
      <P>In this regard, invalidity pensioners can, subject to prior approval from my Department, engage in occupational training where they are incapable of following their usual occupation, and also to undertake rehabilitative or therapeutic employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the transfer of training and employment services from the National Rehabilitation Board, <Col N="146" /> my Department has entered into arrangements with FÁS to assist people on disability payments</P>
    <P>who wish to engage in training or rehabilitative employment.</P>
    <P>Where certification is received by FÁS that an invalidity pensioner requires rehabilitative training or employment, they are, subject to certain conditions, allowed to retain their full invalidity pension payment and related secondary benefits whilst engaging in community employment. Some 1,670 invalidity pensioners are currently engaged in rehabilitative training or employment by way of the community employment programme.</P>
    <P>Additionally, as part of a package of measures to further enhance the employment supports for people with disabilities, I introduced in last year's budget two further important improvements for invalidity pensioners. First, the back to work allowance scheme was extended to invalidity pensioners. Participants in this scheme can take up employment and continue to receive their social welfare payment on a sliding scale over a three year period or for four years if they take up self-employment.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I have also extended the back to education allowance to invalidity pensioners. Participants in this scheme can continue to receive their full weekly payment while undergoing approved second or third level education courses. In addition, a cost of education allowance of £200 is paid towards the cost of books and related expenses.</P>
    <P>The range of employment, training and educational supports provided by my Department for people with disabilities will continue to be developed having regard to, <i>inter alia</i>, the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119, 132, 774, 796, 797 and 798 together.</P>
      <P>This Department's expenditure on school meals in 1999 amounted to £565,000. Estimated expenditure, based on the current scheme, for 2000 and 2001 is £860,000 and £930,000 respectively. Expenditure figures for academic years are not available within the Department.</P>
      <P>Applications from schools to participate in the scheme are dealt with in the first instance by the local authorities. The details of the primary schools which are benefiting from the scheme are therefore not available within the Department. Returns to the Department from the 31 local authorities which operated the scheme in 1999 indicate that in the region of 370 schools received meals in that year.</P>
      <P>I have felt for some time that the current school meals scheme falls a long way short of what is required and that a major reform of the scheme is needed. Accordingly, I established an interdepartmental working group chaired by my Department to review the scheme from first principles.</P>
      <P>The review is being undertaken as part of the series of expenditure reviews which seek to ensure that spending programmes are still relevant and to identify priorities for adjustments in expenditure. In this case, proposals are being developed for a reformed school meals scheme that will meet the needs of today's school-going children in an efficient and effective manner.</P>
      <P>The working group undertaking the review is composed of representatives from my Department, the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science, Environment and Local Government and Finance, Dublin Corporation and the County and City Managers' Association. This is indicative of the broad range of stakeholders in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consultation with relevant organisations has been a feature of the reviews carried out to date in my Department. In the course of this review the working group has invited submissions from <Col N="148" /> statutory and voluntary groups, it has surveyed local authorities and schools and met with those involved in innovative projects in the area. The working group and the Combat Poverty Agency jointly organised a seminar last month attended by statutory, voluntary and commercial bodies with an interest in the area.</P>
    <P>This consultation process will inform the group's consideration of the future policy direction for the scheme. All of the issues and difficulties with the current scheme, including the exclusion of county council areas and secondary school pupils, and the various options for a revised school meals scheme have emerged during the consultation process. The working group is examining all of these matters, including the type of food to be provided, whether breakfast, cold lunch or hot food.</P>
    <P>As the working group is still in the process of reviewing the scheme, details of a revised school meals scheme, the criteria and conditions that will apply, the administration of the revised scheme, the methods of provision and types of food to be provided, the number of pupils that will benefit, the cost of the revised scheme etc. are not decided. I expect to receive the working group's report early in the new year.</P>
    <P>Pending completion of the report I was pleased to be able to provide interim funding, towards the food costs, for the voluntary and community groups currently providing school meals outside of the existing scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the latest figures available from the Central Statistics Office, there was a drop of 39,644, or 20% &ndash; from 198,026 to 159,026 &ndash; in the live register in the 12 months to August 2000.</P>
      <P>The largest decreases were recorded in the eastern and south west areas, which include the two main urban areas in the country. In the Dublin area the decrease was 25% while in Cork there was a decrease of 27%. On the other hand the decrease in the same period in the Border and midland areas was 14%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fluctuations in live register figures in rural areas cannot be compared to the larger urban areas, where higher number of job opportunities will contribute to an increased volume of outflows. In addition, certain counties in the Border and midlands regions have been hit by a number of significant redundancies in the last 12 months <Col N="149" /> which would have an influence on the total numbers on the live register in these areas.</P>
    <P>In so far as my Department is concerned we have, through the efforts of our employment support services, continued to assist the long-term unemployed to leave the live register and return to the active labour force. A number of special projects have been undertaken in the Border and midlands areas by my Department's jobs facilitators, usually in partnership with other local agencies and community based organisations. These range from training programmes, business support schemes, IT training and back to education courses. In addition, local offices of the Department give information to unemployed people about local job vacancies and educational opportunities. They also invite other relevant agencies to visit the offices and provide information first hand on their services to customers when they are signing on.</P>
    <P>The Government, through the different enterprise support agencies, is committed to ensuring the most equitable distribution of job opportunities and to encourage the establishment of industry in rural Ireland. The development agencies are now strongly focused on achieving this aim and resources are being deployed to reflect this new focus.</P>
    <P>The agencies' focus on regionalisation ensures that an attractive financial package will be made available to any appropriate project which may choose to locate or expand in the regions.</P>
    <P>Complementary measures in the National Development Plan will also help to underpin the regional strategies of the development agencies. The measures provided for in the plan will provide the infrastructure necessary for the attraction of overseas investment currently lacking outside the major urban areas. The plan envisages spending a higher amount per head of population in the largely rural Border, Midland and West regions.</P>
    <P>The Government is confident that the co-ordinated efforts being made by the development agencies will further advance economic development and employment in rural Ireland.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 121 and 775 together.</P>
      <P>This Government is committed to ensuring that women can realise their full potential in Irish society. One of the main principles underlying the National Anti-Poverty Strategy is &ldquo;the reduction of inequalities and in particular, addressing the gender dimensions of poverty&rdquo; and a number of developments have taken place which aim, <i>inter alia</i>, to ease the burden on predominantly female-headed households.</P>
      <P>The Government has already recognised that women living alone and lone parents face a higher risk of poverty than the population at large. A major review of the impact of supports for one-parent families has recently been completed which finds that, overall, the one parent family payment is fulfilling a valuable role in supporting lone parents. I am encouraged by the significant growth in the number of lone parents at work and I believe that this is the best route out of poverty. On foot of the proposals in the review, and following discussions with the relevant agencies, I will bring forward a range of measures to overcome the barriers to employment which currently exist.</P>
      <P>I expect that the National Anti Poverty Strategy review will further assist in the development of policies which address the concerns of women living in poverty. Possible new targets will be considered as part of the review of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy, in consultation with the social partners, under the themes of women's poverty, child poverty, health, older people and housing and accommodation. Working groups are currently being established to advance the review process which will be completed by the third quarter of 2001.</P>
      <P>The introduction of poverty proofing across all Departments, which aims to assess significant policy proposals at design stage for their impact on the poor, is also a major step in this regard. Lone parents, older people, and single adult households are among the groups given particular attention in this process.</P>
      <P>With regard to this Government's commitment in relation to old age pensions, substantial progress has been made in the last three budgets towards meeting our commitment to increase the old age contributory pension to £100 by 2002. This will be of very significant benefit to households headed by elderly women. In addition, phase one of the review of the qualifying conditions for the old age (contributory) and retirement pensions was launched on 27 August. This report explores the Action Programme for the Millennium commitment in relation to allowing women who take time off work for family reasons to qualify for pensions. Phase two of the review will consider pension cover for women in the home.</P>

      <P>The objective of the recently launched White Paper &ndash; Supporting Voluntary Activity &ndash; is to put a more cohesive framework of support in place for the community and voluntary sector. I am happy that in the White Paper we have delivered a set of decisions about new structures and systems that will bring about real improvements over time in the day-to-day environment in which local groups operate.</P>
      <P>The move by the Government towards a multi-annual budgeting system in the public service will facilitate Departments and agencies in giving greater assurances as to funding to be made available in the medium-term to fund agreed priority services and programmes of activities.</P>
      <P>The Government has decided that multi-annual funding commitments should, in appropriate cases, be made available to organisations providing services or undertaking development activities that are agreed to be priorities, with the budget for each specific year to which the agreement applies to be reviewed in the light of the resources available and taking into account the legal position that the Dáil votes public moneys on an annual basis. It notes that the system of three year funding commitments that operates in the case of community development and money advice projects funded by my Department is a model that could be applied in other comparable areas.</P>
      <P>Relevant voluntary organisations and community groups will be involved in the decision-making process at the level of each Department and agency about which services and activities should be regarded as priority areas and put on a multi-annual footing. This will take a little time, but it is important in keeping with the spirit of partnership that informs the White Paper that groups directly affected have an input into the decisions and choices to be made.</P>

      <P>Considerable progress has been made in recent years in reducing the incidence and effects of poverty and unemployment traps in the social welfare system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amongst the measures which have contributed to this improvement are: the continued increase <Col N="152" /> in child benefit as part of a strategy of making child income support more neutral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employment status of the parents; the introduction of net income assessment for the purposes of determining entitlement to family income supplement; the introduction of a more tapered qualified adult allowance, providing for a more gradual reduction in the payment when the spouse or partner of a social welfare claimant takes up work or gets a pay increase; the continued enhancement of the back-to-work allowance scheme and the back to education programme operated by my Department; and a more tapered withdrawal of supplementary welfare allowance rent or mortgage supplements.</P>
    <P>On a general level, my Department constantly monitors the operation of its schemes with a view to ensuring that poverty traps and disincentives are removed. I am determined to continue to work towards ensuring that the welfare system does not create poverty traps, and minimising such traps where they exist. It must be recognised, however, that the substantial progress in recent years has very much reduced problems in this area.</P>

      <P>In May this year, I set up a working group with representatives from relevant Departments to examine issues related to the assessment of need for supplementary welfare allowance purposes. The working group is made up of representatives from my Department, which chairs the group, and the Departments of Finance, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and the Environment and Local Government, as well as a representative appointed by the chief executive officers of the health boards.</P>
      <P>The group invited submissions from 30 interested parties, including asylum seeker and homeless support groups, the health boards and unions representing community welfare staff. In all, 15 of those invited have made submissions.</P>
      <P>Following consideration of these submissions, a preliminary draft report has been produced and is currently being reviewed by members of the group. It is intended that the group will submit their final report to me shortly.</P>

I have concentrated on improving the personal pension rates of our older people as I believe this to be the most effective and equitable way of ensuring that their position is improved.</P>

      <P>I welcome the findings of the second annual report of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy Inter-Departmental Policy Committee 1999-2000 which I launched with the Taoiseach last Friday, 29 September. The progress which has been made since the launch of the strategy in 1997 is very significant. The key targets set under the strategy have now all been met. Unemployment is down to 4.3%, long-term unemployment is down from 7% in 1996 to 1.6% today and consistent poverty has almost halved from 15% to just over 8% today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While progress to date has been striking, much needs to be done. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides that the National Anti-Poverty Strategy will be updated and existing targets reviewed and revised where appropriate. Possible new targets will be considered in consultation with the social partners and emerging causes of poverty will be analysed. Urban and rural poverty will be addressed in a co-ordinated and coherent manner and this process will be strengthened by the ongoing reform of local <Col N="154" /> government which will maximise the involvement and participation of local communities in the democratic process.</P>
    <P>My Department has for a number of years operated a range of grants schemes and community development support programmes which concentrate on a wide range of support for local self-help groups, community development, welfare rights and information work, and on the provision of seed money to enable community groups to pilot initiatives identified as meeting new and emerging community needs. The community development support programmes were included in the National Development Plan with a commitment of over £100 million over the lifetime of the plan.</P>
    <P>These programmes focus on investment in capacity building, so that socially excluded groups and local communities can be active participants in identifying and meeting their own development needs, working alongside the other social partners.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides for the establishment of an interdepartmental committee to identify and clarify the range of existing and proposed social inclusion measures in the national development plan from which integrated targeted intervention measures can be developed. This committee will have regard to the experience and implications of many existing initiatives including the community development programme. The committee will make recommendations to the Government by December 2000, enabling 25 areas to be designated with a prioritised list of measures that can be implemented within a three year time frame. The committee will explore all avenues and actions that can be front loaded, within existing budget lines, at the 25 designated areas, following their designation. Substantial increases in funding are provided for social inclusion measures in the national development plan and this process seeks to ensure that these funds and actions are co-ordinated and targeted at the areas of greatest need.</P>

      <P>The recently published White Paper &ndash; Supporting Voluntary Activity &ndash; recognises the need to promote the active involvement of people in community and volun<Col N="155" /> tary groups as an essential component of a democratic society. The role of the volunteer is at the heart of the sector's work and, indeed, participation of volunteers is a defining characteristic of organisations in the sector.</P>
      <P>One of the issues that emerged in the course of preparing the White Paper is how little empirical information is available on the scale of the community and voluntary sector. For that reason, the White Paper provides for an allocation of £400,000 for a research programme which will include quantifying the full extent of community and voluntary activity in Ireland, its contribution to social development, to the economy and to employment. The findings of the research programme will be important in informing the ongoing debate on the issues involved in the relationship between the State and the community and voluntary sector.</P>
      <P>The year 2001 is the UN International Year of Volunteers. As provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a national committee on volunteering will be established this year, with participation from all the relevant interests and stakeholders. It will devise strategies and actions for supporting and developing volunteering, not just during the international year, but for the longer term. Its work will take account of the importance of proactively fostering a culture of support for volunteering in schools and third level institutions.</P>
      <P>The international year provides an opportunity to further raise the profile of volunteering in Ireland and progress the Government's policies with regard to the development of social capital and the encouragement of voluntarism. The committee will have a budget of £1 million for initiatives to further support and develop volunteering.</P>
      <P>The work of the committee will include examining and making recommendations on: the possibilities for recognition and accreditation for voluntary work and for training undertaken as a volunteer; measures to widen the pool of volunteers; and the range of supports needed in order to promote, sustain and develop volunteering.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 129 and 753 together.</P>
      <P>In recent years, the Ombudsman published two reports concerning the loss of pension arrears where pension claims were not made on time. The first report, published in March 1997, contained a number of general recommendations which were aimed at significantly improving the position of late pension claimants.</P>
      <P>Arising from the recommendations made in that report, a number of changes were implemented which improved the position of pensioners who made late claims, including automatic back-dating up to 12 months of late pension claims and, where the claim was more than 12 months late, extension of the backdating period on a proportional basis. I also made provision for further payment up to the level of full retrospection where: the delay was due to incorrect information given by the Department, or where illness or a <i>force majeure</i> prevented a person from claiming earlier, or where the person is suffering current financial hardship. These provisions applied to any contributory pension claims made on or after 1 January 1997.</P>
      <P>For contributory pension claims made prior to 1 January 1997, arrears of up to six months pension are payable. I also provided in 1998 for payment of further arrears in these cases on a sliding scale.</P>
      <P>To date, arrears totalling £9.4 million have been paid in 5,700 such cases. In notifying pensioners of payment of arrears, they are advised of the provisions under which full arrears of pension may be paid.</P>
      <P>The Ombudsman's second report, published in June 1999, did not carry recommendations for further changes in the provisions affecting contributory pension applicants. The Ombudsman's report included the following comment:</P>
      <P>The issue dealt with in this report represents an historical problem which, in the light of developments in 1997 and 1998, has now been significantly ameliorated.</P>
      <P>The Ombudsman intends this report to mark the end of his Office's involvement with the general issue of lost arrears of contributory pension.</P>
      <P>In relation to identifying cases where arrears of pension may be due, my Department has identified from its records people who were eligible for arrears payments under the changed provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has paid the appropriate arrears and, as necessary, advised people of the provisions under which full arrears could be paid. The Department is also conscious of the need to ensure that potential pension claimants are fully <Col N="157" /> aware of their entitlements and of the importance of claiming them within the specified time. Information regarding such entitlements is available from any of my Department's local offices throughout the country as well as from the nationwide network of Citizen Information Centres and other outlets. All of the guidelines used by my Department's staff in processing claims are published on our Website www.dscfa.ie. Furthermore, in the ongoing development of my Department's computer systems, the feasibility of providing further provisions to notify potential claimants of their possible contributory entitlements in advance is being examined.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, I brought forward regulations which broadened the scope of the late claims provisions introduced in 1998 to most other social welfare schemes. I also introduced regulations to place on a statutory footing a scheme of compensation for delays by the Department in determining social welfare entitlements. Under these arrangements compensation is paid where a social welfare payment is not made within 12 months due to delay on the part of the Department in processing the claim.</P>
    <P>I believe that the changes outlined above represent a comprehensive, equitable and flexible response to the issues which have arisen concerning delays in claiming social welfare entitlements on time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 and 811 together.</P>
      <P>The view that child benefit represents a key instrument for tackling child poverty and targeting child income support is widely acknowledged and is fully shared by this Government. As it is a universal payment which is not taxable or not assessed as means for other secondary benefits, it does not contribute to disincentives to taking up employment or improving wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The value placed on child benefit is reflected in the level of resources invested in the scheme <Col N="158" /> over the past number of years. The 1999 budget provided for a full-year investment of over £40 million, while the most recent budget provides for a full-year investment of almost £106 million, bringing total investment in the scheme up to some £575 million annually. Some 491,000 families with a total of 967,000 children benefited from these increases.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the value of the child benefit scheme will continue to be exploited to the greatest possible extent. In this regard, the Government has made a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to substantially increase the payment over the period of the programme, with a priority focus towards £100 per month for third and subsequent children. In line with this commitment, from September the basic child benefit monthly rates will have risen to £42.40 in respect of each of the first two children and £56 in respect of the third and subsequent children.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised, that child poverty is a complex problem, the alleviation of which requires policies on a number of fronts. Approximately, 40% of children are in families who are in receipt of weekly social welfare payments. Measures such as the family income supplement have helped encourage parents make the transition from welfare dependency to work and break the intergenerational cycle of poverty. Under the terms of framework III of the programme, new targets will be considered under the various themes of the National Anti &ndash; Poverty Strategy, including child poverty. These targets are to be considered in consultation with the social partners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of the national fuel allowance scheme is to assist householders who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or</P>
      <P>health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 a week &ndash; £8 in smokeless zones &ndash; is made to eligible households during the 26 week period from mid-October to mid-April.</P>
      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of a fuel allowance is that a contributory pensioner and members of the household must not have a combined income of more than £30 per week, in addition to the maximum rate of contributory pension. The pensioner in question has an occupational pension in excess of this amount and so does not qualify for the allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the person concerned is unable to provide for his heating needs, he may qualify for a heating <Col N="159" /> payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme from his local community welfare officer. A heating supplement is available for those who require extra heating in their homes because of ill health or infirmity. If the Deputy feels that the person concerned may qualify for this supplement, an application may be made by contacting a local community welfare officer.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I made a number of improvements to the fuel allowance scheme in recent years which have ensured that many pensioners, who previously would not have been eligible, have now qualified for this allowance. From October 1999, I doubled the weekly income disregard limit from £15 to £30 per week. I am also improving the formula used by my Department to derive a weekly income from savings and investments, from the start of the 2000/2001 heating season in mid October this year. A contributory pensioner with savings and investments of up to £30,000 will now be able to qualify for the allowance provided s/he does not have other income. Other improvements include allowing access to the scheme for people previously excluded as they had access to their own fuel supply and extending the smokeless fuel supplement of £3 a week to an additional five cities/towns outside of Dublin, with a further five cities/towns being included this month.</P>
    <P>This year, approximately 287,400 people will receive a fuel allowance of £5 per week for the 26 weeks of the fuel season and approximately 115,000 people will also receive the smokeless fuel supplement of £3 per week over the same period. Expenditure on the scheme is set to increase by over 5% from £44 million in 1999 to £46.3m this year.</P>
    <P>The question of further improvements in the scheme would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The Social Insurance Fund plays a key role in the provision of social protection. Social insurance contributions are paid into the fund which, in turn, finances a broad range of contributory payments. One of my priorities since I became Minister has been to enhance the level of payments made from the fund, particularly for pensioners, and to reform and develop the system generally in the light of changing social and economic circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, I have introduced a new and innovative benefit &ndash; carer's benefit. The new benefit will come into operation later this month <Col N="160" /> and will enable those workers who take time out to care for ill or incapacitated people to receive a payment. I will also be bringing forward proposals, in the months ahead, to advance the relevant commitments relating to the social insurance system contained in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. This will include the bringing forward of legislation, after appropriate consultation, to provide for the establishment of a Social Insurance Fund board.</P>
    <P>The Social Insurance Fund has had an annual surplus each year since 1997. The financial position of the fund is thus secure in the short-term. However, significant funding challenges lie ahead as a result of the projected ageing of the population and the consequent increase in the number of social welfare pensioners.</P>
    <P>In this regard, a Bill providing for the establishment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund was published last June and will be debated in this House shortly. The proposed new fund will part pre-fund both social welfare and public service pension costs from 2025 to 2055. I strongly support the establishment of the new long-term fund and my Department was represented on the technical working group which examined the issues relating to the introduction of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Reserve Fund Commissioners will be responsible for the control, management and investment of the fund. The Bill provides that the commissioners will consult with the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs in relation to assessments of the projected Exchequer outlays on social welfare pensions. The Bill also provides that the Minister for Finance will consult the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs in relation to the rules which will apply under which payments will be made from the fund.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs will also be consulted regarding the possible extension of payments to and from the fund after the years provided for in the Bill. I am committed to securing the financing of social welfare payments both in the short and long-term. The current healthy financial status of the Social Insurance Fund will facilitate the ongoing development of the social insurance system in the short-term as well as helping to cope with increased pension costs before the reserve fund is available for drawdown. The setting up of the new reserve fund is a prudent and far-sighted Government response to the challenges facing this and future generations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions No. 135 and 140 together.</P>
      <P>As outlined in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, there are complex issues involved in developing a benchmark for adequacy of adult and child social welfare payments, including the implications of adopting a specific approach to the ongoing uprating or indexation of payments.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that the appointment of an independent chairperson of the working group being established under the terms of the programme to examine these issues will be finalised shortly. Once that process is complete, the social partners and relevant Departments will be invited to formally nominate their representatives to the group.</P>
      <P>The working group will have a mandate to examine the range of issues associated with benchmarking and indexation, including their long-term economic, budgetary, PRSI contribution, distributive and incentive implications, in light of trends in economic, demographic and labour market patterns. It is envisaged that the working group will also take account of work being carried out to review the underlying methodology of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy.</P>
      <P>It will be a matter for the independent chairperson and the members of the group to establish the most effective means of satisfying the mandate set out in the programme.</P>
      <P>More generally, I am very conscious of the impact of increased inflation on people dependent on social welfare payments. It is important to recall in this context that, since this Government came into office, social welfare payments have been substantially increased in real terms. For instance, social welfare pensioners aged 66 years and over have received total increases amounting to £18 in their personal rates of payment, representing an overall increase of between 23% and 27%. This compares with less than 11% inflation over the same period.</P>
      <P>The last budget provided for a £7 a week increase for this group, representing an increase of between 7.9% and 8.9%, a rate of increase which remains well ahead of inflation.</P>

    <P>I recognise, of course, that the higher than expected inflation has had the effect of reducing the value of this year's budget increases in social welfare payments. At the time of the budget it was estimated that inflation would be much lower, in the region of 3%, and the Government provided for social welfare increases well in excess of this. I can assure the House that the Government will take full account of the recent increased level of inflation in determining the <Col N="162" /> appropriate level of social welfare increases for 2001.</P>

      <P>The publication of the White Paper &ndash; Supporting Voluntary Activity &ndash; is the start of the Government's long-term strategy to develop and support the community and voluntary sector. One of the main issues that arose during the consultation process with the community and voluntary sector was the need for a supportive legal and regulatory framework for charities and fundraising.</P>
      <P>Preparatory work on the preparation of new legislation in this area &ndash; following from the work of the report of the Committee on Fundraising Activities for Charitable and Other Purposes, the Costello report, and a working group set up under the previous Government &ndash; has been undertaken in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Government has now decided that responsibility for charity regulatory matters and the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests will transfer from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to my Department.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring that comprehensive legislation on regulation of charities and their fundraising is produced as a priority. The sector will be consulted in the development of the legislation through the implementation and advisory group being set up to oversee the implementation of decisions contained in the White Paper, Supporting Voluntary Activity. There is a number of procedural steps to go through to give effect to this Government decision &ndash; including a formal transfer of functions order.</P>

      <P>Pensions and other long-term social welfare payments have traditionally been paid by pension order book at post offices. Short-term payments are generally paid by cheque or, in the case of unemployed payments, at post offices by post draft and electronic information transfer. Payment can also be made, at the <Col N="163" /> person's choice direct to bank accounts through electronic fund transfer.</P>
      <P>The number of customers in each major category whose chosen payment method is electronic fund transfer direct to their accounts and the numbers who are paid at post offices by postdraft and electronic information transfer on 31 August 2000 are shown in the table following.</P>
      <P>Until April 2000 the vast majority, 95%, of weekly payments made to lone parents were by way of personalised payable order book. The remaining 5% had opted to collect their payment through the postdraft/EIT arrangements by using their social welfare services card. This enabled them to avail of the household budgeting facility whereby deductions can be made from weekly payments in respect of costs for local authority rent, ESB and telephone charges.</P>
      <P>The option of payment by electronic fund transfer was extended to lone parents in April 2000 both to extend the choices available and as a response to requests for payment in this way.</P>
      <P>There is no loss of benefit when a beneficiary switches to electronic fund transfer payments, but as a result of the different payment cycle which applies for technical reasons, electronic fund transfer payments are a week later as compared to PPO book payments. Most beneficiaries who opt to be paid by electronic fund transfer do so at new claim stage so there is no interruption of the flow of payments once the claim is allowed. Where an existing beneficiary opts to switch to electronic fund transfer, the different payment cycle will mean that the next payment will be in two weeks rather than in one weeks time, so there is an interruption in payment for one week.</P>
      <P>The question of aligning payment frequencies is under active consideration but due to other pressing demands on the available resources it may not be possible to accommodate this change for some time.</P>

      <P>Since this Government took office, increases in weekly social welfare rates have been brought forward by six weeks from mid-June to the beginning of May. Next year, the implementation date for social welfare increases will be brought forward further to coincide with the start of the tax year in April. This trend will continue in 2002, when the effective payment date of social welfare increases will be brought forward to January in line with the change of the tax year to the calendar year.</P>
      <P>The new social insurance carer's benefit will be introduced with effect from 26 October 2000. The effective payment dates of increases which apply to other weekly social welfare payments will likewise apply in respect of future increases to this new scheme.</P>
      <P>In the case of child benefit, the effective payment date of the increase co-incides with the start of the school year in September and the increased financial burden on parents at this time. In addition, approximately 40% of children are in families who are in receipt of weekly social welfare payments. These families, who consist of the families in greatest financial need, will benefit from receiving an increase in their social welfare weekly payments progressively earlier in the next two years.</P>
      <P>Families with children will also benefit from the Government's commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, to substantially increase the payment of child benefit over the period of the programme. Whereas the effective date of child benefit increases has not been brought forward, this year's significant increases in monthly rates ie £8 for first and second child and £10 for subsequent children will result in gains in real terms for families.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 143, 144, 151, 779 and 781 together.</P>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme is administered on my Department's behalf by the health boards. An interdepartmental committee is currently reviewing the scheme as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations.</P>
      <P>Two health board officers, from the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Mid-Western Health Board, were nominated to the working group by the health boards. Both have extensive experience in this area, having worked in the community welfare service for many years.</P>
      <P>Both SIPTU and IMPACT have indicated that they wish to be represented on the interdepartmental committee that is undertaking the review. As Deputies will be aware, it is not normal practice to have trade union representatives on interdepartmental committees that are preparing policy proposals for consideration by Government. In the circumstances, this request was not granted.</P>
      <P>However, there is no question of unions being excluded from this review. On the contrary, the unions representing community welfare staff, SIPTU and IMPACT, were invited to make a submission to the working group last June. This was received last week. In addition, they have been and will continue to be consulted directly at specially convened meetings by my officials during the review. The most recent such meeting took place on 6 September 2000 and the next is scheduled for 29 November 2000.</P>
      <P>The current review is a fundamental appraisal of the scheme aimed at improving customer service and administrative efficiency. It also provides an opportunity to refocus the scheme, and the health boards' community welfare service of which it is part, to become more effective in tackling poverty and social exclusion.</P>
      <P>I expect that the proposals of the interdepartmental committee will be finalised by the end of next year and I am confident that they will address any uncertainty or low morale in the community welfare service.</P>

      <P>Social welfare legislation provides that a person must satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work in order to be entitled to unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance. In applying the legislation, any relevant facts must be considered by the deciding officer. Any circumstances which may affect a person's availability to take up suitable work are relevant, including family circumstances. It is not possible to state the number of cases disallowed in which the child care issue was relevant.</P>
      <P>The Government has highlighted child care as a priority area for investment in the national development plan, with some £250 million being provided under the equal opportunities child care programme, 2000-06, to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform over the next seven years. The focus of this funding is to increase the number of child care facilities and places as well as to provide affordable child care services to parents, particularly women, in disadvantaged areas who wish to avail of employment, training or employment opportunities.</P>
      <P>Under this programme, my Department has received an annual allocation of £5 million to support the provision of out-of-school hours child care services in disadvantaged communities. This will be achieved through projects funded under my Department's community development support programmes and by other local initiatives which apply a self-help, community development approach in tackling issues of poverty and disadvantage.</P>

      <P>The National Economic and Social Forum's opinion on the National Anti-Poverty Strategy contains a number of recommendations in relation to targets for the National Anti-Poverty Strategy, its extension to other areas of the public service, and the further development of the poverty proofing process, which have already been taken on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since it was formed in 1997, this Government has demonstrated a commitment to the process <Col N="167" /> of social inclusion and has introduced policies to help ensure that every individual has the opportunity to participate fully in society. The latest information from the Economic and Social Research Institute, based on the 1998 living in Ireland survey, shows that the number of people in consistent poverty has almost halved from 15%, when the National Anti-Poverty Strategy was launched based on 1994 data, to approximately 8% today, based on 1998 data.</P>
    <P>Our commitment to an inclusive society is reinforced by the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, PPF, which provides for an updating of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy, including a review of the underlying methodology, a review of existing targets and consideration of new targets.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Forum opinion makes a number of recommendations in relation to the extension of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy to local level. These will be considered in the context of the roll out of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy to local authorities, being jointly undertaken by my Department, the Department of Environment and Local Government and the Combat Poverty Agency, under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Four seminars were held earlier this year to initiate this process and the response from local authorities and other relevant bodies has been encouraging.</P>
    <P>In relation to poverty proofing, a review of the poverty proofing process is currently being carried out by the National Economic and Social Council with a view to strengthening that process. Following this review, poverty proofing will be extended on a phased basis to local authorities and health boards.</P>
    <P>The poverty proofing guidelines oblige Departments to &ldquo;indicate clearly the impact of the proposal on groups in poverty or at risk of falling into poverty&rdquo; when preparing a significant policy proposal. As regards the social welfare budget package, the principles of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy are incorporated into ongoing policy development in my Department. This means that key principles like income adequacy, improving work incentives, addressing poverty among the elderly and so on are built into the development of the social welfare budget package from the start and influence its development throughout.</P>
    <P>It is the responsibility of each individual Department to ensure that its proposals are poverty proofed and, as I have outlined above, my Department poverty proofs the social welfare element of the budget package. Overall responsibility for poverty proofing the budget package is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>Following the agreement among the social partners in July 1998 on a pilot poverty proofing system to assess all significant policy proposals for their potential impact on the poor, the Government adopted this process in official Cabinet procedures. To assist in its implementation, the national anti-poverty strategy unit, based in my Department, produced a set of guidelines on poverty proofing which were distributed to all Departments last year.</P>
      <P>The introduction of poverty proofing of significant policy proposals is a major tool in assisting this Government in halting the drift towards a two-tier society by keeping social inclusion to the fore in policy-making at all times. It ensures that Departments are kept aware of the possible implications of policy on those most in need and it is a system to which this Government is committed as part of its strategy on social inclusion. All memoranda for Government and key policy initiatives, for example, the national development plan, upon which significant policy decisions have to be made, are required to be poverty proofed and this has been the case since late 1998.</P>
      <P>In relation to a review of the process, it was agreed with the social partners during the initial discussions that poverty proofing would be reviewed and revised if necessary after a period of one year. The National Economic and Social Council is currently undertaking an independent study of the process. I expect that the outcome of the review will enhance the current process and help address any difficulties that may constrain its effective implementation.</P>
      <P>Following the review, my Department will consider further measures for improving the process, including training and, as provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, will extend poverty proofing arrangements on a phased basis to a local level through local authorities and health boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The UNICEF report, A League Table of Child Poverty in Rich Nations, includes a number of references to the Irish situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="169" /> The report recognises that the Irish approach to poverty reduction may have much to offer and states that the National Anti-Poverty Strategy shows that it is possible to conduct a public debate on poverty, to develop poverty reduction targets that command national support, and to establish social goals alongside economic targets as measures of national progress. The report acknowledges that Irish poverty reduction targets have succeeded in broadening and deepening public debate and in winning a new place for poverty on Ireland's national agenda. UNICEF also acknowledge the value of a framework, provided by the strategy, within which both economic and social policy can be assessed, and within which governmental and non-governmental agencies can work towards common goals.</P>
    <P>The UNICEF report places Ireland in 13th position of 19 countries in terms of absolute poverty and 18th position of 23 countries in terms of relative poverty. Turkey, the UK, Italy, the USA and Mexico are placed 19th to 23rd respectively in the child poverty league.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that much of the data available on child poverty in Ireland relates to the early to mid-1990s and the rate of child poverty has fallen in the late 1990s. In fact, the most recent information available from the ESRI working paper on the 1998 living in Ireland survey results shows that, in 1994, households with children accounted for more than half of all those below the 50% relative income line. By 1998, this had fallen to 28%. However, this Government recognises that much still needs to be done.</P>
    <P>The view that child benefit represents a key instrument for tackling child poverty is widely acknowledged and is fully shared by the Government. The 2000 budget provides for substantial improvements in the monthly rates of child benefit, resulting in a full year increased investment in the scheme up to some £575 million. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, PPF, also contains a commitment to substantially increase child benefit over the lifetime of the programme, with a priority focus towards £100 per month for the third and subsequent children. From September, the basic child benefit monthly rates will have risen to £42.50 in respect of each of the first two children and £56 in respect of the third and subsequent children.</P>
    <P>The best way out of poverty, for both adults and children, is employment. It is Government policy to ensure that everybody has the opportunity to participate fully in society and work is the key to achieving this objective for those who can work. Measures such as the family income supplement have helped encourage parents back into the workforce. By increasing income from work, not just the individuals themselves benefit, but the families and communities in which they live.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides an opportunity to progress a number of policies in relation to the needs of children. Under the terms of framework III of the pro<Col N="170" /> gramme, new targets will be considered under the various themes of the national anti-poverty strategy, including child poverty. These targets are to be considered in consultation with the social partners.</P>
    <P>On a more general note, all policy proposals across Departments are poverty proofed to ensure that the needs of children, among other target groups, are kept to the fore in the design of policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Free schemes are available to people aged 66 or over, people with disabilities and carers who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are either living alone, or who otherwise satisfy the living alone condition. In addition, widows and widowers between the age of 60 and 65 whose late spouses had entitlement to the free schemes retain that entitlement notwithstanding their age.</P>
      <P>Low-income pensioners who are not in receipt of a social welfare type payment also qualify. The weekly income limit fixed for this purpose is the maximum personal rate of old age (contributory) pension &ndash; currently £96 per week &ndash; plus any increases for dependants, plus £30.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have introduced a series of improvements in supports for pensioners over the last three years. In budget 2000 the free schemes were extended with effect from October 2000 to all people aged 75 years or over regardless of income and household composition and to carers in receipt of carer's allowance.</P>
      <P>The fuel schemes are historically different in nature to the free schemes and, therefore, qualification conditions differ significantly. The fuel scheme is a means-tested payment which is not age-related. The free schemes, on the other hand, are mainly payable to certain categories of recipients, such as pensioners, carers and people with disabilities to support care in the community.</P>
      <P>I recognise the importance of fuel allowance to pensioners and I am also conscious of the need to simplify the social welfare system, whenever possible. However, the question of aligning the qualifying conditions for fuel allowance and free schemes has to be considered in the context of the budget and in the light of alternative proposals for delivering improvements in social welfare supports to pensioners and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any changes to extend entitlement to the fuel allowance to all older pensioners in the forthcoming budget would have cost implications that <Col N="171" /> would have to be weighed against other competing expenditure priorities in this area.</P>

      <P>Individualisation exists to a certain extent within the social welfare system. In the social insurance system, those who meet the contribution conditions receive a payment in their own right; and also in the old age non-contributory pension arrangements whereby in the case of a couple, each over age 66, there is a joint means test and payment is then on an individual basis.</P>
      <P>The report of the working group examining the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent families under the tax and social welfare codes, published in August 1999, considered that individualisation of the system could best be achieved through the expansion of social insurance to enable individuals to establish their own direct rights and social welfare entitlements.</P>
      <P>Much has already been achieved in this area over the last 12 years with coverage being extended to the self-employed in 1988, part-time workers in 1991, and new civil-public servants in 1995. In addition, measures were introduced in 1994 to protect the insurance records of those who take time out from the paid workforce for caring duties.   </P>
      <P>One of the objectives of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is to develop proposals to progress the individualisation of social welfare payments in the context of the continuation of joint assessment of means.</P>
      <P>In this regard, a working group on the implementation of administrative individualisation within the social welfare system has recently been established and its first meeting is due to take place on 19 October. The social partners and the Departments of Finance and Social, Community and Family Affairs are represented on the working group. It will be chaired by an official of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>Progress on administrative individualisation will be pursued in the light of the working group's proposals, which I look forward to receiving in due course.</P>

      <P>The back to work allowance, introduced in 1993, is designed to encourage the long-term unemployed to return to the active labour force. The scheme has proved to be a significant success with over 39,000 people currently participating in the back to work allowance and the back to work enterprise allowance.</P>
      <P>An important feature of both schemes is that participants are allowed to retain certain secondary benefits for the duration of the schemes, provided that the gross household income, less the amount received by way of back to work allowance, is less than £250 per week. The majority of participants retain entitlement to these benefits for the duration of the Schemes.</P>
      <P>The issue of what earnings are taken into account by local authorities in connection with continuing entitlement to differential rents is primarily a matter for individual local authorities. I am not aware of particular difficulties in this regard, but I will bring the Deputy's concerns to the attention of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. If the Deputy is aware of particular cases where difficulties have arisen I would be glad to have the necessary details so that I can have the matter examined.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 156 and 737 together.</P>
      <P>In budget 2000 I announced the introduction of the new carer's benefit scheme. This benefit, which will be of 15 months duration, is specifically intended to support people who must leave the workforce to care for someone who is in need of full-time care and attention. It involves two central elements. The first is a weekly income support payment to be operated and paid by my Department. This will be a non-means tested payment based on PRSI contributions paid by the carer. The second is the protection of the carer's employment rights for the duration of the caring period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Tom Kitt, Minister of <Col N="173" /> State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with special responsibility for labour affairs, is currently drawing up carer's leave legislation to protect the employment rights of the carer.</P>
    <P>The carer's benefit scheme will come into effect from 26 October this year. As the scheme is not yet in operation, no applications have been received to date. However, a number of inquiries have been received and application forms will be sent out shortly. It is not possible to indicate the number of persons who may avail of this scheme before April 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The REACH agency is a cross-departmental agency established by the Government to implement a programme for the electronic delivery of integrated public services to citizens. The programme involves the development of a Public Services Broker which would act as the common gateway to public services and would provide common services such as identity validation, storing and sharing of data and secure environment for electronic Government services.</P>
      <P>REACH and the Public Service Broker are about providing the best possible service to customers, allowing them to conduct their dealings with the public service in the ways that best suit their needs. This will allow improvements in service through the traditional channels of contacts in local office and over the telephone as well as making services available through the new electronic channels.</P>
      <P>The REACH programme is a major undertaking that will take a number of years to develop fully and that will involve nearly all public service agencies. It is expected that new information provision elements of the system will start to appear by the end of the year. The overall project is currently at design stage and consultation is under way with various parties involved.</P>
      <P>My own Department has an essential role in the REACH initiative.</P>
      <P>My Department is responsible for allocating and managing the personal public services number which is a key enabler for the integration of public services across the different delivery agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, my Department has the central role in managing the personal data of customers <Col N="174" /> which will be an essential part of the broker's operation.</P>
    <P>The public services card will be further developed as part of the REACH initiative, and my Department will participate fully in the consultation and research involved in its development and will have a key role in the issue and management of the card.</P>
    <P>As well as participation in REACH, my Department is undertaking a major project to transform the way in which it delivers its own services to its customers.</P>
    <P>We are developing a new approach to provide our customers with a more integrated service that is easy to access and that simplifies the process of applying for the range of schemes and services. This new service delivery project is fully in line with the principles of the REACH initiative.</P>
    <P>One of the key access channels to public services is a person's local office. My Department has a wide network of offices that will provide advice and assistance on a wide range of services to customers who call in person or on the telephone. These services will not just be welfare-related because, as part of the development of the broker, local offices will be able to provide information on services provided by other agencies. This is key to saving the customer from the inconvenience of having to visit a number of different offices in order to avail of the full range of services they require.</P>
    <P>A key aspect of improving and integrating public services will be bringing the civil registration system up to the best modern standards. I am pleased to report good progress on the project to modernise civil registration being undertaken jointly by my Department and the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>The launch of the REACH and Public Services Broker projects was the first time that a live webcast was made available within the public service. The number of actual hits registered on the day was small. However, information has also been made available on the REACH website itself, www.reach.ie, and some 3,500 hits were registered on that site in the week following the launch. The information on the site will be updated to reflect progress on the design and provision of services and to provide a communication channel for the parties involved.</P>

      <P>As announced in Supporting Voluntary Activity: A White Paper on a <Col N="175" /> Framework for Supporting Voluntary Activity and for Developing the Relationship between the State and the Community and Voluntary Sector, which the Government published recently, an additional £7 million is being provided to enhance the capacity of the sector to organise itself at national level, to foster the development of additional support and training within the sector and to further support volunteering. This additional funding will come on stream in 2001.</P>
      <P>A detailed breakdown of how this additional funding is allocated is contained in the White Paper and summarised in the attached Table.</P>
      <P>The additional funding is intended to enhance the capacity and structures of the community and voluntary sector as a sector and as a social partner. I might also make the point that substantial additional resources are also being put into the day-to-day work of the sector. Total funding being spent in support of community and voluntary groups has increased from £487 million in 1996 to almost £1 billion in 1999. The amount of money we are allocating to community development, social services, sport etc. has more than doubled since this Government came to office. It will further increase substantially over the life-time of the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>

      <P>The CSO also publishes a monthly analysis of the flows onto and off the live register and a breakdown of the figures by county and social welfare office, distinguishing 125 local offices.</P>
      <P>A more detailed age breakdown, with an analysis by duration of continuous registration, is compiled every six months in respect of April and October. The figures for April 2000 showed that there were 63,600 people signing on for one year or longer.</P>

    <P>An updated industrial earnings series has just been introduced with retrospective annual data back to 1996.</P>
    <P>The data in the table show earnings according to the former series from 1990 up to and including 1996 and according to the new series for years 1996 to 1999. A revised weighting system in the new series has given rise to minor differences between the updated and former series for the retrospective periods. Long-run comparability back to 1990 would be approximately maintained by increasing the average weekly earnings figure in the former series by about £5.</P>

      <P>The millennium recognition awards were established by the National Millennium Committee specifically for locally based and community projects. Some £3 million of the millennium fund was allocated to the initiative for awards of up to £75,000 and it was administered by area development management on behalf of the millennium committee.</P>
      <P>Glinsk Community Council's application for a millennium recognition award was one of the 1,400 applications received. With such a large number of applications and limited funds available, a large proportion of applications could not be supported. Notwithstanding the quality of the national heritage park proposal from Glinsk Community Council, it was not possible to include it amongst those projects recommended for an award.</P>
      <P>At this late stage of the millennium programme, all the funding available for projects is fully committed and the millennium committee is not in a position to consider any further applications.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Replies to correspondence from Members of the Oireachtas, and other correspondence to my private office in the Department, are in general arranged by my office. An initial acknowledgement is issued to the correspondent by my office within two to three days from receipt of the letter, in accordance with standard procedures. Appropriate material for reply is then sought from the relevant division or Department concerned with the subject matter of the correspondence, with the objective of replying substantively within 15 working days of receipt of the letter.</P>
      <P>The current level of staffing in my private office with responsibility, <i>inter alia, </i>for correspondence, is nine. There has been no change in this level of staffing due to the introduction of the Freedom of Information Act, 1998, even though the volume of work has increased as a result. However, it should be noted that the number of FOI requests from Members of the Oireachtas has actually been very small &ndash; on average seven per annum over the period 1998-2000.</P>
      <P>The level of staffing in my Department as at 1 October 2000 is 171. One officer in my Department is responsible for tracking and following up replies to FOI requests, with some assistance at clerical level. The provisions of the Act govern the timeframe and procedures for responses to FOI replies.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 173, 214 and 220 together.</P>
      <P>I published the report of the Competition and Mergers Review Group on 4 May 2000. The group, which was chaired by Mr. Michael Collins SC has made some 40 recommendations on a variety of aspects of competition and mergers legislation, the enforcement of competition law, including the groceries order, and the administration of mergers law.</P>
      <P>In relation to the groceries order, the majority of the review group recommended that: (i) the groceries order be repealed; (ii) any legislation or regulation introduced in relation to the grocery trade should not include a ban on below cost selling; and (iii) some form of regulation be introduced in relation to the grocery trade which would in particular require suppliers to publish the terms on which they are prepared to trade with retailers, would require retailers to honour the credit terms on which suppliers are prepared to trade with them, would ban &ldquo;hello money&rdquo;, and would require retailers not to discriminate between classes of customers in respect of the products which they sell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am at present considering this recommend<Col N="184" /> ation and I will make a decision on it as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs is responsible, <i>inter alia,</i> for enforcing Statutory Instrument No. 257 of 1991 (the Industrial Research and Standards (Section 44) (Petroleum Coke and Other Solid Fuels) Order, 1991. While that office has not been in a position to give details of the number of prosecutions initiated since the order was made, I understand that in 1994 a retailer was successfully prosecuted and convicted for a breach of the order. Also, at the beginning of this year, the ODCA started proceedings against a number of traders for breach of the order. These proceedings were dropped subsequently for reasons unrelated to legal difficulties in relation to the enforcement powers under the order.</P>
      <P>Enforcement is also effected through the provision of information and advice. For example, in February this year, the Director of Consumer Affairs issued a press release warning consumers to be careful when buying petroleum coke and highlighting the requirements of the order.</P>
      <P>An unintended result of the repeal of section 35 of the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Act, 1987, by section 4 of the National Standards Authority of Ireland Act, 1996, was that authorised officers no longer had powers of investigation under a number of statutory instruments made under section 44 of the Industrial Research and Standards Act 1961, including Statutory Instrument No. 257 of 1991.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently examining the feasibility of preparing legislation to remedy this situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>EU generated legislation, in force in Ireland since 1994, has had the effect of opening up EU markets, including the Irish market, to competition from insurance providers based throughout the EU. In addition, I believe the removal of the &ldquo;cap&rdquo; on brokers' commission will encourage further competition in the Irish market. Nevertheless, the level of insurance premiums in the area of public liability are still high enough to give concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been extensive examination of the factors contributing to the relatively high level of premiums focusing on a number of the key cost elements, including the levels of personal injury compensation and the costs associated with settling compensation claims. Concurrent with this examination, efforts are being made to identify <Col N="186" /> measures which both individually and cumulatively could have a moderating effect on insurance costs.</P>
    <P>The 1996 Deloitte &amp; Touche report on the economic evaluation of insurance costs found that the main contributory factors to rising premium costs were the high legal costs component of small claim settlements; the faster rate of medical cost inflation and the high level of general damages awards relative to special damages in smaller claims.</P>
    <P>Following consideration by Government of the Deloitte &amp; Touche report, a special working group was established to advise on the establishment of a personal injuries tribunal and to examine issues surrounding alternative systems of personal injury compensation in operation in other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>I am currently in the process of examining the recommendations contained in the special working group's second and final report on a personal injuries tribunal.</P>
    <P>Apart from Government initiatives, greater attention to safety in the workplace can further reduce insurance costs. Accordingly, I launched the voluntary code of practice adopted by the initiative on workplace safety group, a group representing the key players in the area of accident prevention and claims mitigation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the Motor Insurance Action Group, although the group has not as yet communicated directly with our Department. I understand a good number of the demands of the group relate to the implementation of the WP extended char 4,29Road to Safety strategy and the introduction of a penalty points system for drivers. These are issues, which are being looked at by my colleague in the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The group also proposes the establishment of a non-profit making insurance company, specifically for young drivers with the suggestion that the company be subsidised where necessary by Government. Our Department has no plans to proceed with such a proposal.</P>
      <P>The difficulties being experienced by young people in securing motor insurance and, indeed, the high cost of compulsory insurance cover for young drivers is, I understand, directly attributable to the adverse claims experience of such drivers as a risk category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A report by Deloitte &amp; Touche which evaluated insurance costs in Ireland found that the <Col N="187" /> average cost of an insurance claim for 17 to 24 year old drivers was twice that for the 36 to 40 age group. The report also noted that motorists in the 17 to 24 age group were responsible for over three and a half times the total average claims costs incurred for motorists in the 36 to 40 age group.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the primary focus of initiatives aimed at reducing the cost of motor insurance for young drivers must be on reducing the frequency of accidents and the associated cost of claims. The key to this is to create appropriate conditions for improving their standards of driving and their appreciation of road safety.</P>
    <P>The Motor Insurance Advisory Board, which was re-established by me in 1998, was a major initiative aimed at providing information and advice on trends in motor insurance costs and with policy recommendations for addressing those costs. The board's membership includes a member representing young drivers' interests.</P>
    <P>A number of initiatives are in place and are being taken to improve driving standards and safety awareness amongst all drivers, including young drivers. The Irish Insurance Federation, in conjunction with the Driving Instructors Register, has introduced a scheme of insurance premium discounts for the young driver on completion of a required number of driving lessons. The National Safety Council, in co-operation with the Garda, continues to promote anti-speeding and anti-drink driving media campaigns, including road safety educational programmes for secondary school students.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 179 and 180 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland was among the first Council of Europe member states to sign and ratify the European Social Charter, which was opened for signature by the Council of Europe in 1961. In so doing, Ireland decided to accept all the essential or &ldquo;core&rdquo; provisions of the charter &ndash; Articles 1, 5, 6, 12, 13, 16 and 19. We accepted most of the <Col N="188" /> remaining provisions with the exception of: Article 4 &ndash; The Right to a Fair Remuneration:  (Paragraph 3 &ndash; Equal Pay for Men and Women); Article 7 &ndash; The Right of Children and Young Persons to Protection: (Paragraph 1 &ndash; Minimum Age for Admission to Employment; Paragraph 7 &ndash; Minimum of Three Weeks' Paid Annual Holidays for Workers under 18 Years of Age; Paragraph 9 &ndash; Regular Medical Supervision for Young Workers (under 18) in Prescribed Occupations); Article 8 &ndash; The Right of Employed Women to Protection: (Paragraph 2 &ndash; Prohibition of Dismissal during Maternity Leave; Paragraph 3 &ndash; Allowing Time Off for Nursing Mothers); Article 11 &ndash; The Right to Protection of Health: (Paragraph 1 &ndash; Removing the Causes of Ill &ndash; Health; Paragraph 2 &ndash; Promotion of Health and the Provision of Health Advisory and Educational Facilities); and Article 12 &ndash; The Right to Social Security: (Paragraph 2 &ndash; Maintaining a System of Social Security, which at least equals ILO Standards (ILO Convention No. 102).</P>
    <P>The decision to omit the above provisions clearly reflected the Irish authorities' assessment of social and economic progress in the Republic at that time. However, the intervening years witnessed enormous social changes in Ireland, especially following our membership of the European Communities from 1 January 1973, to the point where today, Ireland should be able to accept the charter in its entirety without significant difficulty. The only outstanding difficulty continues to be with Article 8 &ndash; The Right of Employed Women to Protection (Paragraph 3 &ndash; Allowing Time Off for Nursing Mothers) as our legislation does not cover that at present.</P>
    <P>I might also point out that there are differences of interpretation, particularly in regard to industrial relations issues, where Ireland's voluntarist approach occasionally conflicts with the more regulated approach of continental European countries.</P>
    <P>The Revised European Social Charter was opened for signature in Strasbourg on 3 May 1996. To save time it was proposed to sign and ratify the Revised European Social Charter, thus incorporating the non-accepted provisions of the 1961 charter; the amending protocol of 1988, the additional protocol of 1991 and also some entirely new provisions of the revised charter.</P>
    <P>Ireland has given detailed consideration to the revised charter and I am confident that we will be in a position to sign and ratify it in the near future.</P>

            <entry>20 April, 1989<br />Strasbourg</entry>
            <entry>Council of Europe</entry>
            <entry>Designed to co-ordinate endeavours among the member states of the Council of Europe to tackle the problem of insider trading. Part V of the Companies Act, 1990, introduced statutory provisions to tackle these problems in Ireland and in so doing implemented the EU Directive of 13 November, 1989 co-ordinating regulations on insider dealing. No decision to sign or ratify the convention has been taken.</entry>

            <entry>Designed to provide common rules for the treatment to be accorded to companies and other bodies of each ratifying state in the territories of the other ratifying states. While the introduction of a unified code for the treatment to be accorded to companies proposed in the Convention might have certain advantages, a substantial revision of Irish company law would clearly be involved. The EU programme of harmonising company law governing the formation and operation of limited liability companies addresses many of the areas covered by the Convention. Ireland has concentrated its resources on negotiating and implementing the relevant EU Directives and Regulations. At this point in time, it is not proposed to pursue the question of signing and ratifying this Convention.</entry>

      <P>Statutory instruments are being prepared, or will be prepared, to transpose the EU directives due for implementation by secondary legislation, which are referred to in my reply today to the Deputy's Question No. 188. Details of other statutory instruments being prepared are as set out below.</P>
      <P>Draft Regulations (Suppliers of Life Assurance Order) will be finalised when the Insurance Bill has passed all Stages, later this year. The effect of these regulations will be to require disclosure of information to consumers about charges made by insurance companies and sales intermediaries in respect of life assurance policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Draft regulations are at present being prepared under the Irish Takeover Panel Act, 1997, to widen the panel's remit to cover public limited <Col N="195" /> companies incorporated in the State which are quoted on stock exchanges, other than the Irish Stock Exchange.</P>
    <P>Draft regulations are at present being prepared under the Companies Act, 1990, to require the provision of additional information in the annual insider dealing report of the Irish Stock Exchange.</P>
    <P>A statutory instrument is at present being prepared under the Companies Acts, 1963-1999, to set fees in respect of certain data submitted to the Registrar of Companies by means of computer diskette.</P>
    <P>Revisions to the European Communities (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities) Regulations, 1989-1999, are in preparation for the purpose of: updating the Central Bank's powers to supervise and regulate UCITS, disapplying various company law provisions to UCITS consistent with changes made for Part XIII investment companies in the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1999 and making various miscellaneous changes to the present regulations.</P>
    <P>As part of my consideration of the final report of the Competition and Mergers Review Group, specifically Recommendation No. 40, a draft commencement order has been prepared for my consideration the effect of which would be to abolish the below cost selling provisions of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987. I will make my position on the matter known when I have completed my deliberations.</P>
    <P>My officials are currently awaiting from the Office of the Parliamentary Draftsman a draft of a statutory instrument which will set out in law the timescales within which the Competition Authority will be required to deal with agreements related to the sale of an undertaking or the business of an undertaking.</P>
    <P>A Consumer Information (Advertisements for Airfares) Order, 2000, is to be made under the Consumer Information Act, 1978. The purpose of the proposed order is to enhance the transparency of advertised airfare prices and their availability.</P>
    <P>Trade Marks (Madrid Protocol) Regulations, 2000 &ndash; the Madrid Protocol is an international treaty under the aegis of the World Intellectual Property Organisation. It provides for a simple and inexpensive method of obtaining international registration of a trademark. At present companies in Ireland wishing to obtain protection for trademarks abroad must apply for registration individually in each of the countries concerned. The purpose of these regulations is to provide for the implementation of the Madrid Protocol in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Trade Marks Act, 1996 (Section 66) Regulations, 2000 &ndash; Community trademarks are valid in all EU member states. They are registered by <Col N="196" /> the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market, OHIM, based in Alicante, Spain. It is possible for an earlier trademark registered in Ireland to subsequently become a Community trademark. In such cases the proprietor of the Community trademark may claim the seniority of the earlier Irish trademark.</P>
    <P>When seniority is claimed in this way OHIM notifies the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks. These regulations provide for the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks to record notifications of such seniority claims in the register of trademarks.</P>
    <P>An order is being prepared under the provisions of section 1 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000, for the purpose of commencing the Act. Consideration as to what other orders may need to be made under the provisions of that Act is ongoing in my Department.</P>
    <P>A statutory instrument entitled European Communities (Control of Exports of Dual-Use Goods) Regulations, 2000, to give effect to Council Regulation (EC) No. 1334/2000 of 22 June 2000, setting up a Community regime for the control of exports of dual-use items and technology, is being prepared.</P>
    <P>A statutory instrument entitled European Communities (Prohibition on the Importation into the Community of Rough Diamonds from Sierra Leone) Regulations, 2000, to give effect to Council Regulation (EC) No. 1745/2000 of 3 August 2000, is being prepared.</P>
    <P>A code of practice and accompanying ministerial regulations under section 6 of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, which will allow young persons &ndash; 16 and 17 year olds &ndash; to work until 11.00 p.m. in licensed premises and catering establishments, is being prepared.</P>
    <P>Ministerial regulations under section 8 of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, which will allow bar apprentices work until 12 midnight, are being prepared.</P>
    <P>Ministerial regulations amending the European Communities (Safeguarding of Employees Rights on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations, 1980 (S.I. No. 306 of 1980) are being prepared. These regulations provide for the representation of employees in the absence of a trade union, staff association or excepted body and to provide for a right of appeal to a rights commissioner where an employer contravenes Regulation 7 of the 1980 Regulations (Information and Consultation of Employees).</P>
    <P>Ministerial regulations entitled European Communities (Protection of Employment) Regulations, 2000, which amend the Protection of Employment Act, 1977, as amended to provide for representation of employees in the absence of a trade union, staff association or excepted body and to provide for a right of appeal to a rights commissioner where an employer contravenes <Col N="197" /> section 9 or 10 of the Act of 1977 (Information and Consultation of Employees in relation to proposed collective redundancies), are being prepared.</P>
    <P>The Organisation of Working Time (Records) (Prescribed Form and Exemptions) Regulations, 2000 &ndash; the proposed effect of these regulations will set out the type and form of the records which employers need to keep under the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, and exemptions from the need to keep such records. The details of these regulations are currently being discussed with the social partners.</P>
    <P>Draft regulations with revised forms are being prepared to update and revise the statutory forms used to make claims-applications to the insolvency payments scheme under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984.</P>
    <P>A statutory instrument entitled European Communities (Machinery) Regulations, 2000, is being prepared to consolidate previous machinery directives which have been transposed into Irish law.</P>
    <P>Prompt Payment of Accounts Act, 1997 (2 S.I.s) &ndash; One statutory instrument will be made to update the Schedule to the Act. The Schedule contains a list of public bodies to whom the Act applies. A second statutory instrument will be made to change the interest rate applicable to late payments under the Act.</P>
    <P>Cement (Repeal of Enactments) Bill, 1999 (1 S.I.) &ndash; It is expected that this Bill will complete remaining stages during the next Dáil term and should be then signed by the President. A commencement order will have to be made to bring the Act into operation.</P>
    <P>A statutory instrument entitled Dangerous Substances (Retail and Private Petroleum Stores) Amendment Regulations concerning licensing of petrol stations is being prepared.</P>
    <P>A statutory instrument entitled Chemical Weapons (Licensing of Schedule Toxic Chemicals and Precursors) Regulations, 2000, concerning the implementation of a system to allow importation, possession and use of certain Schedule 1 chemicals (Chemical Weapons Act 1997), is being prepared.</P>

      <Quest> the Acts or sections or other provisions of Acts under the auspices of her Department or for the commencement of which her Department is responsible which have not commenced by reason of the fact that a commencement order has not been made; if she has any plans to make such an order in each case; if so, when; the reason for the failure in each case to make such an order to date; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in relation to the question put by the Deputy is as follows:</P>
      <P>The Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 2000, which was enacted in July 2000, awaits commencement. It is expected that commencement will take place before the end of the year. The commencement order has not yet been made because it will be necessary to make a number of other orders and regulations prior to commencement in order to ensure that various elements of the legislation are capable of operating in practice. The terms and scope of these orders are currently under consideration.</P>
      <P>Section 2(2) of the Competition Act, 1991, provided, <i>inter alia,</i> that different days could be fixed for the repeal for different purposes of any provision of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972. To date no commencement order has been made providing for the repeal of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987, an order made under the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972.</P>
      <P>Recommendation No. 40 of the final report of the Competition and Mergers Review Group, received by me earlier this year was to the effect that the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987, be repealed.</P>
      <P>I will make my position on that matter known when I have completed my deliberations on the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 248 and 249 of the Companies Act, 1990, provide for matters relating to the delivery of documents to the Registrar of Companies in legible and non-legible form. The commencement of section 248 has recently been requested by the <Col N="199" /> Registrar and is being considered. The need to commence section 249 will be reviewed in the light of the Electronic Commerce Act, 2000.</P>
    <P>Sections 46 to 52, inclusive, 68(1)(<i>c</i>), 120(5) and 122(1)(<i>f</i>) of the Credit Union Act, 1997, have not yet been commenced. Consideration will be given to their commencement on foot of a request to do so from the Office of the Registrar of Friendly Societies, following that office's discussions, which are ongoing, with the credit union movement.</P>
    <P>Commencement orders in respect of sections 18, 19, 20, 36, 37 and 38 of the Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Act, 1998, have not been made. The staff of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland are currently employees of Forfás on terms and conditions which provide, <i>inter alia,</i> for superannuation benefits. The above provisions would allow for the separate employment by these agencies of their own staff and for necessary provision of superannuation benefits to those staff. I have no immediate plans to bring these provisions into effect. In regard to commencement of section 50 of the Act, transfer of staff from Forfás to NSAI, there are ongoing discussions between all the parties concerned in regard to the transfer of the staff of Forfás, who are currently assigned to the National Metrology Laboratory, to the National Standards Authority of Ireland, which I expect to be completed early next year.</P>
    <P>The Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road Act, 1998, which was sponsored by the Minister for Public Enterprise, was signed into law by the President on 2 December 1998. Detailed regulations, which are necessary to give operational effect to the provisions of the Act, are currently being prepared by the Health and Safety Authority, in co-operation with my Department and in consultation with all relevant interested parties. The regulations are complex and involve roles and responsibilities for a number of Departments and other public bodies in order to ensure their adequate implementation and enforcement. The preparatory work is now awaiting finalisation of Department of Environment and Local Government input and as soon as the regulations are finalised the necessary order to bring the Act into operation will be made.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972, (No. 10 of 1972) dealing with provisions in relation to the safety of explosives has not been commenced. This part, <i>inter alia,</i> would make the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, rather than the Minister for Justice, Equality and <Col N="200" /> Law Reform, responsible for explosives safety and the making of regulations in connection with same. The issue of State security has delayed the commencement order on this Part of the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, automatically repealed specific provisions of existing enactments on safety and health &ndash; Factories Act, 1955, Safety in Industry Act, 1980, Office Premises Act, 1958, Mines and Quarries Act, 1965, Dangerous Substances Acts, 1972 and 1979, and the Safety, Health and Welfare (Offshore Installations) Act, 1987 &ndash; from 1 November 1989, both in relation to sections as a whole, or certain provisions relating to penalties. The section, in conjunction with section 1(2), also provides for the repeal of all remaining provisions of these enactments, together with the Boiler Explosions Acts, 1882 and 1890, subject to the making of commencement orders under section 1 (2) of the Act in respect of any of those enactments or any of their provisions.</P>
    <P>Three such repeals orders have been made to date including the Safety, Health and Welfare at work (Repeals and Revocations) Order, 1995, (S.I. No. 357 of 1995). This Order, <i>inter alia,</i> repealed the Office Premises Act, 1958, in full and repealed 46 sections in full and seven sections partially of the Factories Act, 1955. The order also revoked 55 sets of regulations in full and partially revoked 12 sets of regulations made under a range of statutes. The purpose of the exercise was to avoid overlapping or duplication between different statutory provisions and to remove enactments that had become obsolete. The legislation is currently under review to identify further provisions that may be considered for repeal at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 189, 190 and 191 together.</P>
      <P>The following are details of the committees, boards, companies or other bodies which the Deputy requires:</P>
      <P>Existing &ndash; Non-statutory:</P>
      <P>In February this year I set up the Company Law Review Group, CLRG, a group charged with developing proposals for the review and reform of company law<b>. </b>The group has been set up on an interim basis pending its being given a statutory existence on foot of enactment of the Company Law Enforcement Bill, currently before the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I established the review group on auditing following the first report by the Committee of Public Accounts of the parliamentary inquiry into DIRT, which proposed that a number of areas of possible reform in the auditing pro<Col N="212" /> fession should be examined. It is not proposed to establish this body on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>CROlink, the Companies Registration Office Users' Council, was established in January 1996. There are no proposals to give CROlink a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>The Foreign Earnings Committee was established by Government decision in 1993, and further restructured in 1994. Its function is to assume responsibility for co-ordinating the promotional activities of all the agencies and Departments with representation overseas.</P>
    <P>The Asia Pacific Strategy Group was established under the auspices of the Foreign Earnings Committee following the adoption by the Government of the Strategy for Long-Term Development of Foreign Earnings in Asia in 1999. It oversees the implementation of the strategy.</P>
    <P>The Trade Advisory Forum is a consultative body chaired by the Minister of State with responsibility for labour, trade and consumer affairs. Its purpose is to provide a forum for consultation between the export sector and the relevant Departments and state agencies and to act in an advisory capacity to the Minister in determining policy.</P>
    <P>As the fourth, fifth and sixth bodies serve consultative or co-ordination functions, they do not have a statutory basis and it is not intended to give them one.</P>
    <P>An inter-departmental and agency group was established on a non-statutory basis to oversee Ireland's participation in EXPO 2000. As the group will expire shortly, since its mandate will come to a natural end once EXPO 2000 is over, the question of establishing it on a statutory basis is not relevant.</P>
    <P>The Competition and Mergers Review Group, the report of which I published on 4 May 2000, was established by my predecessor in September 1996. This group finalised its work earlier this year.</P>
    <P>The European Consumer Centre offers advice to consumers on their rights in respect of both domestic and EU legislation as well as being a resource location for information on cross-border consumer protection matters. The centre was first launched in December 1996, <Col N="213" /> and since January 1999 it operates as an independent company. There are no proposals to have it given a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>In 1997, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment established the Patents Office Users Council to consider and report to the Minister on the administration of industrial property protection by the Patents Office and to advise on appropriate changes and innovations in the operation of the office. There are no proposals to give a statutory basis to the Patents Office Users Council at this time.</P>
    <P>Implementation Group on the Forfás Report on E Commerce &ndash; the Policy Requirements: the report on E Commerce &ndash; The Policy Requirements was published in July 1999, by Forfás at my request. This group was set up in October 1999, to oversee the implementation of the recommendations in the report. There are no proposals to have this group function on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>Inter-departmental eEurope Action Plan Group: the &ndash; eEurope 2002 Action Plan &ndash; was agreed by the European Council at Feira in June 2000. The aim of the action plan is to increase Europe's competitiveness by exploiting the opportunities of the new digital economy and in particular the Internet. The above group was set up in September 2000 to co-ordinate Ireland's response to the implementation of the recommendations in the action plan. There are no proposals to have this group function on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>On 22 February 2000 a timber industry development group was launched. There are no proposals to give the group a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>The eWork Action Forum was established to provide a focal point for the ongoing development of an environment which will stimulate telework/ework employment opportunities and ensure that this method of working achieves its full potential in contributing to economic growth and an improved quality of life. The forum was established on a non-statutory basis and it is not intended to establish it on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>The National Competitiveness Council was established on a non-statutory basis &ndash; there is no intention of giving it statutory backing.</P>
    <P>A national minimum wage monitoring Committee has been set up to monitor implementation of the provision of the National Minimum Wage Act. There are no plans to give the committee a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>A national framework committee has been set up under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The purpose of this national framework is to identify actions to be undertaken by the social partners at national level that support family friendly policies in the workplace. There are no plans to give the committee a statutory basis.</P>

      <P>The latest quarterly national household survey, which was published by the Central Statistics Office on 12 September 2000, shows that there have been positive labour market developments in the Border areas as a whole with growth in employment and falls in unemployment in the 12 months to second quarter 2000. During this period the fall in the unemployment rate, at over two percentage points, was greater in the Border region, which includes Donegal, than the fall in the unemploy<Col N="216" /> ment rate of 1.4 percentage points for the State as a whole.</P>
      <P>The key to reductions in unemployment rests with job creation. Industrial development in particular areas of the country is a day to day matter for the industrial development agencies and not one in which I have a direct function. The need for more balanced regional development has been brought to the core of IDA Ireland's agenda since it has committed to seek to increase the Objective 1 region's share of jobs in Greenfield Projects from 25%, at present, to 50%. IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland have, moreover, reorganised their Donegal based services to deal with regional issues including actions arising from the Donegal task force report.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by the clothing and textile industry in Donegal but neither the industry nor the development agencies would equate current difficulties with a state of collapse. In recognition of current difficulties, however, both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland have reorganised their Donegal-based services to deal with regional issues, including actions arising from the report of the Donegal Employment Initiative &ndash; the task force established in 1998 following the announcement of job losses at Fruit of the Loom in Donegal.</P>
      <P>IDA is actively seeking to increase the Objective 1 region's share of jobs in Greenfield projects from 25% (at present) to 50%.</P>
      <P>In April of this year Enterprise Ireland, in conjunction with Údarás na Gaeltachta and Donegal County Enterprise Board, organised a seminar for the clothing and textile industry on the theme &lsquo;The Way Forward'. The purpose of the seminar was to outline some new ideas and best practice for the industry.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland has recently articulated a clear regional development mission and will be devoting greater resources to boosting the indigenous sector and the potential for high growth firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is currently undertaking a strategic review of the Irish knitwear industry in conjunction with the Irish Knitwear Exporter's Guild, IKEG. Its primary objective is to examine the current position of Irish knitters and to assess their capabilities, strengths and weaknesses, and to develop a growth strategy. Other initiatives planned to support the clothing industry in the county include: implementation of a Donegal Clothing Promotion over the next six months in <Col N="217" /> conjunction with Donegal CEB and Údarás na Gaeltachta and introduction of an eNetworking group across Ireland, including Donegal, to facilitate sharing of information, contacts and ideas due to commence over next six weeks.</P>
    <P>In early September the Minister, Deputy McDaid, announced the Enterprise Ireland supported investment by Clubman Omega with the creation of 37 new jobs. This announcement will see the investment of over £1 million by Clubman in Inishowen in a move which will see them take over an IDA building used by JayBee in Carndonagh. This is Clubman's second expansion this year.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is currently in discussion with several companies, new and existing, in Donegal in relation to new investments. It has recently approved funding for a meat plant at Carrigans, Donegal which will lead to the creation of nearly 40 new jobs.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the combined efforts of all those involved in implementing the recommendations of the report of the Donegal Employment Initiative will ensure that progress continues in the county.</P>

      <P>The immediate priority of the Donegal employment initiative was to facilitate re-entry to employment or retraining for all those who lost their jobs in Fruit of the Loom and other plants in Donegal in recent times. A programme of registration interviews was organised by FÁS and all of the redundant workers were offered re-training opportunities.</P>
      <P>The longer-term priority of the Donegal employment initiative was to draw up a set of recommendations for establishing Donegal as a prime, competitive and attractive location for job creation. The report of the task force presents a detailed analysis of the development challenge facing the county and recommends a seven year development strategy to implement the investment priorities identified. On receipt of the report, the Government decided that all relevant Departments should examine the report and consider the investment priorities it proposed in drafting the operational programmes of the National Development Plan, 2000-06.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met the chairman and members of the task force on 23 November 1999 and 17 February 2000 to discuss follow-up action arising from their report. We agreed that an appropriate mechanism was needed to oversee the implementation of the priority actions identified in the report and to liaise with Departments and State agencies in advance of setting up the operational programmes to implement the National Develop<Col N="218" /> ment Plan. We further agreed that the county development board would provide the framework within which such follow-up mechanisms could be readily devised. The chairman of the task force undertook to establish a framework aligned to the structure of the county development board to enable the various agencies which were involved in the work of the task force to meet and co-ordinate their efforts at local level. I am satisfied that progress can be made on this basis.</P>

      <P>Motor insurance underwriting criteria are normally based on underwriting experience including trends in the level, frequency and cost of claims for particular risks and classes of risk and are a matter of judgment by individual private insurance companies. Any changes in circumstances affecting the risk insured would have to be assessed by the insurer from an underwriting standpoint and the premiums charged would reflect any material increase in the risk. Increasing use is being made by insurers of technology in segmenting risk categories into more discrete groupings.</P>
      <P>While I understand that drivers over 70 do not necessarily represent a worse than average risk, each case is treated individually.</P>
      <P>The Equal Status Act, 2000, sponsored by my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and which was enacted on 26 April 2000, prohibits discrimination in the non-employment area on grounds of age &ndash; and on eight other specified grounds &ndash; and it gives those who are discriminated against a statutory means of redress. The Act has a broad-ranging scope covering provision of goods and services including that of insurance.</P>
      <P>However, under provisions in section 5(2)(<i>d</i>) of the Act, exemptions apply in the treatment of persons in relation to annuities, pensions, insurance policies or any other matters related to the assessment of risk provided there is reasonable actuarial or statistical data as the basis for those differences or other relevant underwriting or commercial factors.</P>
      <P>Under section 25 of the Act, it is a matter for the Director of Equality Investigations to investigate complaints of discrimination. Once the Act is in operation, a complaint of alleged discrimination, on any of the discriminatory grounds, may be made to the office of the director.</P>

      <P>A Lotus notes based system is used in the Department which enables my office and both Minister of State's offices to capture and monitor the status of correspondence received. The following type of detail is held on the system: date received; subject matter; officer to whom correspondence has been forwarded; date for reply; date reply issued. The system is used as a tool to monitor, maintain and follow up in relation to representations received. The system also monitors replies which are outstanding beyond this date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, there are two people in each ministerial office involved in handling representations from Members of the Oireachtas and the public. <Col N="220" /> The advent of Freedom of Information has not had an effect on staffing levels in my office and in the offices of Ministers of State, Deputies Tom Kitt and Noel Treacy. As a general guideline, a final reply should, where possible, issue within two weeks of acknowledgement of the initial correspondence.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the need for my office to respond in good time to correspondence received both from the Oireachtas and, indeed, from all sources. Accordingly, I have asked my Department to accelerate the process of responding to correspondence and to automate this to the fullest possible extent. At the moment, my Department is embarking on a trial project involving a scanning facility including storage of images of the scanned documentation and, an electronic facility to route the attendant correspondence to relevant officers for reply. The expectation is that this will eliminate a lot of the paper trail and attendant delivery delays currently experienced in routing correspondence for reply.</P>

      <P>In July 1999 I was notified, pursuant to the Merger and Takeover (Control) Acts, 1978-1996, of the proposed acquisition by Princes Holdings Limited, trading under the name Irish Multichannel, of Suir Nore Relays Limited. In September, 1999 I was notified of a related proposal under the Acts, which involved Liberty Media AL Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Media Corporation, acquiring Aringour Limited, which owned Cable Management Ireland Limited at the time. Liberty Media has a 50% holding in Princes Holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following consideration of the proposals under the Merger and Takeover (Control) Acts, 1978-1996, I referred both proposals to the Compe<Col N="226" /> tition Authority for further investigation pursuant to section 7 of the Mergers Act. The Competition Authority carried out an investigation, and recommended that both proposals proceed without conditions. I accepted the authority's recommendations and allowed the proposals to proceed under the Merger Acts.</P>
    <P>With regard to breaches of competition law, this area is governed by the Competition Act, 1991, and the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996. The Competition Act, 1991, prohibits anti-competitive practices and the abuse of a dominant position. Under section 6 of the Act, persons aggrieved in consequence of anti-competitive activity have the right to pursue a civil action for damages. The Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, introduced public enforcement provisions and penalties for breaches of competition law. To enforce the competition acts, a Director of Competition Enforcement was appointed to the Competition Authority to whom aggrieved persons may make a complaint requesting that the alleged breach be investigated.</P>

      <P>The process for the transposition of Directive 96/35/EC into Irish law is at an advanced stage with negotiations among interested Departments and agencies on a draft prepared by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government nearly completed.</P>
      <P>It is expected that Directive 96/35/EC will be transposed by the end of the current year by the European Communities (Safety Advisers for the Transport of Dangerous Goods by Rail and Road) Regulations, 2000.</P>
      <P>However, albeit that the regulations are not in place, it has to be recognised that the Health and Safety Authority has an examination scheme in place for over a year and there are already over two hundred dangerous goods safety advisers qualified and employed directly or on a consultancy basis.</P>

      <P>IDA Ireland recently met the company to discuss the decision <Col N="228" /> to close the facility in early December 2000. IDA Ireland was informed that every attempt to keep the facility operating profitably had been exhausted and the decision to close the company was final and irreversible.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland has worked closely with the company over the past decade in attempting to identify suitable joint venture partners compatible with its product expertise and to secure sub-contract work from a number of overseas consumer product companies. A number of these potential clients entered into direct discussions with the company. However, due to the competitive nature of the business, these discussions did not prove successful.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland has a property policy in place which does not permit the purchase of factories from companies which cease their operations in Ireland. IDA will endeavour to secure a suitable client for the facility in Drogheda. However, the premises is in the ownership of the company and the company has indicated to IDA that it will be placing the facility for sale on the open market.</P>
      <P>The company was approved grant assistance of £2.316 million from IDA Ireland of which £1.56 million has been paid. Contingent liability attached to these grants has expired.</P>
      <P>The company indicated its intention to close the facility in Drogheda on 15 September 2000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 204 and 205 together.</P>
      <P>The community employment programme, CE, provides work experience for long-term unemployed persons for a period of one to three years. CE participants in schools projects are employed as secretaries, caretakers and classroom assistants. The administration of the CE programme including the allocation of places and renewal of projects is a matter for FÁS, as part of their remit under the Labour Services Act, 1987, therefore, it would not be appropriate to comment on individual projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="229" /> My Department, in the context of the commitment under section 4.2.4 of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, is engaged in ongoing discussions with the Department of Education and Science with a view to determining how to transfer all or part of the funding currently spent on CE schemes in schools to that Department. This would provide an increase in funding for schools over and above the additional resources already allocated by the Department of Education and Science for these purposes over the past year.</P>
    <P>The precise nature of the scheme to be implemented is at present under consideration in the Department of Education and Science, having regard to the needs of the different elements of the schools sector. While there may be some short-term reduction in funding for schools due to the CE restructuring and the need for FÁS to prioritise projects, the proposals under consideration in the Department of Education and Science would result in increased annual funding for schools on a more permanent basis than that which has been provided up to now through CE.</P>
    <P>I would hope to have proposals ready for consideration by the social partners through the PPF standing committee on the labour market later this month. The consultation process should be completed and proposals agreed and set in train by the year-end.</P>

      <P>The consultancy review of JI carried out on behalf of my Department in 1999 recommended that the current qualifying conditions remain unchanged for the foreseeable future, on the basis that demand for the programme would be sufficient without any alteration in the qualifying conditions. This position will be kept under review by my Department.</P>

      <P>The Government decided at its meeting of 19 January 2000 to establish an independent group to examine allegations of anti-competitive practices in the beef industry. The group were to report to me by 28 April 2000. However, the group requested extra time to carry out their investigation and I acceded to this.</P>
      <P>I received the report of the independent group on 11 September 2000. The group's report concludes that they have found no evidence of anti-competitive behaviour either in the pattern of cattle prices or in profits. Indeed, the report states that there is evidence from various sources that on average the industry is one of low profitability.</P>
      <P>The report also concluded that changes in retail prices are fully explained by the combined movement in farm-gate prices and post-farm gate prices and that there is no scope for alleged manipulation of prices by wholesalers and retailers.</P>
      <P>The group also made the following recommendations: that an annual census of the economic performance of the food and drinks industry, as has been carried out in Northern Ireland since 1989, be initiated in the Republic; that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development should bring forward proposals designed to modernise the meat inspection system; that the status of collective negotiations, as sought by the farming organisations in the dispute that led to the Inquiry, be clarified in the context of section 4(1) of the Competition Act, 1991, and Article 81(1) of the Treaty of Rome; and that every means be used to promote integrated action in the food industry where farmer, processor and retailer work in harmony to meet consumer requirements.</P>
      <P>Both myself and my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, informed Government of the report at its meeting on 20 September 2000. I published the report on 21 September 2000.</P>
      <P>I intend writing to the Competition Authority to seek its views in relation to the third recommendation above and my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, intends bringing proposals shortly to Government in respect of the other recommendations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 208 and 211 together.</P>
      <P>Section 7 of the Employment Agency Act, 1971, provides than an employment agency shall not charge any fees or expenses in respect of services rendered in the course of the business, in excess of a scale approved by the Minister. The agency is also required to prepare and submit a scale of such fees to the Minister for approval.</P>
      <P>Section 7 further provides that a person carrying on the business of an employment agency shall not charge any fee solely for agreeing to seek employment for another person or solely for agreeing to seek persons who will give or accept employment.</P>
      <P>All employment agencies when applying for a licence must submit their scale of fees to the Minister for approval. Licences are only issued when this and other conditions of the 1971 Act and regulations thereunder are fulfilled to the full satisfaction of my Department. These conditions are designed, in the main, to ensure that only persons who are of good character are granted licences to carry on the business of an employment agency. As a consequence of the above procedures, no employment agency was found to be in breach of section 7 of the 1971 Act in the 12 months ending 30 September 2000.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will wish to be aware that in 1999 a total of 447 licences were issued while, to 30 September 2000, 252 licences have been issued.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 209 and 210 together.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Employment Agency Act, 1971, a person shall not carry on the business of an employment agency except under, and in accordance with, a licence under that Act.</P>
      <P>The primary instrument by which employment agency activity is monitored/regulated is the licensing scheme itself. Licences are issued to applicants only when they have fulfilled, to the full satisfaction of my Department, the relevant governing conditions as laid down by the 1971 Act and by regulations made there under.</P>
      <P>These conditions are designed, in the main, to ensure that only persons who are of good character and who carry on employment agency business from premises which are suitable for that purpose are granted licences. In assessing applications, my Department operates a policy of strict adherence to all of the licensing criteria. Monitoring activity also involves the checking of daily newspapers to ensure that employment agencies which advertise are licensed in accordance with the Act.</P>
      <P>There has been one prosecution of an employment agency for operating without a licence under the 1971 Act over the past five years. This prosecution took place earlier this year.</P>
      <P>With regard to complaints, the Deputy will wish to know that during the past 12 months, my Department received a number of telephone complaints and inquiries regarding the operation of employment agencies. In all cases, the provisions of the 1971 Act were explained to complainants and it transpired that there was no breach of the Act involved in any of these cases. As a result, follow up action by my Department was not called for, and a record of the exact number of such complaints was not maintained.</P>
      <P>I should add, however, that in the event of a complaint against a particular agency requiring further follow-up action the labour inspectors of my Department, of which there are 17, are empowered under the Act to investigate any such complaint. Such an investigation would normally result in a visit to the premises of the agency involved.</P>

      <P>The nominal dur<Col N="234" /> ation of apprenticeship is four years. With the exception of those who fail or refuse to attend training, the vast majority of apprentices complete their training within this period. However, issues have arisen in regard to the timeliness of provision of off-the-job training at phases two, four and six of the seven phase standards-based apprenticeship system. These delays vary by trade, geographical location, and the date on which the apprentice was registered with FÁS.</P>
      <P>Currently, concerted efforts are under way to reduce waiting times. All apprentices are being offered a phase two training place within the first year of their apprenticeship. The number of apprentices currently eligible to attend for phase four and six training stands at 2,830, all of whom will be offered training by January 2001.</P>
      <P>FÁS has introduced a number of measures designed to provide all apprentices with more timely off-the-job training. The number of training places for phase 2 has been increased from 3,300 places annually as at September 1996 to a current provision of 7,060 places. The Department of Education and Science has increased the number of phase four and six training places from 4,100 places annually as at September 1996 to a current provision of 9,500 places. The institutes of technology provided an additional 750 phase 4 and 6 training places during summer 2000. FÁS has also contracted for the provision of 660 phase four electrician training places in the ESB. FÁS has also introduced a number of administrative changes to working procedures that have significantly improved attendance at training. These changes have resulted in an effective further increase in training capacity.</P>

      <P>The necessary consultations with other Departments on the report of the interdepartmental group on modern biotechnology have been completed. The report will be presented to Government in the near future. Following its presentation to Government, the report will be published as quickly as possible on my Department's website.</P>
      <P>The interdepartmental group has conducted a wide-ranging review of the issues and sought to produce a balanced report which takes account of the benefits and risks of modern biotechnology. Its report will contribute to the continuing public debate about genetic modification and modern biotechnology.</P>

      <P>The length of time taken to deal with an application for a work permit to employ a non-European economic area national will always depend on the individual circumstances of the case concerned. In the first six months of this year the average monthly number of applications received was about 1,420 which was a significant increase on the level in the same period for 1999. After a considerable effort by my Department involving the allocation of three additional staff, procedural simplification and overtime working, the processing time was reduced to about 15 working days by late July.</P>
      <P>However, the numbers of applications received in July, August and September were 1650, 2,116 and 2,366 respectively. This level of increase, combined with staff turnover has clearly placed pressure on resources and the processing time has been pushed out to about six weeks. A range of streamlining and organisational initiatives are being taken to speed up the processing of applications and this will be supplemented by further staff increases as appropriate. My objective is to get processing time down to around one week.</P>

      <P>The policy on prices followed by this Government, and by all Governments since price controls were abandoned in the 1980s, is that prices should be set by competition in the marketplace. To ensure that competition operates in the marketplace, the Competition Authority is charged with fostering competition in all sectors of the economy and combating anti-competitive practices. I have approved five additional posts for the authority &ndash; two economists and three lawyers &ndash; which will increase the authority's professional staffing level by approximately 70%. This demonstrates the Government's commitment to ensuring that competition law is vigorously enforced and that competition operates to the benefit of consumers.</P>
      <P>To ensure that the situation regarding staffing is tackled comprehensively, my Department, together with the authority, is currently involved with outside consultants in a study of the authority's operations with a view to having its future resource requirements assessed. All staffing issues are being dealt with in the study.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, I am aware that there are differences in interpretation of the statistics on food price inflation, both for those foods covered by the Groceries Order and those which are not. I understand that the Competition Authority are in consultation with RGDATA to clarify the matter further.</P>

      <Quest> the submissions, representations or discussion she has held with a company (details supplied) concerning the Planning (Retail Shopping) Directive, 1998, and the draft retail planning guidelines, 1999; the date and time of those discussions and representations; her responses to any such points made in this regard; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, made the directive referred to in June, 1998. The draft retail plan<Col N="246" /> ning guidelines were prepared by consultants and issued in April, 1999 by Deputy Dempsey, who has primary responsibility in this area. Deputy Dempsey invited all interested parties to make submissions to his Department for consideration before finalisation of the guidelines. Submissions were made to the consultants and to Deputy Dempsey, a number of which were also copied to my Department for information. A submission, by the company referred to was copied to my Department in 1999. I did not respond to this submission.</P>
      <P>On 3 June 1998 I received, from the company referred to, a copy of a letter dated 2 June 1998 and addressed to the Taoiseach, which related to the directive. I did not respond to that communication.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by my officials, I have met the company referred to on 25 May 1998, 19 March 1999 and 29 June 2000 to review progress made by the company in relation to the undertakings given by the company to the Irish Government in 1997. These discussions, while wide-ranging, have focused on commitments relating to purchases of product by the company from Irish suppliers, as verified by annual surveys carried out by the ESRI, on the company's commitment to development of Irish suppliers, and on its commitment to grow the business in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have agreed with Deputy Dempsey that further analysis would be carried out on the likely impact of the guidelines in relation to competition, prices, consumer choice and the supplier base. To this end, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, and my Department have jointly commissioned a study to examine these issues. The results of this study together with the submissions made by interested parties following publication of the draft guidelines will help inform the final policy position on retail development to be pursued by the Government via the planning system. Where planning issues arose in discussions with the company referred to, they were apprised of this position.</P>

The commissioners were advised that the deposit of material or undertaking of works, or the disturbance of material, on the foreshore is governed by the Foreshore Acts, 1933 to 1998, which provide severe penalties for anyone convicted of unauthorised deposit of material or undertaking of works on, or unauthorised disturbance of, the foreshore. The commissioners were also informed that any operations or activities not already specifically licensed or permitted under these Acts must cease forthwith and that failure to do so would give rise to court proceedings. My Department is actively pursuing the matter.</P>

      <P>The chief executive officer of the Western Regional Fisheries Board informs me <Col N="248" /> that he met the person concerned on 5 September 2000 regarding flooding from the Bunowen River in County Mayo. The board informs me that the Bunowen River is a spate river capable of generating flash floods. The board also informs me that it proposes to carry out general fisheries development work in the river in 2001 and a consequence of this work may be a reduction in the flood risk. The board has also suggested to the person concerned that a possible solution to the flooding problem could be the construction of a flood defence wall around his premises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to proposed statutory instruments being prepared in or under the auspices of my Department is set out as follows:</P>
      <P>Maritime Safety and Environment</P>
      <P>1)Draft Merchant Shipping (Passenger Ship Construction &amp; Life Saving Appliance) Rules, ships of various classes. The proposed statutory instrument will set out construction rules and rules governing the type of life saving appliances to be carried on board for passenger ships in various classes &ndash; mainly 11A-VI.</P>
      <P>2)Draft merchant shipping (radio installation) rules and merchant shipping (radio installations survey) rules. The proposed statutory instrument will give effect to amendments to Chapter IV of the Safety of Life at Sea Convention, SOLAS, and will extend the GMDSS, global maritime distress and safety system, to vessels between 150 and 300 tons. The MS (Radio Installation Survey) Rules go hand in hand with the radio installation rules and are required to enable the Department to legally carry out surveys on GMDSS ships.</P>
      <P>3)Draft merchant shipping (load line) rules. The proposed statutory instrument will give effect to amendments to the 1966 International Convention on Load Lines. It will provide mainly for the structural survey of vessels to establish their sea worthiness and the issue of load line certificates which are required internationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="254" /> 4)Draft Fishing Vessel Regulations (12 to 24 metres category and six to 12 metres category). The proposed statutory instruments will set out vessel construction regulations and life-saving appliance regulations for fishing vessels in the 12 to 24 metre and six to 12 metre categories. The proposed regulations are based on the recommendations of the Fishing Vessel Review Group.</P>
    <P>5)Draft passenger boat safety regulations. The proposed statutory instrument will set out safety regulations for passenger boats including sea-angling boats.</P>
    <P>6)The following instruments are necessary to give effect to the amendments contained in the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) (Amendment) Act, 1998, and will replace existing instruments made under the 1988 Act which is the Principal Act: Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) (Insurance of Ships) Regulations, 2000. Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) (Convention Countries) Order, 2000</P>
    <P>The regulations provide that ships specified in section 16 of the 1988 Act, that is, those which carry 2,000 tonnes or more of crude or fuel oil shall have insurance against pollution damage which will meet the requirements of the Minister in accordance with section 10 of the 1988 Act as amended by section 6 of the 1998 Act &ndash; namely, the revised levels set out in the 1992 Protocol to the Civil Liability Convention). The order sets out the countries which have to date accepted the Civil Liability Convention and the Fund Convention as amended by the 1992 Protocols.</P>
    <P>7)It is also proposed to introduce a statutory instrument to formalise the designation of north west European waters as a special area under Annex 1 of the International Convention for the Prevention of <Col N="255" /> Pollution from Ships (MARPOL 73/78). Special area status covers the North Sea, the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea, the English Channel and the Continental Shelf west of Ireland and Scotland. With effect from 1 August 1999, it means a total prohibition on the discharge of processed bilge water from machinery spaces.</P>
    <P>Marine Leisure and Research</P>
    <P>8)Draft Merchant Shipping (Personal Watercraft and Fast Powercraft) Regulations, 2000, to regulate the use of personal watercraft (for example jetskis) and fast powercraft, in relation to age restrictions, carriage of safety equipment and the making of bye-laws by statutory authorities. Expected to be in place by year end.</P>
    <P>Aquaculture Policy Division</P>
    <P>9)European Communities (Aquaculture Animals and Fish) (Placing on the Market and Control of Certain Diseases) Regulations, 2000. The effect of the regulations will be to transpose Council Directive 98/45/EEC concerning the animal health conditions governing the placing on the market of aquaculture animals and products.</P>
    <P>Coastal Zone Administration</P>
    <P>10)Work is under way to replace the Skin Diving for Shell Fish Bye Law No. 533 (1966) to allow licensed aquaculturalists to harvest their own licensed produce by skin diving. The aim is to have this done within a few months. It is not possible at this stage to say if any other statutory instruments will be required in relation to CZAD matters.</P>
    <P>Sea Fisheries Policy</P>
    <P>11)The preparation and implementation of statutory instruments is an ongoing requirement for the effective regulation and management of certain fisheries which would typically involve either the setting of boat quotas and/or the opening or closure of fisheries for conservation purposes.</P>
    <P>Petroleum Affairs Division</P>
    <P>12)Possible need for primary legislation to give effect to certain provisions relating to access to upstream gas pipelines under Directive 98/30/EC of 22 June 1998 concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas. The advice of the Attorney General's office is being sought at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="256" /> Sea Fisheries Administration</P>
    <P>13)Regulations will be made in respect of the Management of Shellfish Production Areas, amending the European Commission (Live Bivalve Molluscs) (Health and Conditions for Production and Placing on the Market) Regulation, 1996, (S.I. No. 147 of 1996).</P>

      <P>The Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act, 2000, No. 14 of 2000, sections 1 to 43, provides for the enactment by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources of a new legislative regime to regulate the entire area of marine casualty investigation in Ireland. The key feature of this new regime will be the establishment of an independent marine casualty investigation board which will carry out investigations and publish reports of their findings within a specified statutory timeframe. My Department is currently working on the administrative arrangements necessary to set up the board and it is intended that a commencement order will be made to commence sections 1 to 43 of the Act as soon as these arrangements have been put in place.</P>
      <P>Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997, No. 23 Section 13 re. period for determination of applications for aquaculture licences. The clearance of considerable arrears of aquaculture licence applications arising under earlier legislation is the priority; the question of commencing section 13 will be reviewed early in 2001 in the light of progress at that stage in clearing these arrears.</P>

      <P>Council Directive 99/35/EC on a system of mandatory surveys for the safe operation of regular ro-ro ferries and high-speed passenger craft services will be implemented by way of statutory instrument and is expected to be transposed shortly.

      <P>Transposition of Council Directive 98/45/EC amending Directive 91/67/EC concerning the animal health conditions governing the placing on the market of aquaculture animals and products will be by way of statutory instrument. Transposition is overdue. Reasoned opinion has been delivered by the Commission, pursuant to Article 226 of the EC Treaty, relating to the failure by Ireland to notify the Commission of measures taken to implement directive into national law.</P>
      <P>Council Directive 98/30/EC of 22 June 1998 concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas. Certain provisions &ndash; relating to upstream pipelines &ndash;  have yet to be transposed into Irish law. Some sections of the directive will be implemented by the Department of Public Enterprise. There are discretionary elements in the directive and the advice of the Attorney General's office is being sought on whether primary legislation is required to implement the directive.  The directive was due for transposition on 10 August 2000. No action has been taken by the European Commission to date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish fishermen are experiencing considerable difficulties at the present time as a result of increased fuel costs. The fishing industry is exceptionally exposed to increased fuel prices because of the relatively high proportion of fuel costs to overall costs. The industry, in common with other fishing industries in other member states is rebated excise and VAT on marine diesel. As a result fuel cost increases directly reflect movements in the supply price. Fuel costs to the fishing sector have doubled since January <Col N="259" /> 1999, with a 30% increase between January and August 2000.</P>
      <P>I have a very clear understanding of the scale and severity of the problem and I am continuing discussions with the industry and with my colleagues in Government on ways to tackle the difficulties. Options to alleviate the situation including the fishing industry's proposals are being urgently assessed having regard to overall Government strategies and approaches to the fuel issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue to which the Deputy refers relates to a design for a submerged vessel locator buoy which was first brought to the attention of my Department by the developer, Mr. John Kelly, Moville, County Donegal, in August 1996, and was forwarded to the Department's technical experts in the marine survey office for their consideration. Since that time, the marine survey office has provided Mr. Kelly with advice, both orally and in writing, in relation to his product and in particular, on the technology which would be required, such as the attachment of a suitable locator beacon, in order for it to be considered as an effective means of marking the location of a sunken vessel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that Mr. Kelly is now seeking the <Col N="260" /> approval of my Department so that he can proceed with the marketing of this piece of equipment. The marine survey office's only role in approving safety equipment is to ensure that such equipment fitted on Irish registered vessels complies with our domestic legislation for vessels operating in Irish waters and with the International Maritime Organisation's Safety Of Life At Sea Convention (SOLAS) for vessels on international voyages. While there are provisions in our legislation requiring the carriage of emergency position indicating radio beacons, EPIRBs, on certain types of vessels, including fishing vessels, there is however no requirement in either our legislation or in SOLAS which requires the fitting of locator buoys like the one designed by Mr. Kelly on vessels. Consequently, there is no mechanism by which my Department can certify this locator buoy in accordance with SOLAS, nor is there any formal approval process which allows for the endorsement of the product by my Department.</P>
    <P>While my Department does not have a role in approving Mr. Kelly's product, I assure the Deputy that I particularly welcome the initiative shown by him in developing his idea. I am thankful to him for bringing his concept to my attention and I wish him well with the further development and marketing of his product.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest>the procedure, system and resources used in his Department for replying to correspondence from Members of the Oireachtas; the staff numbers involved; if the numbers have been reduced since freedom of information requests were introduced; if staff were diverted to freedom of information cases; if a tracking or follow up system exists; if there is a rule or guideline for sending replies other than acknowledgements; the standard in this regard; the way in which it is monitored; his views on whether responding to requests from Oireachtas Members is an integral part of the democratic system; and if he has any proposals to improve this service.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has a comprehensive system for logging, tracking and replying to correspondence from Members of the Oireachtas. All correspondence received is immediately acknowledged and logged on databases in my office or the Minister of State's office. It is then forwarded to the relevant divisions within the Department for preparation of a detailed response. The databases provide tracking of correspondence by name, date and subject and there is a reminder system in place for unanswered correspondence. The system is administered by the staff in my office and the Minister of State's office and approximately the equivalent of three full time staff are employed on this task. No staff <Col N="261" /> have been diverted from this work to freedom of information cases.</P>
      <P>Timely, efficient and comprehensive liaison and interaction with members of the Oireachtas are important functions of my Department. In accordance with the Department's customer action plan 1998, it is Department policy to reply to letters and correspondence within two weeks. If it is not possible to give a full reply within this timescale, it is the policy to issue an interim reply. While the Department's customer action plan is currently under review I am satisfied with the existing plan for dealing with Members of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>Matching funding has been provided for a pilot scheme for the set-aside of salmon draft nets and a salmon trap on the Munster Blackwater. This scheme is being administered by <Col N="266" /> the Southern Regional Fisheries Board in co-operation with the relevant stakeholders. The scheme is based on agreements by the holders of salmon fishing licences with the Southern Board not to exercise their rights to fish in exchange for monetary compensation.</P>
      <P>In addition, discussions are taking place involving the Southern Board and all relevant stakeholders on a similar pilot set aside scheme for drift nets in the Suir and Blackwater estuaries. My Department has indicated that it is favourably disposed in principle towards such a pilot scheme. I understand that the southern board, the salmon licence holders and the other stakeholders hope to be in a position to present a fully developed and costed proposal for consideration by my Department prior to the commencement of the commercial fishing season 2001. A voluntary scheme, if agreed, will be considered for matching funding, having regard for all relevant criteria &ndash; including level of participation &ndash; and in consultation with the National Salmon Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>All merchant vessels of any significant size must be registered. There are over 140 ship registers in operation worldwide. Ship registers impose obligations on ship owners regarding maintenance, crewing standards and certification of those matters by the flag state or inspection bodies duly authorised by the flag state. I am advised that the practice of using flags of convenience or, involving what is perceived as lenient regulatory requirements, is permissible under international law.</P>
      <P> The International Maritime Organisation is establishing internationally agreed safety and manning standards which are enforceable on ships calling at member state's ports. The European Commission has developed proposals to mandate minimum conditions for the manning of ships using EU ports, and, for the hours worked by seafarers on such ships and these will come into effect before July 2002.</P>
      <P>Foreign registered vessels using Irish ports are inspected regularly by the marine survey office of my Department in the exercise of Ireland's port State control obligations. These inspections are aimed at ensuring that such vessels are maintained and operated in compliance with international safety standards laid down by the International Maritime Organisation. Deficiencies identified are brought to the attention of the owner and flag state administration, and, must be rectified before the ship continues its journey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="267" /> The recently established Irish Maritime Development Office, which was set up to help develop the shipping industry and the shipping services sector, will, <i>inter alia,</i> be working to develop the attractiveness of the Irish ship register as an alternative to the various flags of convenience.</P>
    <P> The Deputy can be assured that international safety and manning standards will continue to apply to all vessels operating on the Irish ship register.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware a major independent review of the State's 16 commercial regional ports, including Kinsale harbour, was published last year. The review develops a general strategic framework for the ports and harbours concerned which aims to maximise their financial sustainability, their contribution to strategic maritime policy objectives and socioeconomic impacts. Following publication of the review a full consultative process was initiated in order to give all stakeholders and interests a chance to comment on the recommendations of the review in advance of any decisions being made.</P>
      <P>In Kinsale's case the independent consultancy review recommends that the harbour be transferred to Cork County Council. The harbour commissioners have indicated that while not opposed to the transfer to the local authority, a number of issues need to be clarified in advance including future investment needs and levels of local input and consultation under any new operational/management structure.</P>
      <P>Kinsale Harbour Commissioners have produced an integrated development plan which was co-financed by my Department. Proposed developments have been costed at some £5 million. This is currently being considered by my Department in the context of competing demands from other regional commercial ports which were the subject of the overall independent review. My Department has already agreed to provide a grant of some £500,000 to Kinsale Harbour Commissioners for the completion of urgent remedial works to repair the main pier at Kinsale and to support the planned eight metre extension to the pier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the harbour commissioners' plan the Adams Quay Development which has received planning permission, was costed at just over £1 million, so as to provide enhanced facilities for the fishing <Col N="268" /> fleet and separate the commercial and fishing trades in day to day operation.</P>
    <P>Ice plant provision is predicated on completion of the pier and consideration of the requirements arising. The existing ice plant in Kinsale has been recently upgraded at a cost of £100,000. This plant is transportable and could be relocated to Adam's Quay, if required. Any decision to move the existing ice plant or establish a new one cannot be undertaken until construction of the pier has begun.</P>
    <P>The development of the fish landing jetty at Adam's Quay has not been included in the prioritised fishery harbour development programme under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. That programme is drawn up by my Department, following the examination of submissions containing prioritised lists of works by local county councils. The scope for funding under the fisheries programme could be re-examined when finalisation of future management of the harbour is completed.</P>

      <P>The application for funding under the Tourism Angling Measure 1994-1999 to which the Deputy refers was received by the Central Fisheries Board in June 1999. The TAM concluded at the end of December 1999 and it is not possible to approve funding for this project at this stage. However, as the Deputy may be aware, £24 million has been allocated under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, for the development of tourism and recreational angling and the association concerned will be eligible to apply for funding under this new Measure when it is operational later this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 248, 250 and 251 together.</P>
      <P>The Statute of the International Criminal Court was concluded at Rome on 17 July 1998 and was signed, subject to ratification, by Ireland on 7 October 1998. It will enter into force approximately two months after 60 states have become party to it. My information is that, to date, 112 states have signed the statute and, of these, 20 have ratified it.</P>
      <P>With regard to enabling Ireland to ratify the statute, I understand that an amendment to the Constitution will be required and that the drafting of a Bill containing a proposal for such an amendment is now in progress.</P>
      <P>In connection with the actual ratification process itself, apart from the need to amend the Constitution and, therefore, the need for a referendum approving such an amendment, an in-depth analysis of the statute by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform together with my Department, the Office of the Attorney General and other appropriate bodies will also be necessary to determine the exact legislative and administrative measures which may need to be adopted in order for Ireland to be in a position to meet its obligations under the Statute.</P>
      <P>Ireland continues to be represented at all of the ongoing preparatory commission meetings of the ICC whose purpose is to deal with matters necessary for the effective operation of the court when the statute enters into force. While I am currently not in a position to give a precise indication as to the time frame within which all the necessary measures will be adopted, I can assure the Deputy that the prompt ratification of the statute will continue to be given a high priority by my Department.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is concerned at reports that the escalating conflict between the forces of the Government of Sri Lanka and secessionist Tamil elements &ndash; the LTTE, Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam &ndash; has resulted in serious human rights violations by security forces in some areas. Reported abuses include extrajudicial killings, disappearances, torture, arbitrary arrests &ndash; including short-term mass arrests &ndash; and detentions. These indicate a failure by the security forces to comply with the protective provisions of the Government's emergency regulations. On the other side, the LTTE have behaved as an authoritarian military regime in the areas under their control and have routinely and grossly violated human rights both within and outside these areas. Violations include civilian massacres through <Col N="270" /> indiscriminate attacks and bombings, illegal and arbitrary arrests and detentions, torture and ethnic discrimination. A further particularly abhorrent abuse of human rights by the LTTE is their large-scale forcing of young persons of both sexes into terrorist actions and attacks against the Government forces and civilian population.</P>
      <P>Although the Constitution of Sri Lanka provides for freedom of speech and expression, the Sri Lankan Government restricts these rights in practice. The Government limits the access of domestic and foreign media to information and continues to censor news relating to the military and security situation. It has not so far reformed the press law and privatised government-owned media as promised during the 1994 election campaign. The EU has made known to the Sri Lankan Government its concerns about such restrictions and called for their lifting as soon as possible.</P>
      <P> It is my understanding that the Sri Lankan Government has started to take some positive steps to control such human rights abuses. The national Human Rights Commission, HRC &ndash; established by Act of Parliament in 1996 &ndash; continues its operations in eleven offices around the country. In 1998, the Government also established, at cabinet-level, the committee to inquire into undue arrest and harassment, CIUAH. The CIUAH has a mandate to investigate complaints associated with alleged harassment and arrests and other security force actions. It appears that some results are now being achieved. Security forces are reported to be receiving instruction in international humanitarian law as part of their training courses and the army has established human rights cells in each division, and human rights offices in each brigade and battalion. The test of such measures, however, will be their effect in bringing to an end the abuses I have described above.</P>
      <P>The ongoing conflict between the Government and the secessionist Tamils remains a fundamental problem which overshadows the entire country and which has to be resolved. The EU has called on the secessionist forces to end their indiscriminate acts of violence and to enter into negotiations with the Sri Lankan Government. The EU has also urged the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflict in the framework of Sri Lanka's territorial integrity. The conflict in Sri Lanka will only be solved ultimately through a political solution, reflecting the fact that although the Tamils are a minority in the country as whole, they are in the majority in the North. It is therefore incumbent on the Government and Opposition parties of Sri Lanka to reach a consensus on how to address this problem.</P>
      <P>The conflict in Sri Lanka has not proven amenable so far to international mediation. But the Government of Norway has offered its good offices as mediator of the talks, should they take place, and the EU fully supports Norway in this endeavour.</P>

Several ways of providing further guarantees in the field of equality and non-discrimination through a protocol have been proposed for some years by various groups and bodies. Ireland supported the adoption of the draft Protocol No. 12 to the European Convention on Human Rights during its different stages. Protocol No. 12 which broadens the field of application of Article 14 of the ECHR and provides for a general prohibition on discrimination, was finally adopted in June of this year.</P>
      <P>The protocol will open for signature in Rome on 4 November 2000 on the occasion of the commemorative ceremony for the 50th anniversary of the European Convention on Human Rights. Discussions are currently under way with relevant Government Departments with a view to signature of the protocol on that occasion.</P>

      <P>The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was signed by Ireland on 1 October 1973 and ratified on 8 December 1989. Upon ratification, Ireland made reservations to Articles 6(5), 10(2), 14, 19(2), 20(1) and 23(4).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reservation entered to Article 6(5), regarding the death penalty, was withdrawn. On 24 August 1998, Ireland transmitted notification of the withdrawal of the reservation to Article 14(6) and the reservation to Article 23(4) of the Covenant to the Secretary General of the United Nations. The enactment of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1993, which makes legislative provision for compensation of miscarriages of justice, rendered Ireland's reservation to Article 14(6) of the Covenant, which provides that such compen<Col N="272" /> sation may be made by administrative rather than by legal means, unnecessary. The reservation to Article 23(4), which arose out of the former prohibition on divorce, was withdrawn further to the amendment of Article 41 of the Constitution and the subsequent enactment of the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>Ireland maintains the following reservations to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. These reservations are kept under review. The reservation to Article 10, paragraph 2 &ndash; the Article deals with the segregation of accused persons from convicted persons and the segregation and treatment of juvenile offenders &ndash; states &ldquo;Ireland accepts the principles referred to in paragraph 2 of article 10 and implements them so far as practically possible. It reserves the right to regard full implementation of these principles as objectives to be achieved progressively&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The reservation to Article 14 states &ldquo;Ireland reserves the right to have minor offences against military law dealt with summarily in accordance with current procedures which may not, in all respects, conform to the requirements of article 14 of the Covenant&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The reservation to Article 19 paragraph 2, states &ldquo;Ireland reserves the right to confer a monopoly on or to require the licensing of broadcasting enterprises&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The reservation to Article 20, paragraph 1 &ndash; the Article deals with the prohibition of propaganda for war &ndash;  states &ldquo;Ireland accepts the principle in paragraph 1 of article 20 and implements it as far as it is practicable. Having regard to the difficulties in formulating a specific offence capable of adjudication at national level in such a form as to reflect the general principles of law recognised by the community of nations as well as the right to freedom of expression, Ireland reserves the right to postpone consideration of the possibility of introducing some legislative addition to, or variation of, existing law until such time as it may consider that such is necessary for the attainment of the objective of paragraph 1 of article 20&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 254, 257, 258, 260, 261, 262 and 267 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland has signed or ratified the following international multilateral human rights instruments since 26 June 1997: the Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on Involvement of Children in Armed Conflicts and on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography; the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. In relation to international human rights instruments originating from the Council of Europe in the same period I refer the Deputy to my response to Question No. 256.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which Ireland signed in 1968, the necessary legislation, namely the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the Equal Status Act, 2000, has been enacted. Ratification of the convention is proposed in the coming months. Given the large number and range of international human rights instruments in existence or under negotiation, signature or accession may not necessarily be under active consideration in respect of all such agreements at any given time. The situation is kept under review in the context of the ongoing assessment and prioritisation of Ireland's international commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has not signed the UN International Convention against the taking of hostages, 1979; the UN Convention on the Protection of the <Col N="274" /> Rights of Migrant Workers and Members of their Families of 1990, which is not yet in force; the UN International Convention Against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries of 1989, which has 16 signatories; the UN Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity of 1968, which has ten signatories, or, the European Convention on the Non-applicability of Statutory Limitation to Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes of 1974, which has four signatories. The question of ratification does not arise, therefore, at this point.</P>

The rights elaborated by this protocol principally concern equality issues, and these are primarily the responsibility of the Department of Justice, Equality, and Law Reform, the Department of Health and Children, and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The Department of Foreign Affairs plays a co-ordinating role. Discussions are currently taking place with the relevant departments with a view to ratification of Protocol No. 7 and it is my hope to be in a position to deposit the instrument of ratification with the Council of Europe very shortly.</P>

There have been no signatures or ratifications of this convention since 1970. The primary framework in Europe for the peaceful settlement of disputes is provided by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Accordingly, the question of ratification by Ireland of the Convention has not been receiving active consideration.</P>

      <P>The United Nations Convention on the Law of Treaties was done at Vienna on 23 May 1969 and entered into force on 27 January 1980. The United Nations Convention on the Law of Treaties between States and International Organisations or between International Organisations was done at Vienna on 21 March 1986 but has not yet entered into force. Ireland proposes to accede to both conventions. Before the State may become party to the conventions however further consideration of their terms will be necessary due to their complexity and no date has been set by which Ireland will become a party to them. In any event, I should point out that many provisions of both conventions merely codify existing rules of customary international law by which Ireland is already bound in its treaty relations with other states and with international organisations. I am satisfied that while it is desirable that Ireland <Col N="276" /> should in due course become party to both conventions, our international relations are not adversely affected by the fact that we have yet to accede to them.</P>

      <P>Ireland became a party to the Statute of the International Court of Justice upon joining the United Nations in 1955, an act fully consistent with Ireland's commitment, under Article 29.2 of the Constitution, to the peaceful settlement of international disputes. However, in view of the possible legal consequences of doing so at that time we did not then make a declaration under Article 36(2) of the statute accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the court.</P>
      <P>Now that a means has been found for regulating and resolving the sovereignty dispute over Northern Ireland, the Government are favourably disposed to accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. A thorough consideration of the modalities of making such a declaration is currently under way within my Department.</P>
      <P>In the meantime it should be borne in mind that, pending the making of such a declaration, the court may nevertheless exercise jurisdiction in disputes where there is a specific agreement between the parties that the court should do so or where specific treaties so provide. It should also be borne in mind that other forms of dispute settlement may be more suitable in certain cases.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 265 and 266 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been made aware by the Attorney General of his presentation of the second national report submitted under Article 40 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to the UN Committee on Human Rights in Geneva on 13-14 July 2000. The conclusions of <Col N="277" /> the committee, which were received on 26 July, have been circulated widely and are available in the Library of the House and on the Department of Foreign Affairs website.</P>
    <P>In his presentation of the report, which was submitted to the committee on 29 September, 1998, the Attorney General gave an update on the very significant developments since then in the area of human rights legislation. He mentioned in particular the Human Rights Act, the Equal Status Act, the Employment Equality Act and the National Disability Authority Act. The Attorney also drew attention to pending legislation in the following areas: disabilities, where a Bill covering access to public bodies, services and participation in the administration of justice will be enacted; rights of children, including an ombudsman for children; incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into Irish law; mental health; the establishment of an independent prisons authority; and the reform of the law relating to defamation.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General also gave the committee a brief description of the commitments entered into under the Good Friday Agreement, with particular emphasis on its human rights provisions. He drew attention to the Government's undertaking to &ldquo;bring forward measures to strengthen and underpin the constitutional protection of human rights&rdquo; and that &ldquo;these proposals will draw on the European Convention on Human Rights and other international legal instruments&rdquo;. Progress on implementation of these measures was also reported to the committee.</P>
    <P>The committee, in its concluding observations communicated to us on 26 July, recorded its appreciation of &ldquo;the high quality of the report of Ireland, which was comprehensive, responded to the concluding observations made by the committee after the examination of the initial report. The committee also appreciated the additional oral and written information provided by the State party delegation during the examination of the report; this information was highly instructive and enhanced the dialogue between the Committee and the delegation. Furthermore the committee welcomed the publication and wide dissemination of the report by the Government and its willingness to involve non-governmental organisations in the process&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The main concerns expressed by the committee related to: a guarantee of Covenant rights in Irish law; the Garda Complaints Board; the Special Criminal Court; detention under the Drug Trafficking Act; participation of women in political, social and economic life; exemptions permitted under the Employment Equality Act; circumstances in which women may legally obtain an abortion; prison conditions; changes in the law regarding asylum seekers; and living standards and low level of participation of the Travelling community in national political and social life.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General at the conclusion of the examination informed the committee that progress was being made in many areas of concern <Col N="278" /> to them, such as the Garda Complaints Board, the Special Criminal Court, the Offences Against the State Act and prison conditions and that particular issues which had been raised had been dealt with. The standing interdepartmental committee on human rights &ndash; whose establishment the Committee had welcomed in their concluding observations &ndash; will be meeting in the very near future to consider all of the concerns and recommendations of the committee.</P>
    <P>Finally, the committee requested that the third periodic report be submitted by 31 July 2005 and that it should give particular attention to the issues raised in relation to the second report. Arrangements will be made to comply with these requests.</P>
    <P>Question No. 267 taken with Question No. 254.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 269, 270 and 271 together.</P>
      <P>As I have pointed out in previous replies to similar questions on this subject, there is a very large number and variety of international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral, already in existence going back over a number of years. New proposals for draft international agreements are constantly being put forward for discussion and negotiation.</P>
      <P>Consideration is given on an ongoing basis to the desirability of Ireland signing, or becoming a party to, those agreements which it has not already signed. In addition, it is often the case that the subject matter of an international agreement relates to the area of work of other Government Departments whose views must be taken into consideration in deciding whether or not Ireland should sign or become party to a particular international agreement. In many cases it will be necessary for other Departments to introduce new domestic legislation or put in place new administrative arrangements in order to allow Ireland to fulfil its obligations under an international agreement. In some cases an amendment to the Constitution may be required.</P>
      <P>Given the large number and range of international agreements in existence or under negotiation, signature or accession may not necessarily be under active consideration in respect of all such agreements at any given time. The situation is kept under review in the context of the ongoing assessment and prioritisation of Ireland's international commitments.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has a query concerning Ireland's position with regard to a particular international, or proposed international agreement, I will be happy to provide him with more detailed information.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 272 to 274, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals for legislation being prepared under the auspices of this Department where heads have not yet been approved by the Government. On 3 May 2000 the Government authorised me to arrange for the drafting of a bill containing a proposal to amend the Constitution in order to enable the State to ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Drafting of this Bill is now under way. While I am not yet in a position to give a precise indication as to a time frame for publication, my Department continues to attach a high priority to this matter.</P>
      <P>Particulars of proposed statutory instruments being prepared in, or under the auspices of this Department, are as follows. A Government order to be made under the Extradition Act, 1965, as amended, is being prepared in my Department. The main purposes of the order are to consolidate existing orders made under section 8(1) of the Act and to implement into domestic law international obligations undertaken by the State with respect to extradition in a comprehensive manner.</P>
      <P>A Ministerial order to be made under section 4(3) of the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act, 1991, is being prepared in my Department. The effect of this order will be to update the list of states which are contracting states for the purposes of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, 1980, following a number of recent accessions to that Convention.</P>
      <P>A statutory instrument &ndash; Diplomatic and Consular Fees Regulations, 2000 &ndash; which will consolidate and amend the Diplomatic and Consular Fees Regulations, 1982 to 2000, is also being prepared in my Department. The Diplomatic and Consular Fees Regulations set the fees to be charged for issuing passports and visas and for the provision of other consular services by this Department and by embassies and consulates abroad. There have been 13 amendments to the regulations since they were last updated and consolidated in 1982. Furthermore, many of the services, for example, those relating to ships and seamen, are no longer required. For these reasons it is proposed to make a simplified, more user-friendly consolidated version of the regulations.</P>

      <P>There are five bodies under the aegis of my Department which were established otherwise than pursuant to statute or statutory instrument.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 280 and 290 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By bearing witness to the atrocity committed at La Union, San Jose de Apartado, Department of Antioquia, in north west Colombia on 8 July, Fr. <Col N="283" /> Brendan Forde has helped to raise awareness of the terrible violence which has been afflicting that country for a very long time, and which has even further intensified during the past decade.</P>
    <P>In my initial statement following the events at La Union, I emphasised the necessity for all concerned to make a commitment to respect human rights and to engage in the peace process initiated by President Pastrana of Colombia.</P>
    <P>I raised the situation of Fr. Forde and the peace community at La Union with the Colombian Foreign Minister, Dr. Guillermo De Soto. We have also been in contact with EU resident embassies in Bogota and with the US State Department. Prior to President Clinton's recent visit to Colombia, the Taoiseach sent him a message setting out our concern about La Union. At the Millennium Summit in New York, the Taoiseach met President Pastrana of Colombia and, against the background of hopes for the peace process, expressed our concern that everything possible should be done to ensure the safety of Fr. Forde and the people of La Union. Subsequently, our Ambassador based in Mexico City visited Bogota to present credentials on a secondary basis there. President Pastrana personally confirmed to him that an investigation into the 8 July killings is well under way. The investigating commission was set up following consultation between the Colombian vice-President, who has special responsibility for human rights, and representatives of the peace community, with the participation of the Intercongregational Commission for Justice and Peace. Investigators from the offices of the Attorney General and State Prosecutor visited the area. The Bogota office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights was also involved.</P>
    <P>During his visit to Bogota, our ambassador was also informed that additional security measures requested by the community at La Union are also in hand. These include road repairs, better lighting and radio links.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to monitor the situation at La Union as well as the progress of the investigation against the background of the efforts being made to advance the peace process in Colombia.</P>

This book drive constitutes a part of the larger book drive to which the Deputy refers, for the Masaka Kitabiro library. The Deputy will be aware that the Irish Government is strongly committed to Uganda and that our aid programme there amounts to almost £10 million in 2000.</P>

      <P>Rosemary Nelson was brutally murdered in a car-bomb attack in Lurgan on 15 March 1999. This <Col N="285" /> murder was an attack on a dedicated and committed defence lawyer and human rights defender. It also represented a fundamental assault on the legal system itself.</P>
      <P>On 29 March 1999, the Deputy Chief Constable of Norfolk, Colin Port, was appointed to lead the investigation into her murder, an investigation which is still ongoing. Colin Port has made several public appeals for information and made arrangements to be contactable directly. I sincerely hope that this investigation will be successful in bringing the perpetrators to justice.</P>
      <P>Officials from my Department remain in close contact with the British authorities in relation to the investigation. They also maintain close contact with human rights organisations, both at home and abroad, with members of Rosemary's family and with other interested parties.</P>
      <P>A number of human rights organisations as well as Rosemary's husband, Paul, have called for an independent judicial inquiry into all the circumstances surrounding the murder.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that it is now 18 months since Rosemary's death. Since then, the Government has repeatedly emphasised that the investigation must be thorough, transparent and independent, and be seen to be so. The central concern in relation to the current investigation is that it should be structured and operated in such a way that all potential witnesses or those with relevant information can feel free to come forward, and I would encourage them to do so at the earliest possible opportunity. We consider the investigation to be the essential starting point for any possible future inquiry. It is essential that the truth be established into all the circumstances surrounding the murder of Rosemary Nelson. The British Government have made clear that no option has been ruled out in relation to this case and I welcome that.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue to monitor the progress of the investigation very closely and, in this context, will keep under active review the question of calling for an independent, public inquiry.</P>

      <P>Robert Hamill died on 8 May 1997, following an attack in Portadown. RUC officers were in the vicinity at the time. Six people were charged in 1997 in connection with his murder, five of whom were released. One person was charged with causing an affray but not murder. Following an RUC investigation into the actions of RUC officers on the night in question, which was supervised by the Independent Commission for Police Complaints, ICPC, the DPP decided not proceed with the prosecution of any of the RUC officers involved. The RUC Chief Constable is currently considering, under the supervision of the ICPC, <Col N="286" /> whether or not disciplinary action against the officers in question is warranted. The RUC file on the case remains open.</P>
      <P>On 7 June last, the coroner decided not to proceed with an inquest because of concerns for the safety of certain witnesses, whose evidence would have been crucial to a complete account of the circumstances of Mr Hamill's death.</P>
      <P>On 7 June 2000, the Taoiseach met Prime Minister Blair and, in the course of the meeting, they discussed the Hamill case. The following day, he met with members of the Hamill family. Afterwards, the Taoiseach stated that the case was a matter of urgent public interest and that the issues of concern involved must be resolved in a manner which would command the confidence of the community, through an independent, judicial public inquiry. The Government continues to monitor closely developments in Mr Hamill's case and to pursue its concerns actively with the British authorities.</P>

The preface to the plan states: &ldquo;We need to build a state for social justice, which will protect all our citizens and uphold their right to life, dignity and property, freedom of belief, <Col N="287" /> opinion and the press . . . . we have to reduce the causes and provocations of violence by opening new paths to social participation&rdquo;. The plan encompasses the peace process; new approaches to the economy; counter-drugs strategy; reform of the justice system and protection of human rights and democratisation and social development.</P>
      <P>The plan envisages overall expenditure of $7.5 billion, $4 billion of which is to be provided by the Colombian government, with 75% of all moneys to be allocated to socio-economic, human rights and institution building programmes. President Pastrana has appealed for a total of $3.5 billion in assistance from the international community.</P>
      <P>In July 2000 the US Congress approved $1 billion over two years in equipment &ndash; including 90 army helicopters &ndash; and training for the Colombian police and army to enhance their anti-drugs capability &ndash; particularly crop destruction on industrial drug plantations.</P>
      <P>More than $300 million was provided for a range of social, economic and institutional reform programmes including: voluntary alternative crop development for small farmers; environmental protection; assistance for displaced persons; protection for human rights workers; support for Colombian and international NGOs in documenting incidents and patterns of collusion between paramilitaries and State forces; support for the development of a national human rights strategy and the establishment of a network of human rights task forces; reform of the judicial system and criminal code: training of police and judges.</P>
      <P>The aid for training and equipment for the Colombian counter-drugs forces was made conditional on the fulfilment of six human rights requirements by the Colombian government, to be certified by the US Secretary of State. On 18 August, Secretary of State Albright formally indicated that she was able to provide certification in the case of only one of the conditions, but reported progress in the case of several others, and set out the steps being taken by the State Department to endeavour to ensure that the Colombian government met all the conditions as soon as possible, stressing President Pastrana's commitment to human rights protection.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the legislation, President Clinton then made a &lsquo;determination' that it was nevertheless &ldquo;in the national security interest of the United States&rdquo; to furnish the assistance, and issued a waiver of certification in respect of the outstanding five human rights conditions.</P>
      <P>When President Pastrana visited Colombia on 30 August 2000, he defended his partial waiver and stressed President Pastrana's commitment &ldquo;to developing military and police forces that both respect human rights and know they will be accountable for abuses&rdquo;. He pointed out too that if the second part of US aid was to be released in the 2001 financial year, Colombia would have to meet the human rights requirements of the US legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" /> The European Union would have wished that some aspects of the Plan Colombia had been drawn up rather differently, but in examining President Pastrana's request for assistance to support the Colombian peace process, the European Union will bear in mind such key elements as human rights; the plight of displaced persons; social exclusion; the socio-economic causes of conflict; institutional reform; the involvement of civil society and local communities in the planning and implementation of reform programmes; and the co-responsibility of the consuming countries for Colombia's escalating illegal drug production.</P>
    <P>Possible areas of EU co-operation might include: human rights training; conflict resolution programmes; education for peace; land reform; aid for displaced persons; environmental protection; and alternative crop production.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the procedure, system and resources used in his Department for replying to correspondence from Members of the Oireachtas; the staff numbers involved; if the numbers have been reduced since freedom of information requests were introduced; if staff were diverted to freedom of information cases; if a tracking or follow up system exists; if there is a rule or guideline for sending replies other than acknowledgements; the standard in this regard; the way in which it is monitored; his views on whether responding to requests from Oireachtas Members is an integral part of the democratic system; and if he has any proposals to improve this service.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>All correspondence whether from Members of the Oireachtas or members of the public which are addressed to me or my office are, on day of receipt, acknowledged and electronically scanned and saved as an image document. The scanned document as well as a template for the draft reply are then transmitted electronically to a designated co-ordinator in the division which has responsibility for answering the representations in question.</P>
      <P>A timescale of five working days is imposed for receipt in my office of a full draft reply to the representations. Where this timescale cannot be achieved, for example, where material is not readily available or information has to be obtained from other sources, one of our missions abroad for example, the division issues a holding reply and a substantive reply issues from my office as soon as possible thereafter. Where a reply has not issued within the five day deadline, a list of any outstanding representations is transmitted electronically to each head of division for immediate attention. A similar procedure and system is in place for dealing with all correspondence received in the office of the Minister of State Deputy O'Donnell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="289" /> Correspondence from Members of the Oireachtas which are not addressed to me or to the Minister of State are sent directly to the relevant section or division, as appropriate, for response. There is no tracking system in place to record receipt of such correspondence or to monitor response times. However, it is the policy of the Department to issue replies to written communications within ten working days of receipt and, in cases where a substantive reply cannot be issued within that time, an interim reply issues explaining the reasons. I regard responding to requests from Oireachtas members as an integral part of the democratic system and this is why they are responded to promptly.</P>
    <P>No staff in my office, in the office of the Minister of State or in the rest of the Department are solely involved in dealing with correspondence received from members of the Oireachtas. This work is done in addition to other functions and duties of staff. There has been no reduction in staffing levels in the Department since the introduction of FOI. However, it was necessary to designate one officer in the Department to act as <Col N="290" /> FOI co-ordinator, in addition to performing other duties of a coordinating nature.</P>
    <P>I consider that procedures and systems in place in the Department are satisfactory for dealing with all correspondence received. However, you may be assured that the Department is committed to providing a quality customer service and in this regard it will continue to review the effectiveness and efficiency of its service with a view to further improving where possible the standard of service it provides.</P>

      <P>The applicant states that his mother was born in Britain and adopted in the United States by the Irish born couple he claims to be his grandparents. If he could provide documentary evidence of his mother's formal adoption and if the Adoption Board recognised the adoption, his mother would thereby be deemed to have been an Irish citizen from the date of her adoption &ndash; in accordance with the Adoption Act, 1991 &ndash; and he would qualify for Irish citizenship by entry in the Foreign Births Register.</P>

The inquiry found that the Aer Lingus DC 3 aircraft on a scheduled flight from Dublin to Bermingham on 1 January crashed at Spernal near Birmingham with the loss of the aircraft. There were no fatalit<Col N="294" /> ies. The inquiry found that the captain was responsible for the accident by allowing both engines cut out by feeding from the same fuel tank which ran dry.</P>
    <P>The captain's licence was endorsed by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, the effect of which prohibited him from flying passenger aircraft. The licence was restored without prejudice in 1977. The late captain's family now seek the quashing of the verdict of the court and officials of my Department are in contact with them. I believe that these discussions should shortly result in an agreed mechanism for a structured review of the issues which are of concern to the family.</P>

      <P>In regard to EU-US aviation relations, the issue of a common aviation area has been under discussion in the Transport Council since 1996. The European Commission has been seeking a full mandate from the council to negotiate an EU-US traffic agreement. In these council discussions I have been and will continue to be opposed to the concept of such an agreement, because I believe it would restrict our ability to negotiate regulatory arrangements with the US to suit Ireland's needs specifically. I do not anticipate that the Transport Council will agree during this presidency or the next to give the commission the mandate it seeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pleased to announce several major public transport measures during the summer recess. Details of these announcements were, of course, distributed to all Deputies and Senators at the time of the announcements. For your convenience, I attach copies of the relevant press releases to this reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first of these major projects was the Government decision, which I announced on 31 July, to proceed with the development of a metro system for Dublin, comprising of three lines: a line from Shanganagh &ndash; near Bray, where passengers can interchange with DART &ndash; to Swords, <i>via</i> the city centre and Dublin Airport, using the old Harcourt Street line and a central tunnel starting in Ranelagh; a line from the Shanganagh-Swords line <i>via </i>Finglas, Blanchardstown and Clondalkin to Tallaght; and a line from Citywest <Col N="295" /> to the city centre <i>via</i> Tallaght and Kimmage, connecting to the central tunnel on the Shanganagh-Swords line. The metro will be developed on a public private partnership, PPP, basis using a design, build, finance and operate mechanism.</P>
    <P>The Government directed the CIE light rail project office immediately to commence the necessary preparatory work for the metro PPP with the objective of seeking invitations to tender within 12 months for the selection of the PPP consortium to undertake the development of the metro.</P>
    <P>The metro is, of course, a key element of a medium to long-term integrated transportation strategy being finalised by the Dublin Transportation Office. Further details of this strategy will be published in the autumn.</P>
    <P>The second of these developments was the Government decision approving the drafting of legislation to establish an independent statutory agency with responsibility for the procurement, on a PPP basis, of major rail based public transport infrastructure projects, including the metro.</P>
    <P>The third and most recent public transport measure was the publication on 4 September of a public consultation document entitled A New Institutional and Regulatory Framework for Public Transport. This document is the culmination of an examination of the Road Transport Act, 1932, which had as its objective increasing competition in the provision of public bus transport services in Dublin and also takes account of a review of the present institutional structures in the public transport area.</P>
    <P>In this consultation document I propose a series of measures to reform the institutional and regulatory framework for public transport. The principal measures are the establishment of Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann as separate, independent companies, with the freedom to operate transport services in each other's current area of business; the consideration of the transfer to private ownership of Bus Átha Cliath; the division of Iarnród Éireann into two separate companies &ndash; one responsible for railway infrastructure, the other for the operation of railway services; the possible dissolution of the CIÉ holding company; the establishment of an independent institution with the function of procuring major infrastructural projects on a public private partnership, PPP, basis; the establishment of an independent public transport regulatory function; the franchising of all bus routes in the greater Dublin area, to be done on a phased basis over three to four years and the establishment of an independent railway safety regulatory body. I have invited comments on these proposals by 13 October. The consultation document has been circulated to all Members of the House.</P>
    <P>I believe that the developments I have briefly outlined above, following on from previous Government action, most notably the Luas project, show this Government's continued commitment to providing a viable alternative to commut<Col N="296" /> ing by private car, in the form of a much improved public transport system.</P>

      <P>The commitment given in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, concerning public transport initiatives in rural areas, is supported by the inclusion of a £3.5 million provision in the national development plan. This provision is for capital support for the development of pilot public transport initiatives in rural areas. The aim will be to encourage local or community based initiatives to provide bus services in such areas.</P>
      <P>It is planned that the funding will be used to support a number of pilot rural transport projects in the period 2001 to 2003. The projects to be funded will be selected following a national call for proposals. The criteria under which proposals may be considered will be elaborated on in a discussion document which it is intended to publish before the end of this year.</P>

      <P>I would encourage all operators to share masts and facilities where possible. While facility sharing is a matter for commercial negotiation among the operators concerned, there is provision in the European Communities (Interconnection in Telecommunications) Regulations, 1998, for the director of telecommunications regulation to intervene to resolve disputes between parties at the request of one of the parties.</P>
      <P>The director may also impose conditions in relation to facility sharing arrangements only after an appropriate period of public consultation during which all interested parties must be given an opportunity to express their views and those conditions may include rules for the apportionment of the costs of facility sharing. My Department does not keep records on the number of telecommunications masts in Limerick or elsewhere being shared by the various operators.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 299, 300, 301, 319 and 324 together.</P>
      <P>On 11 September 2000 I published a consultation documentation document entitled Outline Legislative Proposals in relation to the Regulation of the Communications Sector. Among other things, this contains proposals for a provision mandating the unbundling of the local loop. Following examination of the submissions received in the consultation I will be finalising the legislative proposals for submission shortly to Government for approval. It is hoped to have the Bill published in the new year. In parallel with this, the EU Commission published on 12 July 2000 a draft regulation on unbundled access to the local loop. The draft text is being examined by Council and the European Parliament at present and it is expected that the regulation will come into effect on 31 December 2000. The proposals contained in the consultation document are complementary to the draft provisions in the regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scope of both sets of proposals is limited to dealing with unbundling of the copper local loop of those operators identified as having significant market power, SMP, in the fixed public telephone network market. In Ireland's case this, as of now, means Eircom. The proposals do not cover networks of cable television companies. While steps are being taken by cable operators to upgrade their networks, they are not yet seen as having the same functionality and ubiquity as the <Col N="298" /> copper local loop. However, this does not mean that they will not be obliged to offer access to their networks at some future stage should the conditions at the time justify such an obligation. The draft legislative proposals which I published recently include provisions enabling the proposed Commission for Communications Regulation to designate markets, where justified, and impose regulatory obligations on operators deemed to have significant market power in such markets. The European Commission has also published draft directives with similar provisions.</P>
    <P>Unbundled access to the local loop allows new entrants to compete with SMP operators in offering high bit data transmission services for continuous Internet access and for multimedia applications based on digital subscriber line, DSL, technology as well as voice telephony services. This will be done using XDSL technology which will enable customers to have access to a world-class infrastructure and a wide range of services, thereby enhancing Ireland's competitive position on the international stage.</P>
    <P>Finally, I can confirm that I am aware of the concerns being expressed by the Communications Workers Union in relation to the proposed EU regulation on unbundled access to the local loop. I have received copies of the CWU's circular letter on the issue from a number of public representatives seeking my views on the matters raised and I will be responding in detail to these shortly.</P>

      <P>The Government has accepted the proposals in the Dublin Transportation Office Strategy to 2016. One of the proposals contained in the DTO strategy is the southward extension of the Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green line to Cherrywood and later to Shanganagh. The precise alignment for this extension has yet to be finalised but I have asked the light rail project office in CIE immediately to commence preparatory work on this issue.</P>

      <P>I intend to make commencement orders for sections 4 to 8, 11, 16 and 23 of the Road Transport Act, 1999, before the end of the year which will allow sufficient time for my Department to introduce a new vehicle plating system.

      <P>Commencement orders for the following provisions of the Postal and Telecommunications Services (Amendment) Act, 1999, have not been made: (i) section 19(3), 22 and 24 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983. The above provisions cannot be repealed until the State has fully divested itself of its shares in Eircom; (ii) sections 28 and 30 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983. The above provisions cannot be repealed until Eircom's State-guaranteed loans, which extend up to 2003, have been cleared; (iii) Sections 46(9) and (11) of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983. These provisions must remain until the obligations of the Minister for Finance to Eircom's superannuation fund have been cleared.</P>

    <P>The mandatory provisions of EU Directive 98/30/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas which came into effect on 1 August 2000 have been implemented by the provisions of the Gas Acts. In addition, the directive contains a number of discretionary provisions on such matters as public service obligations, authorisation procedures etc. The question of whether, and to what extent, these discretionary provisions are to be transposed into national law is being considered. If they are to be transposed, this will be done by means of primary legislation.</P>

      <P>The Irish Energy Centre, IEC, was established by a memorandum of understanding entered into between the Department of Public Enterprise &ndash; formerly the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications &ndash; and Enterprise Ireland &ndash; formerly Forbairt &ndash; which came into effect in January 1995. The Government, at its meeting of 5 May 1998, decided to set up the IEC as an independent body, under the auspices of my Department. The draft heads of a Bill to establish the IEC on a statutory basis are currently with the parliamentary draftsman's office for formal drafting.</P>
      <P>The Irish National Petroleum Corporation Limited, INPC, was established in 1979 under the Companies Acts. It acquired Irish Refining PLC and Bantry Terminals Limited in the 1980s as a result of Government decisions. A third subsidiary, the National Oil Reserves Agency, was also set up under the Companies Acts but it operates on the basis of specific oil stockholding provisions set out in S.I. 96 of 1995. Future arrangements for the INPC and its subsidiaries are currently under consideration in the context of the proposed sale of its principal fixed assets &ndash; the Whitegate refinery and the Whiddy oil terminal &ndash; to a US corporation.</P>
      <P>I have nominated the prospective board of the independent electricity transmission system operator, to be known as EirGrid. This company will be put on a statutory footing in the forthcoming statutory instrument which implements the balance of EU Directive 96/92 on the internal market in electricity.</P>
      <P>In the area of public transport, a public transport partnership forum and a public transport accessibility committee have been set up recently in accordance with commitments given in the national development plan and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. A committee on integrated ticketing has also been set up by my Department. There are no proposals to put either the committees or the forum on a statutory basis.</P>

      <P>The following proposals for the establishment of bodies under my aegis are under consideration. The Aviation Regulation Bill, 2000, will establish a new statutory body, entitled the commission for aviation regulation. The Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill, 1999, contains proposals to establish a telecommunications infrastructure board on a statutory basis. I also intend to bring legislative proposals before Government to establish a commission for communications regulation on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>A statutory instrument, to be made in the near future, will provide for the establishment of an independent State company to act as the electricity transmission system operator. The company will be known as EirGrid.</P>
      <P>On 31 July last, I announced that in the context of the development of a metro for Dublin, the Government had approved the drafting of legislation to establish an independent statutory agency with responsibility for the procurement, on a public-private partnership basis, of major rail based public transport projects. Preparation of the draft heads of the legislation is well advanced and I expect to bring proposals in that regard to Government for approval next month.</P>
      <P>Legislation is currently being drafted to put in place a new framework for the regulation of railway safety, including the establishment of an independent railway safety regulatory body. I also propose to establish a statutory railway safety advisory council that will bring together railway operators, trades unions and representatives of the public interest to consider railway safety matters.</P>
      <P>I have recently published a consultative document called A New Institutional and Regulatory Framework for Public Transport. Among the institutional changes being considered are the establishment of the following bodies, a railway infrastructure company, a railway operating company, a railway safety authority, referred to above, a national public transport authority and an interim public transport authority for bus services for the greater Dublin area, which will be established prior to the national body. All these bodies will be established on a statutory basis.</P>

      <P>It is my policy that all transport operators, and in particular the State transport companies, should provide the highest possible degree of accessibility to disabled or mobility impaired people within the overall resources available to them. Under the national development plan, from this year onwards, all major refurbishment projects at bus and rail stations, together with purchases of trains and buses will take account of the needs of mobility impaired customers. Specifically with regard to urban public transport I am very happy to say that from this year onwards all new buses purchased for the urban services of Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann will be low floor. The implementation of Government policy in relation to the provision of accessible public transport by the three CIE companies is proceeding very satisfactorily.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 315 and 316 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force established by the chairmen of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta at my request to examine concerns about the Irish airlines (general employees) superannuation scheme sub<Col N="314" /> mitted a report to the chairmen at the end of May 2000. The task force report summarised the main concerns and views about the pension scheme made by various representative associations in submissions and presentations and an independent actuary costed the various proposals received. Following receipt of the task force report, Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta commissioned separate reviews of the report.</P>
    <P>As far as Aer Rianta is concerned, the company propose to establish a new scheme in due course in accordance with section 32 of the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act, 1998, and the company is giving consideration to this matter.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus as a result of their review and having regard to the structure and terms of the existing scheme and the Government's decision in relation to the IPO, decided that the most appropriate course of action was to set about establishing a separate pension scheme for relevant Aer Lingus staff. The existing scheme is a multi-employer scheme and is not an appropriate one in the context of the proposed flotation. In the light of these circumstances, the airline has been discussing the terms of a proposed new pension scheme with employee representatives. The company has also recently outlined their proposals to the Retired Aviation Staff Association.</P>
    <P>Appropriate enabling provisions to allow Aer Lingus to establish the proposed new pension scheme are contained in the Aer Lingus Bill, 2000, which will be shortly considered by the House. Under those provisions, it is proposed that existing Aer Lingus employees will transfer to the proposed new pension scheme while Aer Lingus pensioners will have the option of either remaining in the existing scheme or alternatively joining the proposed new scheme.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus management has proposed that in the new scheme, pensions will increase in line with the annual Consumer Price Index provided that it does not exceed 5%. It is also proposed that the new scheme will provide improved benefits in areas such as guaranteed pension payments periods and death-in-service benefits. The company do not propose to provide for pension increases in line with salary movements for ongoing cost reasons and as it would also necessitate a substantial capital injection. It is not proposed to remove integration/co-ordination with social welfare benefits. Aer Lingus advise that the overall terms of the proposed new scheme would be in line with practice in the private sector and in many cases would have better benefits. I am advised that there are sufficient funds in the existing multi-employer scheme to fund the proposed improvements for pensioners and in relation to past service for existing staff.</P>
    <P>An estimated overall surplus of £300 million in the existing scheme was identified in the actuarial assessment which accompanied the task force <Col N="315" /> report. Since its inception surpluses have arisen in the normal course and have been used at the discretion of the trustees, acting on the advice of the actuary, to fund increases in pension payments. In the context of the proposed new schemes to be established, there would be an equitable pro-rata allocation, as appropriate, of the funds of the existing scheme in relation to the past service liabilities of existing employees and pensioners based on an actuarial assessment.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has advised that the company contribution will be increased for future service liabilities as necessary to meet the proposed new scheme's funding costs. Employee contributions will remain at current levels. The rules of the existing scheme specify that equal contributions are payable by employees and employers.</P>
    <P>There is no question of any subsidy being provided by the State towards the Irish airlines (general employees) superannuation scheme or the proposed new pension schemes to be established by either Aer Lingus or Aer Rianta. In so far as co-ordination of public sector pension schemes such as the Irish airlines (general employees) superannuation scheme with social welfare benefits is concerned, policy in this area is a matter for the Minister for Finance. I understand that such co-ordination is a central feature of public sector pension schemes for employees who pay the full rate of PRSI and qualify for social welfare contributory old age pension in addition to the occupational pension. The Minister for Finance does not consider that there is any justification for the removal of the co-ordination arrangements in public sector schemes.</P>
    <P>It is Aer Lingus' intention to implement the new pension scheme as soon as possible after the IPO of the airline is completed. In the meantime, I will continue to monitor developments in relation to the discussions on the proposed new pension scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under my Department's customer action plan, all staff are required to deal with correspondence from Members of the Oireachtas and the public in accordance with specific guidelines which state that: all letters will be acknowledged within two working days of their receipt, a full reply will be provided within 20 working days &ndash; if this is not possible, an interim reply will be sent explaining the position; the reply will be in clear, simple language and technical terms will be used only where absolutely necessary; and all replies will carry a contact name and telephone number, or fax number and e-mail address, where appropriate. My Department is at present engaged in a review of its customer action plan with a view to further improvements in service standards.</P>
      <P>A specific tracking/monitoring system is in operation to ensure that correspondence to my office is acknowledged when received and then followed up without delay. If possible, a full and comprehensive reply is issued without recourse to an acknowledgement. However, in cases where an in-depth examination of correspondence is required in the preparation of a reply, an acknowledgement is issued immediately informing the correspondent that a full reply will issue as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>A unit has been set up in my Department to deal with the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act, including the preparation of rules, practices, guidelines and procedures for dealing with requests under the Act. Under the Freedom of Information Act, Oireachtas Members and members of the public are entitled to obtain access to information in the possession of the public bodies, including Government Departments, to the greatest extent possible, consistent with the public interest. I am fully supportive of a system of public administration which is open and fair to all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 320 and 321 together.</P>
      <P>I met with the Chairman and the Chief Executive of Aer Rianta on 26 September 2000 to express my concern about congestion and safety at Dublin Airport, which gave rise to numerous complaints and media reports over recent weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Rianta assures me that the fire safety arrangements at Dublin Airport comply fully with the national standards of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Fire safety risk assessments are carried out by Aer Rianta on an ongoing basis and the airport holds a current fire safety certificate in accordance with <Col N="320" /> the provisions of the Building Control Act and the building control regulations.</P>
    <P>I am, however, concerned that not only should general safety and fire safety standards be maintained at the highest possible levels but that all users of Dublin Airport should enjoy an acceptable degree of comfort in using the airport's facilities.</P>
    <P>I fully accept, as does the company, that passengers were inconvenienced at certain times over the summer months as a result of the major building programme under way at Dublin Airport. It is inevitable, given the combination of this very necessary building programme with rising passenger traffic, that people will be inconvenienced to some extent through congestion and delays. Aer Rianta is investing over £350 million in a major expansion programme at the airport which will provide greater comfort for the ever increasing numbers of passengers using its facilities. This expansion includes additional baggage hall and arrivals capacity, new check-in desks, equipment and technology, new exits and entrances, escalators and lifts. New and expanded catering services are also being provided in this development programme.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, I recently announced an important initiative to ease overcrowding at Dublin Airport which involves responsibility for the co-ordination of take-off and landing slots being assigned to an independent management body. Heretofore, this function was handled by agreement among the airlines themselves on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, a system which worked satisfactorily in the past when the levels of passenger traffic and aircraft movements, particularly at peak times, were not as high as they are now. Passenger traffic at Dublin is expected to reach almost 14 million this year <Col N="321" /> compared to just eight million as recently as five years ago.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently engaged in the process of engaging experts to take over the current slot co-ordination function at Dublin Airport with a view to having them in place within a fortnight and I believe that this will assist in alleviating congestion. I am also, as a matter of urgency, arranging for the appointment of consultants to conduct a study to assist my determination as to whether Dublin Airport should be designated as a &ldquo;fully co-ordinated&rdquo; airport. Subject to timely completion of this study, which is required by EU regulation, it is my intention to make a decision on this issue prior to a major international conference on slots to be held in the US in mid-November at which Aer Rianta will inform the world's major airlines as to the slot status of Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>Initiatives have also been taken by Aer Rianta on the ground at Dublin Airport to ease congestion and to ensure that safety standards are fully maintained. At my request, the Chairman and Chief Executive of Aer Rianta have intensified the level of consultation and co-operation with the major airlines using the airport and I am satisfied that everything possible is being done to reduce the temporary inconvenience caused to passengers and staff at the airport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to gauge with accuracy how well the quality of the postal service in Ireland compares with that in European countries given that there is no uniformity of approach in terms of measuring this among EU member states.</P>
      <P>An Post is committed to continually improving the quality of its mail delivery service, which is measured independently against a standard of next day delivery using a comprehensive and statistically valid system to monitor the service quality of all mail streams.</P>
      <P>Since the end of the Christmas 1999 peak period, an overall average of 90% of letters posted for delivery within Ireland are being delivered on the next working day after the day of posting.</P>
      <P>My Department's statement of strategy contains a target in this regard of at least 95%, and I am confident that recent major investments in new mail processing centres will enable significant progress to be made towards meeting this target in the near future.</P>

The question of providing a new training area for military use to accommodate the range and mobility which the training of mechanised troops requires will be considered by my Department in the coming months. This consideration will include the possible relocation from Oranmore which may allow for the disposal of the lands at Oranmore for economic development. In the event of a sale the future use of the lands will be a matter for the developers in conjunction with the appropriate local authorities.</P>

These recommendations were implemented by the Minister for Defence in December 1991 by way of an amendment to Defence Force regulations, effective from 1 October 1990.</P>

The military guard was put in place solely to secure the explosives stored in the compound while the private security firm was retained primarily to prevent trespass and wanton acts of vandalism and destruction at the former barracks, which could adversely affect the property's future saleability. The explosives compound at Murphy Barracks is expected to close in the very near future and on its closure the military guard will immediately be withdrawn from the location.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the Defence Forces have been deployed for service with UNIFIL since 1978. On 4 April 2000 the Government approved the provision of a replacement contingent to UNIFIL comprising approximately 620 personnel all ranks for a six month period beginning 19 April 2000. The Government decision also allowed for preparations to be made for the selection, training and equipping of a further contingent of approximately 620 personnel all ranks to provide for the possibility of Ireland's continued participation in the UNIFIL peacekeeping force beyond July 2000 in the event of the further extension of the UNIFIL mandate beyond that date. The UNIFIL mandate is reviewed by the UN Security Council every six months. In July 2000 the Security Council extended the mandate for a period of six months to 31 January 2001, the matter to be reviewed by the Security Council in early November on foot of a report to be furnished by the Secretary General by 31 October 2000. The report will examine the progress made by UNIFIL towards completion of the tasks assigned to it in the original 1978 mandate.</P>
      <P>The Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon was effectively completed between 22-24 May 2000. Following the withdrawal, UNIFIL began conducting extensive patrols in armoured vehicles in the former Israeli controlled area. In response to a request from the United Nations for additional troops and support personnel, the Government conveyed approval on 3 May 2000 for the deployment of an extra 50 personnel to augment the 87th Irish Battalion until the end of its tour of duty in October 2000, as well as for the deployment of an engineer party, together with necessary equipment, to undertake essential construction work in the Irishbatt area of operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extra 50 personnel joined the Irish contingent in June 2000. Four Panhard AML 90s were also sent to the Irishbatt area of operations in response to a UN request. In addition, UNIFIL supplied Irishbatt with a further five armoured personnel carriers &ndash; APCs &ndash; to meet additional patrol taskings which arose as a result of the Israeli withdrawal. The extra personnel were employed in crewing the extra APCs as well as supplying additional medical support. In August 2000, 50 Defence Forces engineering personnel, together with their equipment, joined the contin<Col N="325" /> gent in order to construct new posts for Irishbatt personnel in the former Israeli controlled area, close to the &ldquo;blue line&rdquo; or border with Israel. These personnel are scheduled to complete their task by the end of this month at which time they will return to Ireland.</P>
    <P>I will shortly seek the approval of the Government in relation to providing a replacement  contingent to UNIFIL from 30 October 2000 when the current contingent will be due to return home, as well as approval for the selection, training and equipping of a further contingent, to provide for the possibility of Ireland's continued participation in the UNIFIL peacekeeping force beyond April 2001, in the event of the further extension of the UNIFIL mandate.</P>
    <P>United Nations Security Council Resolution 425 of 1978 required Israel to end its presence in South Lebanon. UNIFIL was established in 1978 to (1) confirm the withdrawal of Israeli forces; (2) restore international peace and security and (3) assist the Government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area. While the prospects for long-term peace seem more hopeful now that Israel has withdrawn from Lebanese territory, indications are that the UN is likely to maintain a continuing role in Lebanon for some time.</P>
    <P>The matter of Defence Forces continued participation in UNIFIL will be kept under continual review. I have just returned from a visit to the 87th Irish Battalion and I am happy to report that the situation continues to be calm.</P>

To aid the civil power &ndash; meaning in practice to assist, when requested, the Garda Síochána who have the primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State &ndash; is among the assigned roles.</P>
      <P>As can be seen, the primary responsibility for internal security rests with An Garda Síochána. The Defence forces, pursuant to their role of rendering aid to the civil power, assist the gardaí as required. This entails such duties as assisting the gardaí at roadblocks, checkpoints and searches, including in the Border area. The Defence Forces also assist the gardaí in relation to prisoner escorts, cash escorts and explosives escorts. No change in this role is envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the level of demand on the <Col N="326" /> Defence Forces in aid of the gardaí is kept under constant review in my Department in consultation with the relevant Departments as well as with the Garda authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>There are currently three separate proposals for legislation under consideration within my Department where heads have not yet been approved by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first relates to the provision of a hearing loss compensation scheme for members of the Defence Forces. Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of <i>Hanley v Minister for Defence</i> on 7 December 1999, my Department <Col N="327" /> has been attempting to establish a suitable mechanism whereby Army hearing loss claims may be removed from the courts. In this regard, on 19 January 2000, the Government gave approval in principle for the preparation of heads of a Bill designed to provide a statutory underpinning for a hearing loss compensation scheme for members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>As an alternative to the establishment of a statutory scheme, my Department has also sought to resolve claims by way of direct negotiations with plaintiff's solicitors. The High Court has agreed to adjournments of Army hearing loss claims in order to facilitate this mechanism and, to date, over 600 claims have been settled in this way with considerable savings in legal costs. If the majority of the outstanding claims could be resolved by negotiation, the requirement for a formal compensation scheme may not be necessary. The early settlement scheme will be reviewed by the High Court today and I am hopeful that both sides to the litigation will agree to extend it. The question of instituting a formal scheme of compensation for hearing loss is being kept under review and work has progressed on the preparation of heads of a Bill should a statutory mechanism be required in the future.</P>
    <P>The second relates to the updating of Civil Defence legislation. Civil Defence currently operates under the 1939 to 1946 air raid precautions legislation. A draft memorandum for Government on the proposed Bill has been circulated to Departments for their observations and I, on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Defence, am proposing at Cabinet today to seek the approval of the Government for the preparation of a Civil Defence Bill, 2000, to update Civil Defence legislation generally.</P>
    <P>The third relates to the provision of a statutory authority to manage the Curragh of Kildare and will also consolidate and update existing legislation with regard to the area including The Curragh of Kildare Acts, 1870, 1961 and 1969. Work on this legislation is at a very early stage, however, I hope to be in a position to present a memorandum to Government on the matter in early 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>The military authorities advise that there are approximately 3,500 personnel currently registered as being illegally absent for periods in excess of one year. However, some of these cases were originally recorded as being illegally absent quite some time ago and, in some cases, as far back as 1945. It follows that many of these individuals would now in fact either be very advanced in years or be deceased.</P>
      <P>An &ldquo;illegal absentee&rdquo; is anyone who is registered as being in excess of 21 days absent from the Defence Forces. On being registered as being illegally absent, notification is sent by the unit concerned to the military police and to the Garda inspector of the district in which the individual would normally reside.</P>
      <P>Thereafter, in consultation with the gardaí, the military police will visit the last known address of the individual and, if found, he/she will be detained by the military police and returned to his/her unit.</P>
      <P>The procedure in military law with regard to such absentees is that a court of inquiry is held pursuant to section 147 of the Defence Act in respect of each such absentee. A record would exist in the service books of each unit to the effect that the person concerned had been declared to be absent without leave from a specific date. Pursuant to the provisions of section 135(2)(f2&gt;b) of the Defence Act, that person is also presumed to have deserted the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>There is a simple procedure available for long-term absentees to surrender themselves and for trial to be dispensed with. Furthermore, a pragmatic approach is taken to the question of using powers against long-term absentees, particularly those who are advanced in years.</P>

      <P>On 25 July 1997 the Department dedicated a strip of land measuring about half an acre at Columb Barracks to Westmeath County Council for road widening purposes. As part of the agreement, the council undertook to rebuild part of the barrack boundary wall on a shared cost basis. The deed of dedication between the Department and the council provided for financial arrangements on a <i>pro-rata</i> basis on completion of the works by the council.</P>
      <P>I am now informed that Westmeath County Council has briefed a consulting engineer to prepare a contract for the refurbishment of the wall at Columb Barracks and contract documents are in the process of being completed, with a view to inviting tenders for the necessary works. The local authority hopes to be in a position to invite these tenders in the next two months.</P>
      <P>My officials will continue to liaise with the council in the matter as and when necessary.</P>

      <P>The publication last week of the final report by the air accident investigation unit &ndash; AAIU &ndash; of the Department of Public Enterprise into the accident at Tramore, County Waterford on 2 July 1999 in which four members of the Air Corps, Captain David O'Flaherty, Captain Michael Baker, Sergeant Paddy Mooney and Corporal Niall Byrne, were tragically killed, evoked many sad memories for the families of the victims, for the Defence Forces and for the public in general. <Col N="334" /> I would like to avail of this opportunity to again pay tribute to these brave young men who gave their lives in the service of others and to express my sympathy to the families for their sad and tragic losses. The purpose of the investigation was to determine the circumstances and cause, or causes, of the accident in order to prevent future such accidents.</P>
      <P>The report, which is a very comprehensive and detailed document, is being studied in my Department at present. The safety recommendations set out in the report which call for action by the Department and the Defence Forces are being considered as a matter of priority with a view to their immediate implementation.</P>
      <P>In addition to the aforementioned investigation, a military court of inquiry was convened to inquire into the circumstances of the accident. Its main thrust will be an examination of both the final report of the AAIU and the coroner's report. The work of the military court of inquiry will, therefore, now proceed following publication of the final report of the AAIU. The court of inquiry must also await the Coroner's Court findings.</P>

      <P>Under the new scheme of early retirement from farming, there will be no specific provision relating to hours worked on or off the farm. The relevant criterion <Col N="337" /> is one of viability; a farming transferee must succeed the transferor as a head of an agricultural holding which must be at least five hectares of utilisable agricultural area, and must meet the viability threshold of at least 50 income units of which at least 20 income units must be derived from farming owned/leased land.</P>
      <P>The transferee must undertake to practise farming on all the pension lands, and must farm them for a period of five years or for as long as the pension is granted to the transferor, whichever is the greater. He or she must, unless participating in the rural environmental protection scheme, undertake to follow good farming practice.</P>
      <P>The transferee must, for applications that are received in the period up to and including 31 December 2001, be between his or her 18th and 45th birthdays at the date an application is received. The upper age limit will be reduced, by one year at a time, to 40 by the end of December 2005.</P>
      <P>If born before 1 January 1975, the transferee must have been engaged in farming for at least five years. If born on or after that date, he or she must have a minimum of three years farming experience and have satisfactorily completed a course of training in agriculture or horticulture of at least 180 hours. He or she must have an upper non-farm income limit of not more than 100 units in the tax year prior to receipt of the application, must have a herd/flock/cereal number and must provide a personal public services number &ndash; PPSN.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>The person named had entered the scheme of early retirement from farming in joint management with her husband. The overpayment arose because he was receiving a national retirement pension for some months while she was still being paid her full pension under the early retirement scheme. The regulation under which the scheme was introduced requires that in such cases the pension payable under the scheme must be reduced by the amount of the national retirement pension. Participants in the scheme or their partners in joint management arrangements such as this are required to notify my Department when they become entitled to a national retirement pension. This is to ensure that the national pension can be offset promptly against the early retirement pension, thus preventing overpayments. As the person named did not inform my Department that her husband was receiving the national retirement pension, an overpayment took place and my Department had no option under the regulation but to recover it. My Department had no discretion under the regulation to waive the recovery of the overpayment.</P>
      <P>The specific regulation is Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2079/92. Article 3.1.(d) of that Regulation provides that the total amount eligible for part-financing per holding shall be calculated on the basis of the following reference method: (a) aid is paid, from the age of early retirement to the normal retirement age, in the form of annual compensation at a rate of ECU 4,000 per holding, plus an annual allowance of ECU 250 per hectare, up to a maximum annual total of ECU 10,000 per holding; (b) aid is paid, as appropriate, in the form of an annual supplement to the normal retirement pension paid by the member state in order to arrive at the same annual total amount as that specified in (a).</P>
      <P>Accordingly, as the overpayment in the case of the person named arose due to her spouse becoming entitled to the national old age pension, my Department is obliged to recover all of the overpayment as failure to do so would jeopardise its obligations with regard to EU funds.</P>

      <P>In accordance with EU regulations, 1999 extensification premium is paid on all animals paid under the suckler cow and special beef premium schemes if the stocking density on the holding is less than 1.40 livestock units per hectare.</P>
      <P>The person named declared 9.88 hectares on his 1999 area aid application. He made three applications under the 1999 special beef premium scheme consisting of one 10 month animal (0.6 lu) and 16 22 month animals (13.60 lus). One of the animals applied for on the second 22 month application was previously paid bull premium in another herd and was not eligible for payment under the 22 month special beef premium scheme. However, this animal must be counted in the stocking density calculation. The total livestock units divided by the hectares (14.2/9.88) give a stocking density of 1.43 lus/ha.</P>
      <P>As the stocking density on the holding is not less than 1.40 lus/ha the person named has no entitlement to 1999 extensification premium.</P>

This certificate has been accepted, and no late penalty will apply to the herdowner's 2000 area aid application.</P>

      <P>One of the parcels claimed by the person named in her 1999 area aid application overlapped with a parcel of land claimed by another applicant. The person named was contacted in this regard and in her reply clarified the position by including a map showing the correct position. This information has now been entered on to the Department's electronic database.</P>
      <P>The person named claimed a total of 22.40 hectares on her 1999 area aid application. Following processing of her application an area of 21.72 hectares was determined. This represents a difference of 0.68 hectares or 3.13% between the area claimed and that determined.</P>
      <P>Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, no penalty is applied when the difference is less than 3%, the penalty is based on double the difference when it is between 3% and 20% and when the difference is over 20%, a 100% penalty must be applied.</P>
      <P>Therefore in this case a penalty of 1.36 hectares has to apply, leaving the area for payment purposes at 20.36 hectares.</P>

      <P>My Department has statutory responsibility under EU and national pharmaceutical legislation (Council Directive 81/851 EEC and the Animal Remedies Regulations, 1996) for the operation of a licensing regime in relation to clinical trials. The Department of Health and Children also has statutory responsibility in this area and operates a licensing regime focused on the protection of animals being used for experimental or other scientific purposes.</P>
      <P>The clinical trial referred to by the Deputy was licensed by my Department on the basis of the appropriate details furnished in the relevant application. For the sake of clarity, I should point out that under the relevant legislation, the issue by my Department of a licence is not contingent on the issue of a licence by the Department of Health and Children. While that is a matter entirely for decision by the Department in question, I understand that in this case, it concluded that the trial would not require licensing by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following receipt of a non-specific complaint about the conduct of the trial concerned, my Department carried out a thorough investigation, in the course of which reports were obtained from various individuals and bodies who had an involvement with the trial. Among the reports secured was one from the Garda Síochana, which had, on the basis of an earlier complaint received by them, carried out an on the spot investigation while the trial was in progress. The Department's investigation indicated that, while the trial was <Col N="344" /> substantially conducted in accordance with the licence issued by my Department, it did not in fact take place at the site indicated in the application, and that one of the animals involved was euthanised during the course of the trial for reasons which, I understand, were not linked with the substance being trailed.</P>
    <P>My Department has already conveyed the results of its investigation to the complainants, as well as to the clinical trial licence holder. On the basis of the information currently available, my Department does not foresee taking further action in this specific case.</P>

      <P>In its proposals to the European Commission for a new scheme of early retirement from farming, which form part of Ireland's CAP rural development plan for the period 2000-6, my Department included provision for an element of indexation of payments. The Commission took the view, however, that such a provision was not admissible under the relevant regulation, and my Department then submitted a revised proposal for a higher rate of payment. The rural development plan, which incorporates this revised proposal, is now in the final stages of approval by the commission.</P>
      <P>In relation to rates of payment under the previous scheme, the Commission services have indicated that a proposal to increase the rates would not be entertained. The cumulative numbers of participants in the previous scheme at the end of each year from 1994 to 1999 is as follows:</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 378, 379 and 380 together.</P>
      <P>A new international coffee agreement and a new international cocoa agreement are currently being negotiated by the European Commission on behalf of the Community and the member states. It is expected that the new agreements, once adopted, will be ratified by Ireland. This will not require new legislation. The EU Commission is negotiating in the forum of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) on the liberalisation of trade in agricultural goods in accordance with a mandate adopted by the Council of Ministers. On behalf of member states, the EU Commission is conducting negotiations in the Council of Europe to revise the European Convention for the Protection of Animals during International Transport.</P>
      <P>The following international multilateral agreements have not been signed by the State: (a)The Protocol of Amendment to the European Convention for the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes. This protocol was agreed by the Council of Europe and opened for signature on 6 February 1992. The advice of the Office of the Attorney General as to whether legislation is required before Ireland can ratify and sign the Protocol is awaited; and (b) The European Convention for the Protection of Pet Animals. This convention was agreed by the Council of Europe and opened for signature on 13 November 1987. The ratification and signing of this convention is under consideration.</P>
      <P>There are no international multilateral agreements under the auspices of my Department which have been signed but not ratified or acceded to by the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 383 and 384 together.</P>
      <P>The following proposed statutory instruments are being prepared by my Department:</P>
      <P>1. <i>National Beef Assurance Scheme Act 2000</i>Regulations being prepared under this Act will provide statutory basis to the cattle herd reconciliation exercise planned for 31 December 2000. The purpose of this exercise is to confirm the extent of the current population on the CMMS database and to determine the location of these animals in a particular herd on 31 December 2000. The effect of these regulations will be to oblige cattle herd owners to verify and return herd profile statements previously issued to them.</P>
      <P>2. <i>European Communities (Wine) Regulations, 2000</i>The purpose of this statutory instrument is to confer powers of entry on authorised officers and to provide for penalties for breaches of the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1493/99 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine. Council Regulation 1493/99 automatically has the force of law here, but national legislation &ndash; secondary &ndash; is required to enable it to be policed.</P>
      <P>3. <i>European Communities (Marketing of Cocoa and Chocolate products intended for human consumption) Regulations</i>The purpose of this statutory instrument is to transpose directive 2000/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to cocoa and chocolate products into Irish law. The deadline for the implementation of this directive is 3 August 2003.</P>
      <P>4. <i>An Bord Bia (Levy) Regulations</i>The purpose of this statutory instrument is to provide that the stamps, by which the export levy under section 37 of An Bord Bia Act, 1994, is payable, are in convenient euro amounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>5. <i>European Communities (Approval and Registration of dealers and dealers premises) Regulations</i>The purpose of this S.I. is to give full effect to the provisions of Council Directive 97/12/EC of 17 March 1997, Council Regulation (EC) No. 820/97 of 21 April 1997, Commission Regulation (EC) No. 2628/97, Commission Regulation (EC) <Col N="350" /> No. 2629/97, Commission Regulation (EC) No. 2630/97, all of 29 December 1997 and Commission Regulation (EC) No. 494/98 of 27 February 1998 in so far as they refer to dealers. Specifically, the statutory instrument provides for the approval and registration of dealers and dealers' premises, the revocation, suspension or refusal to register a person or premises and sets out the obligations and responsibilities of dealers and the penalties applicable to contravention of the regulations.</P>
    <P>6. My Department is currently preparing a statutory instrument relating to the labelling of beef and beef products. The statutory instrument will transpose Regulation (EC) No. 1760/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council and will repeal S.I. No. 31 of 1998. The effect of its introduction will be to make it compulsory that all beef sold will be labelled with certain information which will provide the consumer with information enabling the beef to be traced back to the animal or group of animals from which it was derived.</P>
    <P>Part 5 of the National Beef Assurance Scheme Act was commenced with effect from 29 May 2000. A commencement order for sections 20 and 21 of the Act will be made next month. The remaining sections of the Act will be commenced once the arrangements for inspection and certification of farms under the Act have been finalised in consultation with the industry.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the following table. Implementation in each case will be by statutory instrument. While every effort is made to implement directives by the due implementation date, the demands on staff and other resources as well as specific legal difficulties have led to delays in certain cases. The EU Commission has requested observations under Article 226 of the EC Treaty on the delay in implementing Directives 97/12/EC, 98/95/EC, 1999/8/EC, 1999/89/EC and 1999/90/EC.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 386, 387 and 388 together.</P>
      <P>My Department's audit committee was established under Statutory Instrument No. 274 of 1994.</P>
      <P>The following committees/bodies were established by my Department on a non-statutory basis: the Agri-Food 2010 Committee; the Beef Task Force; the Sheepmeat Forum; the monitoring committee on implementation of the recommendations of the sheep forum; the technical committee on meat inspection fees; the food agency co-operation council; the food quality assurance schemes review group.; the task force on agricultural education and training; the strategy group for the pig industry; the Agenda 2000 consultative group; the interdepartmental committee on dangerous and exotic animals; the inter-agency group re silvermines investigation; the BSE scientific advisory committee; the equine liaison committee; and the monitoring committee under the protocol on direct payment to farmers. I do not consider it necessary to establish the above on a statutory basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department intends to establish the following body on a statutory basis &ndash; the agriculture appeals office. My Department also intends to establish the advisory forum on farm animal welfare, initially on a non-statutory basis. In due course, the question of whether such a body should be placed on a statutory footing will be considered. Amendments to the Irish Horserac<Col N="354" /> ing Industry Act, 1994 are currently being considered. These amendments include the establishment of a new state body to replace the Irish Horseracing Authority established under that Act.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development</askee>
      <Quest>the proposed changes in relation to the administration of the REP scheme as it relates to organic food production; and the details of the proposed alterations relative to the previous activities of the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association's role.</Quest>
      <QRef>[19767/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three main changes to the scheme. The first relates to stocking density where livestock production is involved. Previously, to qualify for payment under the measure farmers had to reach a minimum stocking density of 0.3 livestock units per hectare over the total forage area of the farm. Under the new rules, the minimum stocking level to be achieved for payment is 0.5 of a livestock unit on the entire farm, and payment will be <i>pro rata</i> at a rate of 0.5 livestock units per hectare. This new arrangement will allow for payment to small producers while giving them an opportunity to increase their stocking rate.</P>
      <P>The second change is that if, during the course of a five year commitment, a participant elects to convert his or her farm to organic production methods then this change shall be deemed to constitute grounds for the transformation of the existing commitment into a new five year commitment as provided for under Article 20 of Commission Regulation 1750/1999. The practical effect of this change is that farmers participating in REPS who wish to convert to organic production methods can enter into a new five year plan in order to be eligible for payment under the supplementary measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third change concerns the arrangements for inspection and certification. Three private bodies, the Irish Organic Farmers &amp; Growers Association, Organic Trust and Demeter Standards Limited, were approved in 1993 by my Department which is the competent authority under the EU regulations governing organic production to carry out the functions of inspection and certification of organic crop producers. While EU regulations on organic farming did not extend to the livestock sector, my Department also recognised these bodies for the purposes of the organic supplementary measure under REPS. Following the extension of EU regulations to the organic livestock sector on 24 August, and on foot of the recommendations in the Bord Bia report on prospects for organic food in Ireland and the recommendations of the AgriFood 2010 Committee, my Department is putting in place measures to streamline the inspection system by <Col N="355" /> providing a unified structure to which all organic producers and processors will have access. Currently my Department is having discussions with the three bodies as to how this can best be achieved.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for suckler cow premium on 70 animals under the 1991 suckler cow premium scheme on 29 May 1991. At an inspection on 1 October 1991 it was found that 11 of the animals listed on the application were uncalved heifers and consequently the declaration had to be deemed false as heifers were not acceptable under the suckler cow premium scheme in 1991. In accordance with the regulations governing the scheme the person named was not entitled to suckler cow premium in 1991 and was also debarred from the 1992 suckler cow premium scheme.</P>

This category is reserved for farmers who do not qualify under any of the priority categories A, B or C. Quota will only be allocated to applicants under category D when all eligible applicants under the priority categories A, B and C have received allocations. Because the demand for reserve quota has far exceeded the amount of quota available for distribution, all the available quota will be allocated to eligible applicants under the priority categories.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, there will not be sufficient quota available to allow an allocation to be made to the person named.</P>

      <P>My Department is committed to the further development of rural tourism in the context of overall national tourism policy so as to maximise its contribution to the economic and social development of rural areas. It is intended that rural and agri-tourism schemes in the period 2000-06 will be administered by Leader groups through the national rural development programme which has an overall budget of £58 million.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently preparing the operational programmes for the implementation of Leader programmes for submission to the European Commission with a view to obtaining clearance and prompt establishment of Leader funding activity to 2006. The final shape of proposals for the sector including the operating rules cannot be settled until the Commission approves the Leader programmes.</P>

      <P>It is a condition of the scheme of early retirement from farming that participants must apply, on reaching their 66th birthday, to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for both the contributory and non-contributory old age pension. If a pension is awarded it must be offset against the farm retirement pension. Participants in the scheme are told of this condition when they join, and they are required to notify my Department if they are awarded an old-age pension.</P>
      <P>In the case of the person named, he reached age 66 on 16 July 1999 and became entitled to a non-contributory old age pension from that date. Accordingly, my Department was obliged to offset the amount of his old age pension against his early retirement pension.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 398 to 402, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Following discussions with my Department the Office of Public Works agreed last year, and are actively working on, the provision of new accommodation for my Department's staff in Roscommon town.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that the departmental office at Circular Road, Roscommon, presents a serious fire hazard. However, I have asked local management to ensure that all necessary steps are taken to guarantee the safety of our staff including a review of fire evacuation procedures and fire equipment. The matter raised in relation to an inspection by a health and safety inspecting officer should be taken up with the Health and Safety Authority.</P>

      <P>Most correspondence from Members of the Oireachtas is addressed directly to my own office or to the offices of the Ministers of State. All correspondence is acknowledged and referred to the relevant section of the Department for preparation of a final reply. If a reply is not received within four weeks, reminders are issued to the person concerned or their superior, as relevant. It is not possible to indicate the number of staff involved in answering correspondence as staff in almost all sections will deal with such correspondence from time to time.</P>
      <P>Staff were not specifically diverted from dealing with this correspondence to FOI duties and I have no evidence that the numbers dealing with such correspondence have reduced following the introduction of FOI.</P>
      <P>Given the volume of correspondence involved the arrangements work satisfactorily but are subject to periodic review.</P>

      <Quest>the reasoning behind the appointment of his Department as the inspectorate overseeing organic farming; if his attention has been drawn to the anger felt by organic farmers in this regard; if he will ensure that the highest standards will remain in force in organic farming; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[20137/00]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is the competent authority under the EU regulations governing the organic sector and is required to set up an inspection system operated by one or more designated inspection authorities and/or by approved inspection bodies. Standards for organic crop produce had been fixed since 1991 by EU Regulation 2092/91, and on 24 August 2000 this regulation was supplemented by Regulation 1804/99 which set standards for organic livestock produce. Under Regulation 2092/91 my Department had approved three private bodies to inspect and certify organic crop produce. These bodies, in a private capacity, had also been certifying organic livestock produce to standards that they themselves had set. When the livestock sector was brought within the ambit of Regulation 2092/91 in August, however, my Department as <Col N="362" /> the competent authority was obliged to make arrangements for its inspection.</P>
      <P>The Agri-Food 2010 report had included a recommendation that a credible regulatory system be put in place for the organic sector and that the existing confusion between competing inspection bodies be ended. In response, I undertook to streamline the inspection arrangements. My objective is to ensure that all organic farmers and processors have ready access to efficient, transparent and consistent arrangements for inspection and certification. My Department has recently put proposals to the three private bodies, the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association, Organic Trust and Demeter Standards Limited, for a unified inspection and certification system which will achieve this objective while allowing the three bodies to continue to operate their own private arrangements, where their own members are concerned, as heretofore. I understand that the three bodies are currently considering these proposals and I am hopeful for a positive response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has had consultations on standards for organic produce with the three private organic farming bodies, together with other interested parties, and I am confident that the standards which will be set will provide every reassurance to retailers and consumers as to the quality and integrity of Irish organic produce and <Col N="363" /> will ensure the continuing growth of the sector as part of mainstream farming in Ireland.</P>

      <Quest>if he will have arrangements made to have heracleum mantegazzianum, known as giant hogweed, listed as a noxious plant under the Noxious Weed Act, 1936, in view of the effects this plant can have if humans come in contact with it; if there are any regulations in existence dealing with this weed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans to review the noxious weeds legislation which was introduced at a time when specific weeds were a serious threat to farm productivity. A variety of approved agro-chemicals and machinery are now readily available to land owners for controlling weeds. Giant hogweed is not a specified noxious weed under the Act and poses no threat to agriculture. Consequently it would be inappropriate to use agricultural legislation to deal with the issue. I would contend that good management practice by land owners in areas normally accessed by the public should extend to adequate control of this plant and should not require specific legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>The legal basis for the calculation of the superlevy charged to the individual concerned has been outlined in full to him on a number of occasions. I am fully satisfied that the legal basis is correct. The basis for the levy and the general background was set out in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 204 of 10 May.</P>
      <P>Ireland, like all other member states in the European Union, has a national milk quota and can therefore produce up to that level without penalty. Milk production in excess of the national quota is, however, subject to a super levy. Super levy liability is calculated in accordance with EU legislation on the basis of milk deliveries to registered milk purchasers in the milk quota year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the provisions relating to the imposition of a super levy when actual milk deliveries exceed the quota, the relevant EU regu<Col N="364" /> lations include measures to penalise increases in the fat content of the milk deliveries. Each producer has a butterfat representative level, which is based on the fat content of his/her milk deliveries during either 1984/85 or 1985/86 milk quota years, whichever is the higher. At the end of each milk quota year, milk deliveries of each individual producer are adjusted to take account of the difference between the actual fat content of the producer's milk deliveries and his/her butterfat representative level. The actual milk deliveries are adjusted upwards or downwards by 0.18% for each 0.1 grams/kg difference between actual fat and butterfat representative level.</P>
    <P>Each year every co-operative/dairy submits details of the aggregated total of their producers' actual deliveries and fat adjusted deliveries. My Department, on the basis of these figures, then calculates the overall totals at national level. In accordance with the relevant provisions in the EU regulations, super levy liability is calculated on the higher of the two quantities namely actual or fat adjusted milk deliveries provided that this quantity exceeds the national quota.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the EU regulations make it clear that it is not possible to collect levy from some producers on the basis of actual deliveries and other producers on fat adjusted deliveries for the same milk quota year. Neither is it possible to assess a producer's levy liability on the basis of fat adjusted deliveries if, at a national level, the total of the fat adjusted deliveries is lower than the total of actual deliveries.</P>
    <P>The latter situation applied when the super levy liability was established in respect of the 1995-96 and 1996-97 milk quota years and therefore, the super levy liability of each producer had to be calculated on the basis of actual deliveries.</P>

      <Quest>if it is the case, under the milk quota regulations as originally introduced, that farmers in the severely handicapped area were intended to have an entitlement to a milk quota the equivalent of 35,000 gallons.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

      <P>There was never any stated intention in the milk quota regulations that farmers in the severely handicapped areas would have entitlement to a milk quota the equivalent of 35,000 gallons. When milk quotas were first introduced in 1984 individual quotas were based on deliveries during the 1983 calendar year plus 497 gallons for producers with deliveries of less than 14,000 gallons and 3.55% for producers with deliveries over 14,000 gallons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operation of the milk quota system in Ireland since then has taken particular account of the needs of small scale producers and a number of specific measures have been introduced to address their problems. The recently introduced revision to the milk quota regulations specifically targets small scale producers for favourable treat<Col N="365" /> ment in the redistribution of permanent quota under the milk quota restructuring scheme.</P>
    <P>The provision in the milk quota regulations under which quota is ring fenced in disadvantaged areas contributes to the retention of milk production in those regions of the country which are most vulnerable in terms of economic and social decline, and is of particular benefit to small scale committed producers.</P>
    <P>The Milk Quota Appeals Tribunal adjudicates on cases of hardship and over the years, on its recommendation, quota has been allocated to many applicants, again mostly small scale producers. I will, in the future, continue to make whatever efforts are possible within the constraints of the regulations, to address the specific needs of small scale producers.</P>

      <P>My Department is the competent authority under the EU regulations governing the organic sector and is required to set up an inspection system operated by one or more designated inspection authorities and/or by approved inspection bodies. Standards for organic crop produce had been fixed since 1991 by EU Regulation 2092/91, and on 24 August 2000 this regulation was supplemented by Regulation 1804/99 which set standards for organic livestock produce. Under Regulation 2092/91 my Department had approved three private bodies to inspect and certify organic crop produce. These <Col N="368" /> bodies, in a private capacity, had also been certifying organic livestock produce to standards that they themselves had set. When the livestock sector was brought within the ambit of Regulation 2092/91 in August, however, my Department as the competent authority was obliged to make arrangements for its inspection.</P>
      <P>The Agri-Food 2010 report had included a recommendation that a credible regulatory system be put in place for the organic sector and that the existing confusion between competing inspection bodies be ended. In response, I undertook to streamline the inspection arrangements. My objective is to ensure that all organic farmers and processors have ready access to efficient, transparent and consistent arrangements for inspection and certification. My Department has recently put proposals to the three private bodies, the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association, Organic Trust and Demeter Standards Limited, for a unified inspection and certification system which will achieve this objective while allowing the three bodies to continue to operate their own private arrangements, where their own members are concerned, as heretofore. I understand that the three bodies are currently considering these proposals and I am hopeful for a positive response.</P>

      <P>It is accepted that investment in human resources will be a key factor in ensuring competitiveness and comparative advantage in the food industry. It is therefore a critical element in the Government's support for the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The philosophy for the development of the food industry is underpinned in the specific food-related initiatives contained in the National <Col N="376" /> Development Plan 2000-2006 for which a total indicative public funding of £282 million will be provided.</P>
    <P>A sum of £31 million is being allocated to address the human resources needs of the food industry. This funding will be administered by Enterprise Ireland, which in conjunction with other relevant agencies is currently drawing up an operational plan that will provide human resource development supports for food safety training, competitiveness and productivity improvement, management development, innovation management and information technology. Specific supports will be provided to meet the special needs of micro companies and firms which are faced with the need to train first-time entrants to the industry.</P>
    <P>Attention to the research and innovative capabilities of the food industry is also acknowledged as a prime consideration in its development and this issue receives a particular focus in the food-related initiatives set out in the NDP. An indicative allocation of £83 million will be provided in respect of institutional research, in-company research and technology transfer which will play a significant role in assisting the industry in maximising its market orientation and competitiveness. Taken in conjunction with the initiative on human resource development, I am confident that these strategies will greatly assist the industry in attracting and retaining suitably qualified staff and contribute significantly to the vibrancy of this valuable indigenous industry.</P>

      <P>Under section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, tax relief may be claimed in respect of certain health expenses which include the services of a practitioner. Under the legislation &ldquo;practitioner&rdquo; means any person who is (a) registered as a medical practitioner under section 26 of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, (b) registered as a dental practitioner under section 26 of the Dentists Act, 1985 or (c) in relation to health care received outside the State, persons who are entitled under the laws of the country in which the care is provided to practise medicine or dentistry there.</P>
      <P>If the services of a practitioner include acupuncture, tax relief may be claimed. However, if the acupuncture treatment is carried out by a person who is not a practitioner, tax relief may not be claimed, even in cases where the patient has been referred by a practitioner to that person for acupuncture treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that I am unable to introduce more <Col N="378" /> direct tax relief in respect of acupuncture expenses at this time. It would be extremely difficult to specify which practitioners should be recognised in the absence of any official regulation of the area at present. However, I will continue to bear the situation in mind in reviewing the position at a future date.</P>

I should explain that the position is governed by EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. We can retain the zero rating provisions which were in existence on 1 January 1991, but cannot introduce any new ones. Therefore, it is not possible to zero rate the annual charge for the emergency response for the elderly. In addition, EU VAT law requires that VAT apply to the annual charge for the emergency response regardless of the status of the user of the service and it is not open to me to remove VAT from this charge for the elderly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 447, 481 and 486 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, the target for the new programme of decentralisation involves up to 10,000 civil servants and public servants and I intend that the Government will be in a position to take decisions in relation to the new programme by the end of the year. While I had hoped that decisions would have been taken earlier in the year, this did not prove possible due to the scale of the proposed programme, including, for example, issues relating to the identification of those who would relocate as well as the centres to which they would relocate. I am satisfied, however, that the Government's target can be achieved.</P>
      <P>In view of the widespread interest expressed in the new programme and the various interests which must be taken into account, I am currently in the process of renewing extensive consultations with the Civil Service management and the public service staff unions. The views of the management and the unions will then be furnished to the Cabinet sub-committee on decentralisation which, apart from myself, includes the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. These views will help inform the work of the Cabinet sub-committee as will the submissions received from and representations and enquiries made on behalf of over 120 urban centres throughout every county in the country. I want to assure Deputies that, despite speculation to the contrary, the Government have not yet taken decisions in relation to the selection of particular centres for inclusion in the forthcoming programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to emphasise that in implementing the programme I do not intend to depart from the <Col N="382" /> well established voluntary nature of decentralisation. I am anxious also to ensure that the implementation of such an extensive programme in no way compromises the efficient and effective delivery of public services. I am satisfied that the approach I am adopting to the implementation of the Government's decision will ensure that this is the case.</P>
    <P>I can confirm that my Department has indeed received a submission from Westmeath County Council, Mullingar Town Commission, Mullingar Chamber of Commerce, Mullingar and district trade union groups, Westmeath County Enterprise Board, Westmeath Community Development Limited and others setting out the case for the inclusion of Mullingar in the new decentralisation programme. This submission, along with the many others received, will, as indicated above, be considered in the context of the Government's forthcoming deliberations.</P>

      <P>An individual will qualify for the allowance where he or she: takes up a &ldquo;qualifying employment&rdquo;, and has been unemployed for the immediate 12 months prior to taking up the employment, and has been in receipt of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance or one-parent family payment, or certain disability payments or persons released under the Good Friday Agreement during that 12 month period.</P>
      <P>A &ldquo;qualifying employment&rdquo; is one which: commences on or after 6 April 1998, and is capable of lasting for 12 months, and is of at least 30 hours duration per week.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioner's have also informed me that according to their records the individual concerned in this case was employed on the following basis: (a) June 1998 to September 1998 on temporary summer work; (b) May 1999 to April 2000 on a full-time temporary basis; (c) May 2000 to date on a full-time permanent basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The individual did not qualify for the Revenue job assist allowance in respect of the first period of employment as that particular employment was not capable of lasting 12 months. According to the information currently available to the inspector of taxes, the individual does not qualify for the allowance in respect of the second and <Col N="383" /> third periods of employment, as he was not unemployed, and in receipt of any of the above-mentioned benefits for the immediate 12 months prior to taking up the employment.</P>
    <P>However, if the person concerned feels that further facts need to be taken into account or that the Revenue Commissioner's understanding of his case is inaccurate in any respect he should contact Dublin Paye 1 District, Division 57, 9/15 Upr O'Connell Street, Dublin 1 &ndash; Phone No. 8746821.

      <P>There are two international multilateral agreements which have been signed but not yet ratified by my Department. Both are related to the convention of 23 July 1990 on the elimination of double taxation in connection with the adjustment of profits of associated enterprises. The 1990 convention is commonly known as the Arbitration Convention. The Arbitration Convention provides for a mutual agreement procedure between tax authorities to avoid double taxation in certain cases involving associated companies. Double taxation can arise where associated companies operate in different member states and trade with each other. If one of the tax authorities concerned, having regard to transactions between the companies, makes an upward adjustment of the taxable profits of one of the companies, double taxation will occur unless the other tax authority makes a compensating adjustment in the taxable profits of the other company. Where this procedure fails to resolve disputes, the convention provides for referral to an independent advisory commission. The details requested are as follows:</P>
      <P>Protocol amending the convention of 23 July 1990 on the elimination of double taxation in connection with the adjustment of profits of associated enterprises. The protocol amends the Arbitration Convention so as to extend it for further periods of five years at a time unless at least six months before the expiry of any five year period any of the member states informs the Secretary General of the Council of the European Union of its objection to such extension. Opened for signature on 25 May 1999 in Brussels and was negotiated through EU Council. Under section 826 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, a Government order is required. It is intended that this order will be implemented by the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Convention on the accession of the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden to the convention on the elimination of double taxation in connection with the adjustment of profits of associated enterprises. This convention requiring implementation adds the new member states of the European Union, Austria, Finland and Sweden to the Arbitration Convention which was opened for <Col N="385" /> signature on 21 December 1995 in Brussels and negotiated through EU Council. Under section 826 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 a Government order is required. It is intended that this order will be implemented by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>There are five international multilateral agreements which have been signed but not yet ratified by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Convention drawn up on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union on the use of information technology for customs purposes, was opened for signature on 26 July 1995 in Brussels and negotiated through the European Union.

    <P>Agreement on the provisional application between certain member states of the European Union of the convention drawn up on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union on the use of information technology for customs purposes was opened for signature on 26 July 1995 in Brussels and negotiated through the European Union. It is proposed to ratify this agreement by the end of 2000. Legislation is required.</P>
    <P>Protocol drawn up on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union on the interpretation by way of preliminary rulings by the Court of Justice of the European Communities of the Convention on the use of information technology for customs purposes was opened for signature on 29 November 1996 in Brussels and negotiated through the European Union.

      <P>The following is a list of proposed statutory instruments and the effect of each which are being prepared in, or under the auspices of my Department: designation of the 49 integrated area plans approved by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government under the 1999 urban renewal scheme for tax reliefs; an extension to the qualifying period to 31 December 1998 for the tax reliefs in respect of the East Point enterprise area; designation of Knock Airport enterprise area for tax relief; Civil Service spouses' and children's contributory pension scheme: to give statutory effect to revisions to the scheme which were introduced following agreed recommendations under the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the Civil Service. The revised scheme provides pension benefits for the spouse of a member of the scheme who marries after retirement and for all children of the member, and raises the age limit for eligible children in full time education to age 22; spouses' and children's contributory pension scheme for members of the Judiciary: to give statutory effect to revisions to the scheme which were introduced in 1998. The revised scheme provides pension benefits for the spouse of a member of the scheme who marries after retirement and for all children of the member; a pension scheme, under the British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999, for the staff of the implementation bodies is being prepared by the Department of Finance and Personnel, Northern Ireland), and my Department; voluntary early retirement scheme: to give statutory effect to certain voluntary redundancy/early retirement arrangements in the Civil Service; professional added years: to give statutory effect to arrangements which provide for certain additions to service for established civil servants appointed to professional, technical or specialist posts; purchase of service: to give statutory effect to purchase of service schemes for civil servants; superannuation scheme for established civil servants: to provide for consolidation of the principal superannuation arrangements for established civil servants into a single scheme; prison officers: to give statutory effect to revised early retirement arrangements for certain grades of prison officer which were introduced following an agreed recommendation under the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the Civil Service; trans<Col N="388" /> fer of service: to give statutory effect to transfer of service arrangements within the public sector; pensions increases: to give statutory effect to pension increases which have been awarded to civil servants; pension arrangements for MEPs: to give statutory effect to certain revisions to the scheme; draft regulations to bring 17 bodies within the remit of the Freedom of Information Act on 21 October 2000. The bodies concerned are in the social services, voluntary health, environment and regulatory sectors. Further extensions of the Act are planned for 2001; four draft orders are being prepared under the Economic and Monetary Union Act, 1998. The proposed effect of these orders is to withdraw legal tender status from Irish pound notes and coins and to call in the coins from midnight on 9 February 2002, to commence the provisions enabling the issue (through the Central Bank) of euro coins from 1 January 2002, and to specify the design of the national face of such coins; Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (Adjustment of Profits of Associated Enterprises) (Republic of Austria, Republic of Finland and Kingdom of Sweden) Order. This order will implement the convention on the accession of the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden to the convention on the elimination of double taxation in connection with the adjustment of profits of associated enterprises (the Arbitration Convention).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Arbitration Convention provides for a mutual agreement procedure between tax authorities to avoid double taxation in certain cases involving associated companies. Double taxation can arise where associated companies operate in different member states and trade with each other. If one of the tax authorities concerned, having regard to transactions between the companies, makes an upward adjustment of the taxable profits of one of the companies, double taxation will occur unless the other tax authority makes a compensating adjustment in the taxable profits of the other company. Where this procedure fails to resolve disputes, the convention provides for referral to an independent advisory commission. The new convention requiring implementation adds the new member states of the European Union, Austria, Finland and Sweden to the Arbitration Convention. The order is expected to be implemented by the end of the year; Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (Adjustment of Profits of Associated Enterprises) Order. This order will implement the protocol amending the convention on the elimination of double taxation in connection with the adjustment of profits of associated enterprises (the Arbitration Convention). The protocol amends the Arbitration Convention so as to extend it for further periods of five years at a time unless at least six months before the expiry of any five year period any of the member states informs the Secretary General of the Council of the European Union of its objection to such extension. The order is expected to be implemented by the end <Col N="389" /> of the year; Offset of Taxes Regulations, 2000. These regulations arise from section 1006A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, inserted by section 164 of the Finance Act, 2000, which allows the Revenue Commissioners to set any claim for a repayment of tax against outstanding tax liabilities before making any repayment to the taxpayer. Repayments may be offset against any liability to a tax, duty or charge under the various statutes relating to taxation and excise. The regulations made under the section will specify the order of priority of tax liabilities against which any repayment may be set; Appropriation of Payments Regulations, 2000. These regulations arise from section 1006B of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, inserted by section 164 of the Finance Act, 2000, which allows the Revenue Commissioners set payments received against any outstanding liabilities under the Tax Acts, the Capital Gains Tax Acts or the Value Added Tax Acts where no or imprecise accounting instructions accompany a payment. The regulations made under the section will specify the order of tax liabilities against which the payment will be set.</P>

      <P>The following is a list of Acts or sections or other provisions of Acts under the auspices of my Department or for the commencement of which my Department is responsible, which have not been commenced.</P>
      <P>There are four sections of various Finance Acts which have not yet been commenced, namely: section 45 of the Finance Act, 1998, which relates to changes in the filing dates prescribed under the self-assessment system. The reason why the section was not commenced is that the proposed filing dates were superseded by the filing dates which form part of the scheme to align the tax year with the calendar year.</P>
      <P>Section 109 of the Finance Act, 1999, which relates to the consolidation of mineral oil legislation which was included in that Act. The reason for the delay is because secondary legislation required is not yet completed.</P>
      <P>Section 96 of the Finance Act, 2000, which relates to the use of low sulphur diesel in passenger transport services. The reason why the section has not been commenced is because of concerns in the trade because of the lack of availability of the product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="390" /> Section 64 of the Finance Act, 2000, provides for capital allowances for expenditure incurred on the purchase of long-term rights to use advanced communications infrastructure. This section is subject to the issuing of a commencement order by the Minister for Finance before coming into force. The issuing of such an order is dependent on receipt of clarification from the European Commission that section 64 is not subject to notification under EU-state aids rules. The Department of Public Enterprise has sought and is awaiting such clarifications from the European Commission.</P>
    <P>There is one section of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1976, which has not yet commenced.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1976, will repeal enactments mentioned in the Second Schedule to that Act. Commencement of the section is dependent on the making of the principal Civil Service pension scheme.</P>
    <P>There is one section of the Economic and Monetary Union Act, 1998, which has not yet commenced.</P>
    <P>Section 11(2) of the above Act deals with the issue of euro coins which will not take place until 1 January 2002. A draft commencement order is being prepared with a view to its being made later this year in conjunction with other Orders under the Act.</P>
    <P>There are two sections of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, which have not yet commenced.</P>
    <P>Section 1006A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, requires that regulations be made by the Revenue Commissioners to give effect to that section. These regulations, called Offset of Taxes Regulations, 2000, allow the Revenue Commissioners to set any claim for a repayment of tax against outstanding tax liabilities before making any repayment to the taxpayer. Repayments may be offset against any liability to a tax, duty or charge under the various Statutes relating to taxation and the excise. The regulations made under the section will specify the order of priority of tax liabilities against which any repayment may be set. It is expected that the regulations will be made before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Section 1006B of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, requires that regulations be made by the Revenue Commissioners to give effect to that section. These regulations called Appropriation of Payments Regulations, 2000, will allow the Revenue Commissioners to set payments received against any outstanding liabilities under the Tax Acts, the Capital Gains Tax Acts or the Value Added Tax Acts where no or imprecise accounting instructions accompany a payment. The regulations made under the section will specify the order of tax liabilities against which the payment will be set. It is expected that the regulations will be made before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>Single regulatory authority &ndash; SRA &ndash; for the financial services sector:</P>
      <P>The Government has decided to establish a single, unified, regulatory authority for the financial services sector.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 460 and 465 together.</P>
      <P>The business expansion scheme &ndash; BES &ndash; was introduced in 1984 and is scheduled to operate until 5 April 2001.</P>
      <P>It is a tax-based incentive designed to stimulate investment in small unquoted businesses. The scheme provides individuals with tax relief in respect of investment in certain activities such as manufacturing, certain tourism activities and internationally traded services.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the 1998 Finance Act reduced the amount that a company could raise under the BES from £1 million to £250,000. The limit was reduced to refocus the relief on start-up/smaller companies which may find it hard to raise finance elsewhere. This was the original intention of the BES. It was also done to reduce the growing cost of the relief to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The BES has been reviewed on a number of occasions most recently in 1998 for the 1999 budget and copies of the review paper (TSG 98/34) have been placed in the Oireachtas library. It is also available on the Department's website (www.irlgov.ie/finance).</P>
      <P>The question of extending or amending the BES will be considered in the context of preparations for the forthcoming budget and Finance Bill and I will bear in mind the comments of the Deputies in this matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 461 and 462 together.</P>
      <P>My office sourced accommodation on behalf of the Department of Foreign Affairs for the provision of accommodation for Kosovar refugees invited here in 1999. In addition, my office sources suitable accommodation to meet the requirements of the asylum seekers accommodation programme, on behalf of the directorate for asylum support services.</P>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs is currently facilitating a repatriation programme for the Kosovar refugees. As a result of this programme, the level of their accommodation needs has declined. At this stage of the programme, the Department of Foreign Affairs, in conjunction with my office, is currently reviewing the best accommodation options for the 119 Kosovars currently remaining.</P>
      <P>Three properties were purchased to accommodate the Kosovar refugees:</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1998 I introduced a scheme for tax relief for corporate investment in certain renewable energy projects. To qualify for the relief the energy project must be in the solar, wind, hydro or biomass technology categories, and be approved by the Minister for Public Enterprise. The relief takes the form of a deduction for tax purposes from a company's profits for an investment in new ordinary <Col N="398" /> shares in a company setting up a renewable energy project. The relief is capped at 50% of all capital expenditure, excluding land, net of grants, for a single project or £7.5 million, whichever is lesser. Investment by a company or group is capped at £10 million per annum, and unless the shares are held for at least five years by the investor company the relief will be withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Following clearance of the scheme by the European Commission, I made an order providing that the relief would come into operation from 18 March 1999 for a three year period.</P>
      <P>While the relief was designed for a corporate structure, individuals can also invest in wind energy through a limited partnership structure. However, in regard to such limited partnerships, in general, there were major abuses and I had to close off this loophole in the Finance Act, 2000, in respect of the availability of the relief to individuals involved in a partnership structure. Closing off this abuse confines in general the application of the relief to active partners in partnerships. However, I would like to point out that in the case of non-active limited partnerships investment in renewal energy, transitional arrangements were provided for in the Finance Act, 2000, which allow for expenditure incurred under an obligation entered into before 1 March 2001 to be excluded from this restriction. I believe that these transitional arrangements are quite generous. On this basis until the existing three year scheme has elapsed, I do not intend broadening the existing scheme.</P>

      <P>It is a fundamental requirement for relief from tax under the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994, that the disabled person meets the medical criteria specified in the regulations and is in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer, who is an official of the local health board. Where the issue of a primary medical certificate is refused, it is open to the applicant to appeal this refusal to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, an independent body, whose decision is final.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that neither my Department nor the Revenue Commissioners have any role in the medical assessment of disabled persons or the issue of primary medical certificates.</P>
      <P>I understand that the person referred to has been refused a primary medical certificate and has appealed this refusal to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal. An appointment for assessment by the board of appeal will be notified to the person concerned in due course. The Deputy may wish to note that there are other State funded schemes aimed at mobility, namely a mobility allowance and a motorised transport grant, both of which are payable by the health boards.</P>
      <P>The review of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme, by an interdepartmental group which is chaired by an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is ongoing.

      <P>Mobile home sites capable of accommodating up to 1,000 people have been completed in three locations &ndash; Tralee, Kildare and Athlone.</P>
      <P>The firms which supplied the mobile homes at these locations are H. Farrell and Sons, Rathcoole, County Kildare; Bunratty Mobile Homes Limited, Bunratty East, County Clare and A. Maher Caravans Limited, Dunboyne, County Meath.</P>
      <P>This fulfils the Government decision of 28 March last in respect of the mobile home element.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently, the Office of Public Works is <Col N="400" /> developing proposals for the construction of a number of temporary prefabricated centres. Advertisements were placed in the national media during the summer inviting suitable contractors to express an interest. Following selection of a number of candidates, tenders were invited for the first tranche of these buildings. No contracts in respect of these buildings have yet been placed.</P>
    <P>In accordance with normal policy on this issue, Irish firms will continue to be given the opportunity to quote for work of this nature, always bearing in mind the specific requirements of the programme and the need to secure the best value for money.</P>

      <P>Under the National Lottery Act, 1986, one of the designated categories for national lottery funding is &ldquo;the health of the community&rdquo;. The Act also provides that the Government may designate additional categories for which National Lottery funds may be allocated.</P>
      <P>In 1999 my Department implemented one of the key recommendations from the report of the review group on the national lottery which was that &ldquo;the beneficiary fund, apart from any moneys in the reserve fund, should in future be devoted entirely to the support of community and voluntary activity in the areas of sports, youth services, the arts, the Irish language, welfare, health, social services and community development&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that under the national development plan (see paras. 6.39 to 6.41) it is proposed to allocate £550 million to research, technological development and innovation, RTDI, in the education sector &ldquo;to boost human potential in research, science and technology and to strengthen the research and science capability of our higher education institutions&rdquo;. Research in the humanities, the sciences including medical science and technology will benefit from this investment. In addition, medical research projects are already benefiting under the £220 million public/private programme for research in third level institutions.</P>
      <P>I would envisage that medical research would continue to be supported in this way rather than through the national lottery beneficiary fund.</P>

      <P>Correspondence addressed to the Minister of Finance is distributed by staff in my private office to the <Col N="402" /> appropriate line section of my Department for consideration and preparation of a draft reply. The number of staff in my private office primarily engaged in the task of distributing all incoming correspondence and co-ordinating draft replies received back from line sections has remained constant at three in recent years.</P>
      <P>Preparing draft replies to Ministerial correspondence is an integral part of the duties of a large proportion of the staff of my Department. The amount of staff time spent on dealing with correspondence varies in line with the amount and complexity of correspondence and the overall staff complement of the Department.</P>
      <P>The instructions to staff in line sections are that correspondence should be dealt with promptly and, specifically, that if a final reply to correspondence cannot be prepared within seven days, an acknowledgement/holding reply should be prepared. A computer based correspondence tracking system has been in place for a number of years. A review of procedures for handling ministerial correspondence is currently under way and a number of modifications is envisaged.</P>
      <P>While the enactment of the Freedom of Information Act has clearly imposed additional demands on the staff of all Departments, every effort continues to be made to reply expeditiously to representations from members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The position is governed by EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. We can retain the zero rates of VAT that were in existence up to 1 January 1991 and on that basis we can retain the zero rating for oral medicines. However, it is not within my power to introduce new zero rates for any other goods or services and it is not therefore possible for me to remove VAT on non-oral medicines.</P>
      <P>However, it is possible under EU VAT law to introduce a reduced VAT rate for non-oral medicines. The possibility of making a change to the current VAT rates for non-oral medicines will be considered in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <Col N="404" /> For a number of years, under a special refund scheme, the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No. 15) order 1981, repayment may be claimed by disabled persons of the VAT paid on certain special aids and appliances. The relief is also available in certain circumstances to persons other than disabled persons who purchase such goods for handing over to a particular disabled person.</P>
    <P>The operation of these orders is entirely a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. Details of the scheme can be obtained from the Revenue Commissioners, VAT Refund (Unregistered) Section, Government Buildings, Kilrush Road, Ennis, County Clare.</P>

      <P>As I have informed the House on several occasions recently, under the EU Sixth VAT Directive, member states may retain the zero rates they had in place on 1 January 1991 but they are prohibited from introducing new zero rates.</P>
      <P>The supply of electricity and gas are subject to VAT at the 12.5% rate and in this regard, Ireland avails of certain options for reduced rating contained in EU VAT law. Telecommunications services are standard rated at 21%. It is not open to me to zero rate the supply of such services as these VAT rates must apply regardless of the user of the service.</P>
      <P>I should say that for those people in receipt of free telephone rental allowance that this covers the normal two monthly telephone instrument and line rental charges for a standard telephone and also provides up to 20 free call units in each two monthly billing period. For those in receipt of free electricity allowance, this covers the normal standing charge and provides 1500 free units, i.e., 200 units per two monthly billing period in the summer and 300 units per two monthly period in the winter. In addition, it is possible to use the free fuel allowance which is payable from mid-October to mid-April to cover electricity charges and heating bills. For those in receipt of the free schemes, the VAT is borne by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to both commercial and domestic accounts. Most commercial cus<Col N="405" /> tomers would be VAT registered and would be able to reclaim the VAT on their electricity bills. It would be the net VAT figure which is probably of interest to the Deputy in this case. However, VAT returns are not required to be made in a manner which identifies the yield from particular goods and services. It is estimated that the net VAT collected from the supply of electricity amounted to £61 million in 1998 and £65 million in 1999. The number of customers of any firm is not a matter for which I have responsibility.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of the unfinished negotiations between AIB and the Revenue Commissioners about its outstanding liabilities arising from the DIRT inquiry, he will consider withholding the repayment to AIB of £70 million arising out of the ICI collapse and the repayment of the balance of £30 million to Icarom; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The repayment of £70 million to which the Deputy refers was made by the Central Bank to AIB on Friday, 29 September last, in accordance with the terms on which it was deposited by AIB with the Central Bank in 1985 as part of the funding arrangements put in place at that time for the High Court administration of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, now called Icarom.</P>
      <P>Those funding arrangements involved the Minister for Finance making a repayable advance of £100 million to the High Court Administrator of ICI <i>via</i> the insurance compensation fund. That advance was funded by a £100 million loan to the Minister for Finance from the Central Bank which was funded in turn by a £70 million deposit from AIB and £30 million of the Central Bank's own resources. All of these arrangements were scheduled to terminate not later than 1 October, 2000. Accordingly, on 29 September, 2000 Icarom repaid £100 million to the Insurance Compensation Fund from the company's own resources and this was repaid to the Minister for Finance and in turn to the Central Bank. The £30 million to which the Deputy refers represented the Central Bank's own resources.</P>
      <P>The repayment of the £100 million loan on 29 September 2000 effectively ends the arrangements which were put in place in 1985 for the funding of the High Court administration of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland which mainly involved the repayable advance of £100 million and an annual interest subsidy of £7 million payable by AIB and other banks over the 15 year term of the £100 million repayable advance.</P>
      <P>The ending of the 1985 funding arrangements does not affect the additional funding arrangements which were put in place in 1992 and which provided for an interest free loan of £32 million from the Exchequer, which is repayable not later than 2012 and for an annual contribution of £8.8 million from Allied Irish Banks for each of the 20 years up to 2012.</P>
      <P>The question of negotiations between AIB and the Revenue Commissioners about AIB's outstanding DIRT liabilities is a separate matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have looked into this case and the following is the position in relation to part-time employment in the Irish Civil Service.</P>
      <P>Flexible working options currently available to civil servants include flexitime and jobsharing. Flexitime allows staff flexibility in relation to their daily attendance hours within certain parameters. Staff are required to be present for certain core hours but have flexibility in relation to their attendance pattern outside these core hours. Jobsharing is where a person attends 50% of the time. Originally, participants shared a job with a partner employee. In recent years staff have been allowed to jobshare without a partner which has given greater access to part-time employment in the Irish Civil Service. At present, jobsharing is the only part-time option available in the Irish Civil Service.</P>
      <P>Extensive discussions have taken place with the staff unions in recent months on the introduction of a worksharing scheme. The proposed scheme will provide staff and management with a wide variety of attendance options. These options will include a three day week, four day week, shorter hours such as 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. working day, 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. working day. In the case of the latter options, a minimum of eight hours must be worked in any week. Other options will include three weeks on, one week off. Discussions on the implementation of worksharing are at an advanced stage and it is anticipated that a circular on the scheme will be issued before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Until the worksharing scheme comes into operation there are no provisions in the current work arrangements for a civil servant to work ten hours per week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>On 12 May 2000, I announced a new initiative under which nurses and midwives wishing to undertake nursing and certain other undergraduate degree courses on a part-time basis will have their fees paid by their health service employers in return for a commitment to continue working in the public health service for a period of up to two years after they complete the courses.</P>
      <P>This initiative will come into operation next year and will continue until at least the year 2005, when it will be reviewed in the light of developments in pre-registration nursing education. However, nurses and midwives who commence courses covered by the initiative in the academic year 2000-1 will qualify for a refund of their fees in 2001 provided they sign a written undertaking, before they commence the course, to continue working in the public health service for the required period after the completion of the course.</P>
      <P>This initiative has been welcomed by the nursing unions as the most equitable approach to the provision of financial support for nurses undertaking post-registration education programmes, and I certainly do not consider that it is in any way discriminatory. The position is that the initiative does not apply retrospectively to either full-time or part-time nursing degree courses undertaken by nurses during the academic year 1999-2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might mention, for the information of the Deputy, that the President of National University of Ireland, Galway has notified me that the academic council of the University has approved a number of changes to its Bachelor of Nursing <Col N="411" /> full-time degree programme. That particular programme will no longer be designated as full-time, but will be extended over one calendar year and timetabled to enable students to work for a substantial part of the week. On the basis of those changes, the revised programme has been included in the list of courses that will be covered by the fees initiative.</P>

      <P>There are currently seven consultants in palliative medicine in the State with three based in the Eastern Regional Health Authority and one each in the Mid Western Health Board, South Eastern Health Board, Southern Health Board and Western Health Board areas. There are four specialist palliative care inpatient units led by consultants in palliative medicine based in Our Lady's Hospice, Harold's Cross, Dublin, St. Francis Hospice, Raheny, Dublin, Milford Care Centre, Limerick and Marymount Hospice, Cork. Each of these agencies has a specialist palliative day care centre, a specialist palliative care team in the community and provides a hospital palliative care service. In the South Eastern Health Board the consultant in palliative medicine is based in St. Lukes Hospital, Kilkenny. In the Western Health Board the consultant in palliative medicine is based in University Hospital Galway. The above refers to specialist palliative care services. Palliative care is, of course, provided to individual patients with terminal illnesses at hospitals throughout the country.</P>

      <P>The article to which the Deputy refers was included in an information pack sent by the Irish Medicines Board to Members of the Oireachtas and Irish MEPs. This circulation arose as a consequence of the appearance of officers of the board at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committees on Health and Children and Enterprise and Small Business which discussed St. John's Wort and related matters.</P>
      <P>The information pack consisted of 15 different items including the board's presentation to the joint committees. Also included were the board's published Guide to the Definition of a Medicinal Product, various other documents relating to St. John's Wort and a number of articles relating generally to herbal and alternative medicines. These included the article to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the Irish Medicines Board that it considered the article in question, which was published in a reputable non-scientific journal of international repute, as simply presenting another view, albeit a critical one, in relation to the general issues surrounding alternative medicine. The board points out that the inclusion in the information pack of this article did not constitute an endorsement by the Irish Medicines Board of any of the views expressed in the article.</P>

      <P>The provision of an air ambulance service for emergency cases which cannot be safely conveyed by road ambulance is provided by the Air Corps and the marine search and rescue helicopter service of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources.  Proposals for the development of a dedicated air ambulance service fall to be considered in the wider context of developments in emergency medical services generally.</P>
      <P>It is important to acknowledge that the development of emergency medical services encompass all areas of emergency care including the ambulance service, general practice and hospitals' accident and emergency departments. The potential benefits of a dedicated air ambulance service must, therefore, be examined in the context of the improvements to emergency medical services generally and I am anxious to ensure the development of a consensus in an Irish context of the most appropriate role for air support in the provision of pre-hospital care and inter-hospital transfer. I have personally held initial discussions in this matter recently with interested parties and I propose to have further discussions in the near future. I am also seeking the views of the pre-hospital emergency care council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted the concerns expressed by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals in his annual report in relation to the training of psychiatrists. Training in psychiatry in Ireland is supervised by the Irish Psychiatric Training Committee. It includes clinical, administrative, legal and other relevant aspects. It is very much focused on the services here and, at higher training level, aims to train consultants particularly for the Irish psychiatric services. As in other medical specialties, some doctors train abroad particularly in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada. Given that this is a relatively small country this cross fertilisation from other countries is useful and leads to an inquiring and open attitude amongst psychiatrists working at consultant level in Ireland thereby facilitating the assimilation of <Col N="416" /> modern approaches to patient care and treatment.</P>
      <P>The worth of the scheme is evidenced by the number of doctors completing the higher training scheme in psychiatry in Ireland who succeed in obtaining consultant appointments here. Postgraduate training for doctors is a key issue in having a strategy to help young Irish doctors working in the health service and will be highlighted in the report of the medical manpower forum which I expect to be agreed shortly.</P>

      <P>I want to assure the Deputy that I am committed to ensuring that Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children is a position to respond to the need for their cardiology/cardiac surgery services. In this regard the Deputy may wish to note that my Department has sanctioned a major theatre development at the hospital. This theatre development at the hospital, when completed, will provide five new operating theatres complete with ancillary accommodation, a day surgery area and a central sterile supplies department. The existing theatre facilities will also be upgraded to provide a further two theatre suites. When these theatres are fully commissioned it is expected the hospital will be in a position to perform an additional 100 paediatric cardiac procedures per annum, which is an increase of 40% on its existing capacity. This development is expected to cost in the region of £20 million.  In addition my Department has approved the appointment of an additional consultant cardiothoracic surgeon who I understand commenced duty at the hospital in August of this year.</P>

      <P>The particulars to be recorded in the register of deaths are set out in the Births and Deaths Acts, 1863 to 1966, and in regulations made under those Acts. The Acts provide that all deaths occurring in Ireland should be registered, in the registrar's district in which they occurred, as soon as possible. The person registering the death (the qualified informant) must produce to the registrar a medical certificate of cause of death signed by a registered medical practitioner who treated the deceased within 28 days before the death. This certificate will state, as appropriate, the disease or condition directly leading to the death, the approximate interval between onset and death, antecedent causes and other significant conditions.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 510 and 614 together.</P>
      <P>All significant research in this area is monitored by the Department of Public Enterprise with whom my Department liaises regarding the human health aspects. Approval for the erection of mobile phone masts in a particular area is a function of the local planning authority and guidelines were issued by the Department of the Environment and Local Government to all local authorities in relation to location of mobile phone masts. The monitoring of the levels of emissions from mobile phone masts is a function of the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. That office publishes an audit report of licensed operators each year. The audit is carried out by Enterprise Ireland for the office. The most recent report published in February 2000 focuses on compliance with the general public exposure limits specified by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection in 1998. The report shows that all the companies audited have procedures and arrangements in place to ensure compliance with the general public exposure limits.</P>
      <P>A large number of human health studies have been carried out in this area and further research is under way. The World Health Organisation in 1996 launched a five year research programme (the International EMF Project) to assess the health and environmental aspects of electric and magnetic fields including those associated with mobile phone masts. This project will bring together current knowledge and available resources of key international and national agencies and scientific institutions in order to arrive at scientifically sound recommendations for health risk assessments. The results of this research programme will, hopefully, inform any decisions which may need to be taken in relation to appropriate responses to the presence of electric and magnetic fields.</P>
      <P>From the public health viewpoint if conclusive evidence emerges that radiation from mobile phones equipment is causing an unacceptable public health risk then I would seek to have appropriate remedial measures put in place by Departments and agencies with direct responsibility in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Government policy in relation to heroin misuse aims at reducing the number of people turning to drug misuse in the first instance through information, education and prevention programmes and providing a range of treatment options for those addicted to heroin or other drugs, the ultimate objective of which must be a return to a drug free lifestyle, although this may not be a realistic goal in every instance, in the short term at least.</P>
      <P>Health boards, in conjunction with a range of other statutory and voluntary agencies and community groups have significantly enhanced services for drug misusers and, in particular, those addicted to heroin. There has been extensive development of treatment facilities, particularly in the greater Dublin area, in recent years. The provision of treatment facilities for heroin addicts in Dublin has been a particular priority for a number of reasons including the protection of the health and well being of addicts themselves and their families, the control of the spread of infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C and the reduction of the risk to local communities and society generally from the sometimes chaotic behaviour of addicts.</P>
      <P>Health boards are aware of the need for rehabilitation and aftercare as part of an integrated programme of care for drug misusers. It is important to acknowledge, however, that the success of treatment and rehabilitation outcomes for people who are chronically addicted to heroin are varied. Heroin misusers may present for detoxification several times before they achieve a long-term drug-free status.</P>
      <P>Rehabilitation is given high priority, particularly in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area where the expansion of rehabilitation services is taking place. I fully support these important developments as rehabilitation and aftercare are seen as a vital part of a continuum of services in the overall treatment of drug misusers to achieve the ultimate goal of a drug-free lifestyle and to play a full role in society.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware of the valuable contribution being made by local drugs task forces in providing a co-ordinated and integrated response in areas worst affected by the drugs problem.</P>
      <P>My Department will continue to support health boards in expanding their range of services with the aim of having in place a continuum of care to which people using heroin will have immediate access whatever their place in the cycle of addiction. Thus, chronic users should be able to avail of needle exchange and low threshold services while those who are highly motivated to give up their drug habit should have access to detoxification and support services such as counselling.</P>

      <P>The social services inspectorate is headed by an acting director, who was recruited on a temporary secondment from the social services inspectorate in Northern Ireland and commenced work on a part time basis in April 1999. He was tasked with setting up the social services inspectorate, including the recruitment and training of a team of three inspectors, who commenced employment in September 1999. The initial period after training was spent developing draft standards and developing inspection instruments in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, the health boards and other parties who have an interest in the matter. A pilot inspection was carried out in a children's residential centre in the South Eastern Health Board. Since that time the inspectorate has carried out a further 15 inspections, including a pre-opening inspection of the new special care unit at Ballydowd. There are over 30 residential homes to be inspected. The number of children's residential homes run directly by the health boards is set to increase as the voluntary sector reduces its involvement in residential child care so the initial round of inspections may take longer than originally planned. This inspection programme has been the main focus of the inspectorate's work over the current year although the inspectorate has also provided professional comment and advice in relation to a number of policy developments and assisted the health boards with advice on specialist topics. The inspectorate has prepared an overview report of its findings to date and this is due to be launched on Tuesday, 10 October.</P>
      <P>The plans for the inspectorate were that it would concentrate for the first three years on child care, and in particular on the inspection of children's residential centres run by the health boards. A fourth inspector has recently been recruited to assist with monitoring the implementation of the new national guidelines for the protection and welfare of children. When the initial round of inspections has been completed, it is planned that the inspectorate will turn its attention to other areas of child care service, such as foster care, within the next two years. In the longer term it is planned that the work of the inspectorate will be extended to cover the full range of personal social services provided by the health boards.</P>

      <P>Under the general medical services scheme certain gluten-free foods are available to medical card holders who are coeliacs. These food items include breads, bread mixes, flours and pizza bases.</P>
      <P>The drug payment scheme is a community drugs scheme for non medical card holders to assist them with the cost of approved prescribed medicines and other items. Under the drug payment scheme, an individual or family unit pays the first £42 per month towards the cost of all their approved prescribed medicines. The scheme is designed to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
      <P>A common list of reimbursable items was introduced for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme to ensure equity in relation to the products reimbursed by the State under both schemes. The list of reimbursable food items to which persons registered under the drug payment scheme are entitled is in line with those items available to medical card holders. It is considered that the range of such items available under State reimbursement schemes provides a reasonable choice and persons requiring items which are not reimbursable would be expected to meet the full cost of such items.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will wish to know that in 1998, the total cost of claims reimbursed in respect of coeliac foods under the drug cost subsidisation scheme was £192,563, of which £102,588 was in respect of foods which are on the common list of reimbursable items. Of the £89,975 reimbursed for coeliac foods which are now no longer reimbursable, over £42,500 was in respect of cakes and biscuits.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware the provision of services for older people in County Mayo is a matter for the Western Health Board. The facility in question is run by a voluntary group and operational costs are met by a combination of voluntary contributions and grant aid from the board. I understand that the board has been in discussion with the voluntary group regarding operational matters and including staffing issues. It will be a matter for the board to decide, following consultation with the voluntary group, what improvements are required and these will be considered in the context of the board's service plan for 2001.</P>
      <P>I should mention that £275,000 was provided this year by the Western Health Board for the purchase of a facility &ndash; it has been rented for some years &ndash; in order to secure its future and to allow for definite forward planning.</P>

Priorities for the allocation of funding available for the development of services in each region are decided by each health board in consultation with <Col N="423" /> its regional co-ordinating committee for physical and sensory disability services. These co-ordinating committees are representative of the health boards, voluntary agencies providing services to people with physical and sensory disabilities and service users.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, the health boards provide subvention to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care. However, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved.</P>
      <P>There are three rates of subvention payable &ndash; £70, £95 and £120 &ndash; in accordance with three levels of dependency, medium, high and maximum. The amount of funding allocated to supporting older people in private nursing homes has been significantly increased by this Government in recent years. For example, over £5 million in additional funding has been allocated in the current year to provide for an increase in the number of people in receipt of subventions, their higher levels of dependency, resulting in more people receiving the higher rates of subventions, and the change in the regulations whereby the ability of adult sons and-or daughters over 21 years of age to contribute, is no longer taken into account. The amount made available for the scheme this year is £38.4 million.</P>
      <P>The Government's priority this year is to ensure that health boards have adequate resources to meet increasing demands on the scheme. I am keeping under review the scope that exists for effecting further improvements in the scheme. The question of increasing rates of subvention will be kept under review in light of the availability of funding and competing priorities.</P>

      <P>The trials referred to were licensed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development under the Animals Remedies Regulations, 1996. All documentation in relation to the conduct of the trials in question was submitted to the animal health and welfare division of that Department.</P>
      <P>My Department administers a licensing scheme in regard to largely medical and scientific research. However, we received no application for a licence for the trials referred to by the Deputy which related to a particular type of animal remedy. Concerns were subsequently raised that perhaps the trials should also have been licensed by my Department. We received information on the purpose and nature of these trials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and, following receipt of expert advice from a veterinarian in that Department, we concluded that the trials would not have required licensing from my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of drug treatment services for young persons under 16 years of age is a matter for health boards in the first instance. Having <Col N="430" /> consulted with the boards I have obtained the following information.</P>
      <P>The incidence of under 16 year olds presenting for treatment as a result of addiction to drugs, as opposed to experimenting or dabbling, is quite rare, but where it occurs the appropriate services are available.</P>
      <P>In areas outside the Eastern Regional Health Authority persons under 16 years of age are referred to the child and adolescent psychiatric services. In general the treatment required can be provided on an out-patient basis with counselling and support services provided through addiction outreach workers and addiction counsellors. Where residential treatment is required the Aislinn Centre in Ballyragget, County Kilkenny, provides this service to young people from at least four of the health boards.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board established a specialised unit within Arbour House to address issues for young people. This is a structured out-patient model and involves the clients each day from 9 am to 5 pm with a planned weekend programme. A plan to support a voluntary group in the establishment of residential facilities for boys under 18 is now at an advanced stage. It is hoped that a service agreement will be in place by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>In the Mid-Western Health Board the health promotion unit has an advice, information and counselling service operating in its Sláinte health advice centre.</P>
      <P>If a person under 16 requires treatment parental consent must be obtained. In the main a family GP will be the primary source of referral to the drug treatment services. When the chief medical officer in my Department wrote to all GPs last year in relation to drug misuse he included a list of the drugs co-ordinators in each health board for their reference. In the case of heroin addiction the young person will be sent for psychiatric assessment. The first line of treatment is counselling and in-patient detoxification, if necessary. Young persons under 16 years of age are given priority in all treatment centres and satellite clinics with immediate referral to a consultant psychiatrist. There are no waiting lists for treatment for people of this age.</P>
      <P>The drug treatment centre in Pearse Street provides specialist assessment and clinical intervention, as agreed by a consultant psychiatrist. In the centre group support and a counselling service are provided to young drug users and their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all area health boards in the Eastern Regional Health Authority young people are initially assessed by an addiction counsellor in their own local area. If psychiatric assessment is required the young person is then seen by a consultant psychiatrist, who in turn refers them for further counselling, detoxification or other treatment as appropriate. Special programmes for under 16 year olds are run at the Crinan project and Domville House. If detoxification is required this is provided at either Cuan Dara in Cherry <Col N="431" /> Orchard hospital or in Beaumont hospital. Following detoxification counselling and outreach services in the local area link with the young person and key family members.</P>
    <P>In all health boards the boards' education offices in association with other community and statutory organisations provide education and prevention programmes in the national and second level schools.</P>

      <P>The regulation of cosmetic surgery is not provided for by law and there is, therefore, no legislative framework within which I, as Minister for Health and Children, could issue guidelines on the matter which would be binding on the parties involved. The Medical Council is the statutory body established to provide for the registration and control of persons engaged in the practice of medicine under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978. Doctors are required to be registered with the council before they can practise medicine in Ireland. However, practitioners are free to provide services to the public as long as they do not represent themselves as being registered medical practitioners.</P>
      <P>Doctors practising in the public health service are registered with the Medical Council. People who avail of health services outside of the public health system should endeavour to seek the services of reputable organisations. In cases where people are dissatisfied with the service provided, redress can be sought through civil law.</P>
      <P>I will continue to keep this area under review.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to a statement (details supplied); and if he will outline his proposals to deal with the problem identified whereby the lack of data in health care systems is a major problem that is impeding the establishment of quality measures.</Quest>

    <Col N="432" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the abstract to a presentation by Professor Miriam Wiley, Health Policy Research Centre, the Economic and Social Research Centre &ndash; ESRI &ndash; at the 17th international conference of the International Society for Quality in Health Care, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland on 13 &ndash; 16 September 2000 in Dublin. The presentation was primarily concerned with data issues and was not specific to the Irish or any other health environment. It explored the factors that need to be addressed to ensure quality standards are achieved in the measurement of quality. The abstract also referred to the development and availability of appropriate databases being a necessary pre-condition if quality measures are to be successfully advanced from the theoretical to the applied.</P>
      <P>In a modern health service, information systems are recognised as being essential to underpin all aspects of data management and effective service delivery. Over the past five years my Department has invested approximately £55 million across the health services to enable agencies to install a wide range of modern information systems to enhance the delivery of health services.</P>
      <P>The national development plan clearly identifies the increasingly important role which information support systems will have in providing an efficient and effective health service. The plan has earmarked approximately £145 million for capital investments on information and communications technology, ICT, developments in the health services over the period 2000-06. The increasing role of ICT in health care will contribute significantly to maintaining high standards of data quality and to providing a comprehensive range of data to help in planning better delivery of services.</P>
      <P>The availability of accurate, relevant and timely data is, of course, an essential prerequisite for the development of quality measures in health care. Successive strategy statements have emphasised the development of quality initiatives in health care. Initiatives such as HIPE, casemix classification are invaluable sources of data and I understand that Professor Wiley's presentation dealt extensively in this area.</P>
      <P>Another very important development has been the implementation of a major database on disability. The national intellectual disability database was established in 1995 and provides a comprehensive information database for decision making in relation to the planning, funding and management of services for people with intellectual disabilities. The availability of such detailed national data was a key factor in the Government's decision to allocate additional funding of £35 million in the 1999 budget for the development of intellectual disability services. The database will also be used to monitor service developments arising from this substantial investment. In addition, development of a similar database for physical and sensory disability services is currently being co-ordinated by the Health Research Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="433" /> In a broader context, I would refer to the public health information system, PHIS, which has been developed by my Department in collaboration with the director of public health in each health board. The PHIS takes data from many sources including HIPE, vital statistics, and national cancer registry and makes this information available as a common public health data sets. The PHIS now provides the baseline data for monitoring trends in health by region and over time.</P>
    <P>In its review of An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government announced its intention to retain consultants to carry out a comprehensive value for money audit of the health services. As part of their remit the consultants have also been requested to make recommendations on the development of a management information system for the health service which will allow monitoring of the above matters on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>In addition, a project team has been established in my Department's child care area to undertake a major review of child care information systems and to define the management information requirements for this area.</P>
    <P>Recognising the need to co-ordinate and integrate health information systems to facilitate both health service management and public health assessment, my Department has recently established a national health information strategy committee. The report of the committee will be produced during the course of next year and will recommend the necessary steps towards the aim of achieving well-integrated, comprehensive and accessible health information to serve the many needs for planning and evaluation.</P>

    <P>Terms of Reference:</P>
    <P>To identify and advise the Minister of Health and Children on measures to improve the integration of hospital services in Cork, in particular: a new model for the funding, planning and management of hospital services in Cork City, involving the transfer of responsibility for funding of voluntary hospitals to <Col N="439" /> the Southern Health Board; the process to be followed in transferring responsibility for funding with effect from the beginning of 2002; the implications of these changes for the Mercy Hospital, the South Infirmary &ndash; Victoria Hospital and the Southern Health Board.</P>
    <P>Taking into account the circumstances of the acute hospital sector, this model should be based on the approach set out in the report Enhancing the Partnership, 1997 and have particular regard to the following principles: respect for the operational autonomy and ethos of voluntary agencies; recognition of the statutory role of the health board; a standing regional planning structure representative of all agencies concerned; a requirement to operate within the constraints of the accountability legislation with regard to conformity with service plans and determinations of expenditure; agreement on the terms under which service agreements might be reviewed and revised; and arrangements for monitoring, review and resolution of difficulties, with third party involvement where necessary.</P>

      <P>Details of legislation being prepared where heads have not been approved are as follows:</P>
      <P>Ratification of the Hague Convention on Inter-Country Adoption.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this legislation is to provide for the ratification of the Hague Convention which was signed in 1993. Draft heads of a Bill are being prepared at present and are expected to be brought to Government during 2000.</P>
      <P>Legislation is being prepared in the area of adoption information, post-adoption contact and associated issues. An increasing number of adult adopted persons are seeking information about their birth parents in order to complete that aspect of their identity. Equally, many birth parents are seeking information on children whom they gave up for adoption or placement in the past because keeping them was not a realistic option given the social and economic circumstances at the time. Draft heads of the Bill are being prepared and a memorandum for Government is expected shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Talks are taking place with the professional bodies representing 13 professions with a view to agreeing a system of statutory registration by the end of 2000. The professions included in the current talks are physiotherapists, social workers, radiographers, psychologists, chiropodists, care workers, speech therapists, occupational therapists, dieticians, environmental health officers, biochemists, orthopists and medical laboratory technicians. The aim is to conclude the detailed discussions with the professions this year and to <Col N="442" /> bring forward legislation in the early part of next year on this issue.</P>
    <P>Currently there are draft legislative proposals for amending the Nurses Act, 1985, in order to give effect to the relevant recommendations of the Commission on Nursing. The target date is early next year.</P>
    <P>The Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, is currently being examined with a view to updating and amending. It is hoped to have heads of Bill ready by end of 2000.</P>
    <P>Consideration is being given to updating and rationalising the Pharmacy Acts, 1875 &ndash; 1977.</P>
    <P>The Government has agreed to amend the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act, 1997, to allow the tribunal compensate haemophiliacs in respect of their HIV condition. I am committed to introducing the amendments in the autumn.</P>
    <P>A draft memorandum for Government will shortly issue for comments from other Department prior to its submission to Government, in relation to the transfer of certain functions including licensing of controlled drugs and regulation of medical devices to the Irish Medicines Board.</P>
    <P>Legislation to give effect to the policies in relation to tobacco control contained in the policy document Towards a Tobacco Free Society.</P>
    <P>Details of legislation being prepared where heads have been approved are as follows:</P>

      <P>Statutory instruments are being prepared as follows: To establish a health service accreditation agency. The purpose is to maintain and develop the accreditation scheme for hospitals which is currently in the final stages of preparation.</P>
      <P>To allow for the application of a superannuation scheme to the staff of the National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery.</P>
      <P>Order under section 32(1)(b)(ii) of the Animal Remedies Act, 1993 (No. 23 of 1993). The proposed effect of this order is to effect the repeal of the Therapeutic Substances Act, 1932 (No. 25 of 1932).</P>
      <P>The Medicinal Products (Control of Paracetamol) Regulations, 2000. The proposed effect of these regulations is to further regulate the sale and supply of medicinal products containing paracetamol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="443" /> The Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) (Amendment No. 2) Regulations, 2000. These regulations amend the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations, 1996 to 2000, concerning the application of the prescription and supply controls to certain medicinal products.</P>
    <P>Revised Food Hygiene Regulations, 2000, are currently at an advanced stage of completion. The current Food Hygiene Regulations, 1950-1989, provide the framework for enforcing national food safety standards. Having considered developments at EU and national level, overlaps between the food hygiene regulations and other food safety legislation have been identified. Consequently, it is proposed to revoke the existing regulations and draft new Food Hygiene Regulations, 2000.</P>
    <P>Two statutory instruments in relation to the infectious diseases maintenance allowance IDMA:</P>
    <P>(1) To give effect to the IDMA annual budgetary increase.</P>
    <P>(2) To give effect to the IDMA Christmas bonus payment.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to make an order establishing the health insurance authority, pursuant to the Health Insurance Act, 1994. It is also proposed that, following establishment, functions, additional to those specified under the Act, will be conferred on the authority by further order.</P>
    <P>The Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations, 2000, are being prepared to amend the Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations, 1996, which set out the criteria under which the chief executive officer of a health board determines applications for community pharmacy contractor agreements.</P>
    <P>Three statutory instruments to provide a statutory basis for the role of the Eastern Regional Health Authority in relation to St. James's, St. Luke's and Beaumont hospitals.</P>
    <P>In accordance with Government Decision S197 60B of 19 July 2000 approving a draft order entitled Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977 (Controlled Drugs) (Declaration) Order, 2000, legislation is being prepared to add a number of substances to the control schedules under the misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984. These substance include substances with a potential for misuse in sports and 4MTA, a synthetic drug with similar effects to ecstasy.</P>
    <P>Statutory instruments will also be employed to transpose into national law or give effect to EU directives and regulations harmonising the laws of member states as follows:</P>
    <P>Directive 96/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 December 1999 amending Directive 94/35/EC on sweeteners for use in foodstuffs.</P>

    <P>Commission Directive 98/53/EC of 16 July 1998 laying down the sampling methods and the methods of analysis for the official control of the levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>Commission Directive 2000/51/EC of 26 July 2000 amending Directive 95/31/EC laying down specific criteria of purity concerning sweeteners for use in foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>Regulation (EC) No 258/97 concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients.</P>

    <P>The Medicinal Products (Licensing of Manufacture) Regulations, 2000. These draft regulations propose to consolidate the statutory controls in relation to the manufacture of medicinal products for human use and to take into consideration the manufacturing requirements set out in EEC Council Directive 75/319/EEC, as amended, and including the principles and guidelines of good manufacturing practice for medicinal products for human use laid down in Commission Directive 91/356/EEC of 13 June 1991. The regulations also propose to establish controls over the manufacture and release of those medicinal products to be used in the conduct of clinical trials.

The Mental Health Bill, 1999, currently before the Oireachtas will provide for such safeguards and will repeal the Health (Mental Services) Act, 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="446" /> The provisions of section 47(1) of the Health Act, 1970 regarding appeals were not brought formally into effect but procedures have been operating informally in all health boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Asylum seekers are generally eligible for medical cards under the GMS scheme on the same basis as other persons and throughout the country the individual health boards have assisted them in different ways to avail of the scheme. In doing so, the boards have had regard to all factors relevant to ensuring a proper service, including numbers of asylum seekers in any particular location and the situation in relation to local general practitioners.</P>
      <P>In some boards, particularly where the number of asylum seekers may be small, such persons when issued with medical cards make their own arrangements with a contracted GMS scheme doctor. However, the general approach is that boards contact local contracted doctors to establish whether they are interested in accepting asylum seekers unto their panel. This has proved a successful method of ensuring general acceptance of asylum seekers onto GMS scheme panels although we are aware of a difficulty in part of the Southern Health Board area which is currently receiving active attention both in the board and the Department. Further, there are provisions for interpretative and translation services, where necessary.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the matter of asylum seekers has not given rise to any serious issue in terms of them availing of general practitioner services under the GMS scheme nor is there any reason to believe that there are specific medico-legal issues involved but the entire situation is kept under ongoing review both in the boards and the Department.</P>

      <P>The provision of health related support services to school going children with special needs in the Cork region is the responsibility of the Southern Health Board in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the established policy of the Southern Health Board that those attending schools under the remit of the COPE foundation would have <Col N="455" /> access to speech and language therapy services through its service. The Deputy will be aware of the difficulties faced by all agencies providing services to persons with an intellectual disability in recruiting and retaining staff, including speech and language therapists. My Department is working closely with the Health Services Employers Agency, the health boards, voluntary services providers and other relevant statutory and professional bodies with a view to easing, where possible, some of the difficulties faced by service providers in this area.</P>
    <P>One of the initiatives developed in this respect has been the development of joint posts between health boards and voluntary service providers such as the COPE Foundation. At present the foundation has two full time posts of speech and language therapists vacant. There are four shared posts between the Southern Health Board and the foundation and two of these posts are also vacant. The two shared posts are providing services to pupils attending Scoil Eanna and the Rainbow Lodge pre-school.</P>
    <P>Two joint posts between the board and the COPE Foundation will be advertised shortly and it is hoped that following the recruitment of successful applicants additional services can be provided to schools under the auspices of the COPE Foundation.</P>
    <P>Health related support services for children with special needs have been greatly enhanced and expanded since 1998. A figure of £4.6 million has been provided for the development and enhancement of these services since 1998, rising to a full year cost of £5.1 million in 2001. A figure of £250,000 has been allocated to the board in 2000 for the development of these services, rising to £300,000 in 2001.</P>

I have considered this report, and while having taken no final decisions on its implementation, I accept the broad trust of its recommendations. However, I feel that some further refinements are needed in relation to implementation arrangements at local level. In this regard, I have recently announced the establishment of an advisory group, to be chaired by Prof. Niall O'Higgins, St. Vincent's Hospital, to assist and liaise with health boards in formulating their plans for the development of specialist breast cancer services. I am confident that the development of symptomatic breast disease services which will result will greatly <Col N="456" /> enhance the quality of the services currently available to the women of the north-west.</P>

      <P>Considerable progress has been made to date in the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the task force on suicide. Central to the report was the provision of a national suicide prevention strategy which is now in place. The key components of the strategy are the implementation of measures aimed at high risk groups; provision of information and training on suicide prevention to relevant professionals and organisations; and research into suicide prevention.</P>
      <P>All health boards have appointed resource officers to further the implementation of the strategy within their own areas. Many of the task force's recommendations require continuous development, particularly in the area of training and in the development of services relating to suicide and suicide prevention.</P>
      <P>The National Suicide Review Group, established under the auspices of the health board chief executive officers, has recently published its annual report for 1999 which provides a comprehensive overview of activities in suicide prevention. Statistics for 1999 show a decline in the total number of suicides for the first time in five years, down from 504 in 1998 to 439 in 1999.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 568, 576, 577, 580, 616, 617, 622 and 657 together.</P>
      <P>The establishment of an independent living fund has been proposed by the Centre for Independent Living as a means of funding a personal assistance service.</P>
      <P>The personal assistance service is part of a range of support services for people with physical and sensory disabilities designed to enable them to live in the community with the maximum possible degree of independence. My policy is to develop the range of services as a whole in accordance with the recommendations of the report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future.</P>
      <P>To date this Government has provided a total of £72.560 million additional funding for the maintenance and development of services in the sector, including capital developments. This year £7 million development funding has been allocated for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, rising to £14 million in 2001. This funding will be primarily targeted at the provision of additional day care places and home support services. To this end, I have targeted £3 million, rising to £6 million in the year 2001, for home support services, which include personal assistance services.</P>
      <P>I have no plans at present to introduce an independent living fund, as proposed by the Centre for Independent Living, as a means of funding the personal assistance service. Priorities for the allocation of development funding are decided by the health boards in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services. Voluntary sector service agencies, including Centres for Independent Living and service users, are represented on these committees.</P>
      <P>I am also aware that problems in recruiting and retaining personal assistants to maintain the current level of service provision had arisen in the personal assistance service provided by the Irish Wheelchair Association (IWA) on behalf of the Eastern Regional Health Authority. These problems were due in large measure to the perceived inadequacy of the rate of pay being offered. In order to help resolve these problems I approved the provision of additional funding to enable the rate of pay to be increased.</P>

      <P>I have contacted the South Eastern Health Board in relation to this application for an assessment for inter-country adoption. I understand the couple have been on the waiting list since January 2000 and that the assessment is due to commence around March/April 2001, subject to the assessments immediately before this couple's assessment being completed within the expected timescale and the staffing complement remaining as is. I understand the couple have been in touch with the regional adoption service in the South Eastern Health Board in the last two weeks and that they have been advised of the expected date for commencement of assessment.</P>
      <P>In recent years there has been a large increase in the number of applications for assessment received by the South Eastern Health Board. As the Deputy will see from the following table the number of applications more than doubled between 1998 and 1999 and for the first half of this year the number of applications received is greater than the number received in the whole of 1999.</P>

    <P>Following the publication of the report, Towards a Standardised Framework for Intercountry Adoption Assessment Procedures, in June 1999 an implementation group was established to implement its recommendations. In July 2000 the group presented me with a report on progress in each of the health boards, including statistics regarding waiting lists and staffing at the end of June 2000. I am making a copy of this report available to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the above report in June 1999 the board received additional funding of £26,000 and £48,000 in 1999 and 2000, respect<Col N="462" /> ively. An additional social worker was recruited earlier this year and an additional 1.5 posts will be filled in the near future. In recent weeks the board has received further funding for a social work post and a team leader post. I am satisfied that the additional staffing together with the implementation of the standardised framework will impact on the waiting lists for inter-country adoption in the region.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="463" /> Health board orthodontic services continue to be developed in accordance with the dental health action plan. This year I have provided an additional £1.45 million to health boards on an ongoing basis to further the development of their orthodontic services. At my request, the health boards have submitted proposals to me on how waiting lists and times for orthodontic treatment could be reduced in their areas. In response I have recently approved a number of measures for the Eastern Regional Health Authority to improve their service and I hope to clarify the matter with the remaining health boards in the near future.</P>

      <P>The responsibility for the provision of services for the hospitals in the Dublin region is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to inform the Deputy that the overall hospital in-patient waiting list figure at 30 June 2000 was 31,851, compared to 36,855 at 31 December 1999, which represents a decrease of 13.58% since the beginning of the year. The figure represents a decrease of 2,485 from January to March this year and a further 2,519 from March to June. I welcome this continued reduction which reflects the additional resources <Col N="464" /> and priority that I have given to tackling waiting lists. However, it must be acknowledged that waiting lists in some of the major Dublin hospitals have not shown reductions in this period. Increases have taken place in Beaumont, James Connolly Memorial and Tallaght Hospitals. I would like to point out to the Deputy that in the December 1999 to June 2000 period St. James's Hospital has shown a significant decrease of 16% and the Mater has reduced its waiting list by 4%. The Eastern Regional Health Authority has informed me that a number of factors are affecting their ability to get additional elective work done in the current year. Among the main areas of constraint are the current bed capacity, staff shortages and increased emergency admissions.</P>
    <P>Against this background every effort is being made to find areas of activity where additional waiting list work can be done. My Department is having ongoing discussions with the Eastern Regional Health Authority in this regard.</P>

      <P>On 2 May last, Deputy Molloy, Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, with special responsibility for housing, launched a Government strategy for the adult homeless, Homelessness &ndash; An Integrated Strategy. The strategy requires each health board to carry out an assessment of the needs of the homeless in its functional area.</P>
      <P>Each health board will examine its range of responses to the health and personal social service needs of homeless persons, including those suffering from mental illness, in consultation with the homeless forum in the area and draw up an action plan for meeting such needs. Officials in my Department are currently preparing comprehensive guidelines to assist the health boards in drawing up these action plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="465" /> It is also recognised in Homelessness &ndash; An Integrated Strategy, that those leaving institutional care, be it custodial or health related, are one of the principal groups at risk of becoming homeless. Officials in my Department are also developing a preventative strategy aimed at preventing homelessness among those at risk which will be published as soon as possible.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>when any illness was last added to the long-term illness card; the year each category was included; the reason he has refused to date to include asthma; if he will now do so; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to 1971 there were inadequate provisions to provide for persons who had large medical expenses. In 1971 the long-term illness scheme was introduced, whereby patients received free drugs and medicines in respect of prescribed diseases and disabilities, regardless of income. The following conditions were prescribed in 1971: mental handicap, mental illness (for persons under 16 years only) phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy and epilepsy. In 1975 the following were included: multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukaemia.</P>
      <P>From 1971 onwards the general medical services &ndash; medical card &ndash; scheme came into effect. People who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the chief executive officer has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time a scheme to provide for the refund of the costs of drugs above a certain threshold was introduced. Currently, non medical card holders can avail of the drug payment scheme, which was introduced on 1 July 1999 with a threshold of £42 per individual or family unit. Under the drug payment scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than £42 per calendar month towards the costs of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme is designed to be user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow for <Col N="466" /> families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines, such as people with asthma.</P>
    <P>The introduction of these schemes ensured that no individual or family would be faced with undue financial hardship as a result of expenses on drugs and medicines. Consequently, the long-term illness scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to include asthma in view of the other schemes available.</P>

      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, requires nursing homes to be registered with their local health board. Regulations made under the Act require that there must be proper standards in nursing homes, including adequate and suitable accommodation, staffing, kitchen and sanitary facilities, access to medical care, facilities for recreation and other arrangements to ensure the health and well-being of residents. Nursing homes are required to renew their registration every three years. A health board may impose conditions in relation to registration, including a ceiling on the number of persons who may be accommodated in a home. The regulations provide for periodic inspections by the health boards, which are empowered to prosecute registered proprietors and persons in charge in the event of breaches of the regulations. Neither the Act nor the regulations impose any restrictions on private nursing home charges, as this is a matter for determination by the proprietors of individual homes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to advise Deputy Ahern that the standard practice in my Department for dealing with correspondence received from Members of the Oireachtas is as follows.  All correspondence is acknowledged in writing by the staff in my office in the first instance. The correspondence is then issued to the relevant section of the Department for investigation and preparation of reply. It is not possible to quantify the exact number of staff dealing with Oireachtas correspondence at any given time in my Department but I can assure Deputy Ahern that my entire Department is involved at some level in the daily processing of large volumes of Oireachtas correspondence. The replies once drafted are signed off by a senior member of staff in each section before being returned to my office for clearance and issue.</P>
      <P>The staff in my office keep a tracking record of when each item of correspondence was received and where each piece of correspondence has issued for follow-up throughout the Department. When the draft reply is returned, it is seen and cleared for issue by the private secretary before being presented to me for signature. I can confirm that no staff have been diverted from dealing with correspondence from Members of the Oireachtas to work on freedom of information cases.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure Deputy Ahern that I am firmly of the view that responding to requests from Oireachtas Members is an integral part of the democratic system and that my Department officials and I are constantly striving to bring about an improvement in the processing of and the response time to Oireachtas correspondence. However, I am quite sure that Deputy Ahern will also appreciate the staffing shortages currently being experienced throughout most Government Departments and the regrettable impact which this is having on dealing with correspondence in general, including correspondence from Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The procedures outlined above apply throughout the entire Department and also encompass all Oireachtas correspondence received in the offices of my ministerial colleagues, Deputies Hanafin and Moffatt, Ministers of State at my Department.</P>

      <P>The assessment of entitlement to a domiciliary care allowance &ndash; DCA &ndash; in any individual case is a matter for the relevant health board. The respite care grant is an annual grant of £300 which is intended as a contribution towards respite care. It is paid to those in receipt of DCA or carer's allowance on the first Thursday of June. I presume that the Deputy's question refers to the respite care grant and not DCA.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is responsible for the payment of the respite care grant in cases where the DCA recipient also receives carer's allowance.

    <P>An initial assessment commences as soon as possible on receipt of the report. The average length of time of a full assessment varies from case to case and cases are prioritised on intake. Factors influencing the length of time of a full assessment are as follows: the varying levels of complexity and different methods used to assess different forms of abuse, whether or not a case is subject to court proceedings, if more than one type of abuse is alleged, the nature and extent of the <Col N="472" /> alleged abuse, and the facts and evidence available.</P>
    <P>The following is the position in respect of each board regarding the number of children who are alleged to be victims of abuse and who are presently awaiting full assessment. The health boards have informed me that all children awaiting assessment have undergone an initial assessment and have been found not to be at risk.</P>

      <Quest>the action he is taking to ensure that young adults suffering from autism and other disabilities have adequate services available to them when they reach the age of 18 in view of the fact that such young adults are often placed in residential places that are not suitable to their needs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. While new additional services specifically for persons with autism have been and will continue to be developed, many persons with autism are in receipt of services within the intellectual disability services and have benefited generally from the development of new residential, respite and day services which have been substantially enhanced in recent years. However, the Government recognised that there was a need to accelerate the pace at which the identified needs of persons with autism and those with an intellectual disability were being met and is committed to meeting those needs within a defined timeframe of three years, starting with a major acceleration of investment, both capital and revenue, this year.</P>
      <P>The additional revenue funding being allocated in 2000 is designed to support the opening of additional services with an annual cost of £35 million. The services being provided with this funding include the development and enhancement of health related support services for persons with autism.</P>
      <P>The additional revenue funding will provide: 555 new residential places; 185 new respite places; 700 new day places; health related support services for persons with autism; the continuation of the programme to transfer persons with an intellectual disability from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements and additional specialist and other support services.</P>
      <P> There is also a need for capital investment in the infrastructure required to support these services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national development plan now provides a <Col N="474" /> new framework within which unprecedented capital investment will be made in the health services in the period from 2000 to 2006. In the area of intellectual disability services, this investment will focus on three main areas: the provision of new facilities from which a broad range of support services, including residential, respite and day services, can be delivered; the renovation of existing facilities; and the continuation of the programme to transfer persons with an intellectual disability from inappropriate placements.</P>
    <P>Additional capital funding of £30 million will be made available in 2000, £40 million in 2001 and £10 million in 2002. This is a total of £80 million over the next three years, to support these developments.</P>
    <P>This additional funding brings the total revenue and capital funding provided by this Government to date for these services to £121.7 million in 2000, with a full year cost of £128.7 million in 2001. This underlines the Government's commitment to meeting the needs of persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism and I wish to assure you that this will remain one of my top priorities.</P>

      <P>Health services, which includes public hospitals, are exempt bodies for the purpose of EU and national VAT law. This means that while such hospitals are required to pay VAT on their purchases, including construction, no VAT is payable on the services which they provide, even where such services would otherwise be the subject of a charge.</P>
      <P>It would not be possible under EU VAT law to remove the requirement for hospitals to pay VAT as suggested by the Deputy as it would in effect be zero rating. While we can retain existing zero rating provisions, we cannot, since 1 January 1991 introduce any new ones.</P>
      <P>In addition, I should explain that budgeting for expenditure on the development and operation of public health services is done in the knowledge that VAT will apply. VAT does not therefore represent a financial burden for the health services.</P>
      <P>Finally, the Deputy will be aware that the great majority of the costs of the health services relate to the employment of staff, to which VAT does not apply.</P>

    <P>While there continues to be much research in relation to meningitis, it is not fully understood why Ireland experiences such a different pattern of disease to other countries in Europe and elsewhere. Despite the significant increase in the number of cases of bacterial meningitis notified, there has not been a commensurate increase in mortality, reflecting the improved surveillance, preventive and treatment strategies in recent years.</P>
    <P>The working group on bacterial meningitis, which was established in 1996 under the chairmanship of my Department's deputy chief medical officer and which published reports in 1997 and 1999, includes among its members a range of medical experts who are closely involved in dealing with meningococcal disease in Ireland. The group has prepared and issued detailed advice on the surveillance, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of meningitis and it continues to monitor developments, including the outcome of research, at national and international level, so as to ensure that its advice is in line with best practice.</P>
    <P>The development of the National Disease Surveillance Centre, which was established in 1998, will enable a much improved level of surveillance of infectious disease in Ireland and the centre will assist in the continued development of strategies to control communicable diseases, including meningitis. The centre has already developed a meningococcal disease database, which will enable the pattern of this disease to be analysed in detail.</P>
    <P>I am today launching the campaign to immunise children and young persons up to 22 years of age against group C meningococcal disease, which accounts for approximately one-third of meningitis cases in Ireland. The vaccine will be introduced in two phases. Phase I will begin immediately and will run until spring 2001. The target groups for this phase are children under five and persons aged 15-18. The vaccine is also being incorporated into the primary childhood immunisation programme for children up to two years of age. Phase II of programme will commence once the first phase has been completed and will consist of a continuing catch-up programme to cover five to 14 year olds and 19 to 22 <Col N="477" /> year olds. Immunisation will be offered free of charge to everyone in the target groups.</P>

      <P>It is hoped that in the coming years consensus will emerge internationally on this issue. When such a definition is accepted internationally, standardising an audit of severe maternal morbidity is a practise that should be encouraged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I, as Minister for Health and Children, have proposed that a joint consultative forum be held by my Department with as many of the representative bodies of the various therapeutic providers of non-conventional medicine to discuss the issue of statutory registration. A date for this forum <Col N="478" /> has yet to be decided, but is likely to occur before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The Department is currently working with professional bodies on a system of statutory registration for allied health professionals, recognised paramedical grades who hold formal third level qualifications, ministerially prescribed under law and required for appointment in the public health service. This scheme may provide a model of registration for non-conventional medicine, addressing complex areas of concern, finance, protection of title, professional representation, fitness to practice, and the legal implications of establishing registration boards for each member profession to enforce these functions. However, any system of regulation must await the introduction of statutory registration for the health professionals.</P>
      <P>In the interim, the Department encourages the various therapeutic groups to develop mechanisms for informing the general public of the availability of services from reputable therapists and to establish their own voluntary regulatory structures in preparation for a scheme of statutory registration. Many have embraced this form of self-regulation and adopted codes of practice/ ethics, professional profile portfolio based registers, complaints procedures and insurance schemes within their own membership facility.</P>
      <P>There has been no change in the regulatory status of medicinal products containing St. John's Wort since 1 January 2000.</P>
      <P>With a view to establishing a regulatory framework for traditional and alternative medicinal products, the Irish Medicines Board has appointed a project manager for herbal medicines and has sought submissions on the regulation of such products by 30 October 2000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 608 and 609 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness refers to the fact that health board chief executive officers are examining the operation of the medical card scheme and will consult with the social partners by the end of 2000. Particular emphasis will be placed on the needs of families with children, and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the provision of palliative care services in Waterford is a matter for the South Eastern Health Board. I have had inquires made of the board and have been advised that for many years, palliative care services in the region have been provided by four hospice home care teams.</P>
      <P>Since 1998, a regional consultant oncologist has been based at Waterford Regional Hospital and a palliative care consultant has recently been appointed to St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny. I understand that there are strong links between the four hospice home care teams and the consultant staff. The board intends to develop palliative care beds in acute and district hospitals as well as palliative day care centres. Beds in district hospitals will be available also although not exclusively assigned for palliative care purposes.</P>
      <P>There is a commitment in the programme for Government to develop a national hospice plan and my predecessor, Deputy Cowen, established the national advisory committee on palliative care services in September 1999. The committee is currently preparing a comprehensive national policy for the strategic planning and development of palliative care services. I expect to be presented with the report at the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of health related support services, including speech and language therapy, to persons with physical and sensory disabilities is the responsibility of the relevant health board. The development of such services is a matter for the health board in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committee for physical and sensory disability services. Accordingly, the Deputy's question has been forwarded to the chief execu<Col N="481" /> tive officer of the South Eastern Health Board with a request that he examine the matter and respond directly to the Deputy, as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the recruitment of allied health professional staff generally is presenting problems throughout the health board regions and it is clear that the demand for the three therapy grades, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy needs to be reviewed. Following a Labour Court recommendation in 1997, an expert group was established to examine and report on various issues relating to the allied health professional grades, including speech and language therapists. One of the issues examined by this group is the problems which arise in relation to the recruitment and the retention of various grades. The expert group submitted its final report in April 2000 and I am implementing in full the recommendations of this report at a cost of £10 million. Among its recommendations was the urgent commissioning of a workforce planning study for the three therapy grades, that is, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy. The terms of reference for the workforce planning study for the three therapy professions have been agreed and the study commissioned. This study will report by the end of this year. In the context of this report, a large expansion in the area of training for these therapists, in both the numbers of graduates produced and the number of training colleges established will be examined in partnership with the education authorities.</P>
      <P>I am also very pleased to announce that, in co-operation with my colleague the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Michael Woods, I have secured a total of 52 extra places for the training of physiotherapists, five additional places for the training of occupational therapists and three in the area of speech and language therapy, all available from October 2000.</P>
      <P>The Higher Education Authority is also establishing a group comprised of representatives from each of the three physiotherapy schools to investigate the establishment of a fast-track physiotherapy programme to begin in each school from October 2001. The first graduates from these programmes should be available in 2003.</P>
      <P>The possibility of establishing a similar course for occupational therapy and speech and language therapy will also be investigated.</P>

      <P>The administration of the registration system is a matter for An tArd Chláraitheoir, the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages, and for <Col N="482" /> local registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
      <P>The Family Law Act, 1995, came into operation on 1 August 1996. Section 32(1)(a) of that Act provides that any marriage solemnised in the State shall not be valid in law unless the persons concerned notify the registrar in writing of their intention to so marry at least three months prior to the date on which the marriage is to be solemnised or have obtained an exemption from the notification requirement before the marriage. Section 32(1)(b) provides that the notification requirement is a substantive requirement.</P>
      <P>The Family Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997, was enacted to provide for the registration of certain marriages which until its enactment could not be registered due to the non-fulfillment of the section 32 requirement. However, this applies only in circumstances where the three months notification had in fact been given to a registrar other than the registrar for the district in which the marriage was solemnised.</P>
      <P>The marriage to which the Deputy refers took place in April 1999 according to the rites and ceremonies of the Catholic Church. Notification was not received by the registrar for the district in which the marriage took place, nor by any other registrar, and a court exemption was not obtained prior to the solemnisation of the marriage. As the requirements of a valid marriage as set out in section 32 of the Family Law Act, 1995, have not been fulfilled the marriage cannot be registered.</P>
      <P>While sympathetic to the plight of the surviving partner in this case, I regret that within the current legal framework for recognition and registration of a marriage, I am not in a position to accede to the request being made.</P>

    <P>I have no plans at present to introduce a grant aid scheme to parents whose children are awaiting orthodontic treatment. Health board orthodontic services continue to be developed in accordance with the dental health action plan. This year I have provided an additional £1.45 million to health boards on an ongoing basis to further the development of their orthodontic services.</P>
    <P>At my request, the health boards have submitted proposals to me on how waiting lists and times for orthodontic treatment could be reduced in their areas. In response I have recently approved a number of measures for the Eastern Regional Health Authority to improve their service and I hope to clarify the matter with the remaining health boards in the near future.</P>

      <P>The numbers of cases of measles notified to my Department in respect of the Dublin area are as follows: 1999, 99; 2000, to 30 June, 921. While a breakdown of these figures by age is not available, the great majority of cases are understood to have been in children.</P>
      <P>With effect from 1 July 2000, health boards furnish weekly notifications of infectious diseases to the director of the National Disease Surveillance Centre, NDSC, and this includes the collection of age data. The NDSC has indicated that 150 measles cases in children in the Dublin area have been notified in the period 1 July to 23 September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the current primary immunisation uptake levels generally, I have asked the health boards to make every effort to achieve the national target of 95% in the primary childhood immunisation programme this year, and to make particular efforts in relation to MMR. The health boards indicate that a range of measures are being adopted to improve the uptake of MMR and the other primary vaccinations. These <Col N="488" /> include: accelerated MMR boosters campaigns at school level; the identification and follow-up of unimmunised children in the community; targeting of groups or geographic areas where there are particular problems with uptake; general practitioners being asked to make special efforts to promote immunisation to parents; awareness campaigns to inform the public about the importance of MMR immunisation at national and regional level.</P>
    <P>While there are indications that the present measles epidemic is being brought under control, it remains very important that the maximum number of children are immunised against the disease. I, therefore, take this opportunity strongly to urge parents in all areas of the country to ensure their children receive the MMR vaccine, which is available free of charge from their family doctor. This will ensure maximum protection against measles, mumps and rubella for individual children and the population generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Various estimates have been made of the number of opiate misusers in the country. Due to the illicit nature of drug misuse it is difficult to get a clear estimate of the extent of the problem. Estimates range from around 8,500 to 13,500. The ministerial task force suggested a figure of 8,000, confined mainly to Dublin city. The Health Research Board report on treated drug misuse in Ireland in 1998 gave a total of 5,076 treated cases in 1998 in the greater Dublin area. It must be emphasised, however, that this is the number of people receiving treatment and the number of people misusing drugs would be greatly in excess of this figure.</P>
      <P>The number of people registered on the central methadone treatment list at the end of August 2000, who are receiving treatment for heroin addiction in the Eastern Regional Health Authority, was 4,725.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of drug treatment services in the Dublin area is the statutory responsibility of the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA. However, there has been extensive development of treatment facilities in the greater Dublin area in recent years. Services are provided at 53 treatment locations in the ERHA area with plans to establish others where the need for such services has been identified. The ERHA boards will continue to expand services with the objective of providing prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and aftercare services for everyone who needs such services. The Eastern Regional Health Authority's total budget for drugs and AIDS services in 2000 is over £22 million. Services being <Col N="489" /> expanded include information, education and prevention services, increased detoxification, an in-patient stabilisation unit, expansion of the young person's programme, additional addiction centres, additional treatment places through general practitioners, satellite and mobile clinics, training and development, aftercare/rehabilitation, more key workers in the community, improved management of services and development of an information system.</P>
    <P>The ERHA is aware of the need for rehabilitation and aftercare as part of an integrated programme of care for drug misusers. For this reason rehabilitation is given high priority and the expansion of rehabilitation services is taking place. I fully support these important developments as rehabilitation and aftercare are seen as a vital part of a continuum of services in the overall treatment of drug misusers to achieve the ultimate goal of a drug free lifestyle and to play a full role in society.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware of the valuable contribution being made by local drugs task forces in providing a co-ordinated and integrated response in areas worst affected by the drugs problem.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to support health boards in expanding their range of services with the aim of having in place a continuum of care to which people using heroin will have immediate access whatever their place in the cycle of addiction. Thus, chaotic users should be able to avail of needle exchange and low threshold services while those who are highly motivated to give up their drug habit should have access to detoxification and support services such as counselling.</P>
    <P>Health boards are committed to consultation with local groups regarding the establishment of drug treatment clinics, but more often than not they face huge local opposition. The protracted nature of local consultation and subsequent local opposition has slowed the development of new facilities, by years in some cases. Political and community support are required for the ERHA in its efforts to win the support of local groups and residents for the provision of appropriate drug treatment services where the need for such services has been identified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>In July last year, the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, launched the cardiovascular health strategy group report, Building Healthier Hearts. This report showed that the premature death rate from coronary heart disease in Ireland is twice the EU average. The report is very comprehen<Col N="490" /> sive and its recommendations are far reaching. In the implementation of these recommendations my Department has set a medium-term objective to bring our levels of premature deaths from cardiovascular disease into line with the EU average at a minimum and a long-term objective of reducing our rates to those of the best performers in the European Union. This strategy document, which contains 211 recommendations, is designed to achieve these goals in a systematic and sustained manner.</P>
      <P>Additional funding of £12 million has been made available in 2000 to commence the implementation process, and this funding will be the foundation for the implementation of some of the more immediate recommendations across the health services. It is expected that progress will be achieved this year in health promotion, primary care, pre-hospital care, hospital care, and in the area of audit and evaluation.</P>
      <P>With regard to the implementation of the HOPE &ndash; heart outcomes prevention evaluation &ndash; study, it has received mention in the strategy report. The research began in 1993 and it is a multicentre, 200 site, international trial to which Ireland contributed. It explored whether angiotensin converting enzyme, ACE, inhibition with ramipril at 10 mg/day or antioxidation therapy with vitamin E could prevent cardiovascular event or stroke in at-risk patients without known left ventricular dysfunction. Vitamin E therapy was studied because it has been associated with a reduced risk for cardiovascular events and stroke in preliminary clinical studies, and oxidation of lipids has been experimentally found to contribute to atherosclerosis. The results of the study were published in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> in January this year in two separate papers.</P>
      <P>The first paper concluded that ramipril significantly reduces the rates of death, myocardial infarction and stroke in a broad range of high-risk patients who are not known to have a low ejection fraction or heart failure. The authors estimated that treating 1,000 such patients would prevent 150 cardiovascular events in about 70 patients. The second paper concluded that in patients at high risk for cardiovascular events, treatment with vitamin E for a mean of 4.5 years has no apparent effect on cardiovascular outcomes.</P>
      <P>This study shows the importance of secondary and tertiary prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients who are at high risk for cardiovascular event such as heart attacks, stroke, heart failure and other events. The cardiovascular strategy sets out the importance of the identification of high risk patients in a general practice setting who can benefit from this kind of therapy. It also recommends the development and implementation of treatment guidelines which can help to ensure the potential benefits identified in the HOPE study can be realised by those at risk in this country.</P>

      <QRef>[20442/00]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department Health and Children (Ms Hanafin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, which give effect to the provisions of Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, pre-school providers are obliged to notify their local health board that they are carrying on, or proposing to carry on, a pre-school service. On receipt of notification the health board will provide relevant information to the applicant and arrange for an inspection to be carried out by an authorised person. Based on the most up to date information available from the Southern Health Board, 178 inspections were carried out in 1999 and 191 in 2000 to date in the four community care areas in County Cork. The number of inspections carried out include first, second and third annual inspections as appropriate.</P>
      <P>Where deficiencies in services are identified during inspection, the health board and the providers work in a co-operative manner to make specific improvements in a planned way provided that any delay would not adversely affect the welfare of children. The following is a summary of the type of deficiencies found during inspections: the requirement to reduce places is mainly related to the availability of adequate space per child in the premises and/or the requirement to have a sufficient number of competent adults supervising the pre-school children in the service at all times; inadequately equipped first aid box &ndash; a list of suggested contents is forwarded to the provider, where necessary; incomplete record keeping in respect of register of children; details of staff; fire safety and maintenance records etc; inadequate sanitary accommodation for adults and children; inadequate storage of toxic materials, and inadequate rest and outdoor play facilities.</P>
      <P>When deficiencies are identified during an inspection a summary pre-school inspection report detailing all deficiencies is forwarded to the pre-school provider as part of the inspection procedures. The provider is given a timeframe to reply to the report, outlining what measures are to be put in place to deal with the deficiencies. If the deficiencies noted during inspection are of a serious nature and the team is of the view that there is a potential risk to the safety of the children, the provider is so informed and a follow-up inspection will be carried out within a shorter period of time to ensure compliance with the recommendations of the inspection team.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Southern Health Board has also made available grant aid to a range of community pre-school playgroups, as part of its financial support of certain pre-school services which cater for children regarded as being at risk or disadvantaged, <Col N="492" /> to enable them to improve structural accommodation to comply with the regulations. The board's community workers facilitate this process and build relationships with the community pre-school playgroups. In addition, the pre-school inspection teams in the Southern Health Board offer an advice-support service to pre-school providers who are proposing to commence a new pre-school service, in order to outline to providers the requirements for a pre-school service.</P>

      <P>I recognise the importance of the appropriate use of modern technology to assist in the efficient delivery of health care services. In the last five years my Department has provided approximately £55 million to support a programme of investment in information systems. One of the priorities under this investment programme in the health board-voluntary hospital sector has been the installation of a range of modern hospital systems, including accident and emergency systems.</P>
      <P>The national development plan also recognises the significant role information and communications technology, ICT, will have in the provision of an efficient and effective health service. The plan has earmarked approximately £145 million for capital investments in ICT during the period 2000-06. The systems to be provided under this investment programme are expected to permeate virtually all aspects of service delivery, including accident and emergency services. It is a matter for the management of each individual hospital to prioritise its own information technology budget requirements.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Eastern Regional Health Authority is responsible for the delivery of services by St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane. The £13 million project referred to by the Deputy relates to the development of new and refurbished facilities for persons with an intellectual disability currently accommodated in St. Ita's Hospital. This plan is being jointly funded by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and my Department.</P>
      <P>As part of this project new residential and day services have been completed in Oldtown, County Dublin and are currently being commissioned. This new facility will provide accommodation for 30 persons from the St. Ita's campus. The capital costs to date associated with this development are approximately £3 million with additional revenue costs of £600,000 provided by my Department.</P>
      <P>The work of the project and design teams on an overall development control plan for the hospital campus, which includes new accommodation to be provided for the intellectual disability services, is at an advanced stage. In addition to the £3 million mentioned above, capital funding of £500,000 in 1999 and a further £1 million this year has been allocated by my Department towards the costs associated with the improvement of existing accommodation at St. Ita's for this client group. It is anticipated that the planning and tendering process for the new units will be completed by early 2001 with building commencing on site towards the end of the first quarter of that year. As the Deputy will appreciate, the bulk of the expenditure will be incurred once this building work commences.</P>

      <P>Under the regulations, pre-school providers are obliged to notify their local health board that they are carrying on or proposing to carry on a pre-school service. On receipt of notification the health board will provide relevant information to the applicant and arrange for an inspection to be carried out by an authorised person. Based on the most up-to-date information available from the health boards, excluding the Eastern Regional Health Authority area, the numbers of notifications to health boards are as follows:</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have received the report of the sub-group of the National Cancer Forum on the development of services for symptomatic breast disease. I have considered this report, and while having taken no final decisions on its implementation, I accept the broad thrust of its recommendations. However, some further refinements are needed in relation to implementation arrangements at local level. In this regard, I have recently announced the establishment of an advisory group, to be chaired by Professor Niall O'Higgins, St. Vincent's Hospital, <Col N="498" /> to assist and liaise with health boards in formulating their plans for the development of specialist breast cancer services. I am confident that the development of symptomatic breast disease services which will result will greatly enhance the quality of the services available to the women of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of dental and optical services and the monitoring and upkeep of the waiting lists is the statutory responsibility of the health boards. The information relating to the number of children who have availed of dental and optical treatment in each health board region is not readily available in my Department. I have asked the chief executive officers of the boards to investigate the position in relation to the points raised in the Deputy's question and to reply directly to her as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>Dental treatment services for children in national schools are being developed in accordance with the dental health action plan. In recent years health boards have been progressively adopting a planned targeted approach to the delivery of dental services to national school children and phasing out a demand led system. This is to ensure the optimum use of dental resources and equal access for all national school children to the same level of dental care. Children are screened in second, fourth and sixth classes and follow-up appointments for examination, treatment or orthodontic review are made, as necessary, with the dental surgeon in the clinic designated for the particular school(s). Children are eligible for dental treatment up to their sixteenth birthday.</P>
      <P>As regards the provision of optical treatment the position is that vision screening is part of the child health services which health boards are required to provide for children in national schools under section 66 of the Health Act, 1970. The health board chief executive officers have been asked to consider the need for vision screening for children in the 12 to 16 years age group.</P>

      <P>The annual competition for places on the nursing registration-diploma programmes is conducted by the Nursing Careers Centre. The principles of equity and parity of treatment for all applicants underpin the selection processes employed by the centre. Responsibility for the overall running of the centre now rests with An Bord Altranais. From next year, the application system for places on the nursing diploma programmes will be administered by the Central Applications Office, CAO.</P>
      <P>The minimum age and educational requirements for entry to the nursing diploma programmes are set by An Bord Altranais. An applicant must be at least 17 years of age on or before 1 June of the year of the application, and have obtained in the leaving certificate a minimum grade C3 in two higher level papers and a minimum grade D3 in four ordinary or higher level papers. A person who does not meet the minimum educational requirements and who is 23 years of age on or before 1 January of the year of application may apply as a mature applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears from the information supplied that the person concerned does not meet the minimum educational requirements, nor will she be eligible to apply as a mature applicant for a place on the programme next year as she will not have reached the required age. It will, however, be open to her to apply as a mature applicant for a place on the 2002 programme. Alternatively, if the person concerned was to complete her nursing studies in the United Kingdom and register as a registered general nurse, RGN, with the statutory regulatory body there, she would then be eligible for registration as an RGN with An Bord Altranais. It is not possible for a student who has completed part of a pre-registration nursing education programme in the United Kingdom to transfer to the nursing diploma programme here because of fundamental differences between the <Col N="500" /> structure and content of the respective programmes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 648 and 650 together.</P>
      <P>The briefing paper on reforms in the arrangements for the provision of medical indemnity cover for clinical negligence gives 1 July 2001 as a target date for the introduction of enterprise liability. The transition from the existing arrangements to a system based on enterprise liability is a complex undertaking involving negotiations with a wide range of interests. As enterprise liability will replace a number of existing insurance-indemnity arrangements for different groups of practitioners, it may be introduced in a number of distinct stages.</P>
      <P>It is the Government's intention that the enterprise liability system will take on the responsibility for handling and settling claims arising from incidents which occur after the commencement date of the scheme. It is not the intention to relieve existing insurance-indemnity carriers of liabilities which are properly theirs and which they have already been paid to bear. However, the exact basis on which the transition from the existing to new arrangements will be made is a matter for discussion and negotiation.</P>

The only organisation I have met to date has been the Medical Defence Union which had requested a meeting before the briefing paper was circulated. Officials of my Depart<Col N="501" /> ment and their insurance advisers have met a wide range of organisations in recent weeks and are continuing with a programme of meetings with interested parties. Meetings have already been held with representatives of the health boards and voluntary hospitals, organisations caring for those with a mental handicap, the Dublin maternity hospitals, the Irish Patients Association, the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, the Medical Defence Union, the Medical Protection Society and the Irish insurance companies which provide public liability insurance for hospitals.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the concerns expressed by the medical profession at the rising costs associated with litigation against hospitals and doctors. My predecessor and the Attorney General met both medical defence organisations which operate in Ireland last December to discuss these concerns. The Attorney General and I have had subsequent meetings with one of the defence bodies on these issues. In August my Department circulated a briefing paper on the reform of the arrangements for the provision of medical indemnity cover. This paper is the subject of active discussion with the medical defence organisations and other interested parties. I have been made aware of the particular problems affecting the cost of providing indemnity cover for obstetricians/ gynaecologists. I am not aware that, to date, the high cost of obtaining indemnity cover for obstetrics has prevented any doctor from entering or continuing to practice in the specialty. Obstetricians in the public health service have 80% or 90% of the cost of obtaining indemnity cover reimbursed by their employer.</P>

      <P>The then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Brian Cowen, established the Medical Manpower Forum in May 1998. The forum has met on 12 occasions. The forum has been endeavouring to reach a consensus on the issues involved. The main service, training, research and career issues and the principles and approaches to be adopted have, to a large measure, been agreed by the Medical Manpower Forum. It has also been agreed that the introduction of these changes should coincide with an extension of the core hospital working day. This is necessary if one of the key principles of the forum is to be achieved, that is, the need to provide the highest quality of medical care for those who require the services of hospitals. Final discussions on the forum's first report have yet to be completed. While the forum has not met in formal plenary session since 24 February 2000, outstanding issues have been addressed in the meantime on a bilateral basis with some of the key groups represented at the forum. Based on these discussions I am confident that we can reach an early resolution of remaining issues and reconvene the forum shortly to finalise and formally adopt its report.</P>

      <P>The situation regarding this matter is as I outlined in my response to the Deputy's Question No. 283 on 10 May 2000. The Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994, were drawn up by the Minister for Finance and come under the remit of the Revenue Commissioners. The Department of Health and Children has no statutory responsibility for the regulations or their operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To qualify, a person must meet the medical criteria specified in the above regulations which are not set by the Department of Health and Children. The senior area medical officer for the relevant health board area will issue a primary medical certificate if he or she is satisfied that the applicant fulfils the medical criteria set out in the Department of Finance's Disabled Drivers and <Col N="504" /> Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994. This role is to assist the operation of the Revenue scheme.</P>
    <P>If a person is dissatisfied with a decision of a director of community care and medical officer of health in respect of primary medical certification, it is open to that person to appeal to the Medical Board of Appeal. However, as with the above regulations, the Department of Health and Children has no statutory responsibility for this board of appeal.</P>

      <P>Any person making a planning appeal is required to pay a fee as a contribution towards the cost of administering the planning appeal system. The general fee is £120. However, the fee for first party appeals in relation to commercial development is £300, and the fee for certain prescribed bodies which must be consulted in relation to certain types of planning applications is £60. Proposals to waive or reduce fees for any group have to be balanced against the necessity to ensure the planning appeal system is adequately resourced and that the cost is fairly distributed among the users of the system. I have no proposals to amend planning appeal fees as proposed by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Under section 17 of the Roads Act, 1993, the National Roads Authority, NRA, is responsible for the planning and supervision of works for the construction and <Col N="505" /> maintenance of national roads. The national development plan, NDP, for the period 2000-06, together with the Community Support Framework and the Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme, broadly form the strategic policy context for the provision of national road infrastructure over the next seven years; it is a matter for the National Roads Authority, local authorities and the private sector through public private partnerships to implement the necessary investment to achieve the agreed policy objectives.</P>
      <P>It is the responsibility of the NRA within the framework of the NDP to promote the detailed programming of the work required by the plan and to undertake, in co-operation with local authorities, the planning, design and implementation of individual road development projects.</P>
      <P>In addition to the road investment programme set out in the NDP, on 26 July 2000 the Government agreed to advise the NRA to include the Dublin eastern bypass motorway project in the national roads development programme, and to proceed with its planning and design on a basis which would minimise disruption to existing communities. This decision followed a review of transportation issues by the Government in 1999 when the NRA was asked to take another look at the possibility of an eastern bypass of Dublin. The study concluded that the bypass would now be feasible on environmental, engineering, and economic grounds.</P>
      <P>In relation to non-national roads, my Department reviewed the 2000 programme generally in August and made certain revised allocations in order to ensure a full and efficient programme spend. In addition, on 15 September 2000 I visited Killarney to officially open the inner relief road which links the N72 Killorglin Road to the N71 Kenmare Road.</P>
      <P>I have approved three environmental impact statements during the summer months. These relate to the N4 Sligo inner relief route, N11 Newtownmountkennedy to Ballynabarny, and Ballincollig bypass proposed national road improvement scheme and associated works.</P>

      <P>While there is no specific grant available for extending a house in view of multiple births, there are a number of housing options in place which could be of benefit in this situation. The improvement works in lieu scheme allows the local authority to improve or extend a privately owned house in the case of overcrowding as an alternative to the provision of a local authority house. In addition, the local authority may offer a local authority loan for house improvement in the case of persons who cannot obtain a loan to meet their requirements from a building society or bank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Road signs showing distances in imperial measurements have been replaced on all national roads and are being progressively replaced on the more extensive non-national road network. Metrication of speed limits, is in principle, desirable for consistency with road distance signs and general national and EU policies in favour of metrication. Such a change will, however, have to be managed so as not to compromise road safety or the important targets in this regard set by the Government strategy on road safety 1998-2002. A working group of relevant agencies, chaired by my Department, is to recommend on the implementation of metricated speed limits.</P>

      <P>Local authorities are empowered to provide disabled persons parking bays on public roads in their charge. It is an offence to park in such bays unless a disabled person's parking permit is displayed in the vehicle and it is being parked for the convenience of the holder of the permit.</P>
      <P>The offence of parking illegally in a disabled person's parking bay comes within the scope of the on-the-spot fines system and a £15 on-the-spot fine is applicable. The level of on-the-spot fines generally is being reviewed by my Department and the question of amending the on-spot-fine for this particular offence is being considered in that context. Enforcement of these regulations is a matter for the Garda Síochána or local authority appointed traffic wardens.</P>

The power for the placing of weight restrictions on bridges is set out in Section 158 of the Road Traffic Act, 1933, which was replaced by Section 93 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, is still extant and continues to afford legal protection to bridges from the effects of excessive burdens.

            <entry>This Section provides that the functions vested in the Garda Commissioner to make bye-laws in respect of stopping places and stands for omnibuses could be transferred to the Minister. The question of the effective transfer of that function would only arise in the event that a need was established to amend or replace the bye-laws which the Commissioner has made under Section 86 of the 1961 Act. As these bye-laws are still relevant, no such need exists.</entry>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Urban Renewal Act, 1998, and the Town Renewal Act, 2000, it is a matter for the relevant local authorities to propose sub-areas for designation for tax incentives within the area covered by integrated area-town renewal plans. This system has operated effectively since being introduced for the 1999 urban renewal <Col N="526" /> scheme and it is appropriate that local authorities which are in the best position to engage in the type of cross-sectoral consultation with relevant local interests which is required under the scheme carry out this role.</P>
      <P>In doing so they are assisted by the detailed guidelines issued to them; these set out the purposes and aims of the schemes, the criteria to be used in selecting towns for which plans are to be prepared, and advice on the approach to be followed in preparing their plans, including selecting sub-areas for designation. Local authorities were advised that the extent of designation must necessarily be limited and well targeted and that only sites that clearly fulfilled the objectives of the plans should be designated. The award of incentives can only be justified where it can be shown that they will assist in overcoming identifiable barriers to development.</P>
      <P>The role of the expert panels set up by me was to assess the local authorities' proposals and recommend sub-areas-sites for designation on the basis of the plans submitted by the local authorities; the panels were confined to examining the sites recommended by the local authorities by reference to the criteria contained in the guidelines. The panels comprised individuals with a broad range of relevant expertise in urban planning, architecture, conservation etc.</P>
      <P>In the course of their examination of the plans, the panels sought clarification from local authorities in relation to various issues where this was considered necessary. The expert advisory panels exercised an independent role in assessing the plans submitted and making recommendations on the sites to be designated. The recommendations made by the panels were accepted in full and that is the basis on which designations are now being implemented.</P>
      <P>The sites selected for designation by the local authorities, examined by the expert panels and subsequently approved for designation followed a very detailed, structured and well thought out process. Therefore, I do not consider that an appeals system is necessary, feasible or practicable; my priority now is to ensure these schemes are implemented effectively in order to ensure the desired objectives are achieved.</P>
      <P>The incentives are aimed at encouraging investment in the sites targeted, not least those for which development proposals do not exist. The urban renewal and town renewal schemes run until 31 December 2002 and 23 July 2003 respectively.</P>

      <P>The provision of a fire service, including fire fighting appliances and their distribution among fire stations, is a matter for each local fire authority &ndash; in this case Donegal County Council &ndash; in accordance with section 10 of the Fire Services Act, 1981. However, my Department assists fire authorities by providing capital grants towards expenditure they incur in the purchase of such appliances etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October 1999, I approved a proposal from Donegal County Council to purchase a new fire appliance at a cost of over £165,500. The council expects to take delivery of this appliance this month. I also conveyed approval to the council in <Col N="528" /> June 2000 to invite tenders for a further new fire appliance at an estimated cost of £170,000. Exchequer grants will be provided in due course towards the cost of these appliances.

      <P>I am not aware of the provenance of the information referred to. With regard to packaging waste generally, the question of which packaging materials, products or packaging systems, for example, reuse or one trip systems, are environmentally preferable is complex, and a definitive assessment of the best practicable environmental option in any specific circumstance requires appropriate life cycle analysis. However, in broad terms, I am satisfied that there may well be scope for greater use of reusable glass beverage containers on the Irish market, and deposit and refund schemes in respect of refillable and reusable beverage containers, currently operating in a small number of EU member states, are being examined. This matter will be addressed in the context of the forthcoming policy statement on waste minimisation, recycling and recovery generally, which will outline the scope of measures to be undertaken in the interests of a sustained improvement in our waste recovery and recycling performance.</P>
      <P>Ireland will be supportive of any appropriate policy initiatives at EU level which may be brought forward in the context of the current review of Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste, with a view to improving current performance in relation to the minimisation and reuse of such materials.</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of bus lanes and quality bus corridors is to facilitate mass transport in urban areas. Accordingly, access to bus lanes has been restricted to omnibuses, large public ser<Col N="530" /> vice vehicles and, in relation to with flow bus lanes only, taxis.</P>
      <P>Pedal cyclists have been afforded access to with flow bus lanes since the inception of such facilities, <i>inter alia,</i> in view of road safety considerations. A more pro-active promotion of cycling as a transport mode has been advanced through the more recent introduction of quality bus corridors which are commonly provided with associated dedicated cycle tracks for pedal cyclists.</P>
      <P>Access to bus lanes for motor cyclists is not necessitated on road safety grounds and could compromise the safe cycling environment for pedal cyclists which bus lanes and quality bus corridors aim to provide. There are, accordingly, no proposals to extend the use of bus lanes to motor cycles at this time.</P>
      <P>I understand the UK authorities have recently conducted several pilot schemes to study the safety benefits of the use of bus lanes by motor cycles, to both motor cyclists and cyclists alike. These studies have proven to be inconclusive and the UK authorities are maintaining their policy that motor cycles should not be allowed to use bus lanes.</P>

      <P>S.I. No. 78 of 1997 provides that the attachment to an existing radio mast of antennae for mobile telephony and the replacement of an existing mast are exempted development. The addition of antennae for mobile telephony to an existing radio mast and the replacement of an existing mast are, subject to certain criteria &ndash; restrictions on the size, number and type of mobile phone antenna and compliance with certain emissions standards &ndash; exempted development. The exemption for mobile phone masts in S.I. No. 86 of 1994 was a temporary one which expired on 16 November 1994.</P>
      <P>The exempted development regulations give statutory support to the policy of co-location of antennae by licensed mobile telephone operators set out in my Department's guidelines for planning authorities on telecommunications antennae and support structures and are a key measure to avoid the proliferation of masts. I have, therefore, no plans to amend the exempted development regulations as proposed by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>In April 2000, a planning group under the aegis of my Department began consideration of proposals in relation to new rental assistance arrangements and issues arising in their implementation. A report on the matter will be submitted to Government before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The Government decided, in principle, to establish a local authority rental assistance scheme in the light of a report of an interdepartmental committee, published in August 1999. This committee had been set up in March 1996. The local authority role in this area will involve the establishment of a new scheme rather than the transfer of the existing rent supplementation scheme which is administered by the health boards.</P>
      <P>The Government policy statement, Action on Housing, June 2000, indicated that the planning group should specifically explore the potential of more supply-focussed approaches to rental assistance, including possible arrangements and measures needed to promote improvements in standards and supply of rent-assisted accommodation. This is being addressed by the planning group.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>A large number of the Department's staff, including staff in my office and the offices of the Ministers of State, but also staff in the various sections throughout the Department are involved in responding to correspondence from Members of the Oireachtas and in responding to freedom of information requests as part of their day-to-day work. It is, therefore, not practical to quantify separately the systems, procedures and resources in place in my Department for replying to correspondence from Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Systems and procedures, including monitoring and tracking systems, in place in my Department for responding to correspondence from Members of the Oireachtas, which routinely would be directed in the first instance to my office or the offices of the Ministers of State, are constantly under review with a view to providing an excellent standard of customer service. The Department's customer service action plan, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, sets standards of service for all correspondence received in the Department.</P>
      <P>Every effort is made to respond to all correspondence received in my Department, including correspondence from Members of the Oireachtas, in accordance with the standards set in that plan. These standards are currently being reviewed in light of the revised quality customer service principles recently adopted for the Civil Service and in the context of a new customer action plan being drawn up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace):</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1998 policy statement, Changing our Ways, recommended that local authorities identify and assess a range of waste treatment technologies with a view to the development of an integrated waste management infrastructure appropriate to their particular circumstances. To inform the development and implementation of these waste management plans, two EU-funded feasibility studies were carried out in 1998 on thermal treatment-recovery options as one element in an integrated approach towards waste management. These studies examined the technical, environmental and financial advantages and disadvantages of thermal treatment in two distinct rural regions &ndash; the north-east and mid-west &ndash; and in the greater Dublin region.</P>
      <P>The studies considered three thermal treatment options &ndash; waste incineration with energy recovery, WTE, gasification and pyrolysis &ndash; under a range of criteria. At the time, the consultants concluded, <i>inter alia</i>, that: WTE is a safe, tried and tested technology capable of meeting stringent environmental standards; gasification and pyrolysis are emerging technologies which are continuing to be developed to the scale likely to be appropriate in Irish circumstances; gasification does not have the same track record as WTE, but appears to be close to becoming proven as a treatment method for municipal wastes; gasification offers environmental advantages over WTE, including lower emissions; pyrolysis may have future potential in certain applications but is not currently suitable as a bulk treatment method for municipal wastes. I am not aware of any more recent facts that would fundamentally challenge these conclusions.</P>

    <P>As outlined in the 1998 policy statement, Changing our Ways, overall Government policy on waste management is committed to a dramatic reduction in reliance on landfill, in favour of an integrated waste management approach which will deliver ambitious recovery and recycling targets. These include a diversion of 50% of overall household waste away from landfill; a minimum 65% reduction in biodegradable waste consigned <Col N="571" /> to landfill; the development of composting and other feasible biological treatment facilities capable of treating up to 300,000 tonnes of biodegradable waste per annum, and recycling of 35% of municipal waste.</P>
    <P>Having regard to these targets, current and proposed regional waste management plans incorporate proposals for household segregation and separate collection of organic waste and dry recyclables in urban areas; an extended network of bring facilities in rural areas, typically with a target density of one facility per 500 population; an increased network of civic amenity sites and waste transfer stations; a range of centralised composting and other biological treatment facilities, and support for home composting of food and garden waste, especially in rural areas.</P>
    <P>To support the delivery of improved waste services and infrastructure under these regional plans, some £650 million is earmarked for capital investment in the development of waste management infrastructure under the national development plan, 2000-06. Of this, some £100 million in Exchequer-EU funding will be provided to support the development of requisite waste recovery infrastructure, including biological treatment facilities, over the life of the plan.</P>
    <P>A segregated household collection scheme for recyclables has already begun in the Dublin region and is progressively being extended with a view, ultimately, to providing segregated collection services for organic waste and dry recyclables in respect of 80% of households in the region. I anticipate that local authorities in other regions will rapidly move to provide, or require the provision of, equivalent segregated collection and recovery services within their functional areas, and I understand Repak Limited, which was established to promote, co-ordinate and finance the collection and recovery of packaging waste, is prepared to make funding available to assist local authorities in the initiation and development of such services.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 704 and 707 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 101D of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as inserted by the Dublin Transport Authority (Dissolution) Act, 1987, empowers prescribed <Col N="573" /> road authorities to issue directions to statutory undertakers, including telecommunication operators, and others for the purpose of co-ordinating road openings and minimising traffic disruption. Under the Road Traffic (Co-ordination of Roadworks) Regulations, 1992, the following urban authorities are those authorised to exercise these powers: Dublin Corporation, South Dublin County Council, Fingal County Council, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Cork Corporation, Limerick Corporation, Waterford Corporation and Galway Corporation.</P>
    <P>General guidance on the need for an efficient and expeditious approach to the carrying out of road works, whether by road authorities or other statutory undertakers, is in my Department's memorandum on grants for non-national roads. The detailed operation of relevant road traffic controls is, however, the responsibility of the road authority concerned. I am aware that Dublin Corporation is making extensive use of these powers through its Directions for the Control and Management of Roadworks in Dublin City.</P>
    <P>The Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill, 1999, which is currently before the Seanad, proposes to modernise legislation in relation to road openings by telecom operators. In particular, it is designed to enhance local authority powers by obliging telecommunication operators to obtain the consent of the local authority before opening a road to lay underground telecommunications infrastructure. Under section 15 of the Bill, a local authority would be empowered to make its consent subject to conditions, including reduction in the number of telecommunications related road openings by ensuring road openings are co-ordinated, trenches are shared and spare ducts are laid for future use by other operators.</P>
    <P>The Bill simplifies the legislative and arbitration systems to enable the operators of fixed telecommunications networks to obtain rights of use over land for the purpose of constructing telecommunications infrastructure, where such infrastructure is essential for supply of telecommunications services &ndash; mobile phone operators are not included in these provisions &ndash; while maintaining an environment for development that is attractive to investment in telecommunications infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Beyond the above provisions, I have recently indicated, in response to the Committee Stage debate on the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, that I would consider the need for a strengthening of legislation to control road openings and that process is under way. In the meantime, I have asked the Dublin Transportation Office to assess, in consultation with local authorities in the DTO area, to what extent the approaches taken to the opening and reinstatement of roads and paths for the installation of telecommunications infrastructure could be better managed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The draft guidelines are intended to ensure a consistency of approach throughout the country to the treatment of planning applications for child care facilities. It is anticipated that they will also assist planning authorities in their efforts to make suitable provision for child care in their development plans. A wide range of interested bodies, including local and other statutory authorities and non-governmental organisations, availed of the opportunity to comment on the draft guidelines. These submissions are being considered in my Department and final guidelines will be issued <Col N="575" /> as soon as possible, taking into account the views expressed during the public consultation process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations, 1999, made a number of changes to the provisions governing the holding of driving licences for motor cycles, including the removal of restrictions by reference to an age limit of 25. Prior to the making of the new regulations, persons had either (a) to have held a category A1, motor cycles not exceeding 125 cc, full licence for at least two years, or (b) to be over 25 years of age, in order to be eligible to apply for a first-time category A, motor cycles of all sizes, provisional licence.</P>
      <P>The new regulations have relaxed access to first-time category A provisional licences by providing for eligibility of any person over 18 years of age. However, all such persons, irrespective of age, are restricted to riding motor cycles not exceeding 25 kW engine power for the duration of all provisional licences granted to them and for the first two years after passing a driving test and taking out a full category A.</P>
      <P>The intention behind these new provisions is that new motor cyclists will be restricted to riding and gaining experience on lower-powered motor cycles, less than 25kW engine power, before being given access to higher-powered machines. These arrangements are considered desirable in the interests of road safety and against the background of the disproportionately high accident-fatality rate of motorcyclists in Ireland compared to other categories of road users. It should, however, be noted that these new arrangements do not apply to persons who held category A provisional licences prior to the commencement of the new regulations.</P>
      <P>These progression arrangements for new motor cyclists will be kept under review in the light of the motor cycle accident and fatality rate and the impact of the motor cycle training initiative being undertaken by MAG Ireland with support from my Department.</P>

The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the water services investment programme, 2000-02 announced in July. Given the priority rating afforded to the scheme by the council, the level of competing demand and the funding available, it was not possible to include it in the programme at that time.</P>

I understand this section of road would coincide with the eastern end of the road line referred to in the question.</P>
      <P>It will be open to Mayo County Council to prioritise this project, having regard to compliance with the eligibility criteria, for funding under the 2001 EU co-financed specific improvement grants scheme when applications are sought by my Department from local authorities under this scheme shortly.</P>

      <P>In last year's review of the programme, the Government committed to the early achievement of the £100 commitment and, furthermore, extended it to all social welfare old age pensions by 2002. Significant progress has already been made in this regard. In the three budgets since taking office, the Government has moved towards achieving the £100 target rate. The personal rate of old age contributory pension has been increased by £18 to £96 per week, while the rate for a married couple has been increased by £27.20 to £160.40 per week. The equivalent rates for old age non-contributory pension have been increased by £18 to £85 per week and by £29.70 to £137.20 per week, respectively.</P>

      <P>One of the commitments made prior to the 1997 general election was to address the issue of people who narrowly failed to qualify for a pension. The group referred to by the Deputy was marginally excluded from entitlement to an old age contributory pension as they were aged 56 or over when compulsory social insurance was extended to the self-employed in April 1988. These people could not, therefore, satisfy the governing qualifying condition of having entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.</P>
      <P>In delivering our commitment, I examined various options in arriving at a formula that would address the specific problem faced by this group of pensioners. Of these I considered that a flat-rate payment of a special old age contributory pension was the most equitable and practical way of addressing the situation, taking account of all the circumstances. It represents very good value for money for all the people concerned.</P>
      <P>Since April 1999 a special old age contributory pension has been available to those self-employed persons who were aged 56 or over in April 1988 and who have, at least, five years contributions paid since then. Payment is at a flat-rate of 50% of the standard maximum rate with equivalent increases for adult and child dependants, where applicable.</P>
      <P>It is important to stress that this special arrangement represents a positive and reasonable response to the situation in which this group of people found themselves.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a number of community development support programmes, namely; the community development programme; the family and community services resource centre programme; the programme of funding to locally based community and family support groups.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the above mentioned programmes is to provide seed money to enable community groups to pilot initiatives identified as meeting new and emerging needs. More specifically the aim of the family and community services resource centre programme is to help combat disadvantage by improving the functioning of the family unit.</P>
      <P>Centres can provide special services for lone parent families, young mothers and others considered in need of extra support and can act as a first step to community participation and social inclusion for the most vulnerable and marginalised families.</P>
      <P>In 1994, to mark the International Year of the Family, an allocation of £250,000 was made available to my Department to fund ten family resource centres on a pilot basis. The decision was motivated by the perception of a possible gap in statutory support for community development activities focused on support for families and tackling child poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An evaluation of the work of these centres was published in 1997, a key recommendation of which was that funding of these centres should be mainstreamed by my Department. The Com<Col N="584" /> mission on the Family in their final report recommended that a network of 100 family resource centres be established in the ensuing 4 to 5 years. Taking into account the outcome of the review, and the recommendations of the Commission on the Family, additional funding of £700,000 was allocated in 1998 to allow the expansion of the programme by some 25 centres. A total sum of £2.13 million was allocated to the programme in 1999 to allow for the expansion of the programme by some 20 centres and a further £2.939 million has been made available in 2000 to allow for the expansion of the Programme by some 15 centres.</P>
    <P>To date, some 67 centres are in receipt of funding or approved in principle for inclusion in the programme.</P>
    <P>Under Partnership 2000 my Department was committed to identifying 30 new priority areas for funding under the community development programme. Research was undertaken to identify the most disadvantaged areas and as a result I approved the inclusion of some 40 new areas in the Community Development Programme. In addition the research identified some 24 priority areas, including Westport town for inclusion in the family and community services resource centre programme and I subsequently approved the area for inclusion in the programme.</P>
    <P>The Regional Support Agency, West Training and Development, which operates under the community development support programmes is currently undertaking the necessary pre-development work to establish a new centre in Westport. Its brief is to establish a representative voluntary management committee to assume responsibility for the management of the project and to determine a suitable location for the centre. This decision will be made in consultation with the relevant communities in Westport and with reference to available amenities-facilities in the areas concerned. The community indicated in the Deputy's question are engaged in consultations with the Regional Support Agency in this regard.</P>

      <P>A person leaving employment in the UK, or another EU country, and returning to Ireland to care for a person in need of full-time care and attention, and who qualifies for carer's allowance, is entitled to receive carer's allowance credits, provided they have paid or credited contributions in the preceding two contribution years. In order to allow any EC insurance contributions to be taken into <Col N="585" /> account for credit purposes, the claimant must have previously entered social insurance in Ireland.</P>
      <P>If no title exists for carer's allowance a person may qualify for disregard years under the homemakers scheme, provided they satisfy the conditions of the scheme.</P>
      <P>Under the homemakers scheme, introduced in 1994, years spent out of the workforce caring either for children up to the age of six, increased to age 12 from 6 April 1995 or incapacitated people may be disregarded in calculating the person's yearly average number of contributions for old age contributory pension purposes. A maximum of 20 years may be disregarded in this way.</P>
      <P>Provision is also made for the award of credited contributions in the year in which a person commences or ceases to be a homemaker.</P>
      <P>In addition, earnings of up to £30 per week where a person is engaged in part-time employment outside the home are also permitted.</P>
      <P>However, I recognise that issues remain to be addressed in area of homemakers and, as I have previously indicated, I have ordered a review of the arrangements which are already in place. Accordingly, an examination of the homemakers scheme will be undertaken as part of the ongoing review of eligibility conditions for contributory old age pensions.</P>

      <Quest>the grants available to parents of multiple births, especially in the case of triplets.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in relation to the issue of child benefit, CB. entitlements and multiple births is as follows. Prior to the introduction of the Social Welfare Act, 1998, CB was payable at the normal rate for each child in the case of twins and a grant of £500 was payable at birth, and further grants of £500 were payable when the twins reached the ages of four and 12.</P>
      <P>CB was paid at double the normal rate when three or more children were born together. However, no birth grants were payable in the case of triplets.</P>
      <P>In the Social Welfare Act, 1998, I introduced two key additional measures designed to improve the overall package of benefits available to parents of multiple births. First, the £500 grants, which previously were confined to families with twins, were extended to include also families with multiple births of three or more children. Second, the rate of CB payable in respect of twins were increased to 150% of the normal CB rate. These measures took effect in September, 1998 at a full year cost of some £4.8 million.</P>
      <P>In the interim, I have also provided for very substantial investments in the CB scheme. The 1998 budget provided for an additional full-year investment in the scheme of over £40 million, while last December's budget provides for a full year investment of almost £106 million. From September of this year, the basic CB monthly rates will have risen to £42.50 in respect of the first two children and £56 in respect of the third and subsequent children. These improvements will benefit all families with children, including of course, families with twins or triplets and represent, in my view, the most effective use of the available resources.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 736 and 758 together.</P>
      <P>The General Assembly of the United Nations has proclaimed 2001 as the International year of Volunteers known as IYV 2001. The year is designed to enhance recognition, facilitation, networking and promotion of volunteer service.</P>
      <P>The intended outcome of the year are that more needs be identified with which volunteers can help, that more people everywhere offer their services as volunteers; and volunteer programmes receive increased resources and facilities, to help them assign those new volunteers to tackling the needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In such a year all can gain. Individuals can find a renewed sense of purpose. Volunteer groups can be reinvigorated. Governments and the non-profit and private sectors can enter into fresh partnerships to make for greater participation, <Col N="589" /> alleviate problems and promote good governance.</P>
    <P>The UN year of the volunteer will provide a focus for activity to support the volunteering movement. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides that a national committee on volunteering will be established to devise strategies and actions for supporting and developing volunteering.</P>
    <P>I am currently in the process of establishing this committee which will co-ordinate activities during the year. The offer of office space and assistance with the employment of staff made by the Carmichael Centre will be considered as part of this process. The first task for the committee will be to agree a broad strategy for the year and draw up an initial plan of action. Membership of the national committee on volunteering will be drawn from the statutory and voluntary sector and will include a significant number of volunteers.</P>
    <P>The recently launched White Paper, Supporting Voluntary Activity, emphasises the need to promote the active involvement of people in community and voluntary groups as an essential component of a democratic society and outlines a number of measures to support volunteering. In this regard, the white paper announced a budget of £1 million for the national committee to develop initiatives to further support and develop volunteering.</P>

      <P>Signature or ratification by Ireland of an international agreement is a matter for decision by Government; however, the 1962 UN Convention, the subject matter of this question, has not been the subject of a Government decision to date.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for reviewing and modernising the legislation in relation to the registration of births, deaths and marriages was assigned to my Department in July 1997. This review is taking place in the context of a major project to reorganise and computerise the General Register Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the review I intend to publish, next year a new Bill on the registration of births, deaths and marriages including divorce and nullity which will update the current body of legis<Col N="590" /> lation and facilitate the planned organisational change.</P>
    <P>There will remain substantive issue relating to marriage which are outside the scope of this review of legislation but which must be addressed. Accordingly, the Government has approved the establishment of an interdepartmental committee to agree an approach to the review of the legislation governing the registration of marriages and related issues. This committee will be established shortly.</P>
    <P>The question of seeking Government approval for the State to accede to the UN Convention of 1962 on consent to marriage, minimum age for marriage and registration of marriage will be considered in the context of the committee's review of these issues.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 739, 740 and 741 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a series of international agreements and conventions relating to social security which it is open to Ireland to become a party to or to <Col N="591" /> ratify. Details relating to the main such instruments follow.</P>
    <P>The European Code of Social Security, drawn up by the Council of Europe, lays down minimum standards in this field. The code was opened for signature on 16 April 1964. Ireland has ratified the code and accepted five parts relating to sickness benefit, unemployment benefit, old age benefit, family benefit and survivor's benefit respectively. It has not been possible to date to ratify the remaining four parts dealing with medical care, employment injury benefit, maternity benefit and invalidity benefit. These parts are currently under review in my Department to establish whether ratification has become possible. A revised code was opened for signature by member states of the Council of Europe on 6 November 1990. Ireland has not signed or ratified this Revised Code, to date.</P>
    <P>Ireland has ratified a similar ILO Convention No. 102 concerning minimum standards of social security on 17 June 1968, and accepted parts of the convention relating to sickness benefit, unemployment benefit and survivor's benefit. This convention is under review in relation to its unratified parts, medical care, old age benefit, employment injury benefit, family benefit, maternity benefit and invalidity benefit.</P>
    <P>Detailed provisions for the co-ordination of social security schemes throughout the European Union and European Economic Area are contained in Council Regulations (EEC) Nos. 1408/71 and 574/72. These regulations provide for the co-ordination of social security schemes for employed and self-employed persons, students and members of the families of such persons moving throughout the European Union and the European Economic Area. The Regulations also cover refugee and stateless persons who are residing in an EU/EEA member state as well as members of their family, regardless of their nationality, and their survivors.</P>
    <P>The Council of Europe's European Convention on Social Security was opened for signature by the member states of the Council of Europe on 14 December 1972 and was signed by Ireland on 23 February 1979.</P>
    <P>The Convention is designed to ensure, in each ratifying country, equality of treatment in social security for nationals of other ratifying countries and for refugees and stateless persons and also to ensure that entitlement to social security benefits is maintained despite changes of residence within such countries.</P>
    <P>To date eight of the member states of the Council of Europe viz. Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Turkey, have ratified the Convention.</P>
    <P>All, except Turkey, are members of the European Union and, accordingly, the social security entitlements of persons moving between Ireland <Col N="592" /> and those countries are already protected by the EU Regulations on social security.</P>
    <P>Consideration will be given to the signing and ratrification of a protocol to this convention, which was opened for signature on 11 May l994, in the context of any future review as to whether Ireland should ratify the main convention. The Protocol has been signed by four countries &ndash; Austria, Greece, Luxembourg and Portugal &ndash; but has not been ratified by any of them.</P>
    <P>Information sought in relation to other multilateral agreements is being provided by the Government colleagues who have primary responsibility.</P>

      <P>Social Welfare Act, 2000 &ndash; sections 8(1)(f2&gt;d) and (f2&gt;f) &ndash; these sections provide for 0.7% reduction in the standard and lower rates of employer PRSI, to ensure that there is no overall increase in the employer's PRSI contribution following the introduction of the new national training fund levy. The promulgation of the commencement order will co-incide with the introduction of the required employment protection legislation by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>Sections 10 and 11 &ndash; provide for the introduction of the new carer's benefit scheme. This is an insurance-based scheme designed to facilitate people who wish to leave the work-force temporarily to care or older people or for people with disabilities who are in need of full-time care and attention. The scheduled date for implementation of the scheme is 26 October 2000.</P>
      <P>Section 23 provides for the return of social insurance contributions in certain circumstances to people who make enforceable maintenance payments. This will be commenced before the end of March 2001 and will apply to maintenance payments made in the current income tax year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 28 provides for a number of amendments to existing carer's allowance legislation designed to align that scheme with the provisions of the new carer's benefit. The amendments will <Col N="595" /> take effect from the date of introduction of the carer's benefit scheme on 26 October 2000.</P>
    <P>Section 31 provides for changes in the administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which will be addressed in conjunction with additional procedural issues.</P>
    <P>Social Welfare Act, 1999 &ndash; all provisions commenced.</P>
    <P>Social Welfare Act, 1998, section 17 &ndash; provides for actuarial reviews of the social insurance fund to be undertaken on a five yearly basis and will be commenced later this year;</P>
    <P>Social Welfare Act, 1997, Part IV &ndash; provides for the introduction of a new Sickness Allowance scheme. The overall purpose of the proposed sickness allowance scheme will be reviewed this year as part of the review of the income maintenance schemes for people with illness disability. All those who would have qualified for sickness allowance are currently being catered for through other payments, such as supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>Section 26 (1)(f2&gt;b) &ndash; this section contains regulatory powers to prescribe the provisions relating to benefit and privilege in the context of means assessment.</P>
    <P>Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1995. Section 10 (4) provides regulatory powers under which a divorced person may receive a qualified adult allowance in respect of more than one person. The need for this Regulation is reviewed on an ongoing basis; Social Welfare Act, 1995 </P>
    <P>Section 22 provides regulatory powers designed to standardise the arrangements applying to various social welfare schemes, in relation to absence from the State; Social Welfare Act, 1994</P>
    <P>Section 20 provides for the integration of injury benefit and unemployability supplement, payable under the occupational injuries benefits scheme, with disability benefit.The overall role of occupational injuries benefit payments will be examined as part of the current review of sickness/disability schemes. Decisions on the implementation of this section will be taken in the light of the findings of this review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>There are currently two directives relating to my Department which are for transposition into Irish law. They are Council Directive 98/49/EC on the safeguarding of the supplementary pension rights of employed and <Col N="596" /> self-employed persons moving within the European Community, which was adopted on 29 June 2000, providing for equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin.</P>
      <P>Directive 98/49/EC primarily deals with the preservation of benefits, disclosure of information and payment of occupational pensions across borders for workers who move from one member state to another. It also provides for workers who are posted abroad to be allowed to stay in their occupational schemes and to be exempt from joining such a scheme in the country to which they are posted.</P>
      <P>Member states are required to bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative arrangements necessary to comply with the directive not later than 25 July 2001.</P>
      <P>To comply with the terms of the directive, an amendment to the pensions Act is necessary. This amendment will be incorporated into the new pensions Bill, which I expect to publish by early next year.</P>
      <P>Council directive 2000/43/EC was adopted on 29 June 2000. This directive relates to implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin. The purpose of the directive is to allow the participation of all persons, natural and legal, in society regardless of racial or ethnic origin. While primary responsibility for its implementation rests with my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the scope of the directive does include social security. Any necessary changes in the social welfare system arising out of this directive will be implemented not later than 19 July 2003, the deadline for compliance with the directive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 747 to 749, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Because of the range of the Departments activities there is at any one time a range of working groups, committees and project boards involved in aspects of the Department's business. Many of these are set up on an ad-hoc basis to address particular issues and details are not available as to the number and nature of all of these.</P>
      <P>The statutory agencies operating under the aegis of my Department are the Pensions Board, the Combat Poverty Agency, Comhairle and the Social Welfare Tribunal.</P>
      <P>The Pensions Board was established in December 1990 under the Pensions Act, 1990. The role of the board is to monitor and supervise the provisions of the Pensions Act, 1990 relating to occupational pensions; and to advise the Minister on all matters relating to its functions and on matters relating to pensions generally. There are two committees operating the aegis of the board.</P>
      <P>The Combat Poverty Agency, CPA, was established in September 1986 under the Combat Poverty Agency Act, 1986. The main functions of the agency are to advise the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs on all aspects of economic and social planning in relation to poverty; to initiate and evaluate measures aimed at overcoming poverty; and to promote greater public understanding of the nature, causes and extent of poverty and the measures necessary to overcome poverty. There are currently five sub-committees operating under the agency.</P>
      <P>Comhairle was established in June 2000 in accordance with the Comhairle Act, 2000. It is responsible for the provision of independent information, advice and advocacy services for citizens throughout the country, including people with disabilities. It combines the National Social Service Board, NSSB, which was established in 1984 under the National Social Service Board Act, 1984, with relevant functions of the National Rehabilitation Board, NRB.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Tribunal is a statutory body established under section 276 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, as amended.</P>
      <P>The function of the tribunal is to adjudicate on applications for unemployment payments by workers who have been involved in a trade dispute, on the grounds that they were unreasonably deprived of their employment. Where the tribunal rules in favour of the workers, unemployment benefit or assistance may be paid to them for the period of the dispute. Non-statutory bodies, groups or initiatives operating under the aegis of my Department include:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The REACH agency, recently established to co-ordinate and progress the development of modern integrated services across the public sector including the development of an electronic public services broker to act as the gateway for <Col N="598" /> the delivery of electronic services. The REACH unit will be a cross-departmental unit under section 12 of the Public Service Management Act, 1997, reporting to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental steering committee comprising representatives from my Department, the Departments of Health and Children, chair, Finance, Environment and Local Government, the Central Statistics Office, the General Register Office and REACH has been set up to oversee the civil registration modernisation programme. The programme is being led by a full-time programme director in my Department who reports to the steering committee.</P>
    <P>There are no plans to give the committee a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>The family mediation service is a free, professional, confidential service, which enables couples who have decided to separate to reach agreement on all issues related to their separation.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed in the renewed Action Programme for the Millennium to establishing the Family Mediation Service on a statutory basis. I plan to bring proposals to Government in this regard as soon as is practicable.</P>
    <P>A joint steering group was established by my Department with the Department of Finance to oversee the implementation of the expenditure review process within the Department. The steering group, which is chaired by the secretary-general of my Department, monitors progress in relation to the reviews under way and approves completed reviews for submission to the central steering committee, chaired by the Secretary-General of the Department of Finance, which has responsibility for the process across the public service. There are no plans to establish the Department's steering group on a statutory footing.</P>
    <P>The money, advice and budgeting service, MABS, was established on a pilot basis in 1992 to make available money management and budgeting skills to people who need such skills to enable them to cope with pressures on their incomes and to introduce them to low cost, socially targeted credit and a culture of saving. The programme now comprises some 50 projects, or companies, nation-wide.It is now proposed to establish the MABS on a statutory basis and I will be bringing proposals for legislation to Government shortly.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides for the establishment of a national committee on volunteering prior to the UN International Year of Volunteers in 2001 to devise strategies and actions for supporting and developing volunteering. This will be established shortly. There are no provisions to put the committee on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>Customer panels involve customers meeting representatives from the Department on an informal basis to express their opinions on the service <Col N="599" /> they receive. Such panels have been set up from time to time throughout the Department and provide a useful means of obtaining views and feedback from users of the Department's services.</P>
    <P>The Department jointly operates a business users' panel for employers in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Prior to the transfer in 1996 of the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme, renamed disability allowance, from the Health Boards to the Department, a forum of the principal organisations and service providers representing people with disabilities was established to ensure that all aspects and implications of the transfer were discussed. The forum has continued in operation, now meeting on a quarterly basis, and has since been broadened to include issues concerning the invalidity pension and carer's allowance as well as other matters relevant to people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to establish these panels on a statutory basis. A number of working groups will be set up under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness but it is not intended to establish any of these on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>A partnership steering committee and a series of regional and local committees have been established in the Department under the terms of Partnership 2000. The membership of these committees consists of departmental management, staff and unions. It is not proposed to establish these committees on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>The Department is represented on the hidden economy monitoring group, HEMG, which also involves the Revenue Commissioners, Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC, Small Firms Association SFA, Construction Industry Federation, CIF, and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU. This group was set up in 1988 under the Programme for National Recovery, PNR, to  provide a forum for exchange of views on and to monitor the effectiveness of measures introduced in combating the hidden economy. The group's tenure was extended under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, PPF.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to establish this group of a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>A number of other groups and committees have been set up by the Department involving representatives of other agencies and bodies. It is not proposed to establish any of these on a statutory basis at this time.</P>
    <P>These include: inter-departmental committee on the national anti-poverty strategy; joint monitoring group with An Post which monitors and reports on the performance of the obligations and conditions under which An Post provides payment delivery services to the Department; community development programme advisory committee; community development programme technical group.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Since I came to office in mid 1997 I have allocated a total of £13 million to this scheme which allowed some 53,000 individuals to receive assistance under the scheme and this funding has been made available through some 3,000 voluntary organisations. An allocation of £5 million has been made available to the scheme again this year. As applications are currently being processed by the regional offices of my Department is not possible to indicate at this stage how many organisations will participate and how many individuals will benefit from the scheme again this year. The organisation inidcated in the Deputy's question is one of the many organisations that has participated in the scheme in recent years and I understand that they have submitted applications under the scheme again this year.</P>
      <P>Applications received under the scheme are processed by the regional offices of my Department who assess such applications to determine if they cab be funded and if so what level of funding should be allocated in each case. When undertaking this assessment my Department considers each application to determine to what extent it meets the criteria for the scheme and to what extend the most vulnerable older people in our community will be assisted. This assessment also includes examination of accounts submitted by these organisations in respect of funding previously received under the scheme. In addition my Department, when allocating funding, must take account of the overall demands to be met in relation to the available resources.</P>
      <P>I understand that applications in excess of £500,000 have been received this year from the group indicated in the Deputy's question. These applications, in addition to all applications received under the scheme are currently being assessed by my Department's regional offices in the manner outlined above and the groups involved will be advised in due course of the outcome of their applications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pensions apply to all insured people &ndash; both employees and self-employed. These qualifying conditions require a person to have: entered social insurance before age 56, for the old age contributory pension and age 55, for the retirement pension; and a minimum of 156 full rate contributions paid. This requirement for all contributors will increase to 260 and 520 paid contributions from April 2002 and April 2012, respectively; and a yearly average of, at least, ten contributions paid or credited from 1953 (when the unified system of social insurance came into effect) or the date of entry into social insurance, if later. The reduction in the yearly average requirement from 20 to ten was introduced in November 1997. Where the yearly average is between ten and 19 contributions a minimum of 260 contributions must have been paid.</P>
      <P>Provision is also made in the Social Welfare system for <i>pro-rata</i> pensions for any person who fails to qualify for an old age contributory or retirement pension under the standard qualifying conditions. These apply to people who may have a mixture of Irish contributions and contributions in other EU countries or countries with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement or those with a mixed insurance record e.g. full rate contributions and contributions from public service employment.</P>
      <P>In this year's Social Welfare Act, I introduced a special pension targeted at people who had paid contributions prior to 1953 but failed to qualify for an old age contributory pension due to the operation of the &lsquo;yearly average' test.</P>
      <P>This special pension, payable from 5 May 2000, will benefit many women who have gaps in their PRSI records because of time spent working full-time in the home. It is a flat-rate pension, payable at 50% of the maximum personal rate, to any person who became insurably employed prior to 1953 and who, due to the yearly average rule, failed to qualify for pension or qualified for a pension at less than 50%, i.e. £48 per week from May, of the standard maximum rate. To qualify, a person must have paid, at least, 260 contributions which may comprise all pre-53 contributions or a combination of pre and post 1953 insurance.</P>
      <P>In terms of the overall situation, the Department has been reviewing the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pensions. The report on the first phase of this review has recently been published and I am currently considering the recommendations of this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="602" /> I recognise that issues remain to be addressed, particularly in the area of the homemakers scheme which is in place since 1994 and which allows periods spent caring to be disregarded when calculating average contributions for pension purposes. An examination of the homemakers scheme will be undertaken as part of the ongoing review of eligibility conditions for contributory old age pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 752, 760, 766, 784 and 806 together.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by semi-State companies such as Bus Átha</P>
      <P>Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnrod Éireann, as well as services provided by some 75 private transport operators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="603" /> A review of the free schemes was published in April this year by the Policy Institute, Trinity College Dublin. The review considered the difficulties involved in access to public transport services and noted that there are two main groups affected: those who have a disability which prevents them using the service and those for whom a service does not exist, which mainly affects those living in rural areas. This problem, which is unrelated to the free travel scheme, is part of a wider social and infrastructure problem, affecting all those who are disadvantaged and who can neither afford their own transport or avail of access to public transport.</P>
    <P>The review examined a number of alternatives to the existing system including the use of vouchers. It considered that a voucher type system, which would be open to a wide range of transport providers including taxis and hackneys, would be complicated and less feasible than the current system. Voucher schemes, by their nature, can introduce stigma to a scheme.</P>
    <P>The use of vouchers is not in keeping with a fundamental aspect of the scheme as originally envisaged; that of using existing spare capacity on public transport as it covers the country. It would do little to facilitate the provision of public transport services where none exist nor would it facilitate the provision of accessible public transport.</P>
    <P>However, the review of the free schemes does recommend that a &lsquo;Social Transport Fund' be supported and made available to voluntary and community based organisations for the provision of local transport initiatives that would be unlikely to operate without a subsidy. Such a fund would be mainly social in nature and could facilitate the provision of wheelchair accessible vehicles. The review considered it appropriate that such a fund could be managed locally, perhaps by the local authorities, in view of their knowledge of local services and to maintain community autonomy.</P>
    <P>The free telephone rental allowance covers the line rental and instrument rental for a standard telephone and up to 20 call units in each two-monthly billing period. The allowance also covers the cost of a second telephone socket and, for those with a hearing or vision disability, a special telephone and wall mounted bell. My Department has no function in the matter of instrument rental and any proposals in relation to this are a matter for the privately-owned telephone company concerned. However, my Department will monitor any measures that may affect recipients of the allowance.</P>
    <P>The review of the free schemes considered that the schemes have a number of benefits, most importantly from a social inclusion and participation standpoint: basically they facilitate older people and people with disabilities living alone to participate more fully in society. The schemes are inflation-proof, as they are based on a unit allowance rather than a cash equivalent. In addition, <Col N="604" /> they finance items of expenditure that are difficult to budget for on a weekly income. The schemes also perform an income maintenance function in that they provide goods and services in kind which would otherwise have to be purchased or foregone. Overall, however, the main benefit of the schemes results from their role in supporting and encouraging the recipients to be active and participate in the community.</P>
    <P>Information on the type of schemes operated in other EU countries is not readily available in my Department. However, the review examined a number of demands to extend the free schemes to include other socially worthy goods and services. The schemes as currently constituted, provide a basic package of necessary household benefits that ensure a limited standard of comfort or well being to a particular targeted group. This group is not targeted solely on income need and the findings indicate that some recipients do not have the same income needs as others. It is considered that the most appropriate way of alleviating poverty is through the provision of adequate social welfare payments. Therefore, the review recommended that no extension of the free schemes take place unless it can be shown that there are increased social benefits that are over and above those which can be purchased by increased income.</P>
    <P>The role of my Department in matters relating to the senior euro pass is to submit observations in conjunction with other Departments, statutory and non-statutory bodies on any action taken to implement the proposals in this report, in so far as they affect the business of this Department. The administration of the euro pass itself is outside the remit of my Department.</P>
    <P>The review of the free schemes examined the issue of extending the free travel scheme to non-resident pensioners and concluded that such an extension of the scheme would not be in keeping with the primary objective of the free travel scheme which is to encourage older people and people with disabilities to remain independent and active within the community.</P>
    <P>The recommendations made in the review will be examined in the context of future budgets and available resources.</P>

      <P>The students summer jobs scheme operated this year from 1 June to 30 <Col N="607" /> September during which period approved students were allowed to undertake 200 hours work at £3 per hour, giving a possible total maximum payment of £600. The primary aim of the scheme is to provide financial help to less well-off students who are unable to get summer work and who are not entitled to claim unemployment assistance during the summer holiday period. I am conscious of the good work accomplished under this scheme and of the valuable experience it has given to many students.</P>
      <P>I am also conscious, however of the fact that employment opportunities in the wider economy have increased significantly in recent years and that there are greater possibilities for summer work as a result. An increase in pay levels under the scheme could have the effect of discouraging students from taking up other jobs where the supply of labour is tight. I will be reviewing the scheme in the light of this year's experience to determine if any adjustment or refocussing is required for the future. In doing so I will also have regard to the demands of the labour market generally and the need to encourage an adequate supply of labour particularly during the busy summer months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the statutory qualifying conditions for receipt of one-parent family payment for separated people is that claimants must make, and continue to make, efforts appropriate to their particular circumstances to obtain maintenance from their spouses for themselves and their children. This would normally involve taking out a summons under family law against the spouse with a view to obtaining a court order for maintenance. Alternatively, participation in a structured mediation process is also accepted as meeting the efforts requirements.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of this requirement is to encourage separated couples, where possible, to resolve adequate maintenance directly without the need for reliance on state income support by the one-parent families concerned. It also acts as a mechanism to ascertain that the separation has actually resulted from marital breakdown, rather than for financial or employment reasons.</P>
      <P>If claimants do not know the whereabouts of their spouses, they may be required to provide appropriate evidence that they have tried to trace their spouse, eg, through enquiries with the gardaí. In cases where it is believed that spouses are resident in Britain for example, claimants may be requested by the Department to ask the UK Department of Social Security to help trace their spouse with a view to serving a maintenance summons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="610" /> This condition is regarded as being satisfied if the claimant cannot trace the spouse and has made all reasonable efforts to do so.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which ich is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Since I came to office in mid-1997 I have allocated a total of £13 million to this scheme which allowed some 53,000 individuals to receive assistance under the scheme. I am anxious to ensure that this scheme continues to address the security needs of the most vulnerable older people in our society and accordingly a sum of £5 million has been provided for the scheme in my Department's Estimates for 2000.</P>
      <P>Grant aid is available towards the cost of small scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially monitored alarm systems, such as the &ldquo;pendant&rdquo; alarm system which is operated via the telephone and is worn around the neck or wrist.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the scheme a maximum of 90% of the once-off costs associated with the purchase and/or installation of this type of equipment can be funded. While the maximum grant available under this scheme is 90% of the total cost, it is not possible to guarantee this level of funding in respect of all applications received under the scheme. Priority in allocating the available funds is given to the most vulnerable older people. The actual amount of the grant varies in the light of individual circumstances and needs and the overall demands which must be met.</P>
      <P>Annual monitoring fees or maintenance fees associated with these systems are not provided for under the scheme. As these socially monitored alarms are installed by a range of companies the fees charged in respect of monitoring arrangements may vary from one company to another. In some instances the voluntary organisation submitting the application endeavours to cover the monitoring fees through fund raising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in many cases, it falls to the individ<Col N="611" /> ual receiving assistance under the scheme to provide for these fees on an on-going basis.</P>
    <P>A review of the scheme was completed in April 1999 and there are no plans to amend the scheme.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on rent supplements in 1999 was £101 million. At the end of 1999, there were 41,873 people in receipt of rent supplement. 1,563 of these were in receipt of back-to-work allowance and a further 1,518 were community employment scheme workers. Together, these amount to 3,081 recipients or 7.4% of the total. Another 12,748 or 29.8% were unemployed and 8,458 or 20.2% were lone parents. A full breakdown by primary social welfare payments is set out in the attached tabular statement.</P>
      <P>The cost of the scheme continues to increase mainly because of increases in recent levels. For example, £113.4 million has been provided in the current year's Estimates in respect of rent supplement payments, an increase of £12.4 million or over 12% on the 1999 outturn.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the total number of rent supplement recipients increased by approximately 650 &ndash; less than 1.6% &ndash; during the first nine months of this year.</P>
      <P>Another reason expenditure is not falling in line with falling unemployment is the improvements in the arrangements for the retention of rent and mortgage interest supplements which I introduced earlier this year. These changes include disregards in the assessment of means and a tapered withdrawal of the supplement over four years.</P>
      <P>The additional cost in a full year of these measures is estimated to be £1.8 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is committed to maintaining and improving the service provided to Members of the Oireachtas and see this as an integral part of the Department's customer service programme.</P>
      <P>In this regard, my Department, in addition to providing a service through correspondence, has put dedicated telephone lines in place within the main administrative areas to deal with queries from Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The procedure for dealing with correspondence from Members of the Oireachtas is that all letters are acknowledged by the office to which they are addressed. Replies then issue from these offices or from the line area concerned.</P>
      <P>Each office ensures that replies to correspondence from Members of the Oireachtas is correctly handled by adherence to procedures contained in internal instructions which are subject to review and updating from time to time. Computerised systems are used for logging correspondence and for tracking and monitoring replies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="613" /> The business of the Department involves high volumes of claims, reviews and payments and there is inevitably a high volume of queries, whether by correspondence or otherwise, to be dealt with on an ongoing basis. Some of these queries can give rise to protracted inquiries. The standard of service is kept under review and a continuing effort is made to improve both the speed and the quality of service provided. Service standards have been set in the main areas of business as a way of monitoring the level of service and identifying the scope for improvement. The standard currently in place for replies to correspondence from Members of the Oireachtas is that 80% should be answered within three weeks. While in the current year it has not been possible to achieve this standard, every effort is being made to significantly improve current performance with a view to meeting the standard and, if possible, exceeding it.</P>
    <P>As dealing with correspondence from Members of the Oireachtas is an integral part of the work of staff who have a wide range of other duties, the staff numbers or staff time devoted to this element of the work is not available.</P>
    <P>The staff resources in my Department devoted to processing and responding to requests from Members of the Oireachtas have not been reduced nor have they been diverted following the introduction of freedom of information legislation.</P>

      <P>The person concerned had been in receipt of unemployment benefit and assistance since July 1995. To establish that he satisfied the statutory conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work, he was interviewed by an inspector of the Department in February 2000. The inspector was not satisfied with his efforts to secure employment and referred him to the local jobs facilitator. He was then enrolled in a pre-employment course to improve his employment prospects. The person concerned failed to attend this course.</P>
      <P>The deciding officer, having considered the inspector's report, was of the opinion the person concerned was not genuinely seeking work. His claim was disallowed accordingly.</P>
      <P>The person concerned appealed this decision to the social welfare appeals office. His case has been considered by an Appeals Officer who is of the opinion that an oral hearing is necessary. This will be arranged as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Refugees receive income maintenance payments on the same basis as Irish citizens. For example, a single unemployed refugee receives £76 unemployment assistance for the first 12 months of unemployment and £77.50 per week thereafter.</P>
      <P>The income maintenance needs of asylum seekers are met for the most part by health boards who administer the supplementary welfare allowance scheme on behalf of my Department. The SWA scheme provides entitlement to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
      <P>Where a person has access to some resources either in cash or in kind this is taken into account in determining entitlement to SWA. This occurs in the case of asylum seekers who are being provided with full board accommodation under the direct provision system operated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Where a person in full board accommodation receives all meals and has access to other facilities such as laundry and leisure areas the recommended weekly allowance is £15 per adult and £7.50 per child. Furthermore, as is the case with all persons who are resident in the State where there are other reasonable expenses, exceptional needs payments will be made by the health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Asylum seekers who have not been provided <Col N="621" /> with full board accommodation and who have no other means qualify for the full standard rate of weekly SWA. This amounts to £76 per week for a single adult, £123 per week for a couple and £13.20 per week for a dependent child. Asylum seekers who arrived in the State prior to the introduction of direct provision and who live in private rented accommodation qualify for rent supplement on the same basis as other recipients. For example, a single person living in Dublin can receive up to £64 per week towards rent, while a family can receive up to £179 per week, depending on the number of people in the family.</P>
    <P>Asylum seekers and refugees are also entitled to claim child benefit. The monthly rate is £42.50 for the first and second child increasing to £56 for third and subsequent children. They may also make an application for a one parent family payment and old age non-contributory pension if they satisfy the necessary conditions.</P>

      <P>The family income supplement, FIS, scheme is designed to provide an incentive for low paid workers with families to take up or remain in full-time employment. Together with child benefit and child dependent allowances, FIS provides an avenue for the provision of child income support by my Department. None of these payments are, however, designed specifically to meet child care costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of discussions with the social partners in relation to the range of issues associated with child care provision and costs, it has been suggested that consideration could be given, amongst other things, to disregarding certain child care costs in determining entitlement to FIS. This particular proposal will be examined in the <Col N="622" /> context of the development of an equitable strategy to support parents in meeting their child care needs as provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

      <P>At present the treatment of maintenance in the social welfare system differs across schemes. For example, in the one-parent family payment means test all maintenance received is assessed as means with the exception of a disregard of £75 per week in respect of vouched housing costs. In contrast to this, maintenance paid to claimants of unemployment assistance in respect of children is not assessed as means.</P>
      <P>The review of the one-parent family payment, published by my Department recently, examined the treatment of maintenance within the one-parent family payment means test and suggested that OFP recipients be allowed to retain at least 50% of any maintenance received in addition to the existing disregard for housing costs. The review also proposed that the treatment of maintenance be standardised across all social welfare schemes using the OFP system including the proposed change.</P>
      <P>These proposals will be examined in a budgetary context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Social welfare income support through one-parent family payment, OFP, acts as a safety net for families who have failed to obtain adequate, or indeed any, maintenance, from their spouse or the other parent of their child. However, those claiming must satisfy my Department that they have made reasonable efforts to obtain such maintenance. This obligation has existed since the inception of social welfare support schemes for lone parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In separated cases, it is a condition that an OFP claimant must make efforts to seek maintenance before the claim is awarded. In unmarried cases, efforts to seek maintenance is not a qualifying condition but unmarried OFP recipients are expected to make efforts to seek child mainten<Col N="623" /> ance from the other parent after the OFP claim is awarded. There is no cost involved in initiating a maintenance summons through the relevant District Court clerk.</P>
    <P>The liability to maintain family provisions of the Social Welfare Acts were introduced in 1990, and are intended to operate in parallel to the &ldquo;efforts&rdquo; requirements for OFP claimants. Where a claimant had no success in securing adequate maintenance and requires social welfare income support as a result, my Department can take action to recover from the liable relative some or all of the social welfare payments issued to the lone parent family concerned.</P>
    <P>With regard to supports and information available to lone parents attempting to obtain maintenance, help is available in a wide range of number of ways e.g. using a comprehensive information guide published by the Department and available in Information Offices nationwide; by contacting the one-parent family payment section of the Department directly; by contacting any social welfare local office; through a number of national and local voluntary bodies which provide advice to lone parents on maintenance issues.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Family Mediation Service offers free advice to couples in separation situations. The money advice and budgeting service is available to offer advice and help to any person in financial difficulty arising from separation or other causes. Guidance is also available from the free legal advice centres and the Legal Aid Board.</P>
    <P>Overall, I am satisfied that lone parents who need information have a good range of sources and supports available to them.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 793 and 794 together.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has a £5 million annual allocation to support the provision of out-of-school hours child care services by community based groups in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £5 million annual funding for the out-of-school hours child care scheme will be made available to the projects funded by my Depart<Col N="624" /> ment under the following programmes: community development programme; family and community services resource centre programme; core-funded community and family support group programme. Funding will also be available to other local initiatives subscribing to a self-help. community development ethos.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the provision of this funding to less well off communities will address a number of issues, for example, the provision of low cost out-of-school child care for parents who are in the paid labour market, practical support for children who need additional support to maintain their interest in school, the promotion of parental and community involvement in engaging young people in school and community life and the provision of additional community based services for families.</P>
    <P>Since the commencement of the out-of-school hours child care scheme in May 2000, there have been three separate rounds of funding with closing dates for receipt of applications as follows: 26 May 2000, 30 June 2000 and 22 September 2000.</P>
    <P>A total of 196 applications have been received from community groups by the final closing date of 22 September and funding totalling approximately £.7 million has been approved for 25 community groups. Some of the applications received were not eligible for funding and some were appropriate to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which has overall responsibility for child care. The remaining applications are currently being examined in my Department and it is not possible at this stage to state the exact amount that will be approved for funding in 2000.</P>

      <P>Special arrangements were introduced for old age contributory and retirement pension purposes in 1991 to cater for people with a mixture of full-rate and modified rate PRSI. The revised arrangements provided for the payment of pro-rata pensions in proportion to the periods of insurance completed at the class A rate. These arrangements are similar to those which apply under the EU regulations to people with a mixture of insurance in a number of different EU member states.</P>
      <P>In addition, the qualifying conditions for entitlement to the old age contributory pension were significantly eased in 1997, when entitlement to reduced rate pensions was extended to those with yearly averages of between ten and 19 contributions. Under this measure many former public servants who had already qualified for pro-rata pensions became entitled to enhanced pensions. The new arrangements to take account of pre-1953 contributions, which came into effect from 5 May this year, will also benefit people with mixed insurance records.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently reviewing the qualifying conditions for old age contributory, OACP, and retirement pensions, RP. The report on the first phase of this review was published recently and recommended, amongst other things, that the average contribution test, on which entitlement is currently based, be replaced by a system based on the actual number of contributions paid. The implementation of this system will be considered in the second phase of the review, which will also include an examination of the homemaker's scheme.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was disallowed farm assist on the grounds that his means, derived from farm income and his wife's earnings, exceed the statutory limit. An appeal against this decision was made and, in accordance with statutory requirements, a submission on the matters raised in the appeal was prepared.</P>
      <P>Arising from an oral hearing on 23 March 2000 the appeals officer requested a further report from the social welfare inspector with a view to clarifying the farm expenses which the person contended to have been under-estimated. The inspector has now reported that despite considerable effort on his part the person has failed to clarify such expenses or to provide additional receipts. He has submitted a report to this effect to the appeals officer and it is proposed to reconvene the oral hearing. This will be arranged for the next visit of an appeals officer to the Ballina area. The person will be notified of the arrangements when they are finalised.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is currently in receipt of unemployment benefit at the rate of £61.20 per week since 19 September 2000. This payment includes an increase for his four dependant children.</P>
      <P>Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <P>The higher than expected inflation has had the effect of reducing the value of this year's budget increases in social welfare payments. At the time of the budget it was estimated that inflation would be much lower, in the region of 3%, and the Government provided for social welfare increases well in excess of this. However, the recent rapid increase in inflation was not predicted and therefore, in next year's budget the Government will be taking account of the increased level of inflation in getting increases for 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>In formulating proposals for the forthcoming budget, I will aim to build further on the improvements for people with disabilities which have been introduced since this Government took up office. For instance &ndash; all social welfare payments, including the disability allowance, have been substantially increased in real terms; significant improvements in the assessment of capital for disability allowance purposes are being introduced from next week, which will see a fivefold increase from £2,000 to £10,000 in the amount of capital which is disregarded for means test purposes; a range of measures have been introduced to improve access to disability allowance for many people in full-time residential care; various measures have been introduced to facilitate people on disability allowance in accessing employment, training and educational opportunities, including the extension of the back to work and back to education allowance schemes to people on disability allowance and a substantial increase up to £75 a week in the amount of earnings from rehabilitative employment which can be disregarded for means test purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's query in relation to a person on disability allowance who becomes entitled to another social welfare payment, the following is the position. There is a general rule under the social welfare code whereby a person who is concurrently eligible for more than one <Col N="631" /> payment can receive only one payment &ndash; generally the payment which is most financially beneficial to him or her. This rule applies in the case of recipients of disability allowance who become eligible for another social welfare payment, a widow-widower's pension.</P>
    <P>However, disability allowance is paid only between the ages of 16 and 66 years. Therefore, on reaching 66 years of age a recipient will no longer qualify for disability allowance, but will become eligible for the old age non-contributory pension. Under the old age non-contributory pension scheme, means are generally assessed on a more favourable basis than they are under other social assistance schemes, including disability allowance. Accordingly, a person who had been in receipt of disability allowance would, in the normal course, qualify for the old age non-contributory pension on reaching 66 years, the rate of which would generally be higher than that which they had been receiving while on disability allowance.</P>
    <P>There will be some cases where a person would qualify for an old age pension at a lower rate than disability allowance. For instance, a person's income position can change on reaching pension age, for example, they or their spouse may qualify for an occupational pension or a social security pension from another State. Such income would be assessable for old age pension purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The back to work allowance was introduced in September 1993 as part of my Department's programme of initiatives designed to assist the long-term unemployed to return to the active labour force.</P>
      <P>Since then, almost 72,000 people, who were previously long-term unemployed or lone parents, have availed of the scheme to take up new jobs as either employees or self-employed persons. Of that number, approximately 16,000 people have completed the full cycle of support provided under the scheme. An independent evaluation of the scheme has just been completed and it will be published within the next few months. The conclusions and recommendations in this evaluation will form the basis for future changes in the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme, in addition to the financial incentives which it provides, also has a number of important and valuable supports, i.e: assistance towards the cost of business plans, marketing, <Col N="632" /> advertising etc. and small capital items; interest free loans to persons starting or expanding their own businesses from the First Step organisation; loans through the credit union movement which are guaranteed by my Department; special grants to existing self-employed customers who take on a long-term unemployed person and guidance and help with all aspects of their businesses from my Department's jobs facilitators.</P>
    <P>In order to reach those who have not worked for a long time, I recently introduced a supplementary scheme for the people unemployed for five years or more. In addition to the normal financial benefits of the back to work allowance this scheme includes a training period of up to six weeks for employees before they actually start working. A weekly allowance of £35 per week is paid in addition to the person's unemployment payment to cover the cost of travel and meals to potential employees during this time.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the present arrangements provide a good level of financial and other supports to unemployed people wishing to get back to work. Nevertheless my Department continues to monitor the scheme on an ongoing basis and any further improvements which are considered necessary will be introduced as part of the annual budgetary process.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of recent meetings with community activists in Celbridge, County Kildare, she has now revised the proposals for the treatment of Castletown Gates, Celbridge; her new proposals, if any; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>The ornate entrance gates and piers to Castletown House have already been damaged and are under considerable threat of further damage, primarily from large vehicles.</P>
      <P>Consequently, my Department proposed: that the original ornate gates and piers be moved back a short distance along the avenue; that a new wider entrance be provided where the gates are now located, the design of which would be in keeping with the existing entrance; and that improvements be undertaken to the whole area inside the existing gates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These proposals were designed to reduce the risk to the existing gates, to provide greatly enhanced, and much safer, access to Castletown House and to the housing estate in the grounds, and in so doing to maintain the relationship <Col N="640" /> between the entrance, the gate lodges, and the Main Street of Celbridge.</P>
    <P>Local opinion is, however, divided. Celbridge Chamber of Commerce had indicated its support for these proposals, as has the Castletown Foundation. However, on 16 August 2000, officials of my Department and of the Office of Public Works met some local community representatives, who expressed their opposition to what is proposed.</P>
    <P>These proposals are the result of a serious effort by my Department to find a reasonable and appropriate solution to the problems that now arise with the entrance and as of now it is not clear if feasible alternatives exist. For example, my Department could accept the retention of the gates in their current position, subject to access through them being restricted to cars only. However, this has real implications for refuse vehicles, fire service vehicles, ambulances, tour buses, etc., and the agreement of the relevant services would be required.</P>
    <P>However, if the Deputy or the relevant community representatives have any alternative workable suggestions that would effectively deal with the existing problems at Castletown gates, I will have them carefully examined. All material changes to the entrance area will of course require planning permission.</P>

      <Quest>the current position regarding repairs to Ballybunion Castle, County Kerry, following the external damage caused by lightning in December, 1999.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>An architect and a structural engineer from my Department <Col N="641" /> inspected this site in early September, at the request of Kerry County Council. Prior to the inspection, the county council had erected scaffolding to facilitate examination of the lightning damage. The damage is more extensive than had been thought previously and the structure is in a dangerous condition.</P>
      <P>Repair of the lightning damage would require substantial works involving erecting suitable scaffolding, detailed recording of the damaged section followed by careful removal and reconstruction of the damaged sections of stonework.</P>
      <P>The costs involved in the repair work are likely to be significant but would need to be estimated beforehand by a competent quantity surveyor. My officials are prepared to offer advice to Kerry County Council in drawing up a cost plan and are maintaining contact with them in this regard. Pending clarification of the costs involved it is not possible to say what repair works can be carried out.</P>
      <P>Finally, public safety remains a primary concern. Additional barriers and warning signs need to be erected by the county council as well as a lightning conductor to prevent any further damage by lightning strikes.</P>
      <P>Ownership of the property had been unclear but I understand that Kerry County Council is, in fact, the owner. As such, the cost of repairs would have to be borne by the council. As I stated previously in my reply to the Deputy's Question No. 317 of 30 Bealtaine 2000, it would be possible to have the structure listed in the Heritage Council's buildings at risk register which could lead to grant assistance from that body. The Heritage Council is an independent body in this regard.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that my Department is not holding up the work at Bond Bridge. There are two bridges in question in this case and they are of architectural significance. Although Kildare County Council approved a scheme to realign the bridges, it did subsequently accept that the heritage considerations had to receive further attention. My Department subsequently received a revised scheme from the county council on 25 September. Although it is a much improved proposal, which retains substantial amounts of the heritage fabric, my Department has since communicated with Kildare County Council suggesting further improvements which will meet the heritage <Col N="642" /> requirements and allow the realignment to take place.</P>

      <P>The giant hogweed is an introduced species and not protected under the Wildlife Act, 1976. I am not aware that it is occurring in any of our national parks. There is no statutory provision, either under animal health or nature conservation legislation for enforcing the control of species such as this unless they are hazardous to livestock, which this is not.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Central Fisheries Board has taken an interest in the species because it is hazardous to anglers and they have been taking control measures for a number of years. Our conservation rangers are monitoring its presence in areas where it might become a nature conservation concern. As it is not protected and does not pose a threat to other protected species, I have no plans to have a study carried out into the spread of the giant hogweed.</P>

      <P>My Department has proposed Ventry Strand for designation as a natural heritage area. I intend to designate the site when powers become available to me under the proposed amendment to the Wildlife Act, 1976, which the Deputy will be aware is on Committee Stage. Kerry County Council has no powers to exclude any area from a proposed or designated natural heritage area. However, Kerry County Council is the body charged with implementing planning law and I have already requested the county council to take account of these sites in its development plans.</P>

Officials of my Department are to meet in the near future representatives of the Maynooth College authorities to try to determine an appropriate location for these facilities. Provision of toilet facilities is essential if the castle is to open to the public in the summer of 2001.</P>
      <P>The total investment for these projects is estimated at £1.5 million and this heritage site will be extensively marketed as part of the many heritage attractions managed by my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no plans at present to introduce paid parental leave. However, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides that my Department will, in 2001, conduct a review of the operation of the Parental Leave Act, 1998, in consultation with the social partners. This commitment is in accordance with section 28 of the Act, which provides for a review of the operation of the Act within not less than two years and not more than three years of its commencement on 3 December 1998. This review will provide an opportunity to assess provisions of the Act in the light of its operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the numbers who have qualified for parental leave, the position is that the Parental Leave Act, 1998, which implements the Parental Leave Directive (96/34/EC), provides an individual and non-transferrable entitlement to both parents to 14 weeks unpaid leave from work to take care of young children. The leave must be taken before the child reaches five years of age, except in certain circumstances in the case of an adopted child. The entitlement applies to parents of children born or adopted on or after 3 June 1996. The Act was amended by the European Communities (Parental Leave) Regulations, 2000 (S.I. No. 231 of 2000), with effect from 19 July 2000. The effect of the amendment is to provide an entitlement to 14 weeks unpaid parental leave to parents of children born between 3 December 1993 and 2 June 1996 or children born on or after 3 December 1993 and in whose case an adoption order was made between 3 December 1993 and 2 June 1996; this leave must be taken not later than 31 December 2001. Generally an employee must have one year's continuous service with the employer before she or he is entitled to take parental leave. However, where the child is approaching the age threshold and the employee <Col N="650" /> has more than three months' but less than one year's continuous service with the employer, she or he is entitled to <i>pro rata </i>parental leave. In such a case the employee is entitled to one week's leave for every month of continuous employment completed with the employer when the leave begins.</P>
    <P>There are no statistics available centrally in relation to the uptake of parental leave. Individual employers are, however, required, under section 27 of the Parental Leave Act, 1998 to keep records of parental leave taken by their employees.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has applied in the United Kingdom for a transfer to serve the balance of his sentence here under the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. However, his formal application has not yet been received from the United Kingdom authorities. Officials in my Department <Col N="652" /> contacted the UK authorities last week and were advised that the UK authorities were not yet in possession of all the documentation required to complete the application for submission to me for my consideration. When the UK authorities have collated the necessary documentation and reports required under the convention, I am assured that they will forward his application for my consideration without delay.</P>
      <P>As I have explained in the past the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons and the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995, require that extensive documentation be exchanged between both jurisdictions in order to allow an application to be fully considered. A three-way consent is also required to enable any transfer to take place i.e. from the authorities of both jurisdictions and from the person concerned. On receipt of those consents &ndash; assuming they are forthcoming &ndash; an application must be made to the High Court for a warrant authorising the transfer of the person concerned and his or her continued detention here.</P>
      <P>These procedures are required under the convention and must be adhered to in processing each application. Unfortunately, it is not possible to say how long it will take for this application to be considered. However, I assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to complete this process as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very aware of the damage done to local communities by the scourge of so called &lsquo;joyriding'.</P>
      <P>I have been assured by the Garda authorities that they are satisfied that the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts, 1961-1993, as enforced by them are adequate to deal with situations where persons use or take possession of mechanically propelled vehicles without the consent of the owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that they continually monitor trends in unauthorised takings with a view to identifying and targeting both persistent offenders and areas prone to such activities. Some of the local responses to joyriding include &ldquo;Operation Steering Wheel&rdquo; which was developed by the Garda authorities to deal specifically with the problem of joyriding in Coolock. The operation is ongoing and comprises uniform, foot and mobile patrols targeting specific locations on a nightly basis. A special resource unit comprising one sergeant and eight gardaí was established to specifically target incidents of joyriding in West Tallaght. Each Garda <Col N="653" /> division also has a traffic unit which outside of peak traffic hours targets incidents of joyriding.</P>
    <P>In addition I am informed by the Garda authorities that An Garda Síochána is actively involved in a number of diversion programmes or projects, which my Department funds, with a view to diverting juveniles away from this type of crime. These programmes or projects involve not only the Garda but also local community groups and other agencies. I am also informed that juvenile liaison officers and community gardaí avail of every opportunity during the course of their work, particularly in implementing the schools programme, to educate young people to the dangers posed by joyriding. I am further informed that the garda is also involved in the south Dublin inter-agency steering group on joyriding and anti-social activity. The Garda is also involved in a task force to address the problem in the Coolock area.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives the Garda is promoting to deal with joyriding include the crime prevention through environmental design concept which involves a Garda crime prevention officer liaising with local authorities, town planners and communities at the development stage of new estates and parks. This can involve effecting physical changes such as barriers and speed ramps to reduce access to areas frequented by youths engaged in these activities.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, a wide range of measures are being deployed by An Garda Síochána to combat the problem of joyriding and to discharge its role in maintaining law and order. I am further assured that the Garda has been in the past and will continue to be proactive in dealing with such problems both by way of direct action through detection and prevention through the numerous diversion and referral schemes.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also appreciate that at a time when record numbers of new cars are being purchased other organisations have a role to play in ensuring that scrapped vehicles are disposed of properly, responsibly and safely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph 8 of the most recent Supreme and High Court Fees Order (S.I. No. 341 of 1989) provides that no fees shall be payable in respect of proceedings under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964; Maintenance Orders Act, 1974; Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976; Family Home <Col N="654" /> Protection Act, 1976; Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981; Status of Children Act, 1987; Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1988; or proceedings brought by a health board under the Children Acts, 1908 to 1989.</P>
      <P>Legislation enacted after the 1989 fees order not covered by that order and the various statutes providing for orders for judicial separation or divorce do not contain any provision that fees are not to be made payable. Therefore the proceedings at all times attracted and continue to attract stamp duty. The court has no discretion to waive fees in any case not expressly covered by statute or statutory instrument.</P>
      <P>Prior to the recent Government decision, which prohibited any increase in fees charged by State bodies, a revision of the Supreme and High Court Fees Order was under way. As part of that review consideration was being given to an amendment of the order to exempt all family law proceedings from the payment of court fees. This would bring the fees in relation to family law cases in the Supreme and High Courts into line with those payable in the Circuit Court. In the context of that review, consideration will be given to the question of whether an exemption provision can be introduced for the Supreme and High Courts.</P>

      <Quest>the reason for the undue delay in the processing of applications under the equal opportunities child-care programme, 2000-06.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no undue delay in the processing of applications under the equal opportunities child care programme.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, child care has been highlighted as a priority for investment in the national development plan with £250 million being allocated under my Department's equal opportunities child care programme, 2000 to 2006, to support the provision of child care in the voluntary, community and private sectors over the next seven years. This represents the most significant investment in child care by any Government in the history of the State and supports measures which will have a social inclusion and equal opportunities focus.</P>
      <P>In April last, I launched a number of child care measures which will be supported under my Department's equal opportunities child care programme, 2000 to 2006, including capital grants for community based groups and not-for-profit organisations for the establishment, renovation or upgrading of child care facilities;</P>
      <P>staffing grants to support staffing costs for community based child care facilities;</P>
      <P>capital grants for self-employed child care providers catering for not more than 20 children at any one time, to build, renovate or upgrade child care facilities.</P>
      <P>Over 4,400 application forms have been requested from my Department from community based groups, private child care providers and other interested parties. A total of 304 completed application forms have been received for assessment and appraisal. In addition, over 2,000 copies of the booklet, Childcare Funding in Ireland, have been distributed to interested parties.</P>
      <P>In the short period since April, I have already allocated funding with a total value of over £8.34 million to 94 child care providers nationwide. This funding will support over 1,745 current child care places, lead to the establishment of over 1,200 additional child care places and support hundreds of child care staffing positions. I hope to be in a position to make further allocations of funding within the next week.</P>
      <P>We are actively encouraging applicants to complete their application forms and to return them to my Department for prompt processing. There is no closing date for receipt of completed applications for child care grant funding which will further encourage more applications under the scheme.</P>

      <Quest>if the Government intends to review its decision on the pensionability of certain unsocial hours allowances; if the Government is prepared to extend to members of An Garda Síochána who retired before 1 January 1993 the increased pension provision which subsequent retirees received; and if he will make a statement on the matter in view of the fact that it applies to approximately 1,700 former gardaí who retired prior to 1 January 1993.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>Following prolonged discussions at the Garda Conciliation Council, agreement was reached in March 1994, which provided, <i>inter alia,</i> for the pensionability of unsocial hours allowances for members of the force who retired after 1 January 1993. The agreement was reached under the terms of the local bargaining clause &ndash; clause 3 &ndash; of the agreement on pay and conditions which formed part of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress. The agreement does not allow for retrospection.</P>
      <P>In November 1997, the Government decided that public servants who retired before the commencement dates of restructuring pay deals under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work should benefit from those pay deals on a parity basis subject to a minimum adjustment of 3% in their pensions &ndash; or 2% in the case of those pensioners who have already received an advance payment of 1%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has considered the issue of pension increases for public servants on several occasions since coming into office and, in order <Col N="661" /> to help in its deliberations, referred the matter to the Commission on Public Service Pensions.</P>
    <P>The report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions is expected to be published shortly. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness states that following Government consideration of the report, a working group of the public service unions, relevant Departments and other appropriate parties will be established to advise on the implementation of the relevant Government decision with a view to introducing, as quickly as possible, any proposed changes in public service pension arrangements.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that from 1 January 2000 to 31 August 2000, the number of crimes committed in the vicinity of the Christchurch area decreased in comparison to the corresponding period for 1999. I am also informed that detection rates also showed an increase over this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Christchurch area attracts a lot of tourists and, particularly because of the large number of visitors, the Garda is very conscious to ensure that there is efficient and effective policing of the area. I am informed that the Garda has in place a tourist crime strategy whereby both uniform and plain clothes members <Col N="662" /> constantly patrol the area and target known offenders. I understand that these patrols are assisted by specialised units as the need arises, including the divisional crime task force, the special resource units and the drug units. In addition, patrols by the Garda mounted unit and the Garda dog unit are often carried out with a view to ensuring that the Christchurch area is safe for the general public and tourists alike. I am also informed by the Garda authorities that efforts will be maintained to ensure this remains the case.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Garda also has in operation a dedicated tourist victim support service to assist visitors to this country who may have suffered as a result of criminal actions. This service is located at DMA Garda Headquarters, Harcourt Square.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be interested to know that, with regard to the recent assault on a tourist from New Zealand at Christchurch, I am informed that three persons have subsequently been charged arising from this incident.</P>

Ratification of The Hague Convention on the taking of evidence, and other relevant international instruments, will be considered in the context of such legislation. The development of that legislation is subject to the disposal of other priorities.</P>
      <P>The Vienna action plan of 3 December 1998, on how best to implement the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam establishing an area of freedom, security and justice, provides for measures to improve and simplify co-operation between courts in the taking of evidence to be adopted within five years of the entry into force of the treaty. Any instrument adopted by the member states in this area, subject to Ireland opting in to its adoption under Protocol 4 of the treaty, will also inform domestic legislation in this area.</P>

      <P>The question of ratification by the State of the convention in question is under consideration. I previously indicated to the House in the course of debate on the Bill which led to the Children Act, 1997 that the Bill contained certain provisions which would facilitate ratification of the convention. The Act is now operational apart from two important sections. These are sections 26, social reports in the District Court, and 28, appointment of guardian <i>ad litem</i> for a child and provision for separate representation of a child. Those two sections, which have some bearing on membership of the convention, have financial and staffing implications for the probation and welfare service and health boards. The implications are being addressed in the context of current overall reviews of delivery of services in these areas and a decision on membership of the convention will be announced in due course.</P>

    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that signature by Ireland of an international agreement is a matter for decision by Government. There are other international agreements which have not been signed by Ireland and in respect of which signature has not been proposed or remains under consideration. Many of these agreements are long standing and vary in their potential application to and interest for the State. Should the Deputy be concerned to seek the position in relation to any particular international agreement, I shall be glad to furnish him with any available information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is as follows.</P>
      <P>At its meeting of 23 May 2000, the Government approved the recommendations of the interdepartmental group on the review of the Gaming and Lotteries Acts, 1956 to 1986. One of the group's recommendations is for the establishment of a statutory based gaming and lotteries authority with direct responsibility for the overall regulation of gaming and lotteries in Ireland.</P>
      <P>A consultative group on male-female wage differentials will be established as provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. This committee will consider the recommendations of a forthcoming ESRI report on male-female wage differentials, including the case for a sectoral analysis in both the public and private sectors and will develop proposals for action or actions to address issues identified in the report for consideration by Government. It is not intended to establish this committee on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>A working group will be established in 2001 to conduct a review of the Parental Leave Act, 1998. The working group will comprise relevant Departments and agencies and the social partners. It is not intended to establish this committee on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>The Refugee Appeals Tribunal will be established shortly under section 15 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended. The tribunal will be independent in the performance of its functions. The tribunal will hear appeals from applicants for refugee status whose initial application has been turned down by the Refugee Applications Commissioner, in accordance with the provisions set out in the Act.</P>
      <P>The Refugee Act, 1996 provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for the establishment of a Refugee Advisory Board, consisting of a chairperson and 14 ordinary members.</P>
      <P>The Government on 28 March 2000, approved the establishment of a statutory agency to be called the Reception and Integration Agency under the aegis of my Department. On 18 April 2000, the Government approved my proposal for the establishment of an interim board for the agency which will operate on a non-statutory basis pending the enactment of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Human Rights Commission Act, 2000 pro<Col N="689" /> vides for the establishment of an independent Human Rights Commission. The Government has appointed Mr. Justice Donal Barrington as president of the commission and a selection committee under the chairmanship of Dr. T. K. Whitaker has been asked to draw up a list of candidates for consideration for appointment by the Government as ordinary members of the commission.</P>
    <P>Legislation is currently being prepared to establish a statutory prisons board. Pending the enactment of the legislation, a prisons authority interim board was established with effect from 26 April 1999.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill which is currently being drafted will, <i>inter alia,</i> provide for the establishment of a new mental care review body which will review the cases of persons detained after verdicts of not guilty by reason of insanity or findings of unfitness to plead.</P>
    <P>It is intended to establish a non-statutory commission on liquor licensing in the near future. The commission will be charged with the task of examining the operation of the State's liquor licensing laws.</P>
    <P>It is intended to establish county child care committees. The establishment of the committees is being facilitated by the health boards. Each committee will become a limited company and will operate within guidelines developed by the National Co-ordinating Child Care Committee chaired by my Department. It is not intended to establish the committees on a statutory basis.</P>

      <P>The advisory committee that was established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate applications for Garda CCTV systems has, to date, received in excess of 40 applications &ndash; including one from Waterford &ndash; for CCTV systems, as aids to policing. The application from Waterford is currently under consideration &ndash; as indeed are applications from other cities and towns. Delays have been encountered in progressing various CCTV projects while the demand from various communities for CCTV systems has been very significant. A shortage of technicians in the telecommunications section of An Garda Síochána has impacted on the progress in implementing CCTV systems. Notwithstanding this, it also became evident that the existing approach to CCTV could not cope with the demand and a review of all aspects of CCTV was required. I therefore decided to initiate a review of CCTV and asked the Garda Commissioner to look at this whole area. The review is now complete and I expect to make a statement on CCTV in the near future.</P>

      <P>While naturally I am concerned with any under-reporting of crime, there is no evidence that the level of under-reporting of crime is greater now than before. As I have indicated before, my Department is considering the implications of results of the Central Statistics Office survey of crime and victimisation from 1998. In terms of international comparisons for surveys of this type, Ireland compares favourably with similar countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there can be a multiplicity of factors behind decisions not to report specific crimes it is <Col N="691" /> in the best interest of each individual who is the victim of a crime to report the matter to the Garda and I would urge that they do so.</P>

      <P>I have spoken in the House on many occasions on the subject of missing persons. As I have indicated before, the deployment of Garda resources and the investigative methods used in missing persons cases are matters for the Garda Commissioner. I am informed by the Garda authorities that An Garda Síochána do all in their power to locate all missing persons. On an international level, the gardaí liaise with Interpol and non-Governmental organisations where there is a world-wide network to trace missing persons.</P>
      <P>I am further informed that, at present, An Garda Síochána do have a website which gives details of certain missing persons cases but I understand that relatives must first grant permission to An Garda Síochána to place the details of the missing relative on the website. The details are placed on the website by the Garda Press Office, Garda Headquarters, Phoenix Park, at www.Garda.ie. An Garda Síochána encourage relatives to avail of this facility, but understandably they do not always wish to avail of this facility and their wishes must be respected.</P>
      <P>As my Department does not take part in investigations I do not think it appropriate that it should develop a similar website. Furthermore, in cases where family members lose contact with each other and where, for example, people are not missing in suspicious circumstances it would not be appropriate for my Department to become involved.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that another option for relatives is the website set up by Father Aquinas Duffy offering the same facility to relatives of missing persons, his address is located at www.missing.ws. The Deputy may be interested to know that there are also other organisations which assist people to trace missing relatives such as the Salvation Army.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Courts Service was established by me on 9 November 1999. Under the provisions of the Courts Service Act, 1998, the Courts Service is independent in the exercise of its functions as defined in the Act, which includes the management of the courts. Consequently I no longer have any function in relation to the deployment of courts staff. I have, however, brought the Deputy's concerns in this matter to the attention of the chief executive officer of the Courts Service.</P>
      <P>The appointment of places to be District Probate Registries is a matter for me as Minister by virtue of section 129 of the Succession Act, 1965 (No. 27 of 1965). I have no plans for any changes in this regard at the moment.</P>
      <P>Individual grants of probate are a matter for the High Court. Consequently it would be inappropriate for me, as Minister, to comment on any individual case.</P>

I am, however, informed that the current allocation of cars &ndash; per Garda district &ndash; in the Dublin Metropolitan Area (DMA) driven by uniformed members is as follows:</P>

      <P>I am, of course, aware that there have been calls for a public inquiry into what happened in Abbeylara, but I have always taken the view that it would be premature, in the absence of a full knowledge of all the circumstances, to conclude that there are grounds for such an inquiry. We should first, I believe, examine the facts established by the Garda investigation before we form conclusions as to what further action might be needed.</P>
      <P>In this context, the Deputy will be aware that I have agreed that the findings of the Garda inquiry should be referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights for its consideration. I will very shortly lay the necessary motions before both Houses.</P>
      <P>It is also worth recalling that the inquest into the death of the person in question is due to resume shortly and that this constitutes an important element in the process of investigation into what happened at Abbeylara.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Sex Offenders Bill, 2000, provides for a package of measures aimed at protecting the public, in particular children, from sexual abuse or attack. The main provision of the Bill will be the creation of a sex offenders register, or tracking system as it is also known. The Bill has passed Second Stage in the Dáil and I hope that the remaining stages will be passed to allow for the register to come into operation before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The registration or notification obligation will cover all those who, on or after commencement of the Act, are convicted or found guilty but insane of a sexual offence specified in the Schedule to the Bill and those who are, on commencement, still in contact with the criminal justice system, whether awaiting sentence, in prison, subject to supervision, serving a community service order or detained in the Central Mental Hospital. Further retrospection would be impossible without compromising the accuracy of the records; it would simply not be possible to trace all those offenders no longer in contact with the criminal justice system. However, the issue of retrospectivity is dealt with in the Bill in the following way. If such an offender were to act in such a way as to pose a risk of serious harm to the public, the gardaí could apply to the court under Part III of the Bill for a sex offender order and the making of such an order, apart from the other consequences of the order, would automatically make the person liable to the notification requirement.</P>
      <P>The Bill's enactment will ensure that An Garda Síochána will have up-to-date information on the whereabouts of convicted sex offenders. This in itself should act as a deterrent to reoffending and so contribute towards their rehabilitation. In addition, the availability of up to date data will be of particular benefit to the gardaí in the investigation and prevention of sexual crimes.</P>

      <P>The procedure for replying to correspondence from Members of the Oireachtas in my Department starts with the receipt of all such correspondence in my office. It is acknowledged by that office and referred for a substantive reply to the relevant area of my Department. That reply is submitted to and issued by my office. Under my Department's customer service action plan, the Department is committed to working towards issuing a reply within 20 working days where possible. In some cases, it is not possible to comply with this guideline where, for example, substantial research into or examination of issues is required.</P>
      <P>In order to improve and assist in the processing of such correspondence the Department has put in place an electronic correspondence tracking system. This system has been improved and updated significantly over the last two years. The operation of this system is kept under continuous review and further changes and enhancements will continue to be made in line with requirements as they arise.</P>
      <P>Dealing with correspondence from Members of the Oireachtas is an important work requirement for members of staff in the Department as is dealing with requests under the Freedom of Information Act. The degree of involvement of individual staff members in such work will depend on the divisional work area they are assigned to and the nature and volume of such correspondence and requests received. In light of this, it is not feasible to indicate to the Deputy the numbers of staff of my Department dealing with such correspondence.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Department will continue to keep under review its systems and procedures for dealing with correspondence from Members of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The application for citizenship by way of post nuptial declaration referred to by the Deputy was received in my Department in September 2000 and is currently being processed.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the person referred to applied for a certificate of naturalisation in April 1997. The application was processed based on the person's individual circumstances and I decided not to grant a certificate of naturalisation at that time. A fresh application was received in this office on 2 June 1999 and this case is being processed.</P>
      <P>Due to the various procedures involved in processing an application for a certificate of naturalisation in respect of a person of full age, together with the very high number of applications being received, the average processing time is approximately two and a half years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant extra resources are currently being <Col N="712" /> allocated by me to the immigration and citizenship division of my Department with a view to reducing the delays in processing naturalisation applications, which will in time impact considerably on the present delays.</P>
    <P>As soon as full consideration has been given to this application, I will advise both the applicant and the Deputy of my decision.</P>

    <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that they are satisfied that the personnel strength in the Waterford-Kilkenny division is adequate to meet the present policing requirements of the area.</P>
    <P>I am further informed that the situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available, the needs of the Waterford-Kilkenny division will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of each Garda division in the country.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 925 and 934 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that each chief superintendent in the Dublin Metropolitan region is undertaking a series of initiatives under the umbrella name &ldquo;Operation Oíche&rdquo;. These initiatives tackle street crime, drunkenness and public order problems generally. The locations of recurring incidents are receiving particular attention, with an emphasis on high visibility patrolling. Special resource units and unmarked crime task force units are also used to the full. I am also informed by the Garda Commissioner that the gardaí have extended &ldquo;Operation Oíche&rdquo;, to tackle violence and public disorder in the streets of large towns and cities throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I also understand that &ldquo;Pinch Point&rdquo; locations in the city have been selected for intensive patrolling involving use of the Garda mounted unit, Garda drug unit and garda air support unit. Elsewhere, public order units are deployed to augment regular resources at appropriate times and locations.</P>
      <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that they are fully committed to participation in the Garda youth diversion projects, which I am in the process of greatly expanding in accordance with the National Development Plan 2000-2006. As the Deputy is no doubt aware, these projects are designed to challenge the criminal and anti-social attitudes of the young people engaged in such behaviour. I also understand that close liaison is maintained with local authorities in relation to estate management to ensure a combined response to anti social behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the proactive policing measures, An Garda Síochána are engaged in a programme of consultation with publicans, hoteliers, off-licenses, night club owners etc. with a view to <Col N="714" /> ensuring full legislative compliance with the Intoxicating Liquor Acts, Licensing (Combating of Drugs) Act, and other relevant legislation.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Garda authorities for a report on the statistics the Deputy requested and I will write to her when it comes to hand.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 927, 931 and 932 together.</P>
      <P>The advisory committee that was established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate applications for Garda CCTV systems has, to date, received in excess of 40 applications or expressions of interest from cities and towns for CCTV systems, as aids to policing. These include Ballyfermot, Ballymun, Blanchardstown, Clondalkin, Dublin (South Central), Dún Laoghaire, Finglas and Tallaght. It is too early at this stage to say precisely how much all of these projects &ndash; if approved &ndash; would cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cork and Dublin (South Central) CCTV projects are currently being undertaken. The <Col N="715" /> budget for 2000 is £700,000. Recently the CCTV system in the O'Connell Street and adjoining areas was increased from 38 to 42 cameras and the CCTV system in Pearse Street &ndash; Dublin (South Central) is currently being increased from nine to 24 cameras.</P>
    <P>I have also been informed by the Garda authorities that each chief superintendent in the Dublin metropolitan area is maintaining ongoing initiatives under the umbrella &ldquo;Operation Oíche&rdquo; tackling street crime, drunkenness and public order problems generally. Locations of recurring incidents are receiving particular focus with emphasis on high visibility patrolling. Special resource units and unmarked crime task force units are also utilised to the full.</P>

Elsewhere, public order units are deployed to augment regular resources at appropriate times and locations.</P>
    <P>In addition to the proactive policing measures a specific programme of consultation is on-going with publicans, hoteliers, off-licences, night-clubs owners etc., with a view to ensuring full legislative compliance with the Intoxicating Liquor Acts, Licensing (Combating of Drugs) Act, and other relevant legislation.</P>
    <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that they are fully committed to participation in the Garda youth crime prevention and diversion projects which are being greatly expanded in accordance with the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Closer liaison is being maintained with local authorities in regard to estate management to ensure a combined response to anti-social behaviour.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of street patrols in the Dublin area have not been cut back. The overall levels of policing throughout the region have been maintained. Resources are deployed at all times with greatest concentration in problem areas. In cases where problem areas are identified the levels of patrols are increased to support initiatives taken to tackle the specific problem. In these cases special beat patrols have been introduced to augment normal patrols.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to my Department's Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme, 2000 to 2006.  Child Care was identified as a priority area for investment in the National Development Plan, 2000 to 2006 which provides £250 million to my Department's equal opportunities child care programme. The funding is being invested in the following child care measures: capital grants to community groups and not-for-profit organisations for building, renovating and upgrading child care facilities; staffing grants for the community based child care services; capital grants for self-employed child care providers catering for not more than 20 children at any one time; grants towards the development of local childcare networks; support for local training models to assist in the enhancement of quality childcare provision; supports to enhance the development of the national voluntary child care organisations and support for innovative projects identified over the course of the national development plan.</P>
      <P>On 28 April 2000 I launched the capital and staffing grant measures. Since then my Department has received 290 applications for funding.

      <P>My Department provides funding to support the development of child care under the Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme. The Programme was developed in 1998 and was allocated £6 million for the two year period 1998 and 1999 which included the following supports for child care places: capital infrastructure &ndash; capital grants to 106 community based child care projects. Total amount approved was £2,575,200; community support initiative &ndash; grants towards the cost of two senior child care workers in each of 25 community based flagship <Col N="719" /> child care projects. Total amount approved was £2,000,000. This is paid over two years; employer demonstration initiative &ndash; funding for employer involvement in the development of eight projects, comprising 21 employers. Total amount approved was £842,000.</P>
      <P>The balance of the funding was expended on the development of the National Child Care Census, research into child care training and administration costs.</P>
      <P>In June 1999 my Department secured a further £5 million from the European Social Fund for training and development purposes. The funding supported the training and development of personnel in projects which had secured capital and staffing grants, local partnerships and community groups. In addition grants were provided to six national voluntary child care organisations to support development of their services to their membership base.</P>
      <P>More recently, my Department's Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme has been allocated £250 million under the National Development Plan, 2000 to 2006 which will be invested in the following child care measures: capital grants to community groups and not-for-profit organisations for building, renovating and upgrading child care facilities; staffing grants for the community based child care services; capital grants for self-employed child care providers catering for not more than 20 children at any one time; grants towards the development of local child care networks; support for local training models to assist in the enhancement of quality child care provision; supports to enhance the development of the national voluntary child care organisations; and support for innovative projects identified over the course of the national development plan.</P>
      <P>Since I launched the funding measures on 28 April 2000 my Department has received 304 applications for funding. I have arranged for the monthly appraisal of applications during this year to ensure that they are processed as quickly as is practical. To date I have approved 94 applications to the value of £8.34 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>A Garda CCTV system &ndash; comprising 24 cameras &ndash; and providing extensive coverage of the main thoroughfares and some adjoining streets in the town centre has been in operation in Tralee since September 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department invited tenders in November 1998 for the provision of a CCTV operator service for the monitoring of Garda Síochána closed circuit television systems used as an aid to policing in each of the following locations: O'Connell <Col N="725" /> Street Garda office, Pearse Street Garda Station, Dublin and Tralee Garda Station in County Kerry. The proposed service entailed the provision of personnel on a 24 hour/7 day week basis to monitor and control all town/city centre cameras. The invitation to tender also made it clear that any contract would be for a trial period only and, in addition, that there was no guarantee that any tender would be selected at all.</P>
    <P>The closing date for the receipt of tenders was 26 January 1999. Tenders for monitoring of the CCTV system in Tralee which were received prior to the closing date were examined by a Garda evaluation committee and subsequently by officials in my Department. Tenderers who passed the preliminary examination of the tenders were invited to make presentations to the evaluation committee. Those who did not pass the preliminary examination were written to by the secretary to the evaluation committee.</P>
    <P>The prices quoted for monitoring were higher than anticipated and it was finally decided, on the basis of existing tenders, that no contract should be awarded at that stage for the provision of personnel on an agency basis to monitor Garda CCTV systems. Companies who were invited to make presentations to the Garda evaluation committee were notified of this decision in June 2000.</P>
    <P>In arriving at the decision not to award any contract it was necessary to look at this issue on a national basis. The countrywide application of the costings quoted for civilian monitors was such that it would have significant Exchequer implications. I have, therefore, asked the Garda authorities to review the policy of dedicated monitoring of CCTV cameras. While the tender process was ongoing a number of more global issues, demand for Garda CCTV systems, shortage of Garda technicians to carry out CCTV work and the financial implications of installing additional systems, also arose in the context of a review of CCTV in general.</P>

The conditions are that the applicant is of full age; is of good character; has had a period of one year's continuous residence in the State immediately before the date of the <Col N="726" /> application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, has had a total residence in the State amounting to four years; intends in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation; and has made, either before a Justice of the District Court in open court or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, this URBAN programme provided funding to address in an integrated way, a range of problems associated with socio-economic exclusion within deprived sections of urban areas. As with all EU co-funded programmes, it encompassed very specific timeframes in terms of project approval and drawdown of funding. More importantly, because of the time-specific nature of URBAN, the steering groups that operated the programme were required to ensure that sustainability or mainstreaming capability be vital elements in their project selection criteria.</P>
      <P>In relation to the after school projects piloted by South Dublin URBAN Initiative Limited, I understand that two of the projects &ndash; Neilstown/Deanrath after school project and the Clondalkin-Tallaght after school project for Traveller Children &ndash; have now been approved for future funding by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.

      <P>Local drugs task forces have been set up in 14 areas, the vast majority in the Dublin area, where heroin abuse is the primary concern. The task forces bring together key State agencies to work with local elected representatives and community and voluntary groups in the target areas in developing appropriate responses to the local drug problem.</P>
      <P>The task forces prepared action plans in 1997 and the Government approved £10 million funding, over and above that already available to State agencies, to support the implementation of the measures set out in these plans. Over 200 projects were supported to deliver a range of interventions under the themes of prevention, education, treatment, rehabilitation and supply reduction.</P>
      <P>All of the projects are to be independently evaluated with a view to mainstreaming those which are considered to be achieving their aims and objectives. In this context, mainstreaming means that the projects will continue to be funded through a relevant State agency, in line with agreed procedures which protect their ethos. Decisions on mainstreaming are due before year end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has now allocated a further £15 million to enable the task forces to prepare new updated plans. To date, three such plans have been submitted to the National Drugs Strategy Team for assessment and it is anticipated that <Col N="728" /> the remainder will be submitted in the current year.</P>
    <P>As part of the Government's National Drugs Strategy, the young people's facilities and services fund was established in 1998 to assist in the development of preventative strategies/initiatives in a targeted manner through the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The objective of the fund is to attract young people at risk in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse.</P>
    <P>The main focus of the fund has been on the local drugs task force areas and funding of over £26 million has now been approved to support over 295 projects contained in plans emanating from these areas.</P>

      <P>The National Advisory Committee on Drugs whose purpose is to advise the Government in relation to the prevalence, prevention, treatment and consequences of problem drug use in Ireland, based on its analysis and interpretation of research findings and information available to it, was set up earlier this year. The committee was set up initially on a non-statutory basis but consideration will be given at a later stage to its long-term status.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Marketing Partnership was established in April 2000, with the involvement of representatives of the tourist industry and Bord Fáilte, working together to develop complimentary strategies and plans for the totality of their combined annual tourism marketing expenditure. There are no proposals to give the TMP a statutory basis.</P>

      <P>All incoming post to my office, including correspondence from Members of the Oireachtas, is examined and prioritised by my private secretary, who is also responsible for bringing the correspondence to my attention.</P>
      <P>All correspondence is entered on a computer database which assigns a reference number to each item, notes the relevant official and division to deal with it and the date by which a reply should be forwarded to my office. Once details have been entered onto the database an acknowledgement of receipt can be generated and issued. This database also tracks correspondence for which a reply is overdue.</P>
      <P>The full complement of staff in my private office, a private secretary, two executive officers and two clerical officers, deal with correspondence as part of their duties. In addition each line division in my Department deals with correspondence relevant to the division as part of its ongoing work. It is not possible therefore, to say exactly how many staff are involved.</P>
      <P>The implementation of Freedom of Information legislation in my Department did not result in any reduction in the numbers of staff dealing with correspondence from Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The quality customer service action plan for my Department includes, among its aims, endeavouring to respond to written correspondence within 20 working days of receipt. Reports from the central monitoring system for correspondence on progress towards this aim are regularly examined by my Department's senior management team.</P>
      <P>I consider that responding to requests from Members is an integral part of the democratic system and I am happy that my Department has a good track record in this regard which it is consistently aiming to improve.</P>

      <P>Earlier this year the Government appointed a development company, Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited, which has responsibility for taking the Sports Campus Ireland project through the design and construction stages.</P>
      <P>Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited estimate the cost of the development of the total campus and stadium project to be in the region of £550 million. This covers the cost of an 80,000 seat stadium, where the cost remains at £281 million as outlined in the feasibility study 'A Stadium for the New Century', less a private contribution of £50 million; a series of general sports use facilities including an aquatic and leisure centre, an indoor arena, a multipurpose indoor and outdoor training halls and pitches, a sports science-sports medicine centre and headquarters for sports organisations including the community games and a visitor-information centre; some specific use facilities for individual sports to be decided on the advice of the Irish Sports Council; the cost of the infrastructure on the Abbotstown site; and the operating costs of CSID, where the cost of the executive services team, which came on board on 1 September to provide a range of services including concept development, business planning, communications and public relations, management and corporate governance, financial services and control and information technology, will be capped at 1.8% of the development cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CSID intends to undertake the development of the sports facilities on a design-build-finance-operate and maintain basis. This will in effect involve a series of public private partnerships with financial contributions from the private sector based on the returns they estimate for the facilities. CSID will also seek proposals for fully <Col N="736" /> private sector funded facilities on the Abbotstown site. CSID intends to work closely with the local community organisations and take on board community projects in developing the site.</P>
    <P>Of the total cost of £550 million, CSID estimates the return related and fully funded private sector elements to be in the region of £150 million taking account of the £50 million private sector donation. The remaining public sector cost is estimated by CSID to be in the region of £350 million.</P>
    <P>The company is planning to have the aquatic and leisure centre at the Sports Campus Ireland site completed in time for the Special Olympics in 2003.</P>
    <P>Following a publicly advertised competition and after an initial assessment by CSID and the Office of Public Works, five consortia from Ireland and abroad have been invited to make outline bids by 9 October. It is intended that the heads of agreement will have been reached with a developer for the aquatic and leisure centre by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>CSID will, between now and the end of the year, and using the same procedures as for the aquatic and leisure centre, put out to tender the other facilities for Sports Campus Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the past few days CSID has published advertisements outlining the terms of a competition to develop an architectural and environmental framework plan for the entire site. The site is 500 acres and the winning framework plan will suggest a logical and coherent approach to accommodating Sports Campus Ireland, a major parkland amenity to serve the community and general public, a major science-educational project, and complimentary commercial and leisure projects, with respect to the built and natural heritage that exists at Abbotstown.</P>

      <P>My Department is aware of the details of this case. Enrolment in second level schools is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of individual schools. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking second level places in an area. This may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
      <P>The National Educational Psychological Service is available to all post-primary schools recognised by my Department. NEPS can advise on the management of any difficulties that pupils might experience and which may present problems in a school setting. Where appropriate it can also advise on any educational supports which might be required to ensure that a pupil's time in school is as productive and positive as possible.</P>
      <P>In order to progress this case further my Department has issued a questionnaire to the child's mother to help identify his educational needs and provide my Department with her written permission to contact schools and the NEPS on behalf of her child. My Department's inspectorate is also involved in this case. Every effort will be made to find a suitable school placement.</P>

      <P>Teachers who have been employed for years on a substitute basis only would generally be unqualified teachers. Furthermore, employment as a substitute will, of its nature, be for intermittent periods during which, for example, the teacher who is being replaced is on sick leave.</P>
      <P>Membership of the teachers' superannuation schemes is open to teachers who are in permanent or quasi-permanent employment and who are fully-qualified. A teacher who is timetabled for the full duration of the school year in any one school for class contact time of at least nine hours per week in the case of a post-primary school or two days per week in the case of a primary school is regarded as being in quasi-permanent employment.</P>
      <P>Exceptional arrangements have been made for the admission of a small number of unqualified teachers in eligible part-time posts to membership of the teachers' superannuation schemes. The exception was made on the grounds that the teachers in question have been in part-time employment of a quasi-permanent nature for many years and that the quasi-permanent employment commenced more than one year prior to the introduction of the eligible part-time scheme in 1988.</P>
      <P>Apart from this exception, which applies to a very small and reducing group of teachers, there are no plans at present for the admission of unqualified teachers to membership of the superannuation schemes. The position of teachers who are not in quasi-permanent employment will, of course, be reviewed in the light of the provisions of the Part-Time Workers Bill when that Bill, which is being introduced by my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Harney, is enacted. That review will not affect the position of unqualified teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The superannuation schemes make provision for the purchase for pensions purposes, once a teacher has been admitted to membership of the <Col N="740" /> schemes, of periods of previous employment in a substitute or part-time capacity.</P>

      <P>The higher education grants scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. An approved institution is defined to mean a university, university college or other institution of higher education in so far as it provides a course or courses of not less than two years duration, being a course or courses which the Minister for Education and Science approves for the time being for the purposes of the Acts.</P>
      <P>Each year, the higher education grants scheme specifies a list of approved institutions for the purposes of the scheme. The approved institutions mainly comprise publicly funded third level institutions. Any extension to the scope of the grants scheme to include private colleges can be considered only in the light of available resources and in the context of competing demands within the education sector.</P>
      <P>While the Deputy has not provided details of the course or the private dance college in question, I would point out that the Finance Act, 1995, provides for tax relief on tuition fees paid by students who are attending certain private third level colleges. Such students or their parents, as appropriate, can avail of tax relief, at the standard rate, on tuition fees paid in respect of full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration in such colleges, provided that both the college and the course satisfy the prescribed codes of standards and are approved by the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
      <P>The Finance Act, 1996, provides for tax relief, at the standard rate, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved part-time undergraduate courses in approved private colleges. In addition, the Finance Act, 2000, provides tax relief for fees paid in respect of approved postgraduate courses, including courses in approved private third level colleges.</P>

      <P>It would be a breach of my Department's policy for post-primary schools involved in the free second level education scheme to demand a registration or re-registration fee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Voluntary contributions by parents or charges for optional extras over and above what is provided for in the general school programme are permissible provided that it is made absolutely clear to parents that there is no question of compulsion to pay and that, in making a contribution, they are doing so of their own volition. The manner in which such voluntary contributions are <Col N="744" /> sought and collected is a matter for school principals and managements.</P>
    <P>No guidelines have been issued to schools specifically relating to charges for re-enrolment. My Department has not had formal discussions with the National Parents Council in relation to these matters.</P>

      <P>With regard to the Education Act 1998, two commencement orders have been made bringing into effect 51 sections of the Education Act. Seven sections remain to be commenced at this time. These deal with patrons of schools, section 8, determination of criteria for the recognition of schools, section 10, procedures for withdrawal of recognition, section 11, annual funding of schools, section 12, the keeping of accounts and records by schools, section 18, the procedure for appeals by parents and students against certain decisions of schools to the Secretary General of my Department, section 29, and the establishment of an educational disadvantage committee, section 32. These sections cannot be commenced until certain preparatory work for their implementation is completed. This work is now at an advanced stage. All sections of the Act will come into operation before the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999, was enacted in July 1999. The main objects of the Act are: to establish and develop standards of knowledge, skill or competence; to promote the quality of further and higher education and training; provide a system for co-ordinating and comparing education and training awards and promote and maintain procedures for access, transfer and progression. Three new bodies will also be established under the Act: the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland and <Col N="749" /> two awarding bodies, the Further Education and Training Awards Council and the Higher Education and Training Awards Council.</P>
    <P>As a first step in the implementation of the Act, the setting up of the designate National Qualifications Authority of Ireland was announced earlier this year. The new authority is being set up on an interim basis pending its establishment on a statutory basis as provided for in the Act. The task of the designate authority will be to commence work on the establishment of a national framework of qualifications and to advise on and support the transition to the new certification system as provided for in the Act.</P>
    <P>The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, which was enacted in July of this year, provides a statutory framework to deal with the problems of school non-attendance, early school leaving and poor educational attainment among students. The Act also provides for a procedure for registration of children receiving education outside the recognised school system. It also provides for the establishment of a national educational welfare board and a nationwide education welfare service.</P>
    <P>As a first step in the implementation of the Act, I have decided to establish a designate board on a non-statutory basis for an interim period to engage in initial planning and preparatory work. Following this interim period, the board will be put on a statutory footing and the various provisions of the Act will be commenced as appropriate letters seeking nominations to this interim board were issued by my Department in early September to the various parties mentioned in the Schedule of the Act. I will make appointments to the board as soon as I receive all these nominations. It is envisaged that the membership of the interim board will, as far as possible, mirror that of the statutory board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>This year the concept of modification of the national standard assessment was introduced in order to accommodate the requirements of special needs students. This was a significant advance in the inclusiveness of our examination system. In essence it allowed us to depart from a situation where a special needs student could be penalised by being required to undergo assessment in an element of an examination which was beyond his or her physical capacity. For example, the aural component of a language examination is clearly problematical for a deaf candidate and the new special arrangements means that exemption from that component is possible in the case of such students.</P>
      <P>Where this greater flexibility and responsiveness means that an element of the examination is not assessed, as with all matters relating to the certificate examinations, this must occur openly and transparently. In the present year the provisional results issued to students were annotated in accordance with these principles.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that neither the leaving nor junior certificate results contained any reference to a candidate's disability. These provisional results did do no more than provide factual information on the actual assessment.</P>
      <P>Decisions in relation to special arrangements are taken having regard to the circumstances of each individual case. My Department takes these decisions in the first instance within a published framework of principles. I should stress that I have also ensured the availability of an independent appeal forum where a student is unhappy with any aspect of my Department's decision.</P>

      <P>A working group was set up in autumn 1997 to examine the potential problems caused by the weight of heavy school bags. The terms of reference of the working group were to consider the issue of heavy school bags and in particular the extent of the problem, the factors which contribute to the problem and possible implications of the problem, particularly for the health of pupils. The group was also asked to formulate proposals to alleviate problems associated with <Col N="756" /> the weight of schoolbags. The group presented its report in July 1998. Its report outlined a number of recommendations that have implications, not only for my Department, but also for schools, parents and publishers.</P>
      <P>My Department, at primary and post-primary levels, initiated an awareness raising campaign by disseminating the report, with an accompanying circular, to all primary and post-primary schools. Information leaflets and posters were distributed to all schools, highlighting the potential health hazard of heavy schoolbags and outlining a range of local measures that could be adopted in order to alleviate the problem.</P>
      <P>The report recommended that schools create an awareness of the potential problem of heavy schoolbags throughout their school community and assess the problem within their own schools. Schools should give consideration to this issue when formulating their homework and timetabling policies. The report also recommended that schools include correct lifting and carrying techniques as part of their health education programmes.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for each individual school to choose those measures that would be most suitable to its individual needs.</P>
      <P>The report also recommended that my Department should examine the feasibility of providing for appropriate storage facilities in future specifications for furniture manufacturers. Accordingly, the building unit of my Department is examining the possibility of incorporating storage facilities in the provision of furniture in the future. Furthermore, as recommended in the report, my Department continues to afford schools the option of book storage in the case of new second level schools.</P>

      <P>I have set the tackling of educational disadvantage as a priority and will be bringing forward proposals for a major initiative to address the needs of pupils who are encountering educational disadvantage in primary schools.</P>
      <P>As a first step in this process, the Educational Research Centre issued a comprehensive questionnaire to all primary schools in April of this year. The analysis by the education centre of the responses from schools is nearing completion. This will allow for an accurate identification of levels of disadvantage in every primary school.</P>
      <P>Based on the levels of need identified, my objective is to introduce a range of significant and specifically targeted interventions, which will ensure that disadvantaged children receive the support they require to enable them to succeed in school. The interventions in question will take the form of extra teacher support or extra funding, or both, depending on the nature and level of need identified.</P>
      <P>I expect to make a further announcement in relation to this matter in the near future.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the recently published Music in Education Report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[19885/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the Music in Education Report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science with great interest.</P>
      <P>In relation to primary education, I am pleased to note the unambiguous support expressed in the report for the aims, objectives, new emphases and overall methodologies of the revised music programme designed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and introduced to schools in the last school year. The phased formal implementation of the revised curriculum in schools is being linked to the delivery of the heavily resourced primary curriculum support programme, PCSP, for schools in co-operation with the Education Centre network. Phasing will not preclude schools from introducing any area of the curriculum, such as music, prior to the provision of in-career development in that area. The training strategy in the case of music, when activated, will be informed by experience gained in supporting the implementation of other areas of the revised curriculum.</P>
      <P>The availability and use of specialist music teaching skills in primary schools is dealt with comprehensively in the teacher guidelines accompanying the revised music programme. The PCSP training phase will make use of highly skilled practitioners who will assist schools in the successful implementation of the programme. In the longer term, this expertise will be added to that already available to schools through education centres, some of which provide ongoing in-career development activity in music and act as an invaluable resource for teachers in a variety of ways, with potential to develop new strategies in the teaching of music.</P>
      <P>My Department's inspectorate will continue to advise and support schools and individual teachers on matters pertaining to curriculum implementation. In addressing the quality of teaching and learning in schools, the process of whole school evaluation will include all aspects of the integrated curriculum in primary schools, while music may be included as a subject for specific evaluation in planning an evaluation of a second level school. School development planning, which is now the focus of substantial support from my Department, affords schools opportunities to plan the structured implementation of the music programme under the guidance of the school leadership and, where possible, to include curriculum development and support as tasks within their in-school management structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note the report's emphasis on the importance of performance and participation, specifically in the area of instrumental music, as part of chil<Col N="762" /> dren's school music activity and the link to the need for appropriate assessment. The curriculum documentation generally stresses the integration of the listening, performing and composing strands of the programme while, in addition to providing very helpful advice on the promotion of pupils' instrumental skills, the teacher guidelines outline the purposes and methodology of assessment within the teaching and learning cycle.</P>
    <P>I have noted in particular the committee's views on matters relating to the design and assessment of second level music syllabi and its concern over examination outcomes. I will undertake to pass those views to the NCCA for consideration in its ongoing programme of syllabus review.</P>
    <P>The joint committee places particular emphasis on a variety of support mechanisms, whether state or privately funded, for school based music education. Primary and second level schools are encouraged to make use of music resources within the school community, such as those identified by the committee, and they welcome the commendable outreach policies of a growing number of arts groups to engage with schools in order to enrich pupils' musical experience. In relation to services provided by local authority arts officers, I will be pleased to explore the potential of such services for schools with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware the staffing of primary schools is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between this Department and the education partners.</P>
      <P>The enrolment at the school in question decreased from 211 pupils on 30 September 1998 to 195 pupils on the 30 September 1999. This latter enrolment warrants the staffing of a principal and six mainstream classroom for the 2000-01 school year. The school also has the services of two posts because of the school's disadvantaged status, two learning support teachers and a home-school liaison teacher. An enrolment of 205 pupils on 30 September 1999 was required in order to retain the seventh mainstream class teacher for the 2000-01 school year.</P>
      <P>The organisation of classes within a school is a matter for the school authorities.</P>
      <P>An official from my Department visited the school recently and reported on the staffing position. I regret that the inspector reported no extenuating circumstances in the school beyond those catered for by the five extra teachers outlined above, which would warrant the appointment of an additional mainstream class teacher for the 2000-2001 school year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The enforcement of school attendance under the existing legislation, the School Attendance Act, 1926, is not arranged on a county basis. Under this Act responsibility for the enforcement of school attendance rests with the school attendance committees in Dublin City, Cork City, Waterford City and the County Borough of Dun Laoghaire/Blackrock, and the Garda for the remainder of the country.</P>
      <P>My Department gathers a range of data annually in its primary school census, including the destination of those who have left the school since the previous year. All census data is presented at a school, rather than an individual pupil, level. Based on 1999/2000 returns submitted by school authorities, some nine pupils in County Kilkenny left education. School principals were unable to give the destination of a further eight pupils.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I share his concern about non-school attendance and early school leaving. It is for this reason that my Department has initiated a programme comprising both legislative measures and special targeted initiatives to combat the problem of non-school attendance and early school leaving.</P>
      <P>The recently enacted Education Welfare Act, 2000, will replace and reform current school attendance legislation. The Act provides for the introduction of a comprehensive school attendance service with responsibility for school attendance being given to a newly established body &ndash; the National Educational Welfare Board. Every school will maintain a school register and will enter details of every child enrolled in the school and their attendance at that school. An educational welfare officer will be assigned to every school for the purposes of the Act. The Act requires schools to draw up school attendance strategies in order to promote regular attendance and to foster an appreciation of learning amongst the students. The strategy will focus on arrangements for the identification of children who are at risk of dropping out of school at an early stage so that appropriate interventions may be put in place. The board will also assist schools in discharging their responsibilities under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the key objectives of the 8-15 year old early school leavers initiative, which was introduced in September 1998, is to test models of response to the problem of early school leaving, with a view to the integration of such models, after structured evaluation, into mainstream policy and practice. The projects strand of this initiative involves 17 specific projects in 14 areas. The initiative was originally introduced for the school years 1998/'99 and 1999-2000. I have decided to extend the existing 17 projects for a <Col N="765" /> further phase, for the period 1 July 2000 until 31 August 2002. Funding of £2.82 million has been allocated to this initiative for the year 2000.</P>
    <P>In June 1999 the stay in school retention initiative at second level was launched. This marks a significant departure from traditional policy in that funding of up to £40,000 per annum is being granted to targeted schools, on the basis of plans which they were helped to design themselves. The purpose of this initiative is to prevent early school leaving and raise senior cycle completion rates. At the end of May 2000 an additional 59 schools were invited to participate in the initiative, including three in County Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>I am currently working on proposals for a major new scheme aimed at addressing educational disadvantage at primary level. This scheme will target those areas with the greatest needs in order to maximise participation and the potential for achievement in education. The supports will involve a mixture of additional teachers and resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The higher education grant schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. Under the terms of these Acts a mature student is defined as a person of not less than 23 years of age on 1 January of the year of entry to their third level course. Under the terms of the higher education grants schemes, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</P>
      <P>As the student to whom the Deputy refers was not 23 on the 1 January 1998, the year in which she commenced her third level education, she cannot be assessed as a mature student.</P>
      <P>When assessing the means of students, other than mature students, the Acts specify that the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not a mature student. In this regard, as my Department understands that she has not already done so, the student in question should submit details of her parental income to Sligo VEC in order that her eligibility for grant assistance may be assessed.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the need to expand the National Educational Psychological Service to the school in question and to all schools in the coun<Col N="770" /> try. In June of this year, the acting director of NEPS sent a letter to the principals of all schools in the country, primary and post-primary, informing them about the proposed expansion of the service. The expansion will involve an additional 50 psychologists before the end of 2000 and 20 of these have already taken up duty. The letter explains how the service will be organised and I refer to sections of this letter:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Service will be organised on a regional basis: NEPS psychologists will be allocated to 10 regions corresponding to the Health Board regions&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Within each region, priorities for expansion will be informed by the results of a survey of each county which NEPS psychologists have undertaken. In examining the data, particular consideration will be given to evidence of disadvantage, the incidence of special needs and the level of access to other psychological services in each area.&rdquo; (Letters and submissions on behalf of particular schools and areas that have been sent to NEPS have been taken into account in this exercise).</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Schools that at present do not have a psychological service from NEPS will be notified that they are receiving one as soon as this is decided.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The needs of Shinrone National School are being taken into consideration in the context of prioritisation of expansion of services in the region.</P>
      <P>Pending the expansion of NEPS in primary schools, all referrals for psychological assessments should be sent to the relevant health board.</P>

      <Quest>the policy and commitment to raising income eligibility levels for third level maintenance fees; if the findings of various reports are not being implemented; the reason this issue has slipped in priority terms since free fees were introduced; and if he will make a one off improvement in the maintenance income limits in order to make these available to more families.</Quest>
      <QRef>[20039/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The statutory framework for the main<Col N="772" /> tenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for means-tested higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education.</P>
      <P>The practice in recent years has been to increase, annually, third level maintenance grants in line with inflation and to increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage. In line with this policy, I announced increases of 5% in the maintenance grant and of 5% in the income limits to qualify for a grant, for the 2000/01 academic year.</P>
      <P>The reckonable income limit for a full maintenance grant under the student support schemes for the 2000/2001 academic year is £20,200. Candidates who do not qualify for a full maintenance grant may qualify for a part-maintenance grant (50%) in respect of which the income limit is £21,400. Where two or more children or the candidate's parent are attending full-time approved third level courses the above income limits may be increased by £2,270 where there are two such children, by £4,540 for three such children and so on, by increments of £2,270.</P>
      <P>Some 40% of third level students qualify for maintenance grants. The question of further raising the reckonable income limits could only be considered having regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector. In this respect, the need for a special enhanced level of maintenance grant for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, well targeted at those most in need has been highlighted in a number of reports, most recently in the Osborne Report on &ldquo;Evaluation of the Targeted Initiative on Widening Access for Young People from Socio-Economically Disadvantaged Backgrounds,&rdquo; published by the Higher Education Authority on 21 September 2000.</P>
      <P>The need to target resources at those most in need is well recognised and underpins this Government's approach to tackling disadvantage. In this regard, there is provision within the National Development Plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan. This fund will provide for additional financial support for disadvantaged students on top of the existing maintenance grants schemes. The objective of this measure is to facilitate and improve access to the labour market for the beneficiaries whilst improving their long-term employability through enhancing their educational qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently announced the setting up of an action group on access to third level education, in line with a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, with the aim of tackling under-representation of disadvantaged students in third level education. This action group will advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote participation at third level <Col N="773" /> by students in three disadvantaged groups &ndash; students with disabilities, students from disadvantaged backgrounds and mature &lsquo;second chance' students.</P>
    <P>As an indication of the Government's support in promoting equity in access, and as a purely initial step pending the findings of the action group, I announced on 14 September 2000 the introduction of a special maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders, targeted at those most in need. The full rate of maintenance grant will increase from £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college; and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college.</P>
    <P>Tentative indications are that in the region of 10,000 students may benefit from this measure.</P>
    <P>The action group will provide a report to me within three months, advising on the specific interventions we can make, which would be most effective in achieving our objectives in the area of disadvantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Representations made to me by Members of the Oireachtas are recorded in my private office on a lotus notes system. An acknowledgement issues to the correspondent and the papers are transmitted to the appropriate section of my Department for the preparation of a draft reply.</P>
      <P>The data recorded includes the name of the correspondent, the nature of the query, the date of receipt, the date an acknowledgement was issued and the name of the officer to whom the correspondence was sent. Individual line sections of the Department that receive large volumes of representations also have their own tracking system in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the line sections, draft replies are normally prepared by the member of staff dealing with the administration of the various schemes, programmes and operations which are the subject of the correspondence, or by higher officers where <Col N="774" /> the subject of the correspondence is complex or impinges on policy.</P>
    <P>The clerical staff in my office are responsible for tracking the replies and issuing reminders to sections where replies are overdue.</P>
    <P>The volume of representations and the diverse nature of the subject matter is such that only the staff on the ground dealing with the issues are in a position to prepare replies to the queries raised by Oireachtas Members. Freedom of information queries are dealt with in a similar manner.</P>
    <P>Members will be aware that the Public Service Executive Union in my Department was engaged in industrial action from January until April of this year in pursuit of a staffing claim. The industrial action included an instruction to union members not to answer representations from public representatives. The backlog of representations from this period, coupled with the normal volume of representations made on a daily basis since the cessation of the industrial action has led to a very large backlog, which can only be eliminated by the allocation of additional staffing resources to the task, both at central level and in the line sections. To meet these needs the Government has approved the appointment of over 100 extra staff.</P>
    <P>My Department's overall aim, in accordance with our customer service statement, is to reply to all correspondence within a period of 21 days and where this cannot be done, to issue an acknowledgement. In the case of representations from Members of the Oireachtas, there is a general instruction that an interim reply should issue if a final reply cannot be issued within a reasonable timeframe.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it is not possible for existing staff to comply with these targets at present. A significant number of vacancies exist in my Department in the clerical and administrative grades, and existing staff are under considerable strain in seeking to deliver the standard of service to which they aspire. Every effort is being made to fill the vacant positions as quickly as possible. However, Deputies will be aware that Government Departments are facing the same labour market constraints as other sectors at present.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with the Deputy that responding to queries from Oireachtas Members is an integral part of the democratic system. In recognition of this fact I have recently assigned an executive officer to liaise with Deputies and Senators on queries relating to my Department. In addition, I will be assigning a higher executive officer to head up a unit with exclusive responsibility for tracking representations from Members of the Oireachtas and ensuring that replies are issued within a reasonable period of time.</P>

      <P>Enrolment in second level schools is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of individual schools.

      <P>The higher education grants scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. An <Col N="776" /> approved institution is defined to mean a university, university college or other institution of higher education in so far as it provides a course or courses of not less than two years duration, being a course or courses which the Minister for Education and Science approves for the time being for the purposes of the Acts.</P>
      <P>Each year, the higher education grants scheme specifies a list of approved institutions for the purposes of the scheme. The approved institutions mainly comprise publicly funded third level institutions. Any extension to the scope of the grants scheme, to include private colleges, which avail of the CAO system for processing applications for admission to third level institutions, can be considered only in the light of available resources and in the context of competing demands within the education sector.</P>
      <P>Tax relief is available at the standard rate on fees paid to certain private colleges in accordance with the provisions contained in section 6 of the Finance Act, 1995 and section 15 of the Finance Act, 1996. In addition, the Finance Act, 2000, provides tax relief for fees paid in respect of approved postgraduate courses, including courses in approved private third level colleges.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the letter sent by the acting director of the National Educational Psychological Service in June of this year, to the principals of all primary and post-primary schools. The letter outlines the planned expansion of the service which will involve an additional 50 psychologists before the end of 2000 and 20 of these have already taken up duty.</P>
      <P>As the letter indicates, the service will be organised on a regional basis: NEPS psychologists will be allocated to ten regions corresponding to the health board regions. Within each region, priorities for expansion will be informed by the results of a survey of each county which NEPS psychologists have undertaken. In examining the data, particular consideration will be given to evidence of disadvantage, the incidence of special needs and the level of access to other psychological services in each area. Schools that at present do not have a psychological service from NEPS will be notified that they are receiving one as soon as this is decided.</P>
      <P>It is intended to deploy one of the recently appointed psychologists to the Waterford area as soon as the psychologist has completed induction and another more established psychologist will also be redeployed to Waterford.</P>
      <P>Pending this expansion to all primary schools, all referrals for psychological assessments should be sent to the relevant health board.</P>

      <P>School managerial authorities are responsible for ensuring that a fair and efficient code of behaviour, encompassing rules and procedures, is drawn up and applied in schools. Circumstances vary from one school community to another, and, therefore, it would not be appropriate for me to set out formal and detailed guidelines for all schools in relation to pupil behaviour. However, my Department has issued guidelines to assist schools in discharging their responsibilities in this area. The guidelines outline the general principles to be followed in drawing up and implementing a code of behaviour in schools.</P>
      <P>The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 will, when commenced, require schools for the first time to prepare codes of behaviour which specify the types of behaviour requiring disciplinary measures, the nature of these measures and the procedures to be followed by school authorities. The code is to be prepared in accordance with guidelines which may be issued by the National Education Welfare Board which is to be established under the provisions of the Act.</P>
      <P>The enactment of the Education (Welfare) Act together with the implementation of the Education Act, 1998 will introduce a new legislative framework for dealing with school discipline issues generally and provide an opportunity to update existing guidelines where necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>This year the concept of modification of the national standard assessment was introduced in order to accommodate the requirements of special needs students. This was a significant advance in the inclusiveness of our examination system. In essence, it allowed us to depart from a situation where a special needs student could be penalised by being required to undergo assessment in an element of an examination which was <Col N="780" /> beyond his or her physical capacity. For example, the aural component of a language examination is clearly problematical for a deaf candidate and the new special arrangements mean that exemption from that component is possible in the case of such students.</P>
      <P>Where this greater flexibility and responsiveness means that an element of the examination is not assessed, as with all matters relating to the certificate examinations, this must occur openly and transparently. In the present year, the provisional results issued to students were annotated in accordance with these principles.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that neither the leaving nor junior certificate results contained any reference to a candidate's disability. These provisional results did no more than provide factual information on the actual assessment.</P>
      <P>Decisions in relation to special arrangements are taken having regard to the circumstances of each individual case. My Department takes these decisions in the first instance within a published framework of principles. I should stress that I have also ensured the availability of an independent appeal forum where a student is unhappy with any aspect of my Department's decision.</P>

      <P>A statistical breakdown of results in leaving certificate history, higher and ordinary levels, for the years 1998, 1999 and 2000 is included with this reply. Results obtained by external candidates and school candidates are included. The figures given are valid for 28 September, 2000. It is anticipated that the figures for 2000 will change slightly following the completion of the appeals process.</P>
      <P>While there has been a decline in the numbers of candidates over the three year period, the pattern of results at each level is broadly consistent. The percentage of candidates scoring a grade C3 or higher ranges from 61.6% to 67.5% at higher level and from 58.6% to 63.5% at ordinary level. The percentages of candidates scoring a grade E or lower varies between 9.0% and 11.2% at higher level and between 20.1% and 24.0% at ordinary level.</P>
      <P>The percentage obtaining a grade E or less at ordinary level in 2000, and especially the proportion of candidates obtaining a grade F or no grade indicate that a number of candidates at that level fell short of meeting the aims of the syllabus. This did not apply at E, F or no grade on the higher level. On the other hand, at ordinary level a large percentage obtained high grades with 22.8% achieving Grade A1 or A2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="787" /> Grade patterns in the leaving certificate can and do vary from year to year as the cohort of candidates changes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="788" /> The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is at present working to develop a new syllabus for leaving certificate history.</P>

      <Quest>if recent leaving certificate and junior certificate results show major disparities between males and females; the reasons for this; the action necessary in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[20482/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a growing trend internationally whereby females tend to achieve better than males in terms of examination performance at the end of upper second level education. This trend has been evident in Ireland for the past ten years or so and is also reflected in the respective performances of females and males in GCSE O and A level examinations in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. My Department and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment have commissioned a number of research studies by the Educational Research Centre &ndash; ERC &ndash; St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra and the Economic and Social Research Institute &ndash; ESRI &ndash; which include analysis of the factors contributing to the performance of candidates in examinations. The ERC conducted a longitudinal study of the 1994 junior certificate candidates who took the leaving certificate examination in 1996 and 1997. The results confirm that the underachievement of males at junior certificate level is maintained in the leaving certificate examination. This pattern is also repeated in the case of the 2000 certificate examination results where females outscore males on most subjects in the junior certificate and leaving certificate.</P>
      <P>&lsquo;Do Schools Differ', a research project undertaken by the ESRI for the Department of Education and Science, explored the impact of schooling factors on a range of pupil outcomes at junior and leaving certificate levels. This research confirms the different levels of examination performance by gender and also indicates that females make greater progress relative to their initial ability. Girls apply themselves better to homework and study and have higher educational aspirations. Nevertheless, the report shows that girls tend to have a lower sense of control of their lives, to report higher stress levels and to have lower self-esteem. In response the Department has initiated a number of personal development programmes for both sexes to address self-esteem among lower ability pupils in order to integrate them fully into the education process. The Department has also provided for boys a broader range of personal development programmes than hitherto available and encouraged the adoption of these and other existing personal development programmes, particularly in single sex boys' schools.</P>
      <P>Our 8-15 early school leavers initiative and the stay at school retention initiative target those pupils most at risk of leaving school early and withdrawing from education. Boys are more likely than girls to leave school before the end of their second level education. Such interventions, therefore, combined with improved access to the junior certificate school programme and leaving certificate applied programme from September 2000 onwards, along with additional teaching resources provided recently for these programmes, should help to redress low achievement and in particular low achievement by boys.</P>
      <P>The ESRI is also currently engaged in research on the gender uptake and performance of girls and boys in science subjects at leaving certificate as part of the Department's response to increasing the uptake of science subjects and in particular physical science subjects.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if he will investigate the problems created for families who do not qualify for maintenance grants to send their children to third level education; the plans he has to extend the limits of such grants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[20527/00]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for means-tested higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education.</P>
      <P>The practice in recent years has been to increase, annually, third level maintenance grants in line with inflation and to increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage. In line with this policy, I announced increases of 5% in the maintenance grant and of 5% in the income limits to qualify for a grant, for the 2000/01 academic year.</P>
      <P>The reckonable income limit for a full maintenance grant under the student support schemes for the 2000/2001 academic year is £20,200. Candidates who do not qualify for a full maintenance grant may qualify for a part-maintenance grant (50%) in respect of which the income limit is £21,400. Where two or more children (or the candidate's parent) are attending full-time approved third level courses the above income limits may be increased by £2,270 where there are two such children, by £4,540 for three such children and so on, by increments of £2,270.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the maintenance grants scheme and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, support is also available to students through my Department's student assistance/access fund. The objectives of the fund are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered by the third level institutions and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college to complete <Col N="790" /> their studies. I have increased the provision for this fund from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.8 million in 2000.</P>
    <P>For students who do not qualify for free tuition fees under the free fees initiative, certain tax reliefs are available for fees paid for third level education.</P>
    <P>Some 40% of third level students qualify for maintenance grants. The question of further raising the reckonable income limits could only be considered having regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector. In this respect, the need for a special enhanced level of maintenance grant for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, well targeted at those most in need has been highlighted in a number of reports, most recently in the Osborne report, Evaluation of the Targeted Initiative on Widening Access for Young People from Socio-Economically Disadvantaged Backgrounds, published by the Higher Education Authority on 21 September 2000.</P>
    <P>The need to target resources at those most in need is well recognised and underpins this Government's approach to tackling disadvantage. In this regard there is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan. This fund will provide for additional financial support for disadvantaged students on top of the existing maintenance grants schemes. The objective of this measure is to facilitate and improve access to the labour market for the beneficiaries whilst improving their long-term employability through enhancing their educational qualifications.</P>
    <P>I recently announced the setting up of an action group on access to third level education, in line with a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, with the aim of tackling under-representation of disadvantaged students in third level education. This action group will advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote participation at third level by students in three disadvantaged groups &ndash; students with disabilities, students from disadvantaged backgrounds and mature &lsquo;second chance' students.</P>
    <P>As an indication of the Government's support for promoting equity in access, and as a purely initial step pending the findings of the action group, I announced on 14 September 2000 the introduction of a special maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders, targeted at those most in need. The full rate of maintenance grant will increase from £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college; and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college.</P>
    <P>Tentative indications are that in the region of 10,000 students may benefit from this measure.</P>
    <P>The action group will provide a report to me within three months, advising on the specific interventions we can make, which will be most <Col N="791" /> effective in achieving our objectives in the area of disadvantage.</P>

      <P>The level of radon gas recorded by the RPII at the school to which the Deputy refers at 212 bcqM3 was marginally in excess of the reference level of 200bcqM3 set by the RPII for schools.</P>
      <P>Remediation programmes have been carried out in a number of the worst affected schools.</P>
      <P>Consultants from the Buildings Research Establishment in London have been engaged to advise on the appropriate remediation measures in schools with radon levels between 200bcqM3 and 400bcqM3. The consultants are currently implementing remediation measures on a trial basis in approximately ten schools. The trial results are likely to inform the overall strategy to be adapted for the remediation programmes for schools with radon levels between 200bcqM3 and 400bcqM3. The trial results are expected to be available next month.</P>

      <P>Supports for schools at both second and primary level designated as disadvantaged are aimed at targeting those areas with the greatest needs in order to maximise participation and the potential for achievement within the education system.</P>
      <P>A range of supports has been put in place over the past two decades to support primary and second level schools designated as disadvantaged by my Department. The supports include the payment of enhanced capitation grants. In the case of many of the designated schools, ex-quota concessionary staffing is allocated and inclusion in the home/school/community liasion scheme has been offered to all designated schools.</P>
      <P>In addition at second level, curricular reform, the introduction of the junior certificate school programme, the transition year programme and the leaving certificate applied have increased the range of options that are more responsive to some young people's needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 8-15 year old early school leaver initiative <Col N="792" /> was introduced for the school years 1998/99 and 1999/2000. Its purpose is to develop and test models for the delivery of supports to those young people who are most at risk of educational disadvantage with a view to the integration of such models, after structured evaluation, into mainstream policy and practice. The projects strand of this initiative involves 17 specific projects in 14 areas. I have decided to extend the existing 17 projects for a further phase, for the period 1 July 2000 until 31 August 2002. Funding of £2.82 million has been allocated to this initiative for the year 2000.</P>
    <P>In June 1999 the stay in school retention initiative at second level was launched with 58 schools serving pupils and areas with higher than average levels of early school leaving invited to participate. This initiative represents a significant departure from traditional policy in that funding is being granted to targeted schools, on the basis of plans which they were helped to design themselves. The purpose of this initiative is to prevent early school leaving and raise senior cycle completion rates. At the end of May 2000 an additional 59 schools were invited to participate in the initiative.</P>
    <P>The recently enacted Education Welfare Act, 2000 provides for the introduction of a comprehensive school attendance service nationally. The new Education Welfare Act includes specific measures for an effective tracking system so as to ensure that children who are at risk of dropping out of the system can be identified and early interventions put in place. Among the key objectives of the Act is the establishment of a single national authority, the National Educational Welfare Board, with responsibility for school attendance on a country wide basis. Education welfare officers employed by the authority will co-ordinate State services to children who have school attendance problems.</P>

      <P>This initiative has four components: Clondalkin project for Traveller children; Brookfield project, linked to St Aidan's Community School; Fettercairn project; and Neilstown and Deansrath.</P>
      <P>The project organisers were advised by my officials earlier this year to submit the Clondalkin project for Traveller children to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for consideration under their out of school hours and childcare programme introduced this year. The application was successful and funding has been approved towards staffing and running costs.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Neilstown and Deansrath project has also recently secured funding from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs under the same programme.</P>
      <P>The three post primary schools associated with the Brookfield, Fettercairn, Neilstown and Deansrath projects, St. Aidan's Community School, Deansrath and Collinstown Park Community Colleges are all included in the stay in school retention initiative &ndash; SSRI &ndash; introduced in 1999. After school supports form part of a range of supports being put in place by individual schools as part of a plan to retain pupils to completion of senior cycle. The retention plan will form the core of a contract between the school in collaboration with local service providers and my Department. There is extensive scope for collaboration and integration between the SSRI and the south urban initiative after schools initiative.</P>
      <P>At primary level, the schools participating are St. Anne's junior and senior, St. Ronan's and St. Peter the Apostle. A comprehensive survey of all primary schools was completed on my behalf earlier this year by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra. The results will allow for an accurate identification of levels of disadvantage in every primary school. Based on the levels of need identified, the objective will be to introduce a range of significant and specifically targeted interventions that will ensure that disadvantaged children will receive the support they need to succeed in the education system. Support for the schools in question is being considered in this context.</P>

      <P>On 14 September, 2000, I announced the creation of an action group on access to third level education to advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote access by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities to third level education.</P>
      <P>The creation of this group is in line with a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>The Government is providing for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period 2000 to 2006, aimed at tackling under-representation by the three target groups.</P>
      <P>As an indication of the Government's support in promoting equity in access and as a purely initial step, pending the findings of the action group, I announced the introduction of a special maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders, targeted at those most in need. The full rate of the special maintenance grant will increase from £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college; and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have indicated that I would expect that some 10,000 students will benefit from this measure. This is, of course, a tentative estimate and the actual number of students to benefit will depend <Col N="796" /> on the outcome to the action group's work. The group's terms of reference require that it advise me, <i>inter alia,</i> on the development of targeted interventions and actions and the identification and tracking of the target groups.</P>
    <P>I have asked the group to report to me within three months and it will not be possible to identify the target groups until then. For this reason, the payment of the first instalment of the special rates of maintenance grants, targeted at disadvantaged students most in need, cannot be made before January 2001. For the same reason, there is no provision for such payments in the current year's Estimates.</P>

      <P>A number of socio-economic indicators have been used by my Department over the years to identify primary and post primary schools which are serving communities with significant levels of disadvantage. The key indicators used at both levels are rates of unemployment, medical card possession and residence in local authority housing. These variables have been found to be valid indicators of disadvantage. In addition, my Department has obtained significant additional information from schools in relation to disadvantage and this has been used to target resources to schools where appropriate. This information <Col N="797" /> relates to the level of lone parenthood; levels of educational attainment of parents; numbers of families in receipt of financial assistance from the State because of limited means from farm income; level of pupils with significant literacy and numeracy difficulties; and school drop out rates.</P>
      <P>Schools included in the disadvantaged areas scheme at primary level qualify for special supplementary capitation funding. For the 2000-01 school year, the capitation supplement per pupil is £30 broken down as follows, £16 supplementary capitation for general running costs, £9 for classroom materials and equipment and £5 for home-school community liaison activities. There are a total of 293 concessionary disadvantaged posts allocated to these schools and a further 176 posts are allocated to the home school community liaison scheme in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>Schools in the disadvantaged areas scheme also receive a full refund of their television licence fee and a 95% building grant for building projects.</P>
      <P>Second level schools, which are designated as disadvantaged, qualify for the allocation of a disadvantaged post and-or additional teaching resources in respect of home school liaison activities. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of £30 per pupil is payable to these schools.</P>
      <P>The breaking the cycle project was introduced in September 1996. Special supports extended to schools included in the urban phase include extra teaching staff to facilitate a pupil teacher ratio of 15:1 in all junior classes and special funding of up to £3,000 for materials-equipment and up to £4,000 for out of school projects. They also have the support of a specially appointed co-ordinator. Special targeted in-career development for school staff is also provided. Schools in the rural phase qualify for special funding of £1,000 for materials-equipment and of £1,000 for suitable local initiatives. They also qualify for supplementary capitation funding of £30 per pupil. The 122 rural schools are grouped into 25 clusters, with one locally based co-ordinator serving each. Special targeted in-career development for school staff is also provided.</P>

    <P>(Dr. Woods): There are currently 72 psychologists, in addition to an acting director, employed by my Department in the National Educational Psychological Service agency. Of these, nine are engaged in managerial and supervisory duties in addition to fieldwork, and 20 have yet to complete their induction training. They provide a full psychological support service to schools, which includes the assessment of children with learning difficulties. Schools psychologists are also employed by the Vocational Education Committees of the City and County of Dublin and by a small number of area partnerships.</P>
    <P>Existing psychologists in my Department, represented by IMPACT, are currently engaged in limited industrial action with a view to seeking certain guarantees relating to their terms and conditions of service in the event of the National Educational Psychological Service agency being established as a statutory body. Discussions are continuing between representatives of my Department and IMPACT to address comprehensively all of the concerns and issues involved in the transfer of staff to the new proposed body. A further meeting with the union is scheduled for Wednesday, 4 October.</P>
    <P>The following table shows the number of assessments administered during the past two school years. Statistics in relation to assessments administered during the school year 1999/2000 are still being processed and collated.</P>

    <P>The National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, currently provides a service to all second level schools and approximately a quarter of all national schools. Psychologists assist principals and teachers to develop procedures for screening, identifying and prioritising those students who are in need of an early appointment. In many cases, the psychologist discusses individual students in the light of the school's assessment results with teachers and parents and advises on appropriate remedial strategies. This means that some students can benefit from the psychologist's advice without the need for an individual psychological assessment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the nature of the Irish examination system that results can and do vary from year to year and from subject to subject.</P>
      <P>At junior certificate, I was pleased to note that civic, social and political education was taken by the full cohort for the first time and over 80% of the students obtained a grade C or higher on a common level paper. The improvement in performance of candidates in science at ordinary level reflects in part changes in the format of the exam paper which were designed to make it more accessible to candidates. The grades in foundation level Irish are significantly up on 1998 and 1999 and reflect more closely the grading patterns prior to 1998.</P>
      <P>I have recently received a report of a working party on junior certificate Irish, ordinary and foundation level, set up in late 1999 and I intend to publish this report shortly. This report will contribute to a review of Irish at second level about to be undertaken by the NCCA.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the leaving certificate applied and the leaving certificate vocational programmes were taken by 23% of the student cohort, The results at leaving certificate level showed some upward variations particularly in the % who obtained a grade C or better at higher level in history, art and economic history and downward variation in mathematics and there was a decrease in many instances in the % who failed to obtain a grade D or better at either level. With my recent decision to introduce revised syllabi in home economics and biology from 2001, curriculum support teams will be put in place for these subjects shortly to assist teachers. A curriculum support team is already in place for the new mathematics syllabus at junior certificate level which will be examined in 2003.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>At primary level my Department provides funding towards the cost of caretaking and secretarial services under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the <Col N="800" /> employment of caretakers and clerical officers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. However, this scheme has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. I have extended the scheme to all primary schools with effect from September of this year. All primary schools, other than those in the 1978-79 scheme, are now entitled to grant assistance on an annual basis from my Department of £40 per pupil, £20 in respect of secretarial assistance and £20 in respect of caretaking assistance, with a minimum grant of £2,400 being payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less. In addition, schools with 100 pupils or less will also shortly be receiving grant assistance in respect of the period from September to December of this year.</P>
      <P>These improvements mean that, with effect from September 2000, all primary schools have become entitled to an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was some £5.6 million in 1999 has increased this year to some £12.2 million and will further increase in 2001 to over £16.8 million.</P>
      <P>At second level, the funding arrangements for post-primary schools includes provision for the purpose of providing secretarial and caretaker services in schools. In the case of voluntary secondary schools in the free education scheme, all schools with 200 or more pupils receive financial assistance towards the cost of both caretaking and secretarial services. In the case of vocational schools and colleges, it is a matter for the vocational education committee to deploy staff in the best manner possible to meet the needs of the committee and its schools. All schools in the community and comprehensive school sector have been provided with clerical and caretaking services.</P>
      <P>I recently announced details of a significant initiative in which I am putting in place a school services support fund at second level. Schools will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to second level schools each year. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion in line with that available in relation to <i>per capita</i> grants as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils.</P>

      <P>The leaving certificate applied was introduced to schools in order to cater for students whose needs were not served by the established leaving certificate. The established leaving certificate remains the main qualification needed for entry to third level education.</P>
      <P>However, leaving certificate applied graduates may proceed to study at institutes of technology by obtaining relevant NCVA level 2 qualifications at the end of a post leaving certificate, PLC, course.</P>
      <P>Surveys commissioned by the NCCA, National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, show that in 1998 22% and in 1999 23.3% of leaving certificate applied graduates proceeded to PLC courses.

      <P>The development of a database on all primary school pupils is a very significant undertaking involving the collection and processing of information on 450,000 pupils from more than 3,300 primary schools. It will take at least three years to put the full database in place.</P>
      <P>The project is currently in the planning stages and it is intended to implement a first phase in a pilot group of schools during the current school year.</P>

      <P>Breaking the cycle is a five year pilot project. It began in September 1996 in 33 urban and 123 rural schools that have high concentrations of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving. The programme is currently being evaluated by the Educational Research Centre. There are no plans at present to extend the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am currently working on proposals for a major new initiative to address the needs of pupils who are encountering educational disadvantage at primary level. As a first step, all primary schools were invited to participate in a survey designed to obtain information concerning the level of educational disadvantage in each school. The outcome of the survey will facilitate the putting in place of a range of significant and specifically targeted interventions so that disadvantaged children receive the support they <Col N="803" /> require to enable them succeed in school. I will make a further announcement in relation to this matter in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The educational needs of primary pupils with specific learning disability, including children with dyslexia, are generally capable of being met within the ordinary school system, with the support where appropriate of the learning support service. Since the commencement of the 1999-2000 school year, the learning support service has been extended to every first and second level school in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="807" /> All fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those that are accompanied by perceptual difficulties. In addition, the special training programme for learning support teachers includes a module on specific learning disability. There are currently 1,478 learning support teachers in place in the primary sector.</P>
    <P>Second level pupils with a specific learning disability are normally integrated into ordinary classes. In such situations they may receive additional tutorial support through the learning support, guidance counsellor and subject teachers. Depending on the degree of the condition, they may also be eligible for special arrangements in the certificate examinations.</P>
    <P>Children of primary school age, whose condition is of a more serious nature, may attend their local primary school where they can be supported by the special resource teacher service. Arising from a Government decision of October 1998, all children with special needs within the primary system, including children with dyslexia, now have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs.</P>
    <P>Since this decision was taken, significant additional resource teachers and special needs assistants have been allocated to the primary system to support children with special needs, including those with specific learning disabilities.</P>
    <P>For some children, the severity of their condition can be such that placement in a special school or in a special class attached to an ordinary school is the required response. There are four such special schools at present, three of these are located in the Dublin area and one in Cork.</P>
    <P>Special classes can be established in ordinary primary schools to cater for children with specific learning disability where a need for such provision has been identified. There are twenty such classes in place at present and further classes will be established as required. A reduced pupil teacher ratio of 11:1 is applicable in all special facilities catering for the children in question.</P>
    <P>In addition to the range of support services that are available to children with specific learning disabilities, including dyslexia, my Department is continuing to support the work carried out in this area by the Association for Children and Adults with Learning Disabilities. In the current year, an allocation of £50,000 will be made to that association.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the range of special support services provided by my Department constitutes a very significant response to the educational needs of students with specific learning disabilities, including dyslexia.</P>
    <P>I have recently established a task force on dyslexia, which will commence its work shortly. I want to make early progress in developing policies to assist children with dyslexia, and I have asked the task force to report within three months of commencement because I want to respond to its recommendations at an early stage.</P>

      <P>The student in question was assessed as a candidate other than a mature candidate as she was not aged 23 years on 1 January 2000, the year of entry to her post-leaving certificate course. Under the student support schemes, maintenance grants are payable at either adjacent or non-adjacent rates. Where candidates are assessed as &ldquo;candidates other than a mature candidate&rdquo; the adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable where the grantholder's normal residence is 15 miles or less from the college which she/he is attending.</P>
      <P>The terms and conditions of the student support schemes are of general application and, accordingly, it is not possible to make exceptions in individual cases such as this.</P>

      <P>The third level student support grants are tenable in respect of full-time undergraduate <Col N="810" /> courses of not less than two years duration pursued in a university or third-level institution which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds in another EU member state, with the exception of the following: courses in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine and teacher training courses including those leading to the award of Bachelor of Education; courses in colleges of further and higher education, other than courses which are at higher national diploma level or higher; courses provided in a college which are offered in private commercial third level colleges in the State, and which are validated by that college; and courses in colleges akin to private commercial colleges in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, if the student to whom the Deputy refers is pursuing a course at higher national diploma level or higher, she should apply to Sligo Vocational Education Committee who will assess her eligibility for grant assistance under the terms of the vocational education committees scholarships scheme.</P>

      <P>The position generally is that school transport services are organised as a network of main routes serving post-primary schools. Pupils living off main routes are expected to get, or be brought to a convenient pick-up point on the main route. As a rule, the routes are planned so that no pupil should have more than three miles to travel to a pick-up point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The application for a re-routing, referred to by the Deputy, was turned down by my Department <Col N="812" /> on the basis that the pupils reside well within the three mile guideline.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The enrolment at St. Vincent's Convent primary school has decreased from 695 pupils on 30 September 1998 to 644 pupils on 30 September <Col N="814" /> 1999. This latter enrolment warrants the staffing of a principal and 22 mainstream class teachers for the 2000-01 school year, a reduction in two mainstream class teachers on the previous year's staffing.</P>
    <P>An enrolment of 690 pupils on 30 September 1999 was required in order to retain the 24th mainstream class teacher while an enrolment of 660 pupils was needed to retain the 23rd mainstream class teacher for the 2000-01 school year. Therefore, I regret that I cannot restore these posts to the school for the 2000-01 school year.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above staffing, the school has a learning support teacher, a home-school liaison teacher and two concessionary posts by virtue of its disadvantaged status.</P>
