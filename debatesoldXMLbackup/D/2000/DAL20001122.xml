      <P>Before the Order of Business, I propose to deal with notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with two different topics. I propose to deal with these two topics separately and I will call Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office. In regard to the first topic, I received notice from Deputy Quinn and I now call on him to state the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the terms of Standing Order 31, I give notice of my intention to seek to move the adjournment of the Dáil today to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent attention: the seriously deteriorating industrial relations situation as a result of which secondary schools will be closed for two days this week and all national rail services will be withdrawn for 48 hours, the need for action on the part of the Government to seek a negotiated settlement to both disputes having regard to the potential threat to education and the disruption of travel if these disputes are not resolved quickly and the further need for Government action to deal with the growing number of industrial disputes.</P>

      <P>In regard to the second topic, I received notice from Deputy Sargent and I now call on him to state the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the business of the Dáil be suspended under Standing Order 31 to address the urgent need for Government contingency plans to help stranded commuters to meet appointments when trains, buses or taxis are not operating and that the Government takes the opportunity to thank car drivers who gave lifts to rain soaked commuters who were being passed <Col N="778" /> by full buses at bus stops throughout the country this morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 20f2&gt;a, motion re leave to introduce Supplementary Estimates, Votes 10 and 44; No. 20f2&gt;b, motion re referral of Supplementary Estimates, Votes 10 and 44, to select committee; No. 44, Teaching Council Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage resumed; No. 45, Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage, resumed; and No. 7, Youth Work Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.</P>
      <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 20f2&gt;a, leave to introduce Supplementary Estimates, Votes 10 and 44, and, subject to the agreement of No. 20f2&gt;a, No. 20f2&gt;b shall be decided without debate and any divisions demanded on Nos. 20f2&gt;a and 20f2&gt;b shall be taken forthwith.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not on the merits of the case but because the Government is functioning, as far as transport is concerned, on the basis of announcements but no delivery. It is a Government of announcements and public relations, not delivery. I asked the Taoiseach in the House last week if he had any sense of the anger people are feeling about traffic problems in this and other cities. He did not answer and the situation is worse this week. Traffic is moving at a snail's pace in Dublin and the seed bed from which this snail is generated is Government Buildings.</P>

We have no other way of registering our protest but to refuse to accept the Order of Business today.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek information on the delay with the North-South pipeline because of the levy the Government proposes to introduce. This is seen by private operators who wish to open a pipeline bringing gas to the South and to introduce competition into gas distribution as unfair competition and an attempt to preserve a State monopoly. I raised this matter with the Taoiseach some time ago and this morning the matter has become public. There is opposition to the Government from people as diverse as Reg Empey of the Ulster Unionists and Pat Doherty of Sinn Féin. They are agreed that this proposed levy is anti-competitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton raised this matter with me some weeks ago and I took it up with both the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, and with BGE. There are ongoing discussions and it is not as simple a case as has been put by one side, though there are many advantages in trying to resolve this. I have indicated that I would like the matter to be resolved but it is not as easy as waiving the levy, which is the core of the issue. On the other side, this company is making a large investment. However, we are seeking a resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that this is an illustration that if we are to have a genuine all-Ireland energy policy, as we wish under the Good Friday Agreement, it means that entrenched positions on this side of the Border, such as that of Bord Gáis, may have to be changed? The reluctance on the part of existing institutions to recognise that we are now operating under the Good Friday Agreement rather than under previous autonomous 26-county considerations has led to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is looking at this. It is not a question of an all-Ireland situation; it is a question of what is or is not a good commercial deal. There are also concerns within Northern Ireland about what precisely will happen as opposed to what has been stated as happening. I cannot comment on those matters or the arguments of others. For our part we are endeavouring to find a resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will address my remarks, through the Chair, to the Taoiseach but really to the Department that still has responsibility for industrial relations. On the current situation with regard to industrial relations breakdown across a range of sectors, will the Taoiseach indicate if there are any emergency legislative proposals, administrative actions or ministerial interventions contemplated that would bring some sense of order to this chaos and some sense of confidence to the public at large who are looking at a most extraordinary deterioration in industrial relations, one we have not witnessed since the mid-1980s?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, Sir, but does the Taoiseach accept that there is a serious problem across a variety of sectors and that the machinery to which he has made reference is not working as efficiently or effectively as it should? Does he have any proposals in that respect to improve or to consult with the people responsible for our industrial relations conflict resolution machinery so as to bring some order and stability back into the system because it clearly is not there at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is certainly some validity in that because last week we had a situation where a Labour Court recommendation was turned down 24 hours before it was announced. That is not very efficient, but as far as the machinery that is necessary is concerned, the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court are working flat out in that regard. All the conciliation officers and the members of the court are working very hard but it is regrettable that in many instances workers or their representatives are not giving due regard to the recommendations that are being made. I have had discussions on a number of these issues with the leadership of the trade unions and employers.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will continue to do that. I acknowledge the fact that a number of the more serious issues have been resolved.</P>
      <P>On the rail case to which the Deputy has adverted, there have been extensive discussions over the past six months but the Labour Court recommendations were rejected. New offers were made but they were rejected also. I understand both sides have again called on the court to assist them so hopefully those matters will continue to be dealt with in the appropriate place.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach not agree that there is a political dimension to this issue in that when the CIE board found, as soon as this Government came into office, that the Minister started to interfere selectively in its industrial relations to garner popularity for herself, as she thought, that undermined the authority of the board and its negotiating capacity and undermined the faith of the unions in any agreements that were made? Will the Taoiseach agree there is a political accountability on the part of the <Col N="784" /> Government and that he cannot, as he is so good at doing, shake it off? Every problem is somebody else's problem. No problem is his problem. The Taoiseach should remember that he is the Taoiseach. He is in charge and these are all State owned enterprises that are paralysed.</P>

When will the package of legislation and reform measures, which has been promised on so many occasions, be introduced by the Government Chief Whip and Minister of State to enable this House to debate the sort of issues that are on the minds and in the mouths of ordinary citizens outside this House?

      <P>By way of a final reply, the argument here normally was that Ministers should not intervene. When I was Minister for Labour it was always an issue that I should not intervene in disputes. These Houses argue that we should set up proper machinery. The Labour Court Act, 1946 was amended and strengthened. The Labour Relations Commission was set up, and there is an extensive service involved in that. Deputy Bruton is wrong in regard to this case. The strike involving 130 people in Iarnród Éireann planned for today and tomorrow is in pursuit of a pay deal for working conditions. They have been the subject of six months of extensive talks under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission. They have also been the subject of a Labour Court recommendation. The legislation, the powers and the staff are available to continue to deal with these issues and they should be dealt with.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question asked by Deputy Quinn, he would know because there was no better Minister for Labour than himself for saying that this House should not get involved in industrial relations disputes, but matters have moved on. The House is far more modern and not so protective as it was then but I am glad to answer these issues. I hope the other issues will be discussed by the reform committee as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>When we suspended our deliberations on the last occasion I was dealing with Part V of the Bill which is concerned with people's fitness to teach. While I acknowledge that the vast majority of teachers perform their jobs in an excellent manner, there are some who do not perform so well. This results in parents transferring their children to different schools. Unfortunately, children whose parents cannot afford to transfer them are left in schools with inadequate services. I hope the new council will be able to address problems that arise as a result of certain individuals' lack of fitness to teach. That is one of the <Col N="790" /> larger nettles the council will be obliged to grasp when it is established.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that the provisions in the Bill are a fine balance between respecting the rights of teachers to fair consideration and due process and the rights of students and parents to have confidence in the system of redress open to them in the event of a complaint against a teacher. I hope the provisions in the Bill can meet everyone's needs and the council will ultimately devise a satisfactory formula for dealing with this issue.</P>
      <P>There is a severe shortage of teachers at present and my colleague, Deputy Hayes, will deal with this matter in more detail later. Class numbers are too large and some classes suffer as a result of the continual <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements which must be made as human resources dry up. Section 30 deals with registration and it can be used as a means to establish a database of available personnel. There are many qualified people outside the system who may be enticed to return in some capacity or other if they believe they would be part of a club that holds a certain status and an organisation that will cater for their needs. Throughout their careers, teachers have tended to operate on a stand alone basis.</P>
      <P>In recent years postgraduate courses have been held to satisfy the need in the primary sector. These courses are held in Dublin. The Minister should examine the feasibility of establishing a pilot project in the regions to allow people there to pursue such courses. There are many people in the home who would participate in these courses with a view to changing their careers. However, for geographical considerations, these courses are currently unsuitable. I have been in contact with many people, particularly women living in rural areas, who are graduates, who remained in the home after marriage but whose children have now grown up and moved away. These people would like to attend the courses to which I refer but they cannot do so because they are unable to move to Dublin for five days of the week. Perhaps the Minister will consider establishing a postgraduate course in Galway or Limerick or at some other location.</P>
      <P>Oliver Goldsmith's &ldquo;A Village Schoolmaster&rdquo; is not held in the same high esteem as it was in the past. The Bill may help to redress the situation, but its success or failure hinges on whether correct membership is put in place to allow it to move forward in a positive manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the building programme, if the Government gives permission for construction of a new physical education hall at a particular school, it often takes five years for the work to be completed. A student may enter a school at a time when permission to build a new PE hall has been given but he or she may already have left by the time it is finished. Surely the system could be streamlined. Since the previous occasion on which we discussed the Bill, a report was issued about the number of parliamentary questions <Col N="791" /> tabled by Deputies in respect of repairs to windows etc. in schools. If the system was more efficient, however, there would be no need to table such questions. Politicians are obliged to ask questions because the system has failed to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>With regard to the dangers of traffic, everyone knows that cars are more liable to be driven at speed than they were in the past. The Government is seeking to deal with this matter, albeit very slowly. Many schools were built at accessible but also extremely dangerous locations. Pedestrian crossings have been put in place outside a large number of schools but there seems to be a major struggle with local authorities to ensure their proper operation. I accept that many local authorities have schools liaison safety officers but very often lip-service is only paid to this matter. Traffic can be a source of danger for children in schools, particularly when they are being dropped off or collected. Many children are driven to school and the traffic congestion which results is a source of grave danger. This problem must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Everyone is aware that there has been an exodus from the countryside into our towns and many areas are drawing up development plans as a result. In the next few years, many towns in the greater Dublin area will experience mini-population explosions. What measures does the Department intend to put in place in anticipation of these increases in population? I am aware that these increases are factored into development plans in the form of zoning for education facilities, but I do not know if the Department and local authorities liaise with each other in that regard. I suspect that there is no such arrangement. I have been in contact with the Department to obtain copies of the development plans for Wicklow but there should be no need to do so. There must be greater contact between the Department and local authorities in respect of this matter.</P>
    <P>Various schools were designated as disadvantaged in the past but I do not know how effective the relevant scheme has been. I accept that schools obtained additional resources on foot of the scheme but I do not know whether these schools are the most deserving. The drop-out rate among primary and secondary school pupils in certain areas of particular towns is frighteningly high. The census of 1996 shows that the drop-out rate for 15 year olds is almost 50%. That is unacceptable and there is a need to invest additional resources in our schools.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill which has been the subject of discussion for several years. It is unusual to be debating the Bill today when members of the teaching profession are on strike. The Minister should do everything possible to find a resolution to current difficulties. Young people are our greatest resource and our education system is a source of great pride. However, teachers are often not appreciated in the manner in which they should be and people often <Col N="792" /> complain about the fact that they get long summer holidays. Politicians complain about the long hours they work but I would much prefer to be a politician than a teacher because one is now expected to be a teacher, parent, guardian and counsellor all at once.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill, which contains a number of important features. The Bill affords the teaching profession an opportunity to provide for the establishment of standards, policies and procedures for the education of teachers. That is one of the most important aspects of the Bill. Very importantly, it will provide for a professional code of conduct. Reference has been made over many years to the need for a council which will initiate a professional code of conduct. This provision will be welcomed by the teaching profession and the public at large.</P>
      <P>The Bill will give the 44,000 teachers a significant degree of professional autonomy and, more importantly, self-regulation. It will enhance the status and morale of the teaching profession and the quality of education provided. The morale and status of teachers are themes which have been raised often by teachers in recent times. As Deputy Timmins properly pointed out, given the current climate, the issue of morale among teachers must be addressed by the House. I hope the issue will be addressed by the Minister in the next few days so that morale among members of the teaching profession is restored.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides teachers with a forum where they can present their profession as a dynamic and vibrant one. This provision will be welcomed by parents and students. The concerns of students and parents are sometimes lost in education debates and the Bill will give parents an opportunity to voice their concerns and ensure that teachers meet the highest standards in terms of their professional qualifications and adhere to a professional code of conduct. It also gives an assurance that teachers are committed to doing this.</P>
      <P>The Minister should widen representation on the council to ensure that the voices of hundreds of thousands of students are listened to in a positive and meaningful manner. It has often been acknowledged that the education system has played a huge role in our economic success. The Bill will ensure that education continues to be of the highest standard, thereby ensuring our continuing economic success.</P>
      <P>It is important to recognise that the Bill encourages the Good Friday Agreement in that it will ensure teachers, both North and South, move forward together. This is an essential element of the Good Friday Agreement. It is important that teachers on the island as a whole are seen to work together. The Bill will ensure teachers are committed to maintaining a high standard of education on both sides of the Border. A strong education system will enable us to continue to expand and improve society and build on our economic success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="793" /> Ireland is undergoing huge changes and the growth of the economy and advancements in technology mean that these changes are set to continue. Teachers are a part of this change and the majority of them want to react positively to it and lead and drive change through education. At parent-teacher meetings, teachers make the point that their role is not confined to the classroom and that they want to play a role in leading change. Teachers are being given the opportunity to ensure that quality remains the hallmark of the teaching profession. This will enhance the status of teaching as a profession. The establishment of the council marks the coming of age for the profession and puts its members on a par with other professionals, such as doctors, lawyers, nurses etc.</P>
    <P>The Bill recognises the high level of confidence the House has in the teaching profession by allowing it to be self-regulating. This means it will be difficult to blame others for the problems in the teaching profession. The profession will have to speak for, and on behalf of, itself in the future. More importantly, teachers will be empowered to take responsibility for the standards and quality of education. The establishment of a statutory body will protect and promote the status of teachers and ensure the advancement of the profession. Teachers have sought the establishment of the council for many years and I am happy that the Bill provides for this. I pay tribute to the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, who initially steered this process. The Bill has come about as a result of a process of consultation, which is a very important element of the Bill, and a series of recommendations, including the 1991 OECD report, The Review of Irish Education, and the 1992 Green Paper. The establishment of the council is long overdue and is welcomed by all those interested in the advancement of education.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the council is an independent, statutory agency. The Bill will give the teaching profession a large degree of professional autonomy and provides for self-regulation. It spells out clearly the functions of the council, specifically the promotion of teaching as a profession. This is the cornerstone of the Bill. It provides that the council will establish, review and maintain codes of conduct for teachers and establish and maintain a register of teachers. It will also establish and promote standards in programmes of teacher education and training. It will promote the continuing education, training and professional development of teachers, conduct inquiries into and, where appropriate, impose sanctions in relation to the fitness to teach of teachers.</P>
    <P>The membership of the council will ensure that it is a professional regulatory body which is afforded a high degree of autonomy, with a majority of representatives from the teaching profession. The Bill allows the council to avail of the expertise and experience of others who are deeply interested in education and the teaching profession. I welcome the broad range of representatives from the teacher training colleges, universities, trade unions and employer and par<Col N="794" /> ent groups. The executive committee structure will ensure that the council does not become a large and unwieldy organisation. It is very important to tie this into the legislation so that the council will be a manageable size and will make an impact.</P>
    <P>In recent years teachers have complained that their profession is undervalued. The Bill is timely in that it demonstrates to those teachers on strike that the House recognises the important role they play. The Bill aims to address this issue so as to generate greater confidence in the profession and restore and regenerate the public's perception of the profession. The Bill provides a positive context in which to explore issues relating to the profession. The industrial action has given parents and the public a negative perception of teachers and the Bill should help to counter this in the future. I support the Minister's call to teachers to return to the negotiating table. Parents and the public talk about the lack of disciplinary measures, accountability etc. The Bill addresses these issues not only from the point of view of teachers but also from the point of view of parents and students.</P>
    <P>I would prefer if the Bill provided for student representation on the council. The Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, broke new ground when she embarked on a meaningful consultation process with children who were asked what issues they would like to see covered in child legislation. Their views were taken on board and incorporated into the relevant legislation. I ask the Minister to consider providing for student representation on the council. The Bill should provide for students' views to be taken on board by requiring the council to consult teachers and students regularly, meaningfully and positively. The model used by the Minister for State, Deputy Hanafin, could be suitable for inclusion in this Bill. Provision should be made for the inclusion of representatives from the soon to be created national children's office, Dáil na nÓg, and, when appointed, the ombudsman for children and youth organisations, such as the National Youth Council.</P>
    <P>It is very important to remember that even though this is titled the Bill, it is not the preserve of teachers. It is also about the promotion of high values and a quality education system. Students are obviously major stakeholders in the education system and I encourage the Minister to make provision for their views to be taken into account. In the age of openness and consultation, it is vital that we consult in a meaningful way all those involved in the education system. If such representation was provided for, it would bring about a situation where students could engage with the council in a positive and meaningful way rather than being called as witnesses in competency cases. Student representation would further ensure that young people learn from an early age to engage with the democratic system while the profession and the democratic system <Col N="795" /> would learn to engage with its citizens from an early age.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for teacher representatives, as distinct from the role of teachers' unions. Maintaining and improving standards is a key requisite in ensuring the survival of all professions. The Minister is correct that teachers' representative organisations will complement each other in promoting teaching as a profession. I also believe those interested in improving teaching as a profession have been seeking accountability from the profession but such accountability has not been forthcoming from all sections of the profession.</P>
    <P>For the first time access to registration details and most importantly the findings of disciplinary procedures will be provided. Parents, in particular, have for some time sought such openness and accountability. This will improve confidence in the profession. The hallmark of the legislation is to try to improve morale and confidence. The register will act as an astute statement of standards required of teachers and will herald a new era of openness in the education system, which is long overdue.</P>
    <P>A number of people working in the education system are not recognised as teachers. I am aware of a number of special needs teachers who are highly qualified and who have gained a wealth of experience overseas. Some of them are denied full-time posts because they have been unable to pass the Irish language competency test. I recognise there will be some changes in this regard, but, nevertheless, it is vital that the Minister addresses this area as the Government is committed to providing improved educational facilities to children and adults with special needs.</P>
    <P>There will be a requirement to recruit teachers from aboard with specialised training and qualifications. It is ludicrous to deny our children such expertise because of the language requirement. In future there may also be difficulties recruiting teachers for the sciences and languages. These teachers will be sought from abroad and the Irish language requirement will be an anomaly. If the issue is not addressed students and the economy will be adversely affected. Ensuring the survival of the Irish language will be addressed in different ways.</P>
    <P>I refer to the important role of parents in education. I, like all Deputies, have received many representations over the years from parents who have felt powerless in the face of teacher incompetence and while this is not a regular issue, it nevertheless crops up from time to time. I welcome the requirement on the council to set out clear and transparent courses of action for parents which will protect the rights and duties of all parties. Parents will welcome the council's power to act in the event of a teacher failing to perform.</P>
    <P>If the Bill is to have validity the council must have teeth and should be prepared to use them wisely. No one is requesting a witch hunt against teachers. The Bill provides that teachers who face <Col N="796" /> difficulties will receive assistance to improve their competencies and skills. It further provides for sufficient safeguards to be built in on all sides. I encourage the Minister to examine ways of including students in the process. While in the majority of cases their interests will be met by their parents, it should be open to students to assess the grievance procedures. I feel strongly about this issue. If a teacher is not performing, students will be directly affected.</P>
    <P>Providing for student representation could have many inherent difficulties but these can be overcome by permitting representatives of the national children's office and the office of the ombudsman for children on the council. The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Hanafin, will introduce enabling legislation for both offices before the end of the year. I urge the Minister to put in place a mechanism to provide for these offices to be represented on the council.</P>
    <P>The proposed representation is too biased in favour of education interests. We must address this by ensuring that children and student voices are heard. Providing for student representation is essential and progressive. If we fail the voices of generations will not be heard and it might be a missed opportunity. We must be viewed as a society which listens to children. The appalling toll of abuses over the years resulted quite often because children were not listened to, but if student representation is approached in a positive manner we will have little to fear and a great deal to gain in coming years. We are not breaking new ground by ensuring that children's voices are heard. The Children Bill, 1999, broke the ground in this area. We will pay dearly if we ignore the most important stakeholders in the education system, namely the students.</P>
    <P>It is important that any complaints procedure should protect the rights of all. It would be easy for the procedure to become a witch hunt against teachers. The Minister does not want this to happen and it would be against the interests of the education system as a whole. While it is welcome that teachers against whom complaints have been made will have recourse to the courts if they feel they have been unfairly treated, I hope the teaching council will deal with complaints effectively and fairly and without recourse to the courts and that teachers will engage with the council positively.</P>
    <P>The intention of the legislation is to ensure we as a nation have a highly professional body of teachers. No party will be served if teachers are in fear of the teaching council. It is important to put down a marker that that it is not the intention of the legislation and I am sure the council will ensure teachers are given every assistance in developing professionally and improving their performance without any fear. It is also important that the council, which has the ultimate sanction &ndash; the removal of the teacher's registration and the effective end of his or her teaching career &ndash; can engage positively with the teacher who underperforms.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="797" /> Those involved in education will need to respond rapidly to change, to recruit teachers from abroad and to provide new university courses aimed at those who want to teach and, for example, to recognise EU qualification. These changes will need to be facilitated if we are to have a vibrant and dynamic system of education. A system that is long established in schools can be slow to move. We cannot as a society afford a leisurely pace of development. We must move rapidly if we are to continue to develop effectively as a society. This is the challenge we, as legislators, are giving to the teaching council.</P>
    <P>The regulations which will be introduced under the legislation will give teachers enormous self-autonomy and with it a huge challenge. As a profession which has served the country well in the past with the numbers of well educated people it has turned out who have contributed and are contributing to the success of the nation, it will be willing, able and excited by the challenges laid down in the legislation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as positive State deregulation and I am confident it will hail a new era in the education system. I commend the legislation, congratulate the Minister and recognise the important role of the previous Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>We, on this side of the House, support the legislation as it is useful in terms of trying to improve standards in the teaching system. However, it is ironic as we debate it that we are in the midst of the worst industrial crisis in the education system for at least ten years. It is clear from the pronouncements of the ASTI and the Minister for Education and Science that the crisis will get worse before it gets better. I appeal to the Government to do everything in its power to resolve this problem sooner rather than later. As long as the ASTI's grievance remains, other teaching unions will back it. There was an upsurge in militancy in the INTO at its meeting in Cork two weeks ago and it is considering co-ordinating industrial action with the ASTI while the TUI is also moving in that direction. It is not good enough for the Government to put up its hands and say that benchmarking will solve this problem, that the unions should take their seats on the benchmarking committee and that we can proceed from there. The truth is that very few understand the concept of benchmarking and the problem&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I respect that. The Bill, which is about improving standards within the teaching system, must deal specifically with the issue of money and morale. They are the problems which are at the heart of this debate at present.</P>
      <P>I qualified as a secondary school teacher in 1992. Almost all from that class whom I still meet who qualified from Trinity College, Dublin, with a H. Dip. in education have left the teaching profession because they are completely demoralised. It is about money and morale. Unless the Teaching Council to be established under the legislation can deal with that issue, we will not make progress.</P>
      <P>This is specifically in the bailiwick of the Department of Education and Science. The handling of the current dispute by the Minister for Education and Science has been shameful. He is responsible for the considerable provocation which has occurred within the teaching profession over the past two weeks. We now understand that the Government will refuse to pay teachers for the industrial action upon which they have embarked. That will not help the current situation. If anything, it will lead to a spiral of industrial disputes from the other unions involved. The Government's response of benchmarking is not significant in terms of dealing with this problem.</P>
      <P>Young teachers cannot afford to buy a house and those in Dublin live in rented accommodation. They see many people who qualified at the same time as themselves sometimes earning twice as much as they do. The key issues behind this and the way we will solve the current industrial dispute with the ASTI and other unions is money and morale. I have heard nothing from the Government to date which leads me to the conclusion that that situation will be resolved sooner rather than later.</P>
      <P>A specific part of this Bill which has been mentioned by many other colleagues is the problem of the number of unqualified teachers within the teaching system. In response to questions asked by my colleagues, Deputies Kenny and Enright, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, confirmed that there are at least 700 unqualified teachers within the primary school sector. That is why morale is so low. There is a sense of disillusionment within the profession because, over past years, there has been an escalation in the number of unqualified teachers within the profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could make a number of distinctions. There are people who have education qualifications from other jurisdictions who find it difficult to have those recognised in this State, and I will deal with that later. There are people who have specific third level education qualifications in science and languages but who do not have a B. Ed. or a H. Dip. and who are teaching. However, there are also people with no qualifi<Col N="799" /> cations and almost no competence in any subject area who are teaching in primary schools.</P>
    <P>This is not something that can be shunted off to the Bill. This is something immediate which must be addressed by the Government. This side of the House has been bleating at regular intervals for the past two years about this growing problem within the school system. The primary school sector is arguably the most important part of education because, at that level, children pick up all the bad habits in basic numeracy and literacy skills and a range of other areas. We need to deal with the issue of the number of unqualified teachers.</P>
    <P>It is the areas of greatest disadvantage where the problem of unqualified teachers rears its head. Perhaps the Minister when summing up might respond to the point that we will have to introduce some preferential salary weighting for teachers in schools of greatest disadvantage. The pressures and stresses they must endure in areas of most disaffection in urban and some rural communities are such that some increment must be given to teachers within those schools. It has been brought to my attention by the principals of two schools in my constituency that it is almost impossible to get teachers on an ongoing basis. Teachers do not want to go to those schools because the pressures are so intense and the difficulties so great. We will have to introduce some incentivisation to encourage teachers to move to and stay in schools of greatest disadvantage. This problem will not go away.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that we have a specific problem where it is almost impossible, as I understand it, for Northern Irish teachers to enter our school system quickly. Many teachers in Northern Ireland want to teach in this jurisdiction but find it almost impossible to have their qualifications recognised. I know the Bill will deal with this issue in future and I welcome that. However, this is something immediate and in which we could make a positive intervention.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science could seek to employ a greater number of teachers from Northern Ireland and other parts of the United Kingdom who have skills to bring to bear on classes in this State. A situation could develop where many qualified teachers could move to the State if the package was right and their qualifications were recognised. That is something which must be dealt with now rather than being shunted off to the Bill, although I recognise that it will deal with the issue in future. Many teachers from Northern Ireland have been very badly treated in terms of having their specific qualifications recognised because of the bureaucratic bottlenecks which occur in the Department of Education and Science in Marlborough Street in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Speaking as someone who came through the H. Dip. course, we will have to review the teacher training colleges, specifically those which deal with secondary school education. The basic course is insufficient to provide the modern <Col N="800" /> teacher for the modern classroom. We will have to deal with this issue. I received very little instructive help for the one year I spent doing my H. Dip. in education. I learned more in the classroom. I know many teachers who readily concede that the H. Dip. year, or two as it is now, is a wasted period. Modern teaching practices are not in place in teacher training colleges and I am critical of some of those colleges.</P>
    <P>One of the most difficult problems for the modern teacher, especially in the urban setting, is that we, as legislators, frequently presume they are modern social workers. Teachers have to deal with many problems, including absenteeism. I welcome the Government's attempt to deal with the problem of truancy through the establishment of a new body to follow up on children who regularly fail to attend school. At the moment, however, in the South Dublin County Council area we do not have one person who is charged with this responsibility. The problem is yet again shunted onto the Garda Síochána. In modern, millennium Ireland it is ludicrous to have teachers and gardaí running after truants.</P>
    <P>There are specific problems in our schools, including language development and special needs. Recently I attended an anniversary event at a special needs school in Tallaght, in my constituency. That school is crying out for greater speech therapy resources and additional support in respect of many problems. Mainstream teachers are supposed to deal with all these problems, but that is not good enough. These are problems that cannot be dealt with by the Bill because they are mainstream issues that can only be dealt with through more investment by the Department of Education and Science in special needs education.</P>
    <P>I welcome one aspect of the Bill whereby, for the first time, we will at least genuflect in the direction of the quality issue. This is something from which teachers cannot run away. We all know that there is a percentage, albeit a minority, of bad teachers within the school system and it is virtually impossible to rid schools of them. Untold damage has been done to many children within the primary and secondary sectors because of the under-performance of some teachers. The great majority of teachers are disillusioned by the failure of the State to intervene to ensure that the minority of bad teachers are extradited from the system. There has been some movement towards resolving that issue in the Bill, but I am not confident that the Teaching Council will be able to eradicate a small number of very bad teachers from the school system.</P>
    <P>Last year I tabled a question on this matter to the Minister for Education and Science. It is laughable to see the number of teachers that can be dismissed because of their performance. Teachers have to get real too. I fully agree with those who argue that the issue of quality must be addressed, not just in the Bill but also by the Minister and his departmental officials. Untold damage has been inflicted on many children in <Col N="801" /> the school system because bad teachers have had such a negative effect on particular classes. The teacher unions will have to address a number of issues in that regard.</P>
    <P>We need to analyse and compare the performance of our school system, whose ultimate output is judged in terms of the child's competence in a range of disciplines, to that of other EU countries to see how we are doing. We frequently clap ourselves on the back in respect of the education system but, as Deputy Richard Bruton remarked, there is a significant and ever-growing group of children who leave the system unable to read or write. The system has let that group down. We will have to engage further in comparing, contrasting and analysing the performance of schools here to those in Germany, France and Britain. That subject has not been broached before.</P>
    <P>The teacher unions will also have to deal with the issue of days lost each year through holiday time and various events in the school calendar. Every parent knows that in recent years a significant part of the school year has been lost because of increased activities, such as parent-teacher meetings. It would be a worthwhile exercise to find out how many school days are lost every year in our schools compared to those in other EU member states. Teachers will have to get real about this aspect of education also. Whether it is through the benchmarking system &ndash; although no one understands exactly what is going on there at the moment &ndash; or another system, we will have to examine how we can improve not just the individual performance of teachers but also the overall performance of schools, based on the number of days devoted to education in any given year.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a first step along the road to registering the total number of teachers in the country and informing teachers how they can improve performance in the classroom. My party has proposed the establishment of a new body that would provide specific help to teachers and schools through a new teaching council authority. Too often, as legislators, we ask teachers to do jobs for which they are not qualified. If the Bill helps in that regard, I would welcome it.</P>
    <P>Before the dispute in the secondary school sector gets worse, the Minister should intervene and stop this &ldquo;dog in the manger&rdquo; approach that no negotiations are possible until the ASTI engages with the benchmarking process.</P>

The situation will get worse before it gets better. The response of the Minister for Education and Science in the House yesterday was provocative.

      <P>I welcome the Bill. For the past 30 years, in some guise or other, there has been debate, discussion and moves to introduce a teaching council. The idea has now come of age and, thus, we are debating this progressive legislation. I wish to pay tribute to Dr. Séamus McGuinness of Trinity College who chaired the steering group. This group brought the many partners involved in education &ndash; unions, parents and the Department of Education and Science &ndash; together in a conciliatory approach to the legislation. The broad support for the Bill in the House, as well as from the teaching profession, parents and others involved in education, is welcome. If the legislation is to start off on a solid footing it is important to have such a partnership approach.</P>
      <P>The aim of the Bill is to promote teaching as a profession and the professional development of teachers, to maintain and improve the quality of teaching in the State, to provide for the establishment of standards for education and training of teachers, to provide for the registration and regulation of teachers, to enhance professional standards and competence and to establish a Teaching Council. Society is changing and evolving very rapidly. For this reason alone we have to be very conscious of the need for the teaching profession to do likewise. It is very important that, when established, the Teaching Council is proactive in encouraging inhouse service training, for example, where programmes are thought out and put in place to ensure teachers are ahead of changes in society, be they cultural, ethnic, economic or commercial. For 60 years subjects were, more or less, thought in the same way. Then all of a sudden, with the onset of the technological revolution, Internet access and computers are the norm. Students are now able to use laptops in doing their homework. For this reason it is important that teachers are given the support they need to respond to the dramatic changes in society which will continue as the pace of the technological revolution, with the onset of e-commerce, increases in the next century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome section 7 which provides for the functions of the Teaching Council. These include: to promote teaching as a profession and to establish and maintain codes of professional conduct; to devise arrangements for registration, induction and probation; to advise the Minister on the work of the council and on matters relating to the educational qualifications for new entrants to teaching, the number of teachers and the training needs of the profession; to conduct inquiries into the fitness to teach of teachers and impose sanctions where necessary; to review and accredit pro<Col N="803" /> grammes of teacher education and training; to carry out a number of functions in relation to the recognition of the qualifications of teachers trained outside Ireland; and to co-operate with the equivalent body in Northern Ireland. In performing its functions the council shall have regard to the relevant policies as set down by the Minister and the resources provided.</P>
    <P>I have raised in the past the question of cross-Border co-operation. While the demographic structure in the Republic is different from that in the North, given the shortage of qualified teachers, resources from the North should be availed of in classrooms in the Republic. With fewer obstructions, there would be an opportunity to encourage teachers from the North to give of their time in the Republic. In this context, the examination to assess competency in Irish should be looked at.</P>
    <P>We will soon have a multi-ethnic society. Returning first and second generation Irish emigrants may not have the necessary competence in Irish or equivalent qualifications recognised in the State. It should be made as easy as possible for them to be recognised as qualified teachers. I hope we will not be bureaucratic and the Minister, the Department and the Teaching Council will be proactive in facilitating and encouraging those with qualifications and a wealth of expertise and knowledge to return. This would enable Ireland to flourish as we become more outward looking in an era of globalisation and help to enhance the system by giving students, in particular, a broad perspective. That would be a very positive development. In this context, the issue of the examination to assess competency in Irish should be addressed in an effort to make the system as flexible as possible to ensure it does not militate against those with a wealth of experience and qualifications, but who fall down in this area.</P>
    <P>Without a shadow of doubt social inclusion and associated problems present a difficulty, particularly in urban areas. In this context, the question of school accountability must be addressed. It is very important &ndash; I have raised this issue on numerous occasions, including in the debate on the Education Bill &ndash; that a central enrolment system is put in place to ensure that when a pupil drops out of a national or second level school it is known that he or she has enrolled in another school. Where a pupil drops out of a particular school it is completely unacceptable that he or she is no longer its concern on the grounds that he or she has informed it that he or she is moving to another school. It is possible that he or she is begging on the streets or has become involved in anti-social behaviour. This issue must be addressed rapidly. This can be done by way of school accountability.</P>
    <P>Literacy and numeracy levels also present a problem. While I am aware that huge resources have been invested in this area and the Minister of State present has introduced some very innovative programmes, there is no accountability <Col N="804" /> where schools are not performing well. The question must be asked why a particular school is not performing. Is it because of a lack of resources, poor teaching or social and economic problems such as social exclusion and high unemployment? While I understand the sensitivities involved &ndash; nobody wants a school to be blacklisted &ndash; there is a need to put an internal auditing system in place to see how the school concerned and its students are performing, particularly if there is a high level of truancy and if literacy and numeracy levels present a problem. If the root of the difficulty is the principal, a teacher who is not performing his or her duties or lack of resources, at least we would be aware of this and it could be addressed. There is, therefore, a need to ensure schools as well as individual teachers are held accountable under the Bill.</P>
    <P>If the Celtic tiger is to continue to roar, there is a need to ensure children with behavioural or numeracy and literacy problems are identified at an early age. Many teachers and other professionals involved in this area state that from experience they can identify from an early age, at the age of six, seven or eight, the children who will end up in Cork Prison if they do not receive assistance. There is, therefore, a need to ensure resources are targeted at this age group. I hope the Teaching Council will be proactive not alone in encouraging teachers to become involved in programmes and develop their expertise, but also in highlighting what needs to be done to ensure every child benefits from the education system. I hope it will not be a council for teachers, that it will acknowledge the broad partnership approach to education involving parents, pupils, teachers and the Department.</P>
    <P>It is argued by some that if we continue to establish independent commissions, councils and quangos of all forms, we may as well turn off the lights in this Chamber and head home, but we have now reached the point where we will provide for accountability. In a parliamentary democracy it is very important that there is accountability. Section 16 provides that the Minister may appoint a person to conduct an inquiry, where he or she is dissatisfied with the council's performance of its functions. Where the Minister, upon receipt of the report, remains dissatisfied, the director will be informed to this effect in writing and will be furnished with a copy of the report. Subject to written representations from the council and the laying of the appropriate orders before the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Minister may remove the council members and appoint an interim council pending the appointment of a new council. A new council must be appointed within 12 months of the removal of a council.</P>
    <P>That is very important. Education and teaching is integral to the development of society and the economy and it is important to have parliamentary accountability. That is why I welcome section 16. It is all very well to set up councils, commissions and so on with complete independence <Col N="805" /> and freedom but if they are not accountable at the end of the day that is a retrograde step. It is something we shied away from in the past because Ministers may have had to make difficult decisions.</P>
    <P>Section 28 provides for the establishment of a register of teachers. The council will decide the information to be held on the register, which will include specified details for each registered teacher, including the findings of any disciplinary proceedings and the period for which such information will remain on the register. The council will publish the register in such form and manner as it considers appropriate. The register may be made available for inspection at such times and in such manner as may be prescribed by the council. The Freedom of Information Act, 1997, will apply to the Teaching Council.</P>
    <P>It is important that there should be such openness. The Bill sets out that a fine of £1,500 may be imposed where people present themselves as qualified registered teachers. There must be some deterrent to dissuade people who may not be registered teachers but present themselves as such. There could be individuals who, for devious reasons, want to be part of the teaching process and have access to children. That is very much in the minds of all concerned. We must have a strong deterrent so that if people are found out they can be jailed.</P>
    <P>As regards education and training, section 37 provides for the council to review and accredit programmes of teacher education and training, to review the standards of education and training required for entry to programmes of teacher education and training, and to review the standards of knowledge, skill and competence required for the practice of teaching. Provision is made for the council to advise and consult the Minister and the institutions concerned accordingly.</P>
    <P>Section 38 provides for the council to promote the continued education and training of teachers and to carry out a number of related functions, including reviewing and accrediting programmes relating to the continuing education and training of teachers.</P>
    <P>Due to the rapid changes in society, for example the multi-ethnic issue, and in the economy, teachers are often looked on not only as teachers but social workers. They are seen as the ones who will address the issues. It is unacceptable to expect teachers to address the plethora of issues that arise from our changing society. That must be acknowledged. If we have programmes and a registration system in place and children still leave the education system with literacy and numeracy problems, we will be able to trace back to where the difficulty lies. Teacher training programmes will assist in determining who is and is not competent to teach.</P>
    <P>As regards the partnership approach, when I was in school in the late 1970s and early 1980s there was no parent involvement. The only time parents were contacted was if a pupil was to be expelled. Parents were not contacted regarding <Col N="806" /> their children's education. Now parents are very involved and want to be pro-active in the education process. That is their right. It probably met with opposition some time ago but now parent teacher meetings are held regularly and are of great benefit. That should be encouraged as it builds up a relationship between the parents and teachers which can be extremely helpful particularly in cases where there are problems with students. The continued involvement of parents in the education of their children should be encouraged under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Teaching must be seen to be attractive. In the past, teachers were well respected in society. They were held in high standing together with the local priest, garda, solicitor, bank manger&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>Nowadays teachers do not live in the areas in which they teach as they did in the past. That should be addressed to ensure that teaching is seen as a positive occupation and one of which teachers can be proud. The registration process will ensure that. The profession will have a self-regulatory body that will register people, just as is the case with doctors, lawyers, solicitors and so on. That is positive. If teaching is not seen as an attractive option the Bill will be of no avail. If we cannot encourage the best of people into the profession it will be a retrograde step. Economists and other experts will look at the economy and say one of the pillars of our success is our good system of education. There is a massive increase in education spending in this year's Estimates which augurs well for the future, particularly in the area of literacy.</P>
      <P>I wish the Bill a speedy passage through the House. There is broad support for it both from teachers and parents. I hope the council will have sufficient teeth to address the issues and give people confidence in teachers.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome this worthwhile Bill. It is timely that it should be introduced at this stage. It has the backing of all sides of the House, parents and teachers. It is important that the Teaching Council be established. It will set standards and policies for the teaching profession, regulate training and carry out functions similar to those in other professions. It is past time that this was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In introducing the Bill the Minister said that it would enhance the status and morale of the teaching profession. It is ironic that speech was made in recent weeks when we now have the debacle of the teachers being on strike for one day and working to rule on others. That is unfortunate where the secondary school teachers are on strike for one day and working to rule for a number of others. It is unfortunate that it is occurring now when we are discussing the establishment of a teaching council which will enhance the status of teachers. It is a pity teachers feel <Col N="807" /> obliged to work to rule. They are outside the PPF and feel disappointed&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>It is merely a passing reference and might make a positive contribution. I listened to what the various groups said over the past few days and if ever I saw somebody hold out an opportunity to resolve this issue, it was Mr. McCluskey, the president of the ASTI. That was not grasped by the Minister so perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, will convey it to him and plead with him to sit down with the groups concerned and try to resolve it. Mr. McCluskey said that if there were meaningful negotiations, everything would be called off. That is worthwhile and holds out the prospect of resolution. I hope the opportunity will be grasped because the losers are the children.</P>
      <P>The teaching profession is at a low ebb. Recently, the TUI expressed dissatisfaction with its situation and sought negotiations to change the playing field. More recently, the INTO indicated it will come forward with proposals in the benchmarking process. Why is this happening now? Teachers feel they are not getting just rewards for their work. There are between 45,000 and 50,000 teachers in this country. The education system has served this country well. The booming economy can be traced to well educated young people and the teachers believe they should be rewarded for that.</P>
      <P>The question is whether we are rewarding them at present. I have a copy of the new pay scales for teachers. According to this, a young teacher starting in the profession after attending college for three years and securing a degree will receive a salary of £15,000. The Minister of State is shaking his head but I have the full salary details with me. From 1 April 2000, the common basic salary was £14,957 and from 1 October 2000 it was £15,406. If one looks at the salaries available to other people, it does not compare well.</P>
      <P>Last Saturday a constituent called to my clinic. She was working in an electronics company. She had no qualifications and had left school with the leaving certificate. She is on a production line and her P60 indicated that she earns just under £20,000. She has been in the job for a couple of years but is still a young girl. Our teachers, who start on an income of £15,000, will, after 26 years, if they are good and remain in the profession, reach the maximum level of £30,000 or, to be exact, £29,944 from 1 October. The length of time required to reach the maximum salary level in the teaching profession is unsatisfactory. Many teachers believe it is too long and should be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="808" /> I must declare an interest in this subject because I was a teacher.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I recall when the incremental scale ran to 18 years. Our union took up the case at the time and secured the addition of the long service increments. That was about 18 years ago. The long service increments were introduced at the request of the teaching unions but now they want to reverse that. It is an interesting phenomenon.</P>
      <P>Teachers believe they are underpaid. They are badly paid when compared to people with comparable qualifications. Young people coming out of college are earning big money. I was talking to a teacher last evening about this. He told me about his son who had spent two years in college, did not like it and failed, went off to do something else, returned and repeated and failed again. His son is now working in the computer industry. He is 23 years of age and is earning £2,000 more than a teacher with 31 years service. This young lad did not have formal qualifications although I taught him and he was a bright fellow. Obviously, he took to computers and is performing well. However, the comparable salaries available across the board leave teachers feeling bad and disgusted.</P>
      <P>Look at teachers who have additional responsibilities in schools. A principal in a small school, for example, a school with up to six teachers, receives a principal's allowance. The Minister of State will be aware that the allowance at present is £4,629. What is the principal of that school expected to do for that sum? The range of responsibilities is too much and it is unreasonable to expect them to be carried out. They must organise school transport, supervision and school safety for children coming to school.</P>
      <P>During last year's local elections I canvassed a wide area of my constituency. The major talking point was the speed of traffic, particularly around schools, and the difficulties caused by people dropping and picking up children. Times have changed since pupils walked or cycled to school. Virtually all pupils are now driven to school. The melee that occurs around schools is a major concern. There have been accidents and there will be more. Remarkably, the Department says it is not its responsibility but is a matter for the local authority. The local authorities say they do not have enough money and do not have responsibility inside the school gate. They might suggest that the school move the school wall. This issue must be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal is stuck in the middle. It is his or her responsibility to ensure that all is well. He must organise the cleaning of the school, secure secretarial services and deal with the parents, the Department and the board of management. In many cases, he is piggy in the middle. If the toilets or heating break down or there is no water, the principal must come to the rescue. If he or she <Col N="809" /> cannot find a plumber in time, he or she must do the job themselves or close down the school and take the consequences. Principals have a huge and responsible job. The remarkable aspect is that all this work is to be done in addition to their key role of teaching.</P>
    <P>As I have said on previous occasions, there is a great case to be made for recruiting part-time teachers to help principals in these smaller schools. It would be a major step forward if a principal teacher in a four or five teacher school was allowed to look after the principal's duties for one day per week through an additional teacher being employed to take on the principal's teaching responsibilities during that time. It can be done in a number of ways. Teachers could be sent from one school to another to take on those responsibilities. However, that would not be the best option. There would be all sorts of difficulties with teachers gadding about from place to place.</P>
    <P>There is a huge pool of talent and resources among the teachers who have taken early retirement and would be delighted to do an odd few hours each week without huge responsibility or being confined within the classroom on a full-time basis. That resource could be used in a variety of ways. The Minister of State will be familiar with the relatively new arrangement of a resource teacher being available for specific children. The Department may sanction the provision of a resource teacher to teach for two and a half hours a week in a school, but it is difficult to get a teacher to teach for that short a period. However, there may be a retired teacher in the locality who would love to keep his or her hand in and to take up such a position and combine it with another similar position. Such a person could do that job, would be fresh coming into it and would contribute a good deal. The Minister of State should not go down the road of bureaucracy whereby the Department would employ such teachers. It would be preferable if he negotiated with the principal or the board of management concerned and allocated them the amount he estimates it would cost to cover the employment of such a teacher, whether it be £3,000, £4,000 or £5,000. In that way, that amount could be used to the best possible advantage and would avoid the Department being the formal employer of such teachers. There is a great deal to be said for that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelleher mentioned the many teachers who were trained in Northern Ireland who may be available to take up teaching positions but who would have a difficulty regarding fluency in Irish and dealing with Irish exams. Perhaps they could be taken on in our schools and a resource teacher, perhaps a retired teacher, could be given responsibility for dealing with such teachers' shortcomings in the teaching of Irish. Rather than such work being a burden, otherwise qualified teachers could be given a few hours off and a resource teacher could fill in for them. A great deal of meaningful work could be done in that way. Will the Minister of State take on board <Col N="810" /> those views and negotiate with the unions on them? I am sure retired teachers would be willing to take on such work.</P>
    <P>When I addressed a teachers' group some time ago and threw out some of those ideas, I was shocked by the number of teachers who asked me when that arrangement would be implemented. I had not made it clear that those were just my views. A number of female teachers, in particular, said they were tired and would like to get out of teaching and if they thought they could keep their hands in and have a reason to get up every day and do a little bit, they would love to do that. Such an arrangement would take the pressure off them. That resource could and should be made available. Perhaps the Minister of State would talk to his boss about those matters.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of facilities in schools and the availability of supplementary facilities for teachers. The village of prefabs that surrounds many existing school buildings, particularly secondary schools that developed rapidly in the 1980s, is frightening. I taught in a prefab for several years. One day a cow escaped from the local mart and ended up in my classroom &ndash; she learned a great deal that day. While prefabs are a necessary evil, we should move more rapidly towards replacing them.</P>
    <P>The capital programme for schools should be enhanced. Sometimes politicians say they should be highly respected in the community and that reminds me of what a constituency colleague, when Minister for Education, said at the opening of an extension to Mullingar community college.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The extension replaced a number of prefabs. She said how delighted she was to be there and it was her ambition in life to get rid of such prefab villages. That went down well with the teachers and parents present who thought that the then Minister for Education was great. While the capital expenditure for schools in 1986 was approximately £30 million, when Deputy O'Rourke became Minister for Education in 1987 she cut that capital programme down to £15 million. Is it any wonder people become cynical of politicians who will make such declarations and then do something different? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need to move forward with providing back-up facilities for teachers. There is a major problem regarding the testing of children who may have difficulties, particularly in primary schools. Principals tell me time after time that when they have asked for a child to be assessed, who they consider may be dyslexic or have ADD, and refer the matter to the local health board, the local health boards, my own, the Midland Health Board, in particular, despite the matter being the subject of numerous parliamentary questions, state that matter is not its responsibility. The health boards will not face up to their responsibility to help teachers to have those children assessed and on those assessments the necessary <Col N="811" /> resources could be put in place. It is crucial we identify the children with difficulties at an early age to enable their difficulties to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Another major problem in our schools relates to children with special needs, including children with disabilities. We are not quick enough to identify those and thereby sanction what is needed, be it a resource teacher or a classroom assistant. We must move quickly to bring those necessary resource personnel on stream to assist such children.</P>
    <P>With regard to graduates who might want to become primary teachers, a number of my colleagues mentioned a course in Dublin to facilitate such graduates. Given the advances in modern technology, perhaps that course could be given through distance education and modules of it could be taught at weekends in resources such as the excellent resource in my area, Multyfarnham Agricultural College, which has 130 bedrooms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>That college would be ideal for holding such courses. The recruitment of graduates would be a great way to quickly address the shortage of primary teachers.</P>
      <P>Goldsmith's poem about the village school master contains the lines:</P>
      <P>And still they gaz'd, and still the wonder grew,</P>
      <P>That one small head could carry all he knew.</P>
      <P>How things have changed in rural Ireland? The village school master was held in very high esteem, was the pillar of society, president of the local GAA club and presided over everything that happened, but the status of the teacher has greatly changed. Morale within the teaching profession has changed. I notice a major change when I occasionally visit the school where I taught for 20 years. While I have been out of the classroom eleven and a half years and hope to remain out for another while, when I return I notice a great change in noise levels, discipline levels and the approach of the children. Society has changed a good deal, yet the poor teachers are supposed to cope.</P>
      <P>I remember 25 years ago when I taught in a school in which there were 600 children, the principal whispering in the ears of all the teachers that a new boy had come to the school whose parents had separated. He said the boy was going through a rough time and that we would need to be particularly careful to keep an eye on him and make sure all was well. How things have changed. Given the number of children who come from families where there is marriage breakdown, that is the norm today and teachers have to cope with all that it involves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We have always believed an excellent education system is one of the key foundations upon which our economic prosperity is built. An all rounded education system equips children with the necessary qualification and opportunities to help them integrate into the workplace. It also affords our children and students leaving secondary school the necessary tools to contribute in a very positive sense to broader society.</P>
      <P>In the late 1960s substantial financial investment within our education system was a cornerstone of Government policy. Successive Governments since then have sought to increase spending in our primary, second and third level education systems when they have been able. The Government has substantially increased funding across all education sectors and will continue to do so. The Minister for Education and Science and his predecessor, Deputy Martin, are to be commended on their ingenuity and determination to introduce training and educational courses in technology, computer science and Internet-related activities for all schools in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The IT 2000 programme is a very important educational initiative which will ensure that when our children leave secondary school they are equipped with the necessary skills in computer science. We know from our experiences with US companies since the 1970s that they wish to invest in Ireland because we can provide a workforce that is highly educated and determined as well as being fully equipped with all the skills of computer-related activities. This is even more important now with the advent of e-commerce. The Government is working hard to entice as many new hi-tech industries in the e-commerce and Internet fields to Ireland. An educational system which ensures a grounding in computer science is an intrinsic and central element in achieving a high level of inward investment in the hi-tech field now and in the future.</P>
      <P>Lack of educational attainment remains a significant factor in the risk and persistence of long-term unemployment. This has been spelt out time and again when statistics on the issue are presented. In 1997 the proportion of the population of 15 years or over with education to primary level was 27% for the whole State. The regional breakdown of that figure was 33% for the Border, western and midland counties and 26% for the southern and eastern region. However, between 1993 and 1998 there has been a national reduction of 80,000, or 9%, in the number of people with a primary education only. It is clear that the overall national trend is towards an increasingly educated population. This reflects the availability of free second level education since the 1960s, the young profile of the population and the substantial investment in human resources development within the two previous Structural Fund programming rounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must break down the barriers to educational attainment. It is very difficult to integrate into the workplace effectively if one has a pri<Col N="813" /> mary education only. That is why the Government is bringing forward innovative schemes to ensure that all people receive positive education and training opportunities. There is also a strong commitment to linking vocational training and educational programmes to the skill needs of the marketplace. One must also ensure that the education system is equipped to increase its use of information and communications technologies and to meet the rapidly changing information technology skills needs of the economy.</P>
    <P>The links between economic growth and education have been intensely researched and comprehensively proven. Social inclusion measures in the education sector include an early education initiative, a school completion initiative, early literacy measures, Traveller education and a school guidance service. The ESRI has already identified the priority for investment in education as being the needs of those whom the system fails. Addressing educational disadvantage requires intervention in the context of a continuation of educational provision from early childhood through to adulthood, with a strong focus on preventative strategies.</P>
    <P>The aim of the early education measure is to provide early interventions to encourage long-term educational participation and to address literacy and numeracy difficulties. In the period 2000 to 2006 it is intended to build on the experiences of the eight to 15 year olds who participated in the early school leaver pilot initiatives which started in 1998 and the stay in school programme of 1999. Schools involved in these initiatives will be required to operate on a multi-agency basis, establishing appropriate cross-community links. The Government is committed to raising the retention level of post-primary students to completion of the senior cycle and to improving the participation of all children in education and training systems. It is also committed to education in the form of lifelong learning. The demands of the global knowledge economy are such that a lifelong learning ethos is needed to underpin long-term employability and living standards.</P>
    <P>The back to education initiatives involve the merging and continuation of existing levels of provision under the Youthreach programme, senior Traveller training centres, the VTO scheme and post-leaving certification courses. The back to education initiative will play a key role both in addressing the needs of those with minimal or no educational qualifications and in offering a re-entry route to those who wish to upgrade their skills in line with emerging needs. Access to information and communication technology, electronic and technical training skills, enterprise development, business, tourism, arts and crafts, child care and a broad range of other disciplines within the industry and services sector will ensure that life-long learning is a central Government policy.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the Bill that there will be a transparent course of action with procedures to safeguard the rights and duties of all parties with <Col N="814" /> appropriate remedies where such are needed. The Bill will copperfasten the already high standard of education provided which, as the Minister said last month, has played such an important role in the recent economic and social development of the State. It is correct that teachers should have their professional role formally recognised by the State. This will confirm the status of teachers, entitle them to regulate their own affairs and empower them with greater responsibility for the standards and quality of Irish education. The high quality of the teaching profession in Ireland and the need to ensure this quality is maintained into the future was a key theme of the Minister's speech here on 24 October last. I support the clear and unequivocal goals of this Bill and I hope other Members do likewise.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing his time. We have heard much discussion not just here but in the media about how the teaching profession has changed. This is an important time for that profession and the promotion, development and advancement of teaching is best achieved through an independent statutory agency such as the Teaching Council.</P>
      <P>It is important that we regulate professional practice and oversee teacher education programmes in addition to assuming responsibility for furthering the highest levels of service to the public. This is an important step for the teaching profession. It has been arrived at through consultation and it is broadly welcomed by teachers.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins mentioned the changing structure of society and it is clear that jobs in Ireland are geared towards skilled individuals. That is why it is so important that the Irish education system is of such a high standard. We have achieved that and it is important to maintain the high standards in the teaching profession. We must recognise the professionalism of teachers so that we can maintain the numbers of people in first, second and third level education. That is important for our future.</P>
      <P>I compliment the work of the Minister and his predecessor in education, particularly on increasing the level of funding in all sectors of education. That is important and it is something that is recognised and appreciated by the entire teaching profession. It is important to recognise that there is a clear distinction between the responsibilities of the Teaching Council and the unions. The Teaching Council will be solely concerned with the qualitative and professional matters within its remit, whereas negotiations on issues such as pensions, salaries and conditions of service will remain within the remit of the unions. There is no confusion between those two bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the functions of the council, the first of which is to promote teaching as a profession and to establish and maintain codes of professional conduct. Deputy McGrath highlighted a fact earlier with which we are all familiar. He said that ten, 15 or 20 years ago <Col N="815" /> school teachers were held in the highest respect within the community. That respect is richly deserved because the role played by teachers is even more difficult today than it might have been ten, 15 or 20 years ago. Coming from a family of teachers, I am particularly conscious of the importance of the role of the teacher in society, and the people who criticise teachers are not fully aware of the amount of work that goes on behind the scenes. They tend to talk about teachers' holidays and the short hours they work relative to somebody working in industry, but the reality is that a great deal of preparation and work is done at home and there is a great deal of stress. The teachers who take their jobs seriously, which I believe is the vast majority of them, have made teaching the fine profession it is today. While there have been changes in relation to discipline in schools which have made the teacher's job more difficult, the vast majority of them are doing an excellent job. The Teaching Council recognises the professionalism of teachers and will enhance the profession over the years.</P>
    <P>The second function of the council is to establish and maintain a register of teachers and to determine the qualifications and criteria for registration. It is important that these criteria are set out clearly because I know, from talking to many teachers in my constituency, that the availability of teachers, and trying to find a substitute teacher, have posed a major problem. There are hundreds of unqualified teachers substituting for teachers in schools throughout the country and while they may be doing a good job in many cases, it is important that we do not allow standards to drop in the teaching profession. If the criteria on how a teacher can be registered on the register of teachers are set out clearly, there will be no doubt in the minds of the parents, students or the public that we are maintaining the best standards in our schools.</P>
    <P>Another function of the council is to advise the Minister on the work of the council, matters relating to educational qualifications for new entrants to teaching, the number of teachers and the training needs of the profession. While the unions have done their best to keep the Minister informed of the requirements of the profession, the council will have a clear role in keeping the Minister of the day updated on the needs of the profession. That close contact is to be welcomed because when people qualify as teachers, that is not the end of their learning. Teachers learn throughout their lives. The needs of teachers are changing. There are many special needs pupils in today's classrooms who are now attending mainstream education, including Travellers and people from disadvantaged backgrounds. The whole structure of society is changing and it is important that teachers upgrade their needs and that the correct educational programmes are provided, whether they are in an urban or a rural setting. Teachers' educational needs must be met <Col N="816" /> and proper training should be available to the teaching profession.</P>
    <P>That area is covered under another function of the council which is to review and accredit programmes of teacher education and training. I have heard many teachers talk about that issue. I taught English and Irish in a national school but foreign languages were not taught. An array of foreign languages are currently being taught at national school level. That is something national school teachers have to be able to provide because that is what society is demanding of young people for the future.</P>
    <P>Another function of the council is to co-operate with the equivalent body in Northern Ireland. That is important because there is much that we can learn from the people in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers raised the question of those teachers who do not have Irish. It is true that Irish is not necessary in some teaching jobs but it is important from a cultural point of view that we highlight the importance of the Irish language. It is important that our teachers have the necessary Irish qualifications but it is fair to say that some jobs in the profession might not necessitate having fluency in the Irish language. That is something that should be examined on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>Under section 8, the membership of the Teaching Council will be 37, the majority of whom will be made up of registered teachers. What we are talking about here is self-regulation, which is important, and the consultation process I referred to earlier is reflected in the make-up of the Teaching Council. Teachers cannot but be pleased that of the 37 members, 11 will be from primary level and 11 from post-primary level but many of them can be elected by their own groups and teacher unions. That is important because they are the people who are being affected by this council. We must also take into consideration school management organisations, national associations of parents and the Minister for Education and Science who will be able to nominate people to this council. Everybody is represented and that is what gives the Teaching Council such strength. All people who have an involvement in education will be represented and will have their point of view put forward.</P>
    <P>Section 23 deals with the way the Teaching Council will operate. I note it will do its work through three major committees. Should it deem it necessary to set up other committees, however, that can be done. The three committees are the executive committee, the investigating committee and the disciplinary committee. I welcome this move because investigation and discipline is something that happens in schools from time to time but the length of time it takes to investigate a case and impose discipline is very stressful on the teacher, if it is unfounded. It is also stressful on the person making a complaint who wants to see discipline meted out if necessary. I welcome the fact that these committees are in place and I hope that if complaints are made, they can be <Col N="817" /> investigated thoroughly and quickly and that the appropriate action can be put into place. I welcome the fact that there are provisions in the Bill for sanctions to be imposed. That gives the Bill a great deal of strength. If it did not have such power it would have been useless.</P>
    <P>Access to the teachers' register will simplify the tasks of schools wishing to assess the professional status of new teachers and potential employees. That is important because from time to time schools have to employ substitute teachers or employ people on a temporary basis and if they have a register at their disposal, it will make that job much easier.</P>
    <P>The information to be held on the register is of critical importance, particularly the findings of any disciplinary hearing including the length of time the information is to remain on the register. In cases where promotion is envisaged, or simply the employment of a substitute or temporary teacher in a school, it is important that the school would have access to that type of information before a person would be offered a position to avoid possible later difficulties. The register is important in that regard. The other information on the register is important but it is what one would expect.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a step forward and it is welcomed by the teaching profession. It will improve the professionalism of what is an excellent job in our society and one I hope will continue to be a professional job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is timely as the teaching profession is under siege, demoralised and, in many cases, disillusioned. It also comes at a time when many teachers are experiencing burn-out and loss of status and are falling behind in terms of pay. Many Deputies said there was a time when the teacher was at the centre of the community and was a very respected figure. Teachers are still respected but they do not have the same status.</P>
      <P>I have a vested interest in this issue as I come from a teaching background. However, teachers have not been treated fairly by the Government on this occasion. The current strike could have been averted if meaningful discussions had taken place. The only way it will end is if such discussions are held. The ASTI has offered to enter meaningful discussions with the Minister but, unfortunately, the Minister will not meet its representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ASTI is not a signatory to the PPF. This debacle must be brought to an end and some morale must be restored to the teaching profession. If this dispute carries on it will fester and teachers will become more entrenched in their attitudes, leading to a very long strike. The dispute could also become very bitter after Christmas when we approach examinations and parents become concerned about their children's future. The Minister should consider entering into discussions immediately to resolve this mat<Col N="818" /> ter. The dispute will have to be resolved eventually, so why not start now?</P>
    <P>I entered politics in the 1980s when there was little money and when any proposals put to the House for cuts were resisted. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, was quite good at that. I remember when teachers marched on Croke Park and the manner in which Fianna Fáil manipulated the teachers' unions and encouraged them to take strike action and every other type of action. It is ironic and unfortunate that it is a Fianna Fáil Minister who is now refusing to meet teachers. This must send a message to all members of Fianna Fáil, particularly those who are teachers, to talk some sense into their Minister to try to create the conditions which would restore morale to a profession which, more than any other, made the people of Ireland. Even before the introduction of national education, the teacher was at the heart of Irish society going back to penal times.</P>
    <P>This debate also provides an opportunity to examine other aspects of teaching. Teaching is not getting any easier. Students are less compliant and parents are more demanding, in some cases, and totally disinterested in others. We must also face up to the problem of illiteracy. Deputy McGrath referred to the early identification, assessment and evaluation of students' behaviour, IQ levels and so on. This process should be carried out at six years of age and the Minister of State has a particular interest in this issue. The earlier learning difficulties are identified, the better as measures can then be taken to address the problem. Due to the lack of teachers' resources some children enter second level education without being able to read or write. This is not a reflection on teachers who, in some cases, are saddled with 30 or 40 pupils per class. Such teachers do not have the necessary resources. I acknowledge the improved provision of resource teachers but there is a need for further improvement.</P>
    <P>The provision of roads, broad-band communications and other services are indicators of economic growth. However, the future of this country depends on how we nurture our children. If we do not provide facilities in areas such as child care, health and, in particular, education, future society will be very different. Our economic future depends on nurturing all our children equally. Children with learning difficulties should be identified at a very early stage &ndash; I suggest six years of age &ndash; and resources must then be put in place to address their needs. Learning difficulties must be tackled head on at primary level.</P>
    <P>We must provide additional resources for schools in disadvantaged areas and more supports for teachers dealing with children from such backgrounds. Unfortunately, psychological pressures on students are becoming more prevalent. We spoke of and read about this issue in the past during teacher training but it is now a reality. Modern life brings advantages but it also brings pressures. That is why we must introduce a properly funded, nationwide school psychological ser<Col N="819" /> vice. There is also a need for additional remedial support. There is no school psychological service at primary level in north Kerry. Such a service has been promised but has not been delivered and I ask the Minister of State's officials to examine this issue.</P>
    <P>Teachers are often criticised over the amount of time they spend teaching which can be 22 hours per week at post-primary level. Twenty two hours per week of constant, intensive contact with students is quite long. I would be in favour of decreasing the number of hours spent teaching but ensuring teachers compensate for that by increased dialogue with fellow teachers and undertaking additional research into their subjects. We must examine the number of contact hours involved as this issue is not as simple as some believe. Twenty two hours of intensive contact with students puts a lot of pressure on teachers who are doing their job properly. My wife is a teacher and she is exhausted by the end of the week because she takes her job very seriously. She did not ask me to raise this issue but I am sure all teachers who do likewise find that 22 hours of intensive contact is tough and requires much endurance. The pupil-teacher ratio is 30:1 in many schools. We must examine this issue given that resources are available.</P>
    <P>A sensible approach was taken to the establishment of the Teaching Council. As I understand it, a special committee was first set up which was representative of all interested parties. The committee came up with broad suggestions on how the council should be structured and appointed and who should be represented on it. A technical working group then developed the detail of the Bill. The establishment of the council is behind schedule as the first meeting was supposed to take place in January 2000.</P>

      <P>I was delighted to welcome the Minister for Industry, Trade and Technology of Newfoundland and Labrador, Mrs. Sandra Kelly, at a State reception held in her honour at Dublin Castle on Monday, 9 October in connection with the visit to Ireland of the business mission, comprising 23 companies and development agencies and organised by Ireland Business Partnerships and the St. John's Board of Trade, she was leading. We observed the signing of four contracts between Newfoundland and Irish organisations and companies. One of these contracts was signed by Mrs. Kelly and the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, and it entails the co-development of an e-learning repository for small enterprise for Ireland's county enterprise boards in association with a Newfoundland based company, Operation ONLINE. The repository, which will be piloted in January 2001 and officially launched in March 2001, is expected to include on-line training programmes for e-business, learning modules and other resource materials.</P>
      <P>A great deal of progress has been made in the co-operation under the memorandum of understanding. I am aware of Deputy Bruton's keen interest in this matter. A detailed note of the extensive developments involved is available and I will forward a copy to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Reflecting the real worthwhile results achieved under the memorandum of understanding and the great potential for the future, I took the opportunity, in my remarks at the Dublin Castle reception, to announce the establishment of a new entity, Newfoundland and Labrador Business Partnerships, a counterpart of Ireland Business Partnerships which was established in Newfoundland and Labrador to oversee and manage developments under the memorandum of understanding between our two countries. I envisage that the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, will chair a new co-ordinating board, with a senior official in my Department as his deputy and with a strengthened secretariat drawn from our two Departments. The process of bringing this board into being has commenced.</P>

      <P>Many areas have been con<Col N="821" /> sidered. One of the companies involved is covered in the memorandum of understanding in terms of co-operating in the provision of technology based services for marine environmental management. In addition, we must look at the other areas in respect of which we can co-operate.</P>
      <P>We have given consideration to the various areas dealt with my our agencies and matched them with those covered by Newfoundland's agencies. We have considered, for example, geological surveys and the role of the Marine Institute. Many of the companies linking up with our State agencies can offer expertise in these areas. A great level of interest in co-operation has been expressed by both the companies and the State agencies involved.</P>
      <P>A number of beneficial discussions have also taken place between the Department of Mines and Energy and the Department of Public Enterprise on trying to encourage development on a number of the issues raised at the North Atlantic Mineral Symposium. We have also covered a wide variety of new areas where real potential exists.</P>

      <P>Has the Taoiseach had any personal contact with the new premier of Newfoundland? Has he considered making contact with the former premier, Brian Tobin, who has moved to a position in the federal Government of Canada where he has responsibility for the general development of Atlantic Canada &ndash; which encompasses Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick &ndash; in respect of which the co-operation agreement with Newfoundland could be a basis for further exchanges?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the Irish and Newfoundland economies compliment each other in the sense that Newfoundland is an area of emigration whereas Ireland is one of immigration? In that context, does he further agree that greater numbers of people from Newfoundland than heretofore could be encouraged to work here?</P>

In conjunction with the new Administration in Newfoundland we will ensure that the memorandum continues to flourish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 30, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I met the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, in Downing Street on Tuesday, 10 October, at Biarritz on Thursday, 12 October, on the eve of the informal European Council meeting, in Seoul on the margins of the ASEM Summit, and we have also spoken on numerous occasions by telephone. I have also had meetings with Deputy First Minister, Séamus Mallon, Mr. Ken Maginnis and Mr. Gerry Adams. These meetings are part of the intensive contacts in which the two Governments are engaged, directly and with the pro-Agreement parties and which will continue in the immediate future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in the course of exchanges at the 21st plenary meeting of the British-Irish Interparlia<Col N="825" /> mentary Body in Galway on 9 October last, if people stretched themselves and made one last heroic effort, the remaining problems could be sorted out. That is what we are working towards and what we are determined to achieve.</P>
    <P>In terms of the decisions reached at the meeting of the Ulster Unionist Council on 28 October, it is clear that new difficulties on the peace process have arisen. I stress again that these difficulties can be resolved. While I do not wish to understate the difficulties, it is important for us to approach the matter coolly and not to over-react. Two important sectoral meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council, on trade and business development and on tourism, took place on 27 October, the eve of the Ulster Unionist Council meeting. North-South ministerial meetings are continuing, including meetings on EU programmes and on agriculture which took place last week. Further meetings are planned.</P>
    <P>A series of intensive contacts between all sides is already under way and will continue over the coming days and beyond in order to help ensure a speedy resolution to current problems. As has been seen many times before in this process, we will need to build and enhance confidence on all sides if we are to resolve the current difficulties. In this connection, the second inspection of IRA arms dumps was an important confidence building measure.</P>
    <P>A summit meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference was held on 17 December 1999, on the same day as the first plenary meeting of the British-Irish Council. I did not discuss the matter of a further summit meeting of the conference with Mr. Blair during our recent meetings, but this is a matter which can be pursued at official level. The second plenary meeting of the British-Irish Council, which, as Deputies will be aware, was postponed due to the untimely and deeply regretted death of the First Minister of Scotland, Donald Dewar, will be rescheduled for a date to be agreed among the participants. It is hoped that it will be held before Christmas.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated in relation to the meeting with the Sinn Féin President, Gerry Adams, in Dublin on Friday, 3 November, we reviewed current difficulties in considerable detail, including in relation to the North-South Ministerial Council. Due to the focus of the meeting, I did not raise on this occasion &ndash; although I have done so on several other occasions &ndash; the situation of people exiled from Northern Ireland as a result of threats from paramilitary organisations. However, the position of the Government on this deplorable situation is well known and has been made very clear to parties with influence in this area on many occasions.</P>
    <P>Finally, the wording of our national anthem has not been raised in the context of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, nor do I see any reason that it should be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's view is that the <Col N="826" /> current difficulty should be dealt with coolly and kept in proportion and the achievements to date set against whatever difficulties there may be at the moment, which are considerable. First, in regard to the difficulties, has he had any indication from the republican movement as to why the IRA is unwilling to engage in discussion with General de Chastelain? Second, has he had any indication from the republican movement as to whether it is its intention to decommission its weapons at any likely foreseeable stage? Has he asked it that question and, if so, has he got an answer?</P>
      <P>Third, on a related matter, given that the Good Friday Agreement provides for cross-Border co-operation in trade, has the Taoiseach made representations to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer to withdraw the proposal in his pre-budget statement which would involve a special levy being paid by Irish or non-UK trucks which use roads in Northern Ireland in view of the fact that if this were to be put in place it would artificially interfere with cross-Border trade and the carriage of goods from one part of the Republic to another if they go through Northern Ireland on their journey? Has the Taoiseach taken up this matter with the British authorities at any stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first two matters, it is my wish that the IRA would engage as early as possible with General de Chastelain to discuss real and meaningful efforts to deal with arms, arms dumps and related matters. It has not been possible to achieve this. On the Deputy's question about the response, I give the response I get rather than my view. The response continually is that matters which have been set out by the British Government in discussions, some of which I have been a party to, have not developed, for example, in areas where there was a <i>quid pro quo</i> or understanding on demilitarisation, the Patten report, OTRs and other related issues, confidence building measures and a determination by the British Government which would show confidence in the process. Since these have not happened, the IRA or its intermediaries have not engaged in discussions with General de Chastelain for many months.</P>
      <P>We have to make progress on this issue as part of the outstanding issues. However, we are unlikely to see progress on this issue until some of the other issues have been moved forward as well. It is inevitable that these issues will move in tandem. There will be no understanding on the other issues until there is some indication on the success of the dialogue with General de Chastelain. We have gone beyond the stage where there will be a meeting between the IRA intermediary, or one of its members, and General de Chastelain if there is not going to be real dialogue and progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>For many months I have not <Col N="827" /> been available for a meeting unless it is one of substance. I want to be frank about this. If a meeting is the same as a previous one, it is not of much benefit and it will only lead us into further difficulties and create more difficulties on the other side.</P>
      <P>We need to secure an understanding that the IRA will re-engage with General de Chastelain and this will lead to some process. I cannot say exactly what will happen at the end of the day, but if other things happen, the dialogue could be meaningful. It is abundantly clear to me and everyone else &ndash; there may be difficulties on other issues, but there is an acknowledgement by everyone of the reality on this issue &ndash; that in order to achieve these two points there must be progress on the completion and finalisation of the Patten report, meaningful progress on demilitarisation as per the earlier commitments and more movement by the British Government and republican movement on this issue and the OTR issues. I believe this is the fair view not only of the Government but also of the British Government, the UUP and others.</P>
      <P>On the trade-related matter, I have discussed this with the Minister for Finance, particularly as regards the statement by many countries that questions arise as to whether this measure is compatible with EU law in the first instance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the 6 May historic statement by the IRA that it wants to verifiably put arms beyond use, will the Taoiseach agree that the continuous inspections of an existing number of arms dumps does not equate with verifiably putting arms beyond use? Is that the position held by the Taoiseach and the Government? Will the Taoiseach agree that Article 15.6 of the Constitution is being violated while these dumps exist within the State in that it states: &ldquo;No military or armed force other than a military or armed force raised and maintained by the Oireachtas shall be raised or maintained for any purpose whatsoever&rdquo;? Are we not going down a very difficult road in that continuous inspection of existing sites will validate the maintenance of these arms dumps and the right of a person to hold such dumps?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the last question is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. The position of the Government, the Garda and the Army is that they are always on the alert to find dumps and they take whatever weapons they find. They are never validated regardless of what goes on. The Garda and the security forces are always vigilant and have been successful in the past year in finding some dumps. That position never changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope Maarti Ahtisaari and Cyril Ramaphosa <Col N="828" /> continue to inspect arms dumps. They have an understanding with the people with whom they keep in contact and then they report back to the two Governments. It is hoped they will make further inspections. Deputy Hayes asked whether I thought there should be more inspections. It is obvious that I do, but that is not enough to resolve the issue. That is precisely the dilemma in which Mr. Trimble and his colleagues find themselves. If there is not more engagement in arms inspections, there will not be a conclusion.</P>
    <P>Equally, I am slow to comment on what would bring this to a conclusion, as is everybody else, because the bar may be put too high and more difficulties would be created. The view of the republican movement is that if the British Government had made more determined progress since 6 May last, over six months ago, it could have moved in more unspecified innovative and imaginative ways. I cannot make a judgment on that. For example, even if there had not been a resolution of the OTR issues, the British Government at the Labour Party conference many weeks ago laid down the circumstances in which it would deal with people who will be repatriated but who had a criminal record and it set down a mechanism to do so, yet nothing has happened on those issues as far as I, the republican movement, Sinn Féin and the SDLP are aware. That creates difficulties.</P>
    <P>The way to deal with this is to be alert to the difficulties, to try to maintain momentum to resolve them but not to overstate them. It is a pity there are difficulties but at the same time there has been immense progress and we must find resolutions to these difficulties in as calm a way as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the Taoiseach's meeting with Mr. Séamus Mallon of the SDLP, has thought been given, in the interest of the common cause of peace on both parts of the island and given the leap of faith required of people in Northern Ireland to accept changes in policing, to updating or reforming police institutions on this side of the Border and to the possibility of trying to assist through common cause the acceptance of changes in the North if such was the case?</P>
      <P>In discussions with Séamus Mallon or any other ministerial representatives in the Northern Assembly were agricultural issues, which are pressing on both sides of the Border, raised, particularly BSE and the rural environmental protection scheme which operates to two different standards, North and South, as will organic certification in future? The Minister of State, Deputy Davern, is familiar with this. Has a common approach been adopted to ensure both sides of the Border have common standards on such issues?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been numerous meetings on agricultural issues. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, and the Ministers of State at the <Col N="829" /> Department, Deputies Davern and O'Keeffe, co-operate closely with their Northern counterparts. This emanates from close co-operation between farming organisations and the Department over a long number of years in regard to EU programmes, the BSE crisis and rural development. There are many areas of co-operation. The IFA and the ICMSA have close dealings with the farming association in Northern Ireland. I am not sure about meetings in the past two weeks on the issue we discussed yesterday but at various meetings agricultural issues have been discussed. The first area of co-operation two years ago was in regard to the pig trade and the difficulties in Northern Ireland when some factories were destroyed.</P>
      <P>On policing, the Garda has already made clear that it will give any help it can through its training programmes and facilities in Templemore and through experience and knowledge. RUC members who worked in Kosovo undertook some of their training in Templemore. There is close co-operation between both forces. The relationship between the Garda Commissioner, the Chief Constable and their senior officers continues to develop on a professional basis and that is to be welcomed. I am not sure whether there are any other areas of reform but the relationship between the two senior officers is closer than ever. The next stage in regard to the issues arising out of the Patten report is to wait for the implementation plan and see where we move on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree the greatest obstacle to advancing the entire process is the successful resolution of the arrangements for policing in Northern Ireland? Is the Government satisfied that the British Government, including the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, has completed its proposals in respect of the operation and implementation of the recently passed legislation in Westminster to ensure that the <i>de facto </i>operation of the reformed police force in Northern Ireland will meet the tests of confidence of both communities to enable other areas of blockage with regard to the implementation in full of the Good Friday Agreement to be addressed?</P>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach satisfied himself in recent days that an agreement and accommodation has been arrived at between the various parties to this process to ensure the operation and implementation of the new police legislation on the ground will meet the dual test it must pass to get agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish I could say yes but I cannot. At the same time I do not want to get into damnations about how we can get through it. The legislation which was passed in the House of Commons late last night and which has been sent for royal assent has endured a long and arduous passage through all its stages. I am conscious that the Prime Minister, and particularly the Secretary of State, have endeavoured to listen to all the <Col N="830" /> cases which have been put and to try to reach compromises. He feels he has kept as close to Patten as he could. There are still numerous questions to be finalised not so much in the legislation, but in its operation.</P>
      <P>We began this debate, as the House will recall, by talking about timing, which we moved on, then structures, which we moved on, and the third issue was flags and emblems. We have moved on that but not very progressively. The flags and emblems issue will be dealt with by the police authority which will be set up using the d'Hondt mechanism and an advertisement for the authority has been placed. Last night the Secretary of State put back the date for that until closer to Christmas. What he stated last night was not that different from what he stated before, but he changed the date on which the interim board will be set up in January. It is hoped it can begin to examine the flags and emblems issue in February and that it can resolve that matter.</P>
      <P>A wiser counsel than I on flags and emblems, Séamus Mallon, said he did not see the police authority resolving that issue and that he believed it would revert to the Secretary of State. If I interpret the Secretary of State's remarks last night in a way I would like to, and they are on the record for people to interpret them, they do not seem unhelpful to the views of the SDLP, Séamus Mallon and his colleagues, who put an enormous effort into this matter. I am sure he would say that clarification would have to be sought on what was said last night in the debate. It must be removed from the context of the debate to be analysed and I am sure that will happen.</P>
      <P>The issue of flags and emblems is enormously important and is not in line with Patten. Whatever about any emotion we would generate in the House about flags and emblems, I am sure Deputy Currie will remind me once again that it has an enormous ability to raise fury in Northern Ireland. I have not had one discussion with people from Northern Ireland, including SDLP colleagues, business people and others from a Nationalist or republican background, where they have not become enormously upset about this issue. They say the Patten report must be adhered to by the letter and deed. The emblems and flags issue must be as Chris Patten set out, it must not be related to either side. They will not buy any harp, shamrock and crown situation. That is their position from which they are not going to change and that has been made abundantly clear to me, no matter how much I talk around this issue. There are many historical and other reasons for this stance and it will not change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Secretary of State said he will publish the implementation plan within a month. If that happens, it will help discussion. He also said we must await proposals on the amalgamation of the CID and the Special Branch. I do not know the position on that, but it is also a very important matter. The final issue is the closing of Gough Barracks. These are the issues which must be addressed. <Col N="831" /> The Secretary of State, Mr. Mandelson, said yesterday he would think it unreasonable to ask the SDLP to declare its support or otherwise until those matters are finalised, and I agree with that.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach will not be surprised that my view has not changed that acceptable policing, meaning a police service young Nationalists and republicans can join, is absolutely necessary. If it does not happen, does the Taoiseach agree that, eventually, the Good Friday Agreement will collapse?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach also agree that, when the republican movement announced it was prepared to accept inspection of its arms dumps, it made clear that this was a confidence building measure and was not to be confused with decommissioning? In those circumstances, will the Taoiseach, when next he meets the republican movement, not ask, request or urge some movement on decommissioning but demand on behalf of the Government and everyone in the House, with the exception of one Member, some movement, not in terms of engagement with de Chastelain but in terms of decommissioning? Will the Taoiseach demand that?</P>
      <P>In case the Taoiseach thinks I have forgotten about it, will he remind the republican movement the next time he meets it that the disappeared issue has not gone away and that there are relatives and people such as myself who believe information regarding this continuing agony of relatives exists within the republican movement that has not been disclosed?</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach also point out to the people he meets their hypocrisy in demanding the release of all republican prisoners in Northern Ireland and Britain and that charges be dropped against people on the run when they continue to be in favour of the banishment from Northern Ireland of people who have not been convicted of any offence but some of whom showed considerable courage in standing up to local republican IRA führers in their midst?</P>

      <P>I note and agree with what Deputy Currie said regarding policing. Clearly, unless the police service in Northern Ireland becomes one acceptable to all communities and representative of them in near equal measure, those difficulties will continue.</P>
      <P>Regarding the question of decommissioning, I have put the Deputy's case repeatedly and the representatives have made that case on numerous occasions to those who have control over arms. I never confuse the inspections with decommissioning although they are helpful and have proved to be such. However, they will not resolve the entire problem and I am aware of that, regardless of what the final resolution may be and without specifying it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of the disappeared, the commission for the location of victims' remains comprising the former Tánaiste, John Wilson, and Sir <Col N="832" /> Kenneth Bloomfield, submitted a report to the Irish and British Governments some time ago stating that, having reviewed the resumption of the searches and their extension at the request of the families, regrettably, no further remains were discovered and the commission, believing that the understandable distress of relatives could be compounded only by further searching with little prospect of success, agreed with the Garda Síochána to call off the searches.</P>
    <P>The best judgment is that the unfortunately limited success in recovering the victims' remains was due to the fallibility of human memory combined with the changes in terrain at most search sites as well as the lapse of time since the victims were killed and interned in these sites. It now appears highly unlikely that any more useful information will be received about the location of the six victims who were not recovered. The commission does not envisage that any further information would be of a quality that would justify resumption of searches in these cases.</P>
    <P>The commission is aware that there are a number of other disappeared victims to whom the Deputy referred and on whose location the commission has received no information. It is now widely held that it will not receive such information but it is willing to remain in being, albeit in abeyance, until the expiry of the 18 months since the commencement of the legislation so as to react to any further information which might appear to be authentic and reliable.</P>

Does the Taoiseach not agree that a model for resolving these issues of respect and symbolism is to be found in the fact that the Executive was able to agree a non-contentious symbol for the Government of Northern Ireland, namely, the bunch of flax which is a symbol of an industry in Northern Ireland that transcends both communities? Does <Col N="834" /> the Taoiseach agree there could, therefore, be merit in all parties to the Good Friday Agreement coming together to see whether they could find a symbol or set of symbols that would engender the respect necessary from both traditions? Does the Taoiseach not agree that the success of the Executive &ndash; some might say an unsung success &ndash; in finding an agreed symbol for the Government should be able to transfer itself to finding an agreed symbol for what is essentially a subsidiary institution, namely, the police force?</P>

      <P>I had better not agree or disagree with that comment. They have had a round of it. I have some sympathy with the Secretary of State because the legislation has been moved to the police authority. Of course, as has already been stated, it will not be resolved by the police authority which is actually being formed on the basis of the d'Hondt system, so it is the political representation that will form that. He will then be back to the difficulty again. Maybe the best way is to stick as closely as possible to what Patten has stated because there is some agreement on that. We have to resolve it, however, because it is fundamentally important. It is as clear as daylight that if we do not get a resolution to this, the declaration of support &ndash; or otherwise, but let us hope it is support &ndash; for the new police authority and police service in Northern Ireland will not happen or work. The issue has to be resolved. It is probably not the only one, but it is the biggest issue that we will have to resolve before we can conclude this part of the business. Without seeming to interfere in it, from our perspective we certainly have no difficulties with what happened on the emblem for Government. We have suggestions on the flags issue. The policing issue is an extremely difficult one to resolve and in the course of all the deliberations on the Bill there was no resolution to it either.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach is aware of the recent establishment of the Office of Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, which is an independent office staffed by 45 people dealing with complaints by the public about the new police service in Northern Ireland. Given the public disquiet on the issues of Abbeylara and Donegal and the fact that under the current system com<Col N="835" /> plaints against the gardaí are investigated by the Garda authorities, would the Taoiseach consider it useful to implement a similar, independent ombudsman's role for the Garda Síochána?</P>

The reply the Taoiseach gave to my questions on the last occasion I spoke was that there is co-operation between North and South in policing, agriculture and other areas. Is the Taoiseach saying that there will be no reform of policing south of the Border? Will there be a common standard concerning agricultural matters, North and South? I realise there is co-operation, but the question I posed was about a common standard in different areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness to our gardaí, I do not think they have been subject to the same level of accusations, factual or otherwise, as their colleagues in the North, who, I know, are in entirely different circumstances. Neither has the Garda Síochána lost the number the RUC has over the years, in very difficult circumstances. I do not think it is a comparable issue.</P>
      <P>The issues in Donegal are under intense investigation also. The Minister has powers in these matters when such powers are required. Admittedly, the investigations are conducted by the Garda Síochána. As of this stage, a case has not been made to do that in a very different way. The complaints system that I have seen in operation over the years is fair. Many officers have been disciplined and dealt with by their superiors through that mechanism.</P>
      <P>As regards Deputy Sargent's question, in so far as possible, concerning agricultural matters within the EU, there is no reason they should not have co-operation and joint studies and implement matters jointly. It is a separate jurisdiction, but there is an attempt to co-operate fully in as many areas as possible, not only in sharing information but in working together. We will see more of this in many areas through the North-South Ministerial Bodies.</P>

      <P>My Department is the designated managing authority for two of the operational programmes under the national development plan. These are the productive sector operational programme and the employment and human resources development operational programme.</P>
      <P>The aims and programmes outlined in the national development plan which relate to my Department were drawn up in close consultation with the implementing agencies which include Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and FÁS. Under the plan the agencies have been set ambitious targets, in particular in relation to the development of the Objective One BMW &ndash; Border, midlands and west &ndash; region. For example, IDA Ireland has a target to locate at least 50% of all new greenfield jobs in the region. I am satisfied that over the period of the plan these targets will be achieved.</P>
      <P>Following approval of the national development plan by the Government and the European Commission work commenced on the preparation of the operational programmes. In the meantime formal Commission approval has been obtained for the employment and human resources development operational programme. It is expected that formal Commission approval will be forthcoming for the productive sector operational programme in the very near future.</P>
      <P>The operational programmes are monitored by their respective monitoring committees which, in the case of the productive sector and human resources development operational programmes, are chaired by my Department.

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a specific date, but I understand approval will be forthcoming from the European Commission in a matter of weeks. I do not accept what the Deputy said. There are 300,000 more people at work today than in June 1997, not all of whom are working in the cities. For example, we announced yesterday that the American company, Teradyne, is to make a major investment of £50 million in Cavan. This is the largest investment ever made in the county and the only direct foreign investment of any substance in 22 years. Major efforts, therefore, are under way. There will be other announcements shortly in relation to other areas in the BMW region. It will be additionality, not simply replacement.</P>
      <P>The issue now is to ensure there is more balanced regional development. One of the ways to ensure this is to make things happen in the regions. Clearly, one of the obstacles to making things happen in the BMW region was the violence and political instability in Northern Ireland, which affected possibilities in counties on both sides of the Border. Inadequate infrastructure remains a barrier to investment. The development of telecommunications infrastructure with the road and transport plans generally as well as the water and sewerage developments envisaged under the national development plan will play a major part in making the regions attractive for investment, both indigenous and foreign.</P>
      <P>Two thirds of Irish companies which apply to Enterprise Ireland for grant aid are located in the Dublin area. We, therefore, have an enormous amount of work to do to encourage our own companies to locate outside the greater Dublin area. This process is under way with a view to encouraging companies to locate or expand their operations in other regions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that meeting the targets set in the national development plan for infrastructural development is the key to the development of the regions? Given the chronic shortage of staff in her area of responsibility, does she agree the infrastructural projects provided for in the plan are running behind schedule because of delays in the planning process due to the lack of engineers and so forth? On telecommunications infrastructure, what progress, if any, has been made in ensuring employers in rural areas can avail of such infrastructure at the same cost as those in urban areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The most effective way to reduce costs is through competition, which leads to improvements in services and delivers better <Col N="838" /> value for money for consumers. Thirty companies are now licensed to provide telecommunications services as against one just a few years ago. This has driven down the cost and improved the quality of service, particularly on the international side. When the local loop is unbundled &ndash; the process is under way &ndash; there will be similar improvements on the domestic side.</P>
      <P>On infrastructural development, there is no doubt it is the case that the development of areas outside Dublin and the big cities is very dependent on infrastructural improvements. If it takes an investor from the United States or mainland Europe who flies into one of our international airports, Dublin perhaps, a number of hours to travel to a regional location, it is not very encouraging for investment in the regions. Transport infrastructure, therefore, is crucial, as is education infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The reason we have introduced the working visa arrangement for planners and building professionals generally is the shortage of indigenous resources. This year there has been a substantial increase in the student intake in the planning school in UCD.</P>

      <P>During 1999, 215,000 man days were lost due to industrial action, of which 170,000 can be accounted for by one dispute, namely, the nurses dispute. According to figures released by the Central Statistics Office at the end of September, 26,353 days were lost due to industrial disputes during the first six months of this year compared to 28,191 for the first six months of 1999.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at the extent of industrial action taking place and threatened. This has to be seen in the context of very clear procedures on industrial peace and stabilisation agreed between the parties earlier this year in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. More generally, the industrial relations and dispute resolution procedures and institutions in place are essentially those which the parties themselves desire. It is incumbent on those parties to work with these procedures and institutions and to accept and respect the outcomes.</P>
      <P>I call on employers and trade unions to recommit themselves to reaching agreement through negotiations where the parties cannot agree among themselves and to use the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court whose record at settling disputes is excellent.</P>

      <P>Those who break the law will have to suffer the consequences of law-breaking. I appeal to people to sit down and discuss the issues and not to engage in discommoding the travelling public. Some people seem content in bringing the country to a standstill.</P>
      <P>These disputes are in breach of the industrial peace clause in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Many in disputes are looking for settlements that are way outside the terms of that programme. It is not just the responsibility of the Government to have its hands on the tiller; management and trade unions also have a responsibility to give leadership and ensure the programme, to which we all signed up, is implemented. In the 1970s, this country nearly ground to a halt and we were on the verge of bankruptcy. If we recall, some 15 or so years ago, the dire consequences for this economy when we did not honour our commitments, I am sure no-one will want to return to those days. Inflation has put pressure on the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness but, in the context of the budget, that is the priority for the Government. What should concern workers and their representatives is real take home pay. That has been substantially increased, by more than 30% in real terms, during the lifetime of social partnership. That has not been achieved in any other economy. It is through agreement and consensus, and honouring those agreements, that we will continue to generate the kind of economic prosperity we have been pleased to experience in recent years.</P>

Regulation was brought in to improve the quality rather than to limit market access but it had the opposite effect. It is a Government decision.

      <P>Five examinations of company books and documents are ongoing in my Department under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990. The companies involved are Celtic Helicopters Ltd., College Trustees Ltd., Guinness &amp; Mahon (Ireland) Ltd., Hamilton Ross Co. Ltd. and Kentford Securities Ltd. I expect to receive final reports on a number of these companies in the coming months.</P>
      <P>Since I last replied to the House on this matter on 12 October, an appeal has been lodged with the Supreme Court, on 31 October 2000, in relation to the High Court decision of Mr. Justice Butler of 28 July last, concerning my appointment of an authorised officer under section 19 of the 1990 Act to Dunnes Stores Ireland Company and Dunnes Stores (ILAC Centre) Ltd. Until the outcome of that appeal is known, it is not possible to estimate when these investigations will be concluded.</P>
      <P>Three companies are also being investigated by High Court Inspectors under section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990. The companies involved are National Irish Bank Limited, National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited and Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited. As regards the section 8 High Court inquiry into Ansbacher Cayman Limited, I expect that it will be at least six months before this inquiry can be completed.</P>
      <P>The section 8 inquiry into National Irish Bank Ltd. and National Irish Bank Financial Services Ltd. is also ongoing and I hope the inspectors' inquiry can be concluded early in 2001. Section 8 inspectors operate to the mandate of the High Court and will make such reports to the court in due course.</P>
      <P>The reports on Bula Resources (Holdings) plc., Garuda Limited and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited are with the Director of Public Prosecutions. I have no information on his intentions with respect to any of these reports. Consultations with my legal advisers are ongoing regarding the initiation of summary prosecutions for breaches of the Companies Acts identified in the Bula report. Summary proceedings have been instituted for breaches of the Companies Acts arising from the section 19 report on Faxhill Homes Ltd. The cases are listed for hearing on 30 November and 1 December 2000.</P>
      <P>As I previously indicated, the section 19 report on IIB Bank Limited, formerly known as Irish Intercontinental Bank Limited, which I received on 1 June 2000, has been forwarded to the High Court Inspectors appointed to Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited, the Moriarty and Flood tribunals of inquiry, the Minister for Finance, the Central Bank and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>They are virtually completed. There may be reasons some of them may not be signed off on until others are completed. I must accept the authorised officer's judgment and his legal advice on these matters. I am satisfied that, before long, all the reports of the investigations will be completed and it will then be a question of whether they go to another level, to a High Court inspectorate, or are forwarded to existing tribunals and inquiries. Unfortunately these inquiries take a long time because there are a substantial number of years involved, a great deal of data to be examined and a number of individuals to be interviewed. There is also the legal process. The small team of people who have been involved, on behalf of the State, in carrying out these inquiries have been working morning, noon and night and, on many occasions, on weekends and have shortened holidays in order to facilitate the inquiries. I have a very high regard for the standard of work and the manner in which the reports are being completed.</P>
      <P>The sheer volume of inquiries has placed a big burden on the resources within that unit in my Department and that is one of the reasons we are setting up a new company law enforcement office so that, in future, we will have a more independent mechanism for ensuring company law is enforced and, where there are breaches, action is taken. That office will be resourced by the appropriate personnel, including accountants, barristers and members of the Garda Síochána. That is an important development for the future so that we do not have such a high volume of inquiries again.</P>

      <P>The Minister said on 3 November last year that these reports were substantially completed, yet, 12 months later, none of them has been completed nor has any decision been taken on them. On the reports that have been completed, has the Minister sought permission from the companies involved to publish them? On the lodgement of the appeal to the Supreme Court, there is a time factor on these investigations. When is that critical date? When does the Minister hope the Supreme Court case will take place?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sought the permission of the companies. It was not forthcoming from two of them. The Deputy should understand that these inquiries are interconnected. It is a little like a jigsaw. It is not a question of signing off and com<Col N="843" /> pleting one, and ordering them in that fashion. I envisage a couple of them may be completed together for legal reasons and because they are connected. Some of the findings of the authorised officer to date have been made available to the Flood and Moriarty tribunals and to the High Court inspectors appointed to look into the Ansbacher payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of the establishment of a single regulatory authority for the financial sector, with a strong consumer protection focus. The report of the implementation advisory group on the single regulatory authority envisages a strong consumer protection role for the new authority. The report recommends the appointment of a statutory consumer protection director, the creation of a statutory ombudsman scheme and the establishment of a special consumer panel. I hope the Government will approve the establishment of such an authority in the near future, based on a submission by the Minister for Finance and me. The submission will be made to Government when outstanding issues regarding the structure and organisation of the authority have been settled. Following the Government's decision, I expect that any legislation required for the establishment of the authority will be promoted by the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept, as does the McDowell report, that a single regulatory authority is long overdue? We now have an unacceptable situation where consumers are directed to a variety of offices, from the Registrar of Friendly Societies to the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs to the Central Bank. If there is to be a strong consumer focus, will she not accept the Central Bank is the last place in which this new agency should be established?</P>
      <P>At any time ordinary individuals find it intimidating to bring complaints to a bank. To be obliged to go to an authority under the aegis of the Central Bank is certain to scare away many consumers who have complaints. There are numerous instances of credit card charges being excessive and bank charges being imposed without due process being followed. The ethos of a consumer friendly authority requires that it be independent and stand alone from the Central Bank. Will the Minister continue the battle in the interest of consumers to ensure this agency is not established under the remit of the Central Bank?</P>

      <P>I am aware of the draft code of practice in relation to genetic testing recently prepared by the Irish Insurance Federation, IIF, for its members. My understanding from the draft code is that the industry intends that applicants for insurance policies will not be required to undergo a genetic test to obtain insurance cover.</P>
      <P>While the move by the insurance industry is welcome, I am conscious of the need to consider whether Government regulation in this area is warranted.

Does the Minister agree this attitude is bound to be common and that, in those circumstances, the lead given by Britain should not be followed in this case? Does he agree the lead given by France, the Netherlands and Belgium, which have introduced regulations to prevent genetic testing being used in these circumstances, <Col N="846" /> is the lead we ought to follow?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the letter in <i>The Irish Times</i>. It was signed by eminent scientists and medical experts. The Deputy is taking a simplistic view of the letter. If consumers found that genetic testing would ease their insurance problems, they might consider it. However, that is by the way. We should not be rushed into a decision.</P>
      <P>The Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation, ICSTI, has set up a special group on biotechnology and it is currently considering genetic testing. The IIF has put forward its proposals and we have asked for consultations between the IIF, officials in the Department and the group on biotechnology under ICSTI. We will await the recommendations that will arise from that and we will take a decision at that time if that is the appropriate thing to do.</P>
      <P>There is constant innovation in this area so there is no point sticking our heads in the sand and making a decision now which might be ridiculous in six or 12 months. This is an evolving area. The Government has taken a decision, based on the recommendations of ICSTI's technology foresight group, that we spend £560 million over the term of the national development plan on both information communication technology and biotechnology. All this is relevant. We must take cognisance of the current situation and not be rushed into doing something that might turn out to be foolish.</P>
      <P>We do not wish to countenance a situation where people would be obliged to undergo genetic testing for insurance cover. We have an assurance in that regard from the IIF. The document is being discussed at present with the relevant groups and the final decision will be taken in due course. We will await that decision.</P>

It was subsequently decided, however, that this unfairly disadvantaged those with an interest in the report who did not have access to the Internet and as a result a print version of the complete report has now been produced.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State should be in the comedy club. He said in reply to the previous question that we should not stick our heads in the sand. I am delighted this report has been eventually published. It flies in the face of the Minister of State's colleagues, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, who stated that there should be no field trials of genetic modified plants, that this area was a mass experiment.</P>
      <P>Why was the question of genetic cloning and genetic engineering of humans and animals not included in the report? What action is being taken in this area? When will a report on that matter be published, given that it is not covered by legislation and the system is open to abuse if a person takes an action on this matter?</P>

It was submitted to Cabinet on 10 October and went for printing on 26 October. It came back from the printers last week and was published immediately. Anyone who says we have not acted on it and made the information publicly available has not given fair recognition to the effort that has been made to ensure the information was brought forward.</P>

The nominations were put forward by each Department and the Government accepted them. We had a very high powered team.</P>
      <P>A question was raised about the EU regarding this area. The EU has not led in this area. Each member state is taking certain action and discussions are taking place at EU level.

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be recalled that the Supreme Court in the Barrington judgment of January 1999 in regard to National Irish Bank held that a confession obtained by the inspectors, as a result of the exercise by them of their powers under section 10, as modified by the 1993 case, Desmond &amp; Ors <i>v.</i> Glackin &amp; Ors, and section 18 of the Companies Act, 1990, would not in general be admissible at a subsequent criminal trial unless in any particular case the trial judge was satisfied that the confession was voluntary. On that basis, I am advised that the principles of constitutionality obtained in the National Irish Bank case should apply in a similar way to section 19(6). That subsection provides that a statement made by a person to an authorised officer in compliance with a section 19 requirement may be used in evidence against him.</P>
      <P>The Company Law Enforcement Bill, 2000, provides for the repeal and replacement of section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990. In providing for the repeal and replacement of section 19, the Bill left subsection (6) of that section unchanged. On the basis of the judgment of the Supreme Court in the National Irish Bank case, it would appear this provision is not, in itself, unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>Arising from the Second Stage debate on the Bill a commitment was given that section 19(6) would be looked at in more detail. I propose, therefore, to introduce a Government amendment to the Bill, on Committee Stage. The amendment will be to the effect that statements made by persons in compliance with section 19 may only be used against them in criminal proceedings in respect of the falsity of those statements.</P>

Is the Minister saying that as a result of that the Company Law Enforcement Bill, as published, will have to be changed? Is he specifically saying that section 28(6), as published, which states that a statement by a person in compliance with the requirement imposed by virtue of this section may be used in evidence against him, would be incompatible with both the Supreme Court decision in the NIB case and the European Court decision in the Saunders case?</P>

Based on that and in so far as the issue raised by the Deputy is concerned, it is correct.

I am not sure of the situation in the Supreme Court case; I do not have the exact date. It may have happened but obviously there were learned lawyers dealing with the matter. We now have a Bill and as I have said on many occasions, nobody has a monopoly of wisdom. We have a collective responsibility as legislators to pass good laws and I am confident that as a result of amendments put down by the Deputy and his colleagues in addition to Seanad amendments and our experience, we will ensure that as we bring forward this important legislation it will be the best we can do and will be relevant to a modern society.</P>

Will the Tánaiste talk to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about that, as it is Progressive Democrats policy? Also, what training is being put in place for asylum seekers who are waiting for their applications to be processed and who are not available for employment? In relation to people who have been granted work <Col N="856" /> visas, some of whom still have to get an immigration visa, will the Tánaiste discuss the matter with the Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with a view to streamlining this process so that if a work permit is granted, an immigration visa will also be granted.</P>

The United Kingdom, for example, has devolved the authority to reputable companies. That is something we are considering to speed up the matter. We are streamlining the visa and work permit arrangements but there are security issues as well that we cannot ignore. Visas are not required for every jurisdiction but they are required for some. In relation to the new working visa, about a quarter of those who have got them have come from visa jurisdictions. Three quarters have come from countries where they do not require a visa.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely concerned at the effects of the action taken by a number of taxi drivers at various locations during the course of today. I am sure this is a concern shared by all Members of the House and I express my sympathy to the many individuals who have been subject to disruption as a result of the action taken by the taxi drivers.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that there are other opportunities available to it to discuss the substantive issues relating to the issue of taxi licences generally. The private notice questions are confined to one specific matter: the steps being taken by gardaí in relation to blockades. Irrespective of the rights and wrongs of the case made by taxi drivers, the disruption which they are causing to their fellow citizens cannot be justified.</P>
      <P>The House will also appreciate that what we are talking about is a difficult and volatile situation which is subject to change by the minute. I will endeavour, however, to give the House the most recent information which has been made available to me.</P>
      <P>I will concentrate primarily on the situation at the airport as at present that appears to be the situation giving rise to most concern. A substantial number of taxi drivers have converged on the airport with the intention of causing substantial disruption to people trying to enter or leave the airport. Their action has caused severe difficulties.</P>
      <P>Gardaí are currently at the scene in substantial numbers. It is the case that the response by the gardaí at the scene is an operational matter and one for professional police judgment. It is not something with which I would interfere or seek to direct and I know the Deputies would be appalled at the prospect that I would do so. I have been in contact with the Garda Commissioner during the day and I know his force is trying to deal with a very difficult situation as sensitively and effectively as possible.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputies in their questions were not seeking to denigrate the efforts of the Garda or to suggest that there is some simple law and order response to a complex situation. There are certain legislative provisions available to the Garda to deal with public order difficulties &ndash; for example, obstructing a public highway &ndash; but a difficult decision has to be taken by the people on the ground as to whether any actions would solve or, in reality, exacerbate a given situation. It would not be right for anyone in the House to second guess those decisions and I am sure neither Deputy Higgins nor Deputy Quinn would disagree with that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commissioner has assured me that the situation is being kept under constant review. It would be entirely counter-productive, however, <Col N="858" /> to give the House details about the further measures the Garda may consider it necessary to take. In this context, I understand Aer Rianta had proposed to seek an injunction in the High Court this afternoon and I understand that in the past few minutes, as I was coming into the House, an interlocutory junction was granted, but I do not know the terms of that interlocutory junction. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the operational implications to which that would give rise.</P>
    <P>In summary, the gardaí are taking, and will continue to take, whatever sensible and practical steps they can to deal with what is a particularly difficult situation and I am sure that in doing so, they will have the full support of the House. No one, however, should underestimate the practical constraints which arise in this regard.</P>

        <b>:</b> Notwithstanding that this is a difficult and volatile situation which the Minister seems to think is changing by the hour, does he not agree it involves naked anarchy and a complete disregard for law and public order? Why is such special consideration being given to taxi drivers? This is not an orderly protest but an illegal blockade. Would the Minister agree that if any other vested interest group mounted similar action it would be dealt with very swiftly, cars would be moved on and people would be arrested and, perhaps, have their property impounded? What action will be taken to ensure this matter is dealt with before 7 p.m. or 8 p.m.?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy understands how difficult this situation is for the Garda. It is a question of managing the situation from hour to hour. The Garda has to be pragmatic and does not wish to exacerbate the situation. It must be clear to the Deputy that it would be a mistake to do so. It is not a case of the Garda giving special consideration to any one group but of gardaí on the scene being pragmatic. It is for them to direct operational matters and I have the fullest confidence in them to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given the House a classic Pontius Pilate response and it is deeply politically poignant it should come from someone who trumpeted zero tolerance as a political slogan when in Opposition. Would the Minister agree that to describe the Garda's approach to manifest law breaking on a scale of anarchy which is bringing this city to a standstill in many respects as a &ldquo;pragmatic approach&rdquo; is manifest nonsense? The Minister has professional skills as an officer of the court in his capacity as a solicitor, a practice in which he is not currently engaged. However, would he agree that his knowledge would inform him that this is not a pragmatic response from the Garda?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda has an obligation to enforce the law and part of that law is to maintain public order. That is not to remove the legitimate right of people who feel their contract of trust with <Col N="859" /> Fianna Fáil and the Government has been unilaterally broken. Such people can protest in many ways but not necessarily at the total, utter and continued inconvenience of citizens. Will the Minister tell the House whether he will request the Garda Commissioner to ensure that the rule of law prevails, that the public highway is kept open and allow the operational implementation of that enforcement of law to be a matter of judgment for the commissioner and his senior officers in the Dublin metropolitan area?</P>
    <P>Would the Minister further agree that his response is totally inadequate? If he was in the position he occupied for four and a half years and Deputy Owen was Minister he would be roaring from the rooftops for action on this issue. He is applying two standards to political responsibility, one in Opposition and one in Government.</P>

      <P>Over the past three years I have become used to being second-guessed by Deputy Quinn and other Deputies but comparisons are odious. It must be clear to the Deputy that this is not a Pontius Pilate exercise. The issue is an operational matter for the Garda. Is any Deputy seriously arguing that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should direct the Garda to arrest a person or group of persons? I did not do so in Opposition.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn rightly stated that people cannot disobey the law and those involved in demonstrations of this type are also subject to the law governing activities in public places. There is a general obligation on persons engaged in such demonstrations or protests not to wilfully obstruct traffic or to engage in any disruptive behaviour in breach of the law. Legislation governing this area includes the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1995, and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994. No amount of argument can hide the fact that there are practical problems in this situation.</P>

The public knows there are particular difficulties in demonstrations of this kind and in trying to resolve them without, in so far as is possible, resorting to measures one might later regret. A considerable number of gardaí are on the scene and they are monitoring and managing the situation from hour to hour. It would be wrong of me to substitute my judgment, which would be a political judgment, for the professional judgment of <Col N="860" /> the Garda. It would be <i>ultra vires</i> and outrageous for me to do so.</P>

      <P>How can the Minister square the contradictory assertions he made? On the first count, when we asked him to ensure the rule of law was properly applied, he said that would be an operational matter on which he could not possibly comment. Yet he made operational managerial judgments of his own when he said such actions, if taken, could exacerbate the situation. Is this his own view or the informed view of the commissioner? What precise discussions has he had to date with the commissioner? Does he agree this is not an industrial dispute? It is a political protest within a democracy. All other groups that protested in the past, whether farmers, students or others, have done so within the rule of law, in co-ordination with the gardaí on occasions, but not always. However, the gardaí have always ensured, outside this House and elsewhere, that traffic was able to move despite temporary and short disruptions. We have never tolerated a blockade of the kind we are now discussing. Does the Minister agree this has arisen because of the complete breakdown in trust between the Fianna Fáil party and the taxi men who thought they had some kind of understanding that has now been unilaterally betrayed? What action will the Minister, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, take in conjunction with the Garda Síochána to ensure the rule of law applies and that protests such as they are, are carried out within the framework of orderliness?</P>

With regard to the issue being exacerbated and whether that is my view or that of the commissioner, I preface my remarks in that respect by stating that if it is my view that it would exacerbate the situation, in no way am I taking an operational decision or directing the Garda Síochána, I am expressing an opinion. As it turns out &ndash; if we can turn down the volume of the laughter in the wings at this very serious matter&mdash;</P>

Can he guarantee that by this evening the roads to Dublin Port and to Dublin Airport will be open and the way will be clear for people to conduct their business in an orderly fashion? Does the Minister accept this kid glove treatment that has been meted out to the taxi drivers as distinct from other bodies is nothing other than a craven capitulation to intimidation and bully-boy tactics and the illegal manner in which they are conducting their protest? Is he further aware that they said only an hour ago, in categoric language, that this is not about to end, this is only the beginning and they will continue as long as possible &ndash; in other words until such time as they get their way?</P>

I also outlined on a number of occasions that the direction of the operation is one for the Garda Síochána because it is an operational matter. Members are well aware of that. I do not have to repeat it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins is suggesting that I should seek, in my position as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to direct the day to day and, in this instance, the hour to hour operations of the Garda Síochána. It would be unprecedented for me to do so. It would be wrong for me to do so and it would create a terrible precedent for successors. It would amount to nothing more or less than political interference for which I would be correctly criticised.</P>

There is considerable industrial unrest and if the Government turns a blind eye, and is apparently willing to do so to the level of illegality in regard to this picket, does he accept that others who have grievances with public policy will be invited to take up a similarly aggressive and illegal position to seek the implementation of their objectives? Will the Minister use this opportunity to make a direct appeal to the taxi drivers to end this dispute and to accept that the decisions that have been made were made by the democratic institutions of this State?</P>

Of course I wish the taxi men would call off this demonstration immediately. It is causing untold inconvenience and disruption. As already stated, the situation is not tenable. I ask that taxi drivers desist from the action they are currently taking and I sincerely hope that common sense will prevail.</P>
      <P>I reiterate that the High Court judgment in relation to this matter is quite clear. The Minister of State and the Government had no alternative but to take the action they took on foot of that judgment. In any democracy, the Executive must respect the judgment of its High Court.</P>

    <Title>Teaching Council Bill, 2000: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The establishment of a teaching council was recommended in the White Paper on Education and the report of the National Education Convention. Ireland is not the first country to establish a teaching council. Such councils are already established in England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, Ontario and Newfoundland. I am glad the Minister placed emphasis on future co-operation between North and South in this context. There was a difficulty involving teachers from the North who taught in the South. Agreement on this issue between the relevant Departments and Ministers North and South resolved this difficulty. The teaching councils North and South should work closely together in the future in the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is envisaged that the Teaching Council will fulfil a role for teachers in the same way as the Medical Council does for doctors and the Bar Council does for the legal profession. It is proposed that the council will include 22 teachers, who must be in the majority, as well as representatives from the colleges of education, parents' groups, the social partners and the business sec<Col N="876" /> tor. It is fair to say that, unlike the Bar Council and the Medical Council, teachers have been very generous in terms of the number of representatives on the council from bodies outside the teaching profession. Teachers and teachers' unions must be given recognition for their magnanimous attitude on this issue.</P>
    <P>I envisage the business sector and other sectors playing a future role in the Teaching Council in terms of the type of training teachers are given. At all times the education system must reflect what is happening in the workplace. As far back as the 1960s the strength of the economy has been based on the strength of the education system and innovations in education. A dynamic Teaching Council which advocates new approaches in regard to education and teacher preparation, training and qualifications will be very important in the future.</P>
    <P>The INTO is anxious that the section dealing with teacher supply be amended and strengthened. There are 1,000 unqualified teachers in our schools. While that might solve a local problem at a particular time and the people involved may mean well, it is not right that unqualified individuals should be teaching our young people. One could not envisage, for example, somebody who is not a solicitor dealing with legal issues or going into court representing clients or somebody who is not a doctor performing a medical function. The same applies to teaching and it should be carefully considered. Supply panels should be set up nationwide to eliminate the need for unqualified teachers. That section should be strengthened to ensure the council will have a bigger say on teacher supply.</P>
    <P>Another issue relates to the qualifications of people returning from other countries. I recently met a highly qualified individual who had returned from Australia but could not teach here. I sent the details of the case to the Department to seek clarification and I hope it may be resolved. In future the Teaching Council could suggest additional training and courses to accommodate people who may not have the appropriate qualifications to teach in Ireland but who could do so if they undertook a course set down by the council in co-operation with the Department.</P>
    <P>This is an important issue given the current shortages. A number of Irish people and foreigners are prepared to come to Ireland to teach for many reasons but cannot because their qualifications are not recognised, yet they are more qualified than some of the 1,000 unqualified teachers who are filling in as substitutes and so forth in our schools. Perhaps the Minister of State will refer to this when he replies.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been welcomed by the three teachers' unions. John Carr, treasurer of the INTO, stated that the organisation has been seeking such a body since 1974 and that the council would help to enhance the professional image of teachers and give them a greater input into teacher education and professional development. <Col N="877" /> He expressed the hope that it would help to eliminate what he termed &ldquo;the scourge of untrained personnel in the classroom&rdquo;, which concurs with my comments.</P>
    <P>John White, Deputy Secretary of the ASTI, welcomed the legislation and said it will enhance the professionalism of teachers and will help to assure the wider community that high standards will be maintained in teaching, which also concurs with my comments. The TUI was not as enthusiastic in accepting the Bill as the other two unions. When it was published, Jim Dorney said his union had a number of concerns about the Teaching Council. His union wanted to be certain that the provisions of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, would be invoked before any teacher was struck off the register. It would be no harm if those concerns were addressed.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to education and training in Part IV. I have always advocated that the education and training of teachers and the standards required for entry into the profession should be under continuous review. Economies demand change and are in continuous flux. The people who take up teaching should be continuously examined to ensure that the right people enter the profession. In the past people of the highest calibre have been attracted and we must try to maintain that in future.</P>
    <P>Irish teachers are the most effective in Europe. They work in the largest classes in the EU and in a State that invests on average less per pupil in first and second level education that its European partners. Teaching has traditionally attracted its members from among the best and brightest of its cohorts and must continue to do so. I acknowledge that teachers have always been professional and this is manifested in the manner in which they have taken on information and communication technology in every primary school over the past few years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation. It is a step in the right direction, which has received universal approval. The teaching profession is being treated shabbily by the Government. However, to implement the aspirations of the legislation the Minister will have to come to terms with the current strike.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which has been introduced, not before time. Circumstances for the teaching profession, similar to many other professions, have become more difficult over recent years. I heard the Minister of State on radio yesterday saying he would make himself available as a mediator in the ASTI dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State would be better off if he was a mediator in this dispute. I have not always been supportive of teachers but having sat on a board of management and a parents' council I recognise the difficult job they have to do. The profession has changed. Only 20 years <Col N="878" /> ago many qualified teachers worked in other professions because they could not get jobs in schools. Nobody ever thought the day would come when 1,000 unqualified people would teach children in our schools because there was not enough qualified teachers.</P>
      <P>Why do people not want to take up teaching? Money, pressure and the fact that the job is becoming more difficult are some of the reasons, but much of the legislation that was introduced over the years was anti-teacher. The worst legislation ever introduced in the House dealt with unruly pupils. There have been many bullies and people who abused their powers, but there was nothing wrong with a little law and order in any classroom or school and an odd slap of the hand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>However, we have gone to the other extreme. A teacher only has to look at a pupil, and not even touch him or her, before he or she is informed of the pupil's rights. It has gone from one extreme to the other and I hope that issue can be examined under this legislation. I received a letter from a constituent who told me that an expelled pupil will now have legal representation in the form of a barrister and solicitor. Where are we going? This is about educating our young people and preparing them for the world and it is about teaching young children right from wrong.</P>
      <P>We were always proud of the way our people were educated and always said they were the best educated group in Europe and that our students could be sent to any part of the world. There is no doubt that any of them who have left to go to Britain, America or wherever have succeeded because the education system was good and they were well trained and educated. They were able to go abroad and do what had to be done and many of them have done very well. Some of them have returned and are creating employment or bringing the experience they gained in other countries back to Ireland. That is all because of the education they received here.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill, I understand that teachers will be registered, that there will be an appeals system and that they will be able to adjudicate on each other. The one problem with that profession is that, while there have been very good teachers, there have also been very poor teachers who taught nothing but received the same credits as everyone else. There was no way parents' groups or boards of management could do anything with them because, in that profession, the minute a person qualified, they were protected for life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would love a situation where I was elected once and allowed to stay here for my lifetime, but that is not the way it works. We have an interview process which can take place after six months, 12 months, two years or three years. It is difficult and it is becoming more so. If one steps out of line and makes a few mistakes in this job, one will soon find oneself signing for social welfare and not back in this House. If a teacher is not doing <Col N="879" /> the job, he or she should be dealt with by the profession and it should not be ashamed to do that. It would be like the Law Society where, if a person steps out of line and misappropriates a person's money&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an unfortunate choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>At least there is someone to whom one can complain. It can be investigated and if the person under suspicion is found guilty, he or she will be excluded from the profession and will no longer be allowed practice in Ireland. What happens in larger schools is that if a teacher is not good at a certain subject, parents must provide grinds, and that is the parents who can afford it. Those who cannot must suffer on and their children are at a disadvantage because their parents cannot afford grinds. That is wrong.</P>
      <P>What will happen with the education system now that everything is geared to third level? Every mother and father want their son or daughter to be either a doctor or lawyer. We must put some initiatives in place, otherwise, what will happen to the skilled people, the plumbers, carpenters and block layers? If we continue as we are, in ten years' time we will not have enough carpenters, plumbers or whatever. It is time the Government encouraged young people into the skills area rather than trying to push them into third level. Some people are not happy entering third level but they are forced to do so by their parents and by the pressure of the points system. While I may sound hypocritical in that my daughter sat her leaving certificate this year and another child sat it last year and both went to university, that is not the point. There is no encouragement for people to train. FÁS does not have enough initiatives or schemes to advertise at primary and second level before people make their decisions. There is not enough support for people to make the correct decision and to encourage more people towards skills so that not all of them will go on to be doctors or whatever.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister of State will respond to two points when summing up. A recent situation occurred in my constituency about which I have written to the Minister and tabled parliamentary questions. Last week an inspectorate visited Carnacon national school, a two teacher school which has and will have the numbers for three teachers. I hope the Minister of State or the Minister will make a positive decision in that regard. While I know there is a regulation in this area and that regulations are made to keep the rule of law, sometimes they can be wrong, and there is nothing wrong with changing them if that is the case. Will the Minister of State make the correct decision as quickly as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gaelscoil na Cruaithe in Westport has sufficient numbers for a new school. I know the Department is actively seeking a site and it is important it is obtained because more than 130 students in that school are working in prefabs. I <Col N="880" /> hope the Department and the Office of Public Works are prepared to pay the going rate for a site and I hope that can be announced soon. I am anxious that that school would be up and running in the next year. It is wrong that students must be taught in prefabs.</P>
    <P>I have raised the issue of Carrowkennedy national school on the Adjournment twice in the past two years. An extension was sought to the school but some students are now being taught in a community hall. That is terrible in the new millennium. It was decided to build an extension but it was then decided to build a new school. Will the Minister of State in reply or in written form to me state the up-to-date position on that as it has been ongoing for some time? People from the Department have visited the school to speak with those involved. I attended a meeting on this recently and it was stated that the parents had raised their contribution within three weeks through a major effort on their part. To this day, we still do not know what is happening. Will a new school or an extension be built? Will we see action soon? The commitment given has not been fulfilled.</P>
    <P>We are great at lecturing others on how to deal with their problems but responding to the requirements of children with special needs is a serious problem for us. I know additional funding has been put in place and I do not believe that anyone in the House or in the country would object to whatever spare cash is available being invested in people with special needs. I was recently in St. Anthony's school in Castlebar and parents were crying out for help, services and support. They believe they are not in place and that the resources and commitment do not exist. We cannot obtain help and support for similar cases in Mayo. These people are frustrated with the political system.</P>
    <P>There was a time one could say at a meeting that it was not easy for the Minister for Education and Science or the Minister for Finance because the resources did not exist. Now spin doctors state on an hourly basis how well the country is doing and what resources and money we have. The Minister for Finance tells us on a weekly basis that the coppers are piling up. Listening to him, one would think there were not enough banks in the country to hold all the money being taken in through Revenue. Despite this, people in the area of special needs, such as speech therapists, cannot be employed and people with special needs cannot have their needs met. That is outrageous. When I hear these stories at public meetings, I ask myself why I am in this business. If we cannot deal with the weak and needy in society, with whom can we deal and who can we help?</P>
    <P>We are not helping them. We see with the taxi drivers protesting on the streets of Dublin that the stronger a person is and the more support he or she has, the better he or she will be catered for by Government. There are not many of these people with special needs. They are not sufficiently organised and they have enough troubles <Col N="881" /> themselves. They may have trouble in looking after a child at home, and in some cases mothers and fathers are providing 24-hour care. It is wrong that we are not providing the necessary services for them. It is time to make a commitment to such people who have children with special needs. Nobody could fault that point. The Minister is responsible for the education of children, but he has a particular responsibility for children in rural areas where school transport facilities are needed. The ruling on that matter was outrageous.</P>
    <P>I give credit to the Minister who has investigated particular cases and has done his best to examine the matter, but he is afraid to concede in certain cases because it would set a precedent. I can understand the costs involved, but some needy cases must be dealt with, even though it may mean breaking the Department's rules. New school bus pick-up points should be selected to cater for children who have no transport service at present due to a lack of numbers. We have seen how Bus Éireann runs its operation and the Minister should not be afraid to overrule it if an injustice is being done.</P>
    <P>A common complaint made to public representatives in rural areas concerns the distances young children have to walk to school bus pick-up points. Some of them have to get up a 7.30 a.m. with parents bringing them three or four miles to the pick-up point. In other cases where transport is not available, they may have to walk to school in the rain and arrive there wet and miserable. It is not like England or America where facilities are in place to dry students' clothes and provide tea and lunch for them. Some of these children are wet for the day and return home in the evening carrying big heavy school bags.</P>
    <P>Why should pupils have to bring home all their books every night? The teaching profession should examine this issue so that pupils only have to bring home the books they need for homework. It is terrible to see young children, aged from four to seven years, carrying big school bags in the morning and evening. It is dangerous and cannot be good for them. I hope the Minister will investigate that matter.</P>
    <P>Over the years we have had a good return from the teaching profession. Their hour of need has now arrived and there should be some negotiations on what they are looking for. There should be some support for them to find a middle ground. We should not hang them out to dry. Teachers have done a good job in difficult circumstances but at this stage they are somewhat frustrated. Teachers have more influence on young pupils aged five, six or seven, than their fathers or mothers, because they spend more time at school than they do with their parents who are out working. Because of this busy parental work load, teachers now have a major role to play in the children's upbringing.</P>
    <P>We do not want to lose the goodwill or support of the teachers. Neither do we want to put pressure on them which could lead them to stop doing <Col N="882" /> tasks they currently do in a voluntary capacity. The time has come for the Minister to sit down with the teachers for discussions. If necessary, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, could mediate between them and the Minister, Deputy Woods. The Minister should try to reach some common ground whereby the teachers could be brought back on board.</P>
    <P>We are going through difficult times as regards law and order which has much to do with this legislation. Teachers are faced each day with situations with which, 20 years ago, they did not think they would ever have to deal. They are dealing with students who come into school drunk or under the influence of drugs, and who think the law is on their side. The country is becoming more violent and teachers' lives are at risk. Recently, in my county, a teacher took the wrong action outside school hours and he paid the penalty for it. There was another reason for that, however. We are in a different society, living in dangerous times. We see what is happening all over the world, including in America where students have been shooting all around them. Teachers have a difficult job. The Minister should sit down with them for talks to see how the problem can be dealt with. I hope he will be able to do that soon because the disturbance is affecting students who are preparing for the junior and leaving certificate examinations. The leaving certificate is probably the most difficult exam any student will have to sit and, therefore, students need all the support and help they can get. There should not be any interruptions to their studies for the leaving certificate, the results of which will determine their future. There is no hope for today's students if they are not well educated. With the increased pressures involved, the world of work is becoming more difficult and more demanding.</P>

      <P>Last Saturday, as I attended to my constituency advice centres, I was confronted at every turn by parents who were concerned about the current industrial action by ASTI members. A truism rang through what they said, which was that the dispute would not be resolved by megaphone diplomacy or stand-offs, but by dialogue. The question is, however, how long will it be before one side blinks and negotiations commence? The withdrawal of pay is an inflammatory action by the Minister and has not contributed to resolving the dispute or to facilitating dialogue. The losers in this industrial action, apart from the teachers themselves, are the students, and in particular those in exam classes. The Bill is welcome and puts in place the kind of structural changes and professional bodies to deal with teaching, which are long overdue. I urge the Minister, however, to grasp the nettle and intervene to resolve the teachers' strike. I accept that there are difficulties, particularly in the context of the partnership programme, such as negotiating with a group that is outside the partnership. That effectively invites all others to conduct nego<Col N="883" /> tiations outside the programme. At the end of the day, however, a mechanism will be found so that dialogue can resolve the dispute.</P>
      <P>The message of the parents I spoke to on Saturday was simple but true &ndash; that dialogue should commence now, before positions harden, rather than later. The Minister's action in withdrawing pay when teachers are available was unwise, although the joint managerial body has advised schools to close for insurance purposes. The Minister's action will undermine the voluntary element whereby, year after year, teachers have looked after sports teams, the school drama club and school bands.</P>
      <P>Last Friday evening I was fortunate to be invited to Coachford College in my constituency to present annual awards. I was bowled over by the unity of purpose within the school among parents, teachers and students, and by what had been achieved in a very user friendly school environment. This holistic approach to education was reflected in the range of academic success stories in practical studies, the arts and sporting endeavours.</P>
      <P>We can learn many lessons from what is occurring in the nursing profession. By and large, the teaching compliment in Coachford College is young, but the danger is that we will fail to attract highly motivated young people into the teaching profession. One concession that could be considered by the Department of Education and Science is the establishment of a commission on teaching, similar to the one that paved the way for resolving many problems in the nursing profession. We are now recruiting nurses from various parts of the world to work here. The same indications are there in the teaching profession; we are not getting the same type of people to pursue teaching as we did in the past. For example, this year in UCC there is only one student pursuing the higher diploma in education who has a science degree. Within a number of years this will have a knock-on effect in the recruitment of teachers in certain subject areas, which will prove difficult and manifest itself in the careers students will, ultimately, be able to pursue because of subject choice.</P>
      <P>We would do well, therefore, to recognise the structural deficiencies, which are primarily salary related. The concession of a commission on teaching may be a useful starting point and might tempt the ASTI off the perch on which it has, unwisely, become impaled. While there would be difficulties for the partnership programme in negotiating directly with it, it is necessary to make a concession. At the end of the day, the issue will be resolved through dialogue, not megaphone diplomacy or by shouting at one another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, which is welcome, has teeth. For example, one of the objects of the Teaching Council will be to encourage the ongoing education and training of teachers throughout their careers. It also deals with the nitty-gritty such as fitness to teach and professional misconduct. In <Col N="884" /> such instances it provides for certain actions such as removal or suspension from the teachers' register, all of which are necessary. In bygone days when the economy did not roar as loudly, the permanent pensionable job in the Civil Service, teaching and nursing was much sought after; as a career, it is not as attractive today. There was also a view that no matter what one did one could remain as a teacher despite one's unfitness to teach. These are provisions which parents generally will welcome.</P>
    <P>It is welcome that the Bill, by and large, has the imprimatur of the teaching organisations. We would do well, however, to reflect on the fact that the ASTI has not been known as the most militant of trade unions. If one includes the TUI and the INTO, the majority of teachers are against the partnership programme. We would be foolish to ignore this and would do so at our peril. While the education of the current generation is not at stake, although those in examination classes find themselves in a very difficult situation, given that young people are not joining the teaching profession in the same numbers as in the past, we may well reap the rewards in three, four or five years time.</P>
    <P>Reading, writing and arithmetic &ndash; the three Rs &ndash; have long been held to be the basis of our education system. Any person deficient in these skills is seriously disadvantaged. A recent report which highlighted the fact that a large number of people leave school without being able to read or write has placed the focus on literacy, a matter in which the Minister of State is particularly interested, with particular reference to adult education. This should be one of the most fundamental objectives of the education system. It has also helped to focus attention on why the State invests in education in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Historically, education was the preserve of an elite groups which, as a consequence, was the source of all knowledge. An 18th century peasant farmer did not have to know how to read and write in order to survive. His life was dominated by trying to put a roof over the heads of his family and provide them with food and clothing. He did not have to know how to read a set of instructions in order to use a spade or milk a cow. Education was a luxury he could not afford.</P>
    <P>With the onset of the industrial revolution men suddenly had to know how to read instructions to operate new machines coming with the steam engine. People had to be taught how to read and Governments began to invest in primary education, not out of any altruistic interest, but purely out of self-interest. They were doing so out of economic necessity. The economy needed workers who could read.</P>
    <P>We are now going through a technological revolution which, at a phenomenal speed, is changing not only the way we work, but the places in which we work and way in which we lead our lives. Literacy can no longer be defined in terms of reading, writing and arithmetic. To these must be added computer literacy. Wherever we turn, <Col N="885" /> computers are part of our lives. Yet, we have been snail-like in putting in place policies which recognise this fact. There is as yet no comprehensive programme which outlines what first and second level students should learn about information technology and which tests their computer literacy.</P>
    <P>Six hundred points in the leaving certificate is often regarded as the pinnacle of achievement for a second level student. It is a significant achievement. Yet, there is no guarantee that this 600 point student is in any way computer literate. He or she may not even know how to turn on a computer because the leaving certificate, with the exception of the leaving certificate applied, does not demand competency in the use or understanding of computers.</P>
    <P>Because the three Rs are seen as essential we have wisely decided that mathematics and English are compulsory subjects for all students who sit the leaving certificate. Yet, we do not demand any level of computer competency. The main benchmark of competency is a privately operated certificate, the ECDL, the European computer driving licence, but even this depends on the enthusiasm of a school's computer teachers and the vagaries of the school timetable. We must tackle this problem immediately and ensure that at leaving and junior certificate level the competency of every student in the use of computers is assessed. It is not sufficient to provide computers for schools; we have to make space in the curriculum for a national programme which will ensure computer literacy for all students. Points could be awarded at leaving certificate level on the same basis as points are currently awarded in the leaving certificate vocational programme modules.</P>
    <P>It is possible for a student to leave school with little or no knowledge of computers or computer applications. It is also possible for a teacher to qualify with the minimum knowledge of computers. In the context of teacher registration provided for in the Bill, surely the time has to come to make a certain level of computer competency a mandatory requirement for all new teachers who wish to register.</P>
    <P>Many teachers at primary and second level have undertaken various kinds of computer courses to upskill themselves in new technologies. The type and quality of the courses, however, varies considerably. It is critical for the future of the economy that not only should all teachers have a high degree of competence in computer applications, they should also feel comfortable and motivated in the computer environment. Accordingly, a special diploma in computer applications for teachers should be introduced. All teachers who acquire this diploma should be given an allowance for this qualification. This should be looked at in the context of section 6 which provides for the encouragement of the ongoing education and training of teachers throughout their careers.</P>
    <P>The addition of computers to the curriculum raises another problem, that is, overcrowding of <Col N="886" /> the curriculum. For example, at second level most students take a minimum of seven academic subjects to leaving certificate. These are the subjects for which CAO points are awarded. School subjects and activities for which points are not awarded in the leaving certificate tend to lose out in the final two years leading to examination.</P>
    <P>Students in the 16 to 18 year age bracket are increasingly becoming unfit and often reluctant to take part in physical education classes. Highly motivated students, academically, will often see PE as an unnecessary burden which will not help them towards their chosen third level course. Accordingly, if we believe that physical education and fitness are important objectives for the education system, we must ensure that not only are they allocated time on the weekly curriculum, but that they also receive recognition in whatever certification a student receives on completion of his or her schooling. It must also receive recognition in the allocation of places in third level institutions.</P>
    <P>One of the great strengths of the education system is that it is widely focused. The fact that all students take English, Irish and mathematics with at least four other subjects from a wide range means that most of those who complete their second level education have developed a much wider range of skills and competencies than, say, their counterparts in England where, at this early stage of their educational lives, all students will have narrowed their options to three subjects. If we want to widen our educational objectives, we should keep this wide range of subjects, but reduce their content.</P>
    <P>I am not as familiar with the curriculum as those who have taught in recent years. I remember my leaving certificate Irish. The scourge of our lives was <i>Bullaí Mháirtin</i>, <i>Toraíocht Dhiarmada agus Gráinne</i> and book after book of Irish poetry. I accept that, if you want to encompass a wide range of curriculum objectives, such as PE and computer literacy, it is not possible to maintain content level of many subjects. The curriculum board should look at this aspect.</P>
    <P>I tabled a number of questions to the Minister and I was surprised at the reply I received on computer literacy and curriculum content. We have handed this over and are not getting a sufficient response in a rapidly changing environment. We should reduce the content in certain subjects and broaden the scope of computer literacy which is as important in today's school environment as is reading, writing and arithmetic. PE is also important because there are increasing signs that we are following the American example of lack of exercise and obesity. The education system and curriculum content has a role to play in that area. Reduced subject content would provide space in the weekly timetable for students to take part in those activities that help their personal, social and physical development.</P>
    <P>One of the functions outlined for the new Teaching Council is to promote teaching as a profession. Clearly, this function will be critical for <Col N="887" /> the new council as the recent overwhelming vote for industrial action by the ASTI would indicate a very demoralised profession.  At second level, the difficulty of getting a full-time job, low salary levels on entry, the length of time it takes to reach the maximum point on the salary scale and poor mobility, means fewer people are inclined to take up the profession in the first instance. This will reach a critical stage in the near future. Mathematics and science graduates are few and far between in higher diploma classes while the cost of housing, particularly in the greater Dublin region, is leading to a rapidly diminishing supply of teachers in this area. Many of these factors also affect primary level where qualified cover for teachers absent through illness or otherwise is almost a thing of the past. We will have a crisis in teacher supply if the Minister does not have as a priority the promotion of teaching as a profession.</P>
    <P>I was interested to see a provision in the miscellaneous section of the Bill that makes it an offence, punishable by a fine not exceeding £1,500 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or both, for a person falsely to represent that he or she is a registered teacher. There are people standing before classes every morning whom the students are under the impression are qualified teachers but because qualified cover cannot be found the choice is between leaving classes unattended or having them attended by unqualified teachers. The powers that be know they are not qualified. This goes back to the structural problems in the profession which the council will identify and take remedial action on to ensure we do not reap the same reward as we did in the case of the nursing profession.</P>
    <P>This need is accentuated by the fact that, just as society is becoming more complex, so is the classroom in which teachers operate. Family breakdown, the prevalence of drugs, particularly alcohol in younger and younger age groups, and the easy availability of unsuitable material on video and the Internet means the role of the teacher must change. Many teachers I know would argue that they are often as much counsellors and social workers as they are teachers. One teacher asked me recently how he could teach maths on a Monday morning to students who have been working for 20 hours over the weekend in part-time jobs to fund what is effectively an adult social life, which had also been fitted into the same weekend.</P>
    <P>There is a positive side to schooling. Schools are generally much happier and safer places than they were in the past when tales of horrific beatings were commonplace. While we will often hear of young people who do not like going to school, we do not hear of many who are afraid to go to school. Schools teach a much wider curriculum and the methodologies used are more in common with students' levels of ability. Programmes such as leaving certificate applied, transition year and leaving certificate vocational programmes are a <Col N="888" /> welcome addition. However, if we do not take a long and serious look at what is happening we may find that, in the not too distant future, the castle we thought we had built on a secure foundation will have collapsed. That would be regrettable.</P>
    <P>The Joint Managerial Body made a pre-budget submission to the Department that highlights a long running grievance in this sector. The Minister should take this on board. The Department has commissioned its own study but has not published its report on funding for the voluntary education sector. These schools are discriminated against. Vocational education committees, community colleges and comprehensive schools that are funded directly through the Department get funding for caretakers, insurance and secretarial services yet the <i>per capita</i> grant that the voluntary schools receive must cover all that expense. That is blatantly unfair and means that parents and schools must engage in fund-raising to buy furniture or computers, make up the shortfall to pay the secretary or caretaker and so on. That is not acceptable. If there is a report on this issue the Minister should publish it so that we can have a meaningful debate. I am sure it would confirm what has been conveyed to me by teachers and principals in my constituency who are not in the VEC system or funded directly by the Department but who depend on their <i>per capita</i> allocation. This matter should be resolved.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister, in his reply, will refer to rapidly growing suburbs and the provision of new schools. The system of enrolment the previous September being the sole basis for determining how many teachers a school may take on the next year is archaic. Some other mechanism should be put in place that would anticipate, taking into account local development plans and local authority planning permissions, a surge in demand for primary or secondary school places and circumvent the necessity for prefabricated classrooms and a continuous stream of representations made by Members regarding school extensions at primary and second level. In an ideal world a decentralised system to local governance bodies for education would usefully serve that purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that we should debate education at present. Uppermost in most people's minds is the industrial dispute that is affecting second level. Like other speakers, I ask the Minister of State to intercede with his senior colleague and influence him in a positive way to deal with the matter to ensure that full facilities are restored. The Government is acting tough and being impervious to the needs presented by the teaching profession or anyone else. I do not extol the virtues of pursuing wage demands that are in excess of what is required and deemed advisable, keeping in mind the need to reduce inflation levels. They have increased what was anticipated two or three years ago. It was never envisaged that inflation would rise from 1.5% to almost 9%. It is incredible that the Government allowed <Col N="889" /> that to happen and did nothing about it. It can whinge about the various strikes that are taking place but responsibility rests with the Government for allowing the economic situation to develop to such an extent that these people have no option but to increase their wage demands.</P>
      <P>A young teacher who hopes to buy a house has no chance of doing so. A medium quality secondhand local authority house in my constituency costs £120,000 at present. The Minister should address the underlying issues which are driving the wage demands in the teaching and other professions. Failure to do something about them will leave this country in a serious situation in a couple of years. Undoubtedly, there will be leapfrogging and our competitiveness will suffer dramatically.</P>
      <P>There was no need for this. The housing crisis caused it and the Government did nothing about it. I am sorry to introduce an issue that is not particularly relevant to this Minister's Department but it impinges seriously on the services which the Department of Education and Science supply to the public. If the Minister consulted with parents and teachers, he would find differing views as to who is right and wrong. Ultimately, however, they will come down to the delivery of educational services to families. If I were the Minister, I would take serious cognisance of where that responsibility falls and how to deal with it.</P>
      <P>Ireland's investment in education in the past is seen, nationally and internationally, as a major impetus in the creation of the so-called Celtic tiger economy. I do not doubt it was. However, it took a long time for that investment to have a direct impact. It took a long time to be able to keep our educated young people at home and before we encouraged them to return to this country with investment proposals. For many years the fathers and mothers of this country had to bid farewell to sons and daughters who had gone through the education system and achieved their qualifications but were faced with the prospect of emigrating and, in many cases, spending the rest of their lives abroad.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers referred to the industrial revolution and the need for an educational revolution. That is an accurate assessment. Even though we made an adequate investment in education in the 1960s which dealt with the issues presenting then and in the immediate future, nobody could have anticipated that changes would be forced upon us by the requirements of the changing world economy. What was excellent five or six years ago is no longer sufficient to meet current demand and what is adequate now will not be sufficient in two or three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for ongoing review of the educational process is more pressing than ever for two reasons. Technological advances are dramatic but have a short lifespan so there is a need for ongoing education in that regard. Despite opinions to the contrary, we have a growing young population. There is an increase in the <Col N="890" /> population and more people will require ongoing education. In that regard, one can draw on the past experiences of our emigrants. Many of them had to leave home before their education was completed. In many instances they were lucky enough to be able to avail of second and third level educational opportunities in other countries. They did so satisfactorily and achieved their professional qualifications because the opportunities were there. There were no such opportunities in this country at that time.</P>
    <P>There have been substantial improvements in the meantime. However, what was sufficient to meet requirements a couple of years ago might be insufficient a couple of years hence. As has been pointed out by other speakers, it is attractive for many young people to take up employment at an early age. It is also not possible for various businesses in this country to function without taking on people who are young and still at school. The tendency among some young people, however, is to remain at work and neglect their schooling because work is a ready means to financial independence which they otherwise would not have. It is imperative that the education system keys in these two elements.</P>
    <P>Employment should be only the practical element of education. If that can be done effectively, it could be beneficial for the students. If that cannot be done, that generation will have moved on in ten or 12 years. By then the tiger economy might not be so rampant and it might be necessary for those young people to return to school. I have no doubt the facilities will be available but it might not be economically possible for them to do so at that stage. They might have other pressing demands and be obliged to forego again the opportunity for education, which would be a disaster. The first opportunity is during their formative years and the second opportunity would be in the event of there being a necessity to further their education and improve their employment potential. If they do not succeed at one of those points, they will never do so and the economy will be the poorer for it.</P>
    <P>Another area of education which must be examined is the education of immigrants. A large number of the immigrants legitimately seeking work in this country &ndash; we need them to work here &ndash; do not have great command of the English language. It must also be said that we do not have a great command of the languages of the immigrants' native countries; if we had to emigrate to those countries, we would be in dire straits. Nevertheless, for whatever reason, these immigrants have had to come here and schools in many areas are doing great work addressing the issue of their education. However, there is need for improvement. It would be a great help to the people concerned if they were able to avail of English classes as early as possible and it is our duty to make that possible.</P>
    <P>The more people there are available to work, the better it will be for our economy. Obviously, we cannot as a nation put in place sufficient per<Col N="891" /> sonnel for manufacturing and the delivery of goods and services at present. Where the personnel come from is immaterial, the important thing is that they are able to do the job. Our education system can enhance their ability to do those jobs and communicate with people.</P>
    <P>The other issue is the ongoing needs of the teaching profession. There are procedures in place to deal with them but it can do no harm to improve and enhance these procedures. Reviews of procedures that are tried and true and have been adopted over the years can enable us to respond to changes and carry out an ongoing critical analysis of the process to ensure the teachers are in the best position to tackle the job they face. The voluntary contribution of teachers was mentioned by many speakers. That is central to the current ASTI dispute. It should be borne in mind that a great many in the teaching profession voluntarily give of their time liberally and, compared to other countries, unnecessarily. That voluntary effort should not be accepted gratefully and graciously and then ignored. Teachers throughout the country make a voluntary effort above and beyond the call of duty. That practice has become established over the years and it is happening to a far greater extent than it did many years ago. Teachers make a voluntary effort because they have a social conscience, a responsibility towards their students, and consider such activity is a contribution to the potential achievement of the student in the classroom. I ask the Minister of State to bear in mind that voluntary effort should be recognised.</P>
    <P>The adequacy of life skills is central to a revision of educational needs. Improvements have been made in that area, but there is a need for ongoing improvement. When jobs were difficult to obtain, young people on leaving school, reasonably well qualified and full of hope about their ability to obtain employment, were often disappointed and even more disappointed about their basic life skills. They thought they had it all, but when they went into the workplace it was a different story. The life skills required there were often different from those they had become accustomed to believe were required in the classroom. When students enter the workplace, their level of confidence will be based on their educational abilities and achievements in the classroom and although they might be great, the workplace is a different world where vastly different life skills are required.</P>
    <P>In a recent discussion with a businessman, he was quick to point out that the finished product of our education system does not necessarily measure up to what industry requires. Other speakers referred to changes in the computer industry and the necessity not only to be computer literate but to be extremely good in that area. That opens up a vista of new opportunities to the young qualified professional, but a lack of those skills leaves the young professional in a <Col N="892" /> different category. While all young people believe they have it all, it is only when they enter the workplace that reality dawns and the link between the education system and the needs of the workplace are most accentuated.</P>
    <P>I compliment the regional colleges and second and third level institutions on their work in this area over the years. A great deal of work has been done, but a great deal more needs to be done. I emphasise that particularly in the event of there being a decline in our economy. I am not a preacher of doom and gloom, as this economy could develop dramatically for the next 20 years. There is a need for that and an ability to ensure that, but that may not transpire, as one has to manage an economy in such a way as to ensure a certain degree of consistency and stability prevail. If we do not do that, we will miss out.</P>
    <P>Various speakers referred to school accommodation and the quality, standard and degree of facilities available in the classroom at whatever level. In the 1980s and early 1990s a substantial proportion of our student population received almost all their secondary education and often their primary education in prefabricated classrooms with, in some cases, plastic buckets catching water spillage from the ceilings. To say the least, they were less than ideal conditions. We have an opportunity now to remedy those deficiencies. We are working on that, but we have not resolved them by a long shot. Given the current economic climate, the Government is morally obliged to address those needs and the Opposition is morally obliged to ensure the Government provides the necessary resources to bring about that revolution in accommodation that is required.</P>
    <P>Other jurisdictions have developed facilities above and beyond the standards of our classroom accommodation over the years. It is a miracle some of our students were as good as they were coming out of that system and did not develop strange illnesses as a result of being confined to substandard accommodation for such a long time. It is unfair that students should have been expected to spend their educational years in substandard accommodation where they were cold, wet and miserable. It is a credit to the teaching profession, their parents who allowed them to continue their education and to themselves that they stuck with it and achieved their ultimate goals.</P>
    <P>While we boast about how successful we have been, about our tiger economy and that at last we can keep our population at home, all that will be to no avail unless we can continue to expand and provide an enhanced level of education and educational facilities in the future to ensure we will have an investment in education in the future that will prevent the necessity for our population to emigrate and in the event of their having to do so, that they will be able to command employment at the top of the scale in their fields.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing this legislation. I ask him to note the points made by <Col N="893" /> the various speakers and to try to bring about change when it is deemed not to be necessary but when the necessity becomes visible, which is often a long time before it becomes necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this Bill. I declare an interest in this area in that I was a professional teacher before I was elected to this House and I am still a member of a teaching union. More importantly, I am a parent with a number of children in the education system, which means I have a real interest in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. The need for a teaching council has been long discussed and spoken about in academia over the years. I am perplexed because any teacher I have asked about this Bill in recent weeks knows nothing about it. I do not know whether that is the fault of the union or the Department, but teachers know very little about a Bill with the potential to become the most far-reaching legislation to affect them in a long time. I ask the Minister of State and the Department to publicise the fact that we are discussing this Bill. Teachers should be informed of what is in the Bill and what it aims to achieve. It is amazing that teachers know nothing about this and perhaps the Minister of State will tell us in his reply what has been done to inform teachers about this legislation. I know that the unions and certain parent bodies are involved but individual teachers are not.</P>
      <P>The general aim of the Bill is to promote teaching as a profession, which is a laudable aim to which we can all aspire. That is also the case with the professional development of teachers and aiming to maintain and improve the quality of teaching in the State. The Bill provides for the establishment of standards for education and training of teachers, to provide for the registration and regulation of teachers, to enhance professional standards and competence and to establish a teaching council. Nobody could find fault with those general aims of the Bill. However, when one gets into the detail of the Bill one can make points that may be recognised by those who read the account of these debates later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We seem to be setting up a lot of councils. In years to come if a Deputy wants to raise a matter relating to an individual teacher will he be told by the Chair that the Minister has no responsibility in this area as it is the responsibility of the council? This is happening more and more. Are we giving powers to different bodies to the extent that questions may arise about accountability and democracy? The council could be called before an Oireachtas Committee to discuss what it is doing, as happens with other State agencies, but if a Deputy seeks information about this council, for instance, there should be a provision in the Bill allowing the Deputy access to that information by way of a parliamentary question. I have made the same point about other Bills. The Chair will have an interest in this matter; we must <Col N="894" /> be careful not to distance ourselves too much from what is happening in society.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to establish, review and maintain codes of professional conduct for teachers which will include standards of teaching, knowledge, skills and competence. That is very welcome. Charging teachers with misconduct is also discussed in the Bill without being specific as to what misconduct might be. The Minister might expand on this on Committee Stage. Section 40 states that professional misconduct refers to a teacher engaged in any improper conduct in his or her professional capacity. Therefore, professional misconduct is improper conduct, which may be fair enough, but we do not know what it is. We should have examples because it could mean anything.</P>
    <P>A teacher must know what to teach and how to teach. All Members will acknowledge that a teacher's influence never stops. We can all remember the teacher we admired and looked up to, the teacher who inspired us. We can also remember the teacher who struggled in the classroom. There is a lot of talk at present about monitoring and evaluating teachers but there are terrible examples from the past of teachers being victimised by inspectors. That has changed totally but the fear is still there and such stories of victimisation are told by older teachers in every staff room in Ireland. That has changed and the inspectorate is fantastic nowadays. If a teacher is struggling and finding it difficult to teach, this council should work to assist, support and help that teacher rather than seek punitive measures. It is important that is done and I ask the Minister of State to take it on board.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to retraining teachers, which is crucially important. A teacher qualifies with a higher diploma in education after a basic degree but may not take part in any serious in-service training for years afterwards. The quality of such training was not very good until recently &ndash; it was one day here and one day there. That is no good and serves to disrupt the school because while the teacher is away his or her class is covered by someone else and loses a full day's instruction. Those students are losing out because the teacher is away. We need to arrange a system whereby teachers may have a block of in-service days each year, outside school time if necessary. It should be organised so that they can be substituted by someone with similar qualifications while they are out. That teacher could then spend a month or two weeks retraining. One must have such blocks of time because single days are a waste of time. It will be expensive but it will be worth it.</P>
    <P>We must not only look at what is taught and how the subject matter is presented by the teacher, we must also look at how the teacher relates to his or her students in the classroom. That is very important. Unfortunately, it is not covered adequately in many training courses for teachers and is not covered later by in-service training.</P>
    <P>Teachers are often asked to solve the problems <Col N="895" /> of society. Society has a problem with drug abuse, for example, and the schools are asked to deal with it. An information pack is produced and the school is told to deal with it. Producing a pack does not work; it is not as simple as that. If there is a problem with suicide in society teachers are told to deal with the problem in the classroom. These are serious issues and teachers must be highly trained to deal with them. There have been criticisms of various programmes relating to sexuality. We must be careful not to expect too much from schools and teachers without providing them with support, back-up and resources. I would challenge the Minister of State to talk about sexuality to a classroom of 30 teenagers on an ongoing basis. One is better off with a small group of six to eight students where one can relate to them one to one but that will take resources and different management styles in schools.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk recently about the need to introduce league tables or something similar. That may come up in the course of the debate on this Bill because we are discussing ways to review teacher performance. The argument has been made that if a highly skilled teacher is working with a class that is highly motivated, with good home support, that teacher will achieve very good results. Even if the teacher is not highly skilled, he or she will still achieve good results with that class. However, if a highly skilled teacher is working with a large class that is not motivated, with no home support or encouragement, he or she will find it difficult to achieve good results. I am talking about A's and B's in honour subjects; that is how these matters are measured. That teacher might actually be working harder and achieving much more than a teacher with a so-called good class, so we have to be careful when we talk about evaluating teachers.</P>
    <P>If I read it correctly the thrust of the Bill, which I agree with, is to positively support the teachers and to put in place support mechanisms and incentives for retraining teachers. I hope the Teaching Council does that. A teacher who is not performing, and I am speaking as a teacher, does terrible damage not only to the students but also to the school as a whole because of the ripple effect in other classrooms. We have to find ways of supporting those teachers. Up to now they were encouraged to leave the profession but perhaps it would be better to find other ways in which that teacher's skills and experience could be employed in the educational system because we are finding it difficult to attract people into the profession.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about the ongoing strike. A number of school days have been lost and unless something is done soon, we will lose a lot more. These days are being lost to secondary schools only. The other schools are carrying on as normal. These secondary school students are facing a leaving certificate examination in which they will <Col N="896" /> compete with each other for points. That is not the best system but it is the only one we have. I put it to the Minister of State that if we have one set of students who will lose out on their schooling while another will not, the examination will be a little unbalanced. That is unfair on the students who lose out. I plead with the Minister of State, on behalf of parents, to engage with the ASTI and try to reach a resolution. That is important. The Government has said ASTI is not in the partnership programme so it will not talk to it but that is not good enough. We have to try to resolve this dispute for the sake of the students, the parents and the teachers. Teachers do not want to be on strike. It is not a decision they have taken lightly.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the issue of in-service training. Part of the problem of in-service training is that it breaks the sustained period of instruction. It is important that students have a sustained period of instruction over the period. Sustained periods of instruction in classrooms are also broken by sporting activities. I am putting this forward as an issue and not because I am against sport in any way. As my colleague, Deputy Creed, mentioned earlier, it is vitally important that we expand and develop sport and physical fitness in schools and in society generally, but if half a class are at a football match every Friday, one can see how that can develop because teachers have to attend these matches. We need to examine other ways of recognising the importance of sport and activities that occur during school time and try to build those into the school year so that more people can take part in them.</P>
    <P>I am told that the pupil-teacher ratio in secondary schools in Ireland is the highest in Europe. That should not be the case and it is a problem we should move to address. I tabled a question on the pupil-teacher ratio yesterday in terms of the psychological service. I knew the position was bad but I did not know it was as bad as it is. From looking at the figures I received from the Minister for Education and Science yesterday, and I thank him for his comprehensive reply, it seems that some work is being done but much more needs to be done in this area. Again, we are talking about the professional conduct of teachers and teaching as a profession but if only one child in a classroom is disruptive, for whatever reason, he or she can disrupt the entire school, and it is extraordinarily difficult to deal with that problem. Teachers need training on how to deal with that but they also need the services of professional psychologists to assist them.</P>
    <P>I understand that the average number of schools per psychologist is 39. Each psychologist has 39 schools to deal with. The average number of second level students per psychologist is 89. That means they are working flat out. I know many of the educational psychologists are drafted into other areas as well but the number of such psychologists in our schools needs to be increased dramatically. Some psychologists have 54 schools to visit and some of those schools would have 300, <Col N="897" /> 400 or 500 students. How can they help teachers in any way? We should not establish a Teaching Council to monitor teaching without putting in the other supports that teachers need.</P>
    <P>We have recognised over recent years the many other challenges that are faced in the classroom &ndash; attention deficit disorder, dyslexia, dyspraxia &ndash; and they all need to be addressed and supported. I know of a parent in Cork who has been waiting months to have a child assessed in the clinic in St. Finbarr's. What will the school do? Expel the child? It is not the child's fault. The child has a condition that needs to be treated in some way.</P>
    <P>I could go on at length about the Bill. The question of agricultural education needs to be examined. The pressure on principals, caretakers and secretarial staff is enormous. Principals have a huge role to play in the development of teachers but they cannot do it because they are too busy pushing paper. They need more support.</P>
    <P>The ancient Greeks had a very low view of teachers. They said, &ldquo;Lo, there goes another pedagogue&rdquo;. I do not want that to be the case here. I want our teachers to be held in high esteem but to do that we must support and reward them. I ask the Minister of State to intervene and get this dispute sorted out.</P>

It is worthwhile and it will play a pivotal role in the future of education. It is the type of legislation of which all political parties should be proud. It will bring about a situation whereby people can feel there is a mechanism they can use to deal with any type of complaints. This will bring order to the education sector, particularly regarding the teaching profession. A number of Members who contributed to this debate are also teachers. Perhaps we should prevent them running for the Dáil as it would provide a large number of additional teachers.</P>
      <P>Section 6 is fundamental to the Bill and provides that the objects of the council shall be to regulate the teaching profession and the professional conduct of teachers, to establish and promote the maintenance and improvement of standards and to encourage the on-going education and training of teachers throughout their careers. These are worthwhile objectives to which we should all aspire, particularly teachers.</P>
      <P>I am not a teacher but friends of mine are members of the profession. These people complain about the lack of in-service and on-going training and feel the Department is failing to place emphasis on these areas. Many changes have taken place in teaching over the past ten or 15 years as a result of which on-going education and training of teachers is extremely important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teachers are also concerned about the cost of this provision for which they will have to pay. When established, I hope the Teaching Council <Col N="898" /> will have the financial wherewithal to provide proper on-going education and training for teachers. It is imperative that teachers are able to deal with whatever arises in the classroom over the coming years as there will be significant changes in the way children are taught as a result of the Internet, computerisation and such developments. It is difficult for older teachers to keep up to date with these new ideas and systems and it would be unfair on pupils and teachers if they were unable to avail of modern facilities because teachers did not receive proper training. I agree with the Bill's objectives but funding must be made available so that proper on-going education can be provided for teachers who consider it necessary.</P>
    <P>The availability of teachers has been a serious difficulty over recent years and I have raised this issue on numerous occasions in the House. Fewer people, particularly men, are entering the profession. It is difficult to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio if there are not enough teachers. The biggest difficulty in attracting people to the profession is the perception that teachers' pay is not as good as in the private sector. I will not go into this issue now but it will have to be examined.</P>
    <P>I am a former member of a VEC and was a member of an interview board for science teachers. A number of well qualified teachers interviewed by that board did not have the ceard teastas and so were prohibited from taking up the post. I do not understand why it is necessary to have this Irish qualification to teach science, English, mathematics or any subject, apart from Irish. I hope the Department will consider this anomaly which should be removed as it is unnecessary for second level teachers to have the ceard teastas unless they are teaching Irish. This qualification is prohibiting some very good teachers from entering the profession.</P>
    <P>A number of primary school teachers in Northern Ireland are willing to teach in the Republic but the difficulty with Irish is causing problems. I mentioned this issue to Deputy Browne who was an eminent primary school headmaster and produced many excellent students in Carlow. The Deputy told me that Irish is an important part of the primary school system, both in terms of learning the language and other cultural aspects. As a result it would not be easy to introduce a system which would allow people who did not have Irish into the primary sector. I spoke to Senator O'Toole about this issue and the INTO has stated it does not have a great difficulty taking teachers from Northern Ireland, even if they are not proficient in Irish. I hope the Teaching Council will deal with that issue.</P>
    <P>I am a little concerned about the size of the council as outlined in section 10. There is a difficulty in that there are so many teaching bodies and primary, second level and third level institutions which wish to be involved in the council. However, the idea of 37 individuals sitting on the council sends shivers down my spine. One has to limit the number of members if one is to have a <Col N="899" /> chance of reaching decisions and preventing the council from becoming a talking shop. There is no way of achieving this objective in a democratic way as all sectors of education wish to be represented on the board. However, 37 is a large and unwieldy number. I hope I am proved wrong but I am concerned the council could become a talking shop which will find it difficult to make decisions. That would be an appalling vista as the fundamental rationale behind this legislation is to provide help for the teaching profession, parents and pupils. I am concerned that the size of the council will prevent it from making decisions.</P>
    <P>Section 40 defines professional misconduct by a registered teacher and section 43 provides for the removal or suspension of a teacher from the register. These are important sections as there are teachers who are not teaching properly and who should not be in the profession. One of the negative aspects of the teaching profession is that it is difficult to remove teachers who are not performing. Fitness to teach, as covered in Part V of the Bill, will play a very important role.</P>
    <P>My only concern relates to the complaints made to us as Members of the Oireachtas about instances that have taken place in a classroom, be they very serious or not so serious. Parents are often afraid to make a complaint to a school because they feel their child could subsequently find it very difficult in the school and the other teachers might decide the child is a troublemaker and support the teacher. The Teaching Council has an extremely important role to play in that regard. It would be good if the Teaching Council could convey to parents that they can make complaints in confidence and that their children will not be affected. At the same time there has to be a balance. I am not suggesting all pupils and parents are correct. Some may, for whatever reason, dislike a teacher and make a complaint for the sake of it which will not stand up. People must feel confident that they can make a complaint which will be dealt with fairly from the point of view of the pupil and the teacher. That should be emphasised strongly in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Primary education should be given as much funding as possible. If we want to achieve social equality and rid our society of social injustice, it is important that all children have the opportunity to receive a decent primary education. If I ever had the opportunity to be in Cabinet I would fight very hard for funding for the primary sector and work from there up.  Education played an important role in the 1940s and 1950s. If one does not receive a good grounding in primary education one does not have a chance of going on to second level and certainly not to third level. If we really want to get rid of social exclusion, which is much more prevalent in large cities and urban areas than in my constituency, we must focus on education methods in primary education. If children drop out of school before they finish primary education or shortly afterwards they will find it very difficult to go back into the system. I <Col N="900" /> would like more emphasis to be placed on primary education.</P>
    <P>I come from a small rural community in County Leitrim. Several parents have contacted me about a school where the first class has had six different teachers in the past two years, none of whom were trained and all of whom were substitute teachers. It is difficult enough for a child in first class to have to deal with one or two teachers in a year but to have to deal with six is mindboggling. I have no idea how one resolves the problem but it is countrywide. I hope the Government will try to put something in place to bring extra teachers into the system as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>There are also complaints about the methods used in remedial teaching. Several parents who have approached me believe those teaching their children in remedial classes are not properly trained and that, apart from fewer numbers in the class, they are dealing with the children in the same way as they would deal with them in a general class. Such classes may have only two or three children compared with 20 in other classes. Parents complain that these teachers do not know the role of a remedial teacher and that they put pressure on the children. I am not an expert, I am merely stating what I have heard in my clinics over several years. Is there ongoing education and training for remedial teachers? Do remedial teachers take courses before starting to teach children who are regarded as being educationally a little slow.</P>
    <P>Several of my colleagues have raised the issue of accommodation in second level education and at primary level. The Department of Education and Science must play a role in this. My colleague, Deputy Creed, said the Minister has to decide in September on the number of children that will be on the school roll the following September. Perhaps there is some way that system could be changed.</P>
    <P>Carrick-on-Shannon community school was built four years ago to take 500 pupils and there are 850 pupils in it. It has eight prefab buildings; it previously had 20. This is awful in this day and age, and I do not know who is to blame. I was a member of Leitrim VEC at the time and we banged heads with the Department of Education in Athlone to try to convince it to build a school to take 650 pupils. The school now has severe problems and I have no doubt the same applies countrywide. Whatever can be done to evolve that should be done. The same is happening in primary schools, but not to the same extent.</P>
    <P>Several teachers have complained to me about the increased amount of administration entering the system. I do not want the Department of Education and Science to end up like the health boards where most of the money is going on administration. If that happens in education, God help us. Whatever legislation is introduced, I ask the Minister to minimise the amount of administration necessary. It is important the money is spent on the first rung of the ladder, on students, teachers and facilities &ndash; capital expenditure. If <Col N="901" /> the administrators get their hands on it, it will go all over the place and there will be meetings about meetings. I want the Minister to ensure that does not happen.</P>
    <P>Most people spoke about the teachers' strike. I ask the Minister to enter serious negotiations with the teachers tomorrow because the current situation is unfair on the students. I do not know who is right or wrong&mdash;</P>

        <b>:</b> Cuirim fáilte roimh an Bille mar tá sé thar am dó. Tá Bille den chaighdeán céanna ag na dochtúirí agus ag na h-altraí leis na blianta agus is ag na múinteoirí atá an t-eolas faoi na deacrachtaí, na fadhbanna agus na riachtanais sa chóras oideachais. Le cabhair na múinteoirí a bheidh ar an gComhairle agus le cabhair na ndaoine nach múinteoirí iad ba chóir go mbeadh toradh maith don chóras oideachais ar fad.</P>
      <P>I am a member of the ethics committee and I should declare that I have a slight interest in the teaching profession, lest anything I say be held against me later. I welcome the Bill for a specific reason to which I have referred on a number of occasions. I have always defended teachers who do what is becoming a more difficult job. However, I have never defended bad teachers. People fall into the latter category for several reasons and until now there has never been a system for removing a bad teacher. It was grossly unfair to children, parents and schools that teachers who were not doing their jobs could continue to work for their entire careers.</P>
      <P>The people to whom I refer often pulled the wool over inspectors' eyes by using diplomacy, soft talk and plámás. Good teachers often became flustered or excited when inspectors visited schools because they felt that no matter how good a job they were doing it was not good enough.</P>
      <P>I hope the Bill will provide the opportunity to deal with teachers who, perhaps for health reasons or other considerations, are not able to do the job they are paid to do. In my opinion the teaching profession will gain from the fact that, like doctors, solicitors, etc., if a person is struck off the roll because of incompetence, misconduct or whatever, it will show that teachers want certain standards to apply and that they are prepared to deal with matters that affect them. That is a welcome development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also deals with teacher training. Because my words of wisdom often go unheard in the Dáil, I reiterate that teacher training courses should focus much more on teaching skills. When I was in teacher training college many years ago <Col N="902" /> we were hammered if we did something wrong. When we left training college, however, we had a good idea of what was involved when one stood in front of a class. The main aim was to impart knowledge and try to get children to understand it.</P>
    <P>Many people who become teachers now have already pursued academic careers and they have majored in history, French or some other subject. I do not believe that adequate emphasis is placed on teaching skills. It is a complete waste of time if students cannot understand the subjects that one is trying to teach. That is what makes teaching different from most other jobs. I accept that I am prejudiced in favour of teachers but in the past people had a ridiculous perception of them and believed that all they did was go to work at 9 a.m., write a few sums on the board and leave again at 3 p.m.</P>
    <P>If a carpenter works hard he will fit a number of windows or doors in the course of any given day and a typist will type so many letters. However, at the end of any day I spent teaching I could not quantify what I had achieved because I was never sure how much of the information I had imparted had been taken on board by the children. Teachers must go out of their way and work hard to ensure that their students are taking on board what they are saying.</P>
    <P>In recent days I have seen interviews with many third level academics and those who claim to be experts on the strike and on teaching. However, those people deal with adults who may or may not choose to attend lectures. There is no pressure on these people because if students fail their examinations it is simply because they did not do the work during the year. Some of the worst lecturers I encountered during my career taught at third level. I recall one old lady who was nearly 90 years old talking to herself at a blackboard. One of her students, who since completed a doctorate in old Irish, used to give lectures in the local hotel afterwards. I should not have referred to old Irish because someone might recognise the lecturer. However, I am sure she is in Heaven talking to the angels in old Irish at this stage.</P>
    <P>I saw a third level lecturer on television recently who purported to be an expert on teaching. However, that person does nothing other than having information and imparting it to his students. At primary and secondary level, having the information is only half the job. One must be sure that the students one is teaching can give back that information, often in reply to a rather twisted question. Depending on how well they understood the information they will obtain a grade A, B or C. Teachers must deal with a great deal of pressure.</P>
    <P>Things have changed since the days when one was faced with four rows of desks in a classroom and if anybody moved their desk one would ask them what they were doing. Under the new regime classrooms are filled with a constant bab<Col N="903" /> ble. This drove older teachers mad because they could not cope with a child-centred education system in which children are supposed to experiment and discover things. Is there any point in children trying to discover an item of information that has been known for the past 1,000 years when it could be imparted to them directly?</P>
    <P>The higher diploma in education focuses on the philosophy of education, the teachings of Aristotle, etc. That is fine but such philosophies are not worth a damn when one is trying to impart information in a classroom. In my opinion, the colleges which offer the higher diploma in education and the teacher training colleges for primary teachers should place special emphasis on the skill or art of teaching.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to teachers from Northern Ireland and England and Deputy Reynolds mentioned my views on that subject. If we are i ndáiríre about the restoration of the Irish language and if Irish is supposed to permeate primary school classrooms, how can a person from Northern Ireland with no knowledge of Irish be expected to teach here? In theory and, in many cases, in practice, many teachers do not treat Irish as a subject, <i>per se</i>. The language is supposed to permeate children's consciousness by encouraging them to use terms such as &ldquo;An bhfuil cead agam dul amach&rdquo; etc. I cannot see how a person without a knowledge of Irish could do justice to a primary school class.</P>
    <P>Irish is an important subject. Leaving aside its cultural and patriotic importance, one must take note of the fact that it is an integral part of the examinations process. It is unfair to children to miss a year of learning Irish in school because their teacher might not be proficient in the language. That is why I am worried about the employment of teachers from outside the State in primary schools.</P>
    <P>At post-primary level, there are several subjects where Irish is an unnecessary barrier. If one is teaching science, mathematics or history, one need not teach them through Irish in most instances. There should be no barrier to employing teachers from outside the jurisdiction. However, there is a distinction between primary and post-primary education in respect of the teaching of Irish.</P>
    <P>Section 15 states that Deputies and other elected representatives shall be disqualified from employment in any capacity by the council.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Traffic and transport in Dublin and other areas is bad at the worst of times, but now almost every second day transport services and traffic in cities is disrupted directly as a result of the Government's mishandling and mismanagement of the transport and traffic situation. Today mainline trains are not running after a summer and autumn of repeated disruption of rail services, while traffic in Dublin is in chaos because of the action taken by taxi drivers following the announcement by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, last night.</P>
      <P>We have all known that the taxi situation in Dublin has been bad for many years. However, few people could have believed that the Government could have made it worse. Yet this is exactly what has happened. This is the fourth Christmas the Government has been in office. It will also be the fourth successive year in which the people of Dublin will be without an adequate taxi service. Worse still, while there has been a totally inadequate service during the past three years, the real fear now is that the anger of taxi drivers is so great that there will be an even worse taxi service for the public this Christmas.</P>
      <P>We now have the situation where not only are there no taxis today, but the entire city has been brought to a halt, the airport has been virtually inaccessible, commuters have faced journeys of up to many hours to simply get home from work, people cannot go out tonight because they do not know if they have a means of getting home, people who had planned to travel abroad have had to cancel their flights because they do not know if they will be permitted to enter the airport, people planning to come home from abroad for business and tourism are cancelling their journeys because they cannot be sure of getting out of the airport. The situation threatens to get worse. Today we heard angry taxi drivers talk about all-out strikes and threats to block ports and bus stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all agree that we have to uphold the right of all citizens to move freely through the city and country. The handling of this difficult situation has been incompetent and inept. The principal element of the announcement by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, last night regarding the provision for an increase in the number of taxis was a positive development, but the manner in which it was done had all the hallmarks of this disastrous Government. Part of the problem is <Col N="907" /> that taxi drivers understandably feel an intense sense of betrayal by Fianna Fáil. In Opposition Fianna Fáil promised to protect the interests of taxi drivers. Many of them accepted that and some of them pinned their political colours to the Fianna Fáil mast during the last general election. There is now genuine anger among taxi drivers at what they see as a betrayal, not just by the Taoiseach but also by Deputy Callely, Deputy Noel Ahern and others who were glad to accept political support from the taxi drivers in 1997 but who have now effectively let down taxi drivers by their inability and failure to deliver to them.</P>
    <P>Up to as recently as a few days ago representatives of the taxi industry were getting a message from those close to the Taoiseach that was directly contrary to what the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, planned to do. They were misled right up to the moment of betrayal. If the Government is so wedded to the principle of social partnership, why was there no advance consultation with the representative organisations? Why was no attempt made to properly prepare a package in advance? Why did the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, give the House so little information as to the promised tax package? Surely the Government, in deciding what was going to be done about the taxi situation, must have decided the general outline of what it intended to do with regard to the compensatory package to which the Minister of State referred last night.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party acknowledges and believes that the individual taxi driver who remortgaged his home or committed the redundancy money he got when he lost his job for the purchase of a single taxi plate now has a legitimate grievance following the effective deregulation of the taxi business. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, partly acknowledged this in the House last night by promising tax relief in the next Finance Bill. However, we know that the Finance Bill will not be published until after the budget, probably sometime after Christmas.</P>
    <P>Taxi drivers have the right to know the details of what the Government intends to do. It is not sufficient to make some kind of a general, vague promise that something will be done at some point in the future. This needs to be spelled out. The Minister or a representative of the Government should come into the House tonight and tell us and, through us, the taxi drivers and their representative organisations what this package is supposed to contain. They have a right to that information and they need to know it. If they do not get this information there is every danger of continuing disruption of traffic and the taxi service in Dublin so that this Christmas we will end up with the worst of both worlds where, on the one hand, there is a promised reorganisation of taxi services while, on the other, there is such a degree of opposition to, and dissatisfaction with, the package by the taxi industry that we may end up with fewer taxis on the streets than in previous <Col N="908" /> years. The very minimum required &ndash; this should not be postponed until budget day or publication of the Finance Bill &ndash; is for the details of whatever package the Government has in mind to be spelled out to the representative organisations and discussions and consultation held with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>He is better at appearing on the news than he is at coming into the House to explain his actions. He is a day late because these discussions should have taken place before any announcement was made last night. This is the third attempt by the Minister to deal with the taxi problem in Dublin. However, each successive effort has, in practice, made the situation worse.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the DART system. For some time we have been hearing promises from Ministers that additional DART carriages are about to appear. I do not know where those carriages are or what garage they are stored in, but they are certainly not on the line. Every morning during peak time there is chaos at Blackrock, Booterstown and Seapoint stations where people have to literally fight their way on to the DART train. These people want to leave their cars at home and use public transport which the Government recommends as the best and most environmentally friendly way to travel into the city, yet they literally have to beat their way on to the DART trains because of the inadequacy of the service.</P>
      <P>From time to time the Government has promised that additional DART carriages are about to be provided. However, they are a long time coming. They need to be provided as a matter of great urgency if the people who use the DART service are to get an adequate service for which they pay and to which they are entitled and if we are not to end up at some point where there is a serious accident at one of the DART stations because of the degree of pushing, crushing and general discomfort which occurs. An article in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> by a freelance journalist describes his experiences at a DART station. I am familiar with this experience as it is not uncommon or untypical. I appeal to the Minister to speed up the provision of the additional carriages promised for the DART service so that there is an adequate service on that line to accommodate and facilitate the people who want to use it. She should also address the management of DART stations and the service as a whole. Increasing numbers of people are opting to use this form of public transport. However, the problem is that the carriages, services and facilities at stations are not adequate to meet the demands of the people who wish to use this service.</P>

      <P>The Fine Gael motion portrays the party's usual preoccupation with problems inside the Pale. The Minister has demonstrated in recent years that she intends to address public transport problems throughout Ireland. I am delighted the Government has invested heavily in public transport and has outlined its plan for the next few years. We in Cork have benefited significantly as a result. Eleven to 14 year old buses were used in Cork during the last Administration but there are 50 new buses on the streets now with 30 more due. There has also been significant investment in the rail system.</P>
      <P>I am surprised by the Opposition's attempt to lay the blame for the mini-CTC contract at the door of the Minister for Public Enterprise. Deputy Jim Higgins should know better than to try to hang it on her.</P>

      <P>The buck stops with the CIE board but perhaps it should stop closer to the Deputy's party. The Deputy attacked Mr. McDonnell over his handling of the mini-CTC contract two weeks ago. He agreed to join the sub-committee to inquire into the farce whereby senior CIE management provided an open cheque book to the main contractor, Sasib and Alstom and Modern Networks Limited.</P>

      <P>The PricewaterhouseCoopers report commissioned by CIE is a damning indictment of senior management in Iarnród Éireann, not the Minister for Public Enterprise. She is not mentioned in the report and Deputy Jim Higgins should not try to fool the House. She is not responsible.</P>
      <P>I asked Mr. McDonnell when he appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport where the buck stopped in regard to this debacle and he has not yet responded. He acknowledged they had made mistakes. I queried whether he asked any senior member of his management team in Iarnród Éireann to resign and he said &ldquo;no&rdquo;. I then asked him whether he had confidence in his management team and he said &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I also asked whether he accepted fully the findings of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, which is a damning indictment of the company's management, and he said he did. Mr. McDonnell, Mr. Meagher and their team will have to accept responsibility for their gross incompetence in wasting £27 million in taxpayers' money. The committee is determined to get to the bottom of this.</P>

      <P>Industrial relations in Iarnród <Col N="910" /> Éireann are poor. I know several members of staff at the company and they say morale is low. Last week members of management involved in industrial relations said that anarchy was creeping into the company. One does not use such a word when dealing with staff and addressing problems.</P>
      <P>The problem in Iarnród Éireann is that senior managers are not listening or talking to staff and they do not prevent the problems which arise from festering. They are not trying to work out the problems. Management must learn to negotiate in a friendly manner to achieve what is best for the company without alienating the work force, and subsequently the public, who have been gravely inconvenienced by all the recent disruptions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fine Gael motion is utter nonsense. Deputy Gilmore touched on one extraordinary truth. The public transport system is in the hands of an antiquated, worn out, tired and jaded public sector body which has served its time. There is no better example than the DART system. The former Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, promised an extension of the DART line to the people of Greystones before the Wicklow by-election in 1995. He did not provide any money for it but it was provided by Fianna Fáil. The DART extension was built and to this day it is still not operating properly.</P>
      <P>CIE is incapable of managing anything. Its first problem was signalling while its second was rolling stock. We must be sympathetic because over the years successive Governments did not invest money in public transport but in recent years money has been invested which has been grotesquely mismanaged, as evidenced by the mini-CTC contract and the DART extensions. Additional staff were recruited to operate the DART service to Greystones and Malahide and extra carriages were purchased. There is not a banana republic in the world which would tolerate the service provided to the taxpayers and stakeholders in the CIE group.</P>
      <P>Ireland has been betrayed by CIE management which has feathered its own nest. When we examine the salaries they agreed in dubious circumstances with the last chairman of the board we will know more. People in the trade union movement have also betrayed the country because they are not willing to display leadership. It would be in the interests of the commuters, taxpayers, stakeholders and the workers in the CIE group if a little logic applied in that organisation.</P>
      <P>A proper management and board must be appointed initially at the top and common sense must be adopted at the bottom. Deputy Gilmore and his party might use a little influence on the trade union movement in that regard.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge there is a difficulty throughout Ireland in regard to the transport infrastructure. That has been created by the economic boom and the Government has <Col N="911" /> responded positively by introducing a number of different measures. I have no doubt the investment being made by the Government will pay off over time. The Opposition's reaction to the problem is nothing short of a sham and is another failed attempt to grab headlines and curry favour with the electorate.</P>

      <P>The Opposition presents itself every Tuesday in the same format, which is a Government in waiting. However, it is more like an Opposition in a coma than a Government in waiting.</P>
      <P>The Government, on the other hand, has proved it has the will, policies and funding to put a transport infrastructure in place that will serve us well as the economy develops. The Minister has displayed enormous ability and leadership in dealing with the problem left on her desk as a result of the inactivity of the previous Government. She was also left to deal with the CIE management structure, which does not compare favourably with the real world. The sooner it begins to respond the better.</P>
      <P>The previous Government left behind a public transport system urgently in need of investment and a serious problem in regard to rail safety and did not produce a strategy for the revitalisation of public transport. The rainbow coalition failed to address any of these problems or tackle them in a meaningful manner. The Government's plan to deal with traffic in Dublin will provide major assistance to the many people who travel to and from Dublin to conduct business. The investment of £150 million in the regional transport programme and the upgrading of public transport infrastructure in my constituency bodes well for the future for those who operate and use public transport to and from the capital.</P>
      <P>The development of roads infrastructure such as the N9, which is at design stage, should not be lost sight of because when all the projects are in place there will be an improvement in the development of the economy and an infrastructure which is second to none. This will be down to the Minister's vision and the activity of the Government. It will also highlight the Opposition's inaction when it was in power. The Opposition's use of Dáil time in this manner is nothing short of appalling.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinBrady" hpid="Mr. M. Brady Mr. M. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government in its three years in office has been more active than any other Government in providing investment for public transport and developing policies and strategies to meet existing and new challenges. The capital Estimates for the Department of Public Enterprise have been increased from £247 million to £318 million for 2001, an increase of 20%. This is an unprecedented increase of £71 million which will be spent on public transport, including Luas, bus and rail services and the rail safety pro<Col N="912" /> gramme. The provision for national roads of £630 million is an increase of £210 million or 50% on last year. As Deputy McGuinness said, the overall provision for public transport investment is £441 million. The Government subvention to CIE is rising from £115 million to £159 million, an increase of 38%.</P>
      <P>The Government had to develop a plan and it is making a reality of that. Based on the Opposition's track record in office, its promises and proposals can only be regarded as frivolous ramblings from a vivid and greatly overtaxed imagination. They have no more substance than a bottle of smoke. The Government is well on its way to putting the building blocks in place for the deregulation of the Dublin bus market which should be completed by 2002. As a member of the Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport, I compliment the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, and the chairman of that committee, Deputy Doherty, who has done a tremendous job. As Deputy Currie is also a member of the committee, I am sure he will concur with my views in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MartinBrady" hpid="Mr. M. Brady Mr. M. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Currie. At least we agree on the odd matter. I am concerned about recent announcements regarding the extensive deregulation of the taxi business. I do not have a vested interest in the taxi business but I have a vested interest in fair play, equality and justice, and it has not happened in this instance. I accept that the courts have decided that the Government cannot set a limit to the number of taxi licences. However, as a former trade union official, I have grave reservations about any scheme which permits unrestricted access to the business as the new scheme announced last night does.</P>
      <P>The Government has a right and a duty to regulate in the interests of both operators and consumers on such matters as the quality of service, standards, health and safety regulations, and so on. The consumer and the service provider must be taken into account. They must have dialogue. The taxi operators and those who hold taxi licences have been treated very shabbily in this regard. If a person paid £15,000 for a taxi plate a few months ago or last year and it can now be bought for £100, he or she must be compensated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Government, we have a duty to act in a fair and just way and in accordance with the law. The law states that everything is deregulated now. Where will we begin or stop? The taxi men got a raw deal and we must rectify that. We are the people in Government and we must ensure these people receive a fair deal. They have not received that. People have contacted me who invested £80,000 and now have something worth £100. Anyone with a streak of common sense will know that that is wrong, unfair and unjust. As a Government, we have a duty to rectify that and we should do so by providing adequate compen<Col N="913" /> sation. We must write the cheques and ensure those people are adequately compensated for their loss.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is Fine Gael policy to prioritise the railway system as the primary artery of national development, it should have done something about it in the previous Government but, unfortunately, no decisions were made by two Fine Gael Ministers during that Government's term in office.</P>
      <P>It is encouraging that the Taoiseach has spoken about the Government's plan to radically upgrade Ireland's road and public transport network. It shows that planning is moving ahead rapidly and key elements are already ahead of schedule. The road development plans in County Galway alone are very exciting because they involve new roads from Galway to Ballinasloe on the way to Dublin, roads from Tuam to Galway, roads bypassing Gort and going on to Limerick and roads which will bypass Milltown in the northern end of the county.</P>
      <P>While that is very encouraging, there is a great need for investment in the railways and I agree with what the Minister is doing in trying to achieve extra funding for them. A great deal of money has been spent on the railway from Dublin to Galway but we need to provide links into Galway city. The city is fortunate that the railway and bus stations are in the centre of the city. There could be a railway line into Galway for commuters from Tuam, for example. There could be links from south Galway into the city. There should be investment in that. I am always reminded when I go to Gort about the time children from Clare went by train to school. That was very beneficial but many of these rail links have been lost. It is time they were brought back.</P>
      <P>We also have a prospering timber industry and, with lines from Sligo to Limerick, it would be useful to put timber and freight back on the railway lines serving Masonite, Clonmel and Waterford and all the lines on which Fr. Micheál MacGréil has campaigned hard with his western inter-county railway committee to have freight and timber running again. This is very important and it should be done.</P>
      <P>I welcome what the Minister has said regarding the expansion of the Nitelink service and also the fact that extra buses have been brought on stream. Four quality bus corridors have been put into operation. In Galway we are fortunate that there is a bus service on the hour provided by Bus Éireann. We would not have it were it not for the competition which came into the bus industry through the private sector. That is very important. I was disappointed last week when a railway strike led to a bus strike at very short notice. I do not understand how that was allowed to happen. Good notice was given of the rail strike but no notice was given of the bus strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister's proposals to have screens at bus stations letting people know when the next bus is due. These are provided on the <Col N="914" /> Continent and at railway stations, such as Heuston, and Busáras. I hope the Minister's plans will be supported.</P>
    <P>There is only a brief mention of airports in the Fine Gael motion &ndash; Dublin Airport is mentioned. I am disappointed there is no reference to the regional airports because there needs to be investment in them. The marketing fund must be extended to other airports throughout the country. In Galway good use has been made of the marketing fund. I hope the fund will be increased next year and extended to all regional airports which are very important if there is to be regional development in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is a piece of political opportunism on the part of the Opposition. Anyone who looks at it will see it is an attempt to try to jump on the bandwagon in terms of a number of things which are already happening. When the records of the Government and the previous Government are compared, especially where the area of the country I represent is concerned, it will be seen that the previous Government had no commitment with regard to upgrading the railway line from Dublin to Sligo and a number of other areas, such as Galway, Waterford and Tralee. The current Government took a decision to upgrade the railway system and I pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, for taking the decision to put Government funds into upgrading the line from Dublin to Sligo.</P>
      <P>There is also the ongoing situation with the CTC signalling system and that deserves a full investigation. Reference was made to the Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport carrying out a full assessment. There will be a need to investigate that matter fully.</P>
      <P>Work that was proposed and should be completed has not started. In many cases, some of the other additional works that were to be carried out, such as laying fibre optic cables, has also been delayed as a result of this action.</P>
      <P>The upgrading of these lines means that rolling stock will have to be improved and that is the next step the Government should take. The upgrading of the road system has been mentioned by other speakers and I have no doubt that there is a need for that. We should stress to the Opposition parties, however, that we now have a BMW region in the west and north-west as a result of the decision taken by Government, which was totally contrary to what the previous Government proposed, namely, to have the entire country as an Objective One area in transition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must examine the positive transport initiatives that have taken place under this Government as well as the upgrading of various relevant facilities. A number of recent developments are to be welcomed, including the new Nitelink bus system for Dublin. If we do not have sufficient taxis in this city, people will need alternative transport services. None of us wants our sons or daughters to have to walk home after attending discos because of lack of a proper late night transport <Col N="915" /> service. Earlier in the debate a speaker said that parents have to pick up their sons and daughters late at night. In the country we always had to do that but, thankfully, in recent times taxis and hackneys have started to appear in even the most rural areas.</P>
    <P>We all want to see the new Luas system in place as soon as possible. It has the support of everyone in Dublin and everyone who visits the capital. In tabling this motion the Opposition is trying to be opportunistic. The Government's decision to compensate taxi owners had to be taken to ensure deregulation. People's investments are entitled to such protection. Negotiations should take place between the taxi unions and the Government to try to resolve the issue. Dublin is a growing city and it needs good public transport, whether it is provided by the private or public sector. The citizens of the country have a right to such a service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I support many of the views that have been expressed to improve and enhance public transport. I hold strong views on the need for a proper integrated public transport network to address the congestion difficulties in Dublin as a matter of urgency. Some of the traffic congestion is due, in part, to the lack of a properly co-ordinated programme of road maintenance and necessary infrastructural works. Contractors seem to be able to redirect traffic flows without appropriate consideration for those using our cities and towns.</P>
      <P>I welcome recent public transport service developments, in particular the provision of 500 new buses and new DART carriages, the extension of the Nitelink buses and the consultative process proposed by the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, on institutional reform of public transport. Progress is clearly being made but much more has yet to be achieved.</P>
      <P>In the past I have been happy to work closely with taxi representatives to develop ranks, shelters and adequate licences. I brought the various interest groups to round table discussions which later resulted in the formation of the taxi forum. For the first time, we had the relevant groups in round table discussions and at that time they reached agreement on significant increases in taxi licences. The taxi forum worked well for everyone because we had consultation, with no protests and no litigation. There were positive initiatives with, most importantly for the general public, more taxis operating on the streets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised and somewhat disappointed, especially as a Member of the Government benches, that the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, introduced his blunt instrument of change to the taxi service yesterday, without dialogue or consultation with representatives of the taxi industry. It is a matter of regret that representatives of the industry, including SIPTU, one of the largest unions in the country, failed to achieve an audi<Col N="916" /> ence with the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, to discuss this issue today. The measures announced yesterday will have a detrimental effect on many people, including their spouses and dependants, whose livelihood depends on the taxi industry. Surely, in the era of social partnership, consensus, negotiation and consultation, the way forward in these matters is to have dialogue and discussion. Look at the success of the taxi forum. Can anyone point the finger and say that it did not work? It worked well and made significant progress on the taxi issue at that time.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the amendment in the name of the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, refers to the Government's commitment &ldquo;urgently to restore a workable basis for new taxi licensing in order to satisfy public demand&rdquo;. The overriding consideration must be that additional licences are delivered without delay on a workable basis. Surely this is best achieved through consultation and dialogue with representatives of the National Taxi Drivers' Union, the Irish Taxi Federation and SIPTU.</P>
    <P>Everybody is attempting to achieve the same goal and it can be done through consultation. Not one taxi man would disagree there is a need for additional licences, and most Members of this House have said so. Everybody is setting their sights on the same target which can be achieved through consultation, as the taxi forum did. Many taxi drivers who have contacted me do not want to resort to protest or litigation, but they see the new proposals as threatening their livelihoods and investments. This is especially the case for many older taxi operators whose pension is under threat.</P>
    <P>If the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, wishes to resolve this issue he should make himself available to meet the legitimate representatives of the industry and agree proposals for a workable and equitable compensation package. It is important to correct the many incorrect statements that were made about what the taxi forum achieved and the number of licences that were issued by it. We should recognise the success and achievements of the taxi forum.</P>
    <P>I am at a loss to understand why we do not have an integrated public transport system in place, with all public service vehicles operating and co-ordinating transport services, especially at peak seasonal times. Is it not crazy to allow our subsidised public transport system to shut down at a time in the evening when public houses, late night discos and city restaurants are filled to capacity? Surely, we can provide the public with something better than a Cinderella service? Much more has yet to be achieved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I have often wondered, both in government and in opposition, about the useful<Col N="917" /> ness of Private Members' motions. While I recognise that they can highlight particular problems, embarrass the Government and gain publicity, only rarely do they do much good. I am glad, however, the motion before the House tabled one week ago, on 15 November, has struck gold. While the gold remains to be assayed and definite conclusions remain to be arrived at, on two issues at least, this debate has precipitated some action.</P>
      <P>I welcome the announcement well into the Government's fourth year in office that the long-running taxi scandal may, at last, be coming to an end. To be realistic, it is the result of a judicial decision which forced the hand of the Government. I became aware of the close relationship between Fianna Fáil and the taxi industry at a very early stage. On the first occasion on which I sought election I was surprised and appalled to see outside most polling stations in my constituency lines of taxis which were waiting to collect voters and on which the word &ldquo;taxi&rdquo;  was covered by the name of the Fianna Fáil candidate.</P>
      <P>I understand the fury and frustration of taxi operators who have been led up the garden path by certain Fianna Fáil Deputies who have betrayed them. I listened to Deputy Callely and while he might huff and puff, there is no doubt that he has not delivered. He has let the people down to whom he and others made promises. The taxi drivers have been betrayed.</P>
      <P>I have considerable sympathy for some taxi drivers. Full compensation should be paid to individual taxi drivers who paid big money to provide employment for themselves. Widows who were bequeathed licences by their late husbands as a form of pension also deserve full compensation, but, as we are all aware, there are others in the taxi industry, including bookies, who control a number of licences. These people are speculators who acquired licences as a form of speculation and deserve to be treated as such &ndash; they win some, they lose some. In this instance, they have lost and deserve to lose.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the decision announced by the Minister to expand the Nitelink service from the end of November. An hourly service was ridiculous. I have teenagers about whom I worry a lot when they are out at night. I have often said to myself, &ldquo;Thanks be to God for Lucan Cabs&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I live in and represent Lucan, and traffic and the cost of housing are the two most serious issues affecting my constituents. They are interlinked. Young people who have paid in excess of £150,000 for a two and a half bedroom semi-detached house find that they cannot get out of the housing estate in which they live in the morning and back in again in the evening. The QBC from Lucan is a success, but only when one gets out on the dual carriageway. If one is stuck in traffic on approach roads, it is of diminished influence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been promised two new railway stations in Lucan north and Lucan south. When will they be provided? They will make no contribution in responding to the current emergency. <Col N="918" /> We have also been promised a metro system which will serve part of west Dublin. The year 2016 has been mentioned as the earliest by which it will be provided. I will have something in common with it as it is likely that I will be underground by the time it is provided, all because of a lack of planning at central Government level and on the part of local councillors who are motivated and driven by developers who did not pay attention to the need to provide the necessary infrastructure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the debate. I travel regularly by taxi in Dublin and have yet to hear a taxi driver say that he or she would agree to deregulation and with the issuing of additional taxi licences. Most complain about the lack of co-ordination of traffic and events in the city.</P>
      <P>My colleagues should have added to the motion the additional failure of the Minister to recognise that the timings for the closure of pubs provided for in the most recent legislation only add to the chaos. It is obvious that she did not exert any influence. She probably did not make any protest. She probably just said that the pubs should close at 1 a.m. or 2 a.m., clashing with the discos and clubs and leaving many people on the side of the road at a time when few taxis are available. It is during daylight hours that there is over-capacity.</P>
      <P>There is much work to be done on this matter, which I thought could be resolved peacefully. It is obvious that Fianna Fáil members of the Government have not yet got down to work. If the matter is to be resolved, they will have to try to persuade the relevant Minister to step aside before he will give in. This is something about which they should think.</P>
      <P>I am disturbed about the ongoing industrial disputes in Iarnród Éireann in respect of which Deputy Roche, in particular, and others blamed the current management. There is an aspect of the company which I have begun to admire. It has hired many young people who will leave quickly if the industrial disputes continue. All we will be left with are older staff who will not be able to cope with any improvements made in respect of which active staff will be required who will be able to work quickly. The motion condemns the Minister for her failure to resolve any of the industrial disputes in the company. This is a worthy charge to place at her door. If she was present in the House, she would in her usual way dodge the ball and throw another back at us. Equivocation is her master trade. I fully support the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>If there was ever a time for the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, to move on, it is now. She has been in office for over three years during which time the public transport system has deteriorated. While I am aware that the Government has a difficulty with the concept of political responsibility, prefer<Col N="919" /> ring to shunt responsibility for this issue to every authority and none, this is an area around which specifically the grand madam of the Fianna Fáil Party needs to get her head very quickly. She has been an abject failure in terms of the co-ordination of public transport policy. As my colleague, Deputy Jim Higgins, said last night, there are 13 agencies in this city with responsibility for public transport and we wonder why it is in such a mess. There is no co-ordination or political leadership at the relevant Departments and the Minister is unable to take on certain vested interests who do not want the transport crisis to be solved.</P>
      <P>I heard Deputy Callely say earlier that the establishment of the taxi forum last year led to a number of substantial solutions, but I disagree. I was not a member of the taxi and hackney committee that was established by the four Dublin local authorities but the reality is that if the recommendation of that committee had been accepted at the time there would have been no need for deregulation. Fianna Fáil, particularly the Taoiseach who established this forum, delayed the inevitable and increased public hostility towards the taxi industry. Those who should be held directly responsible for that are the Members opposite. The taxi forum was a sop. It delayed the inevitable and, worse still, it failed to take on board the substantial progress made by the four local authorities in this city in respect of the taxi and hackney committee.</P>
      <P>If we had gone down the road of accepting more licence plates two years ago, as was the proposal from the taxi and hackney committee, we would not see deregulation today. I hope people remember that and the ignorant promises made to them on their doorsteps in 1997, which were repeated to me as I walked about my constituency. People should not forget the duplicity of Fianna Fáil public representatives in this city when they gave that <i>carte blanche</i> commitment. They should not forget it now and I hope they do not do so at the next general election.</P>
      <P>The traffic crisis in Tallaght has worsened since the Government came to office and will continue to worsen unless action is taken. A quality bus corridor was built two and a half years ago at considerable cost, yet no bus has ever travelled on it because the corridor stops at Templeogue, one mile away. Why, since the Government came to office, has the Luas project been stalled? We would have had a Luas line in Tallaght, built and delivered upon this year, but for the procrastination of the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, when she delayed the whole project looking at tunnels underground, specifically under St. Stephen's Green. That kind of procrastination is causing chaos in the public transport system.</P>

      <P>This debate is about failure. Why are the taxi men outside the door tonight? It is because of the failure of the Government. I do not blame them. If they listened to Deputy <Col N="920" /> Callely and other Fianna Fáil Deputies they are going down the wrong road. They may have made a mistake the last time but this time they will not go around the city with posters.</P>
      <P>I listened to the contributions made by Fianna Fáil Deputies, and they must have a new script writer. I wonder who she is. There were a few jokes in the scripts tonight but they were not able to carry them off because this is no joke.</P>
      <P>I come from the west where there was a train dispute for ten weeks. There was no public service into the west but there was no word about it because it did not affect Dublin. When it affects Dublin everyone talks about it. We have had rain in the west in the past ten years for ten months out of 12 but there was not a word about it. Three weeks ago there were floods here and the whole world knew about it.</P>
      <P>As regards the train dispute, a neighbour of mine, Finbar Masterson, was in the gallery last night. He is a young man with a wife and family, and his wife had to sit on the line when people, who supported unions at one time, started to take a train out of Westport. He gave 42 years of loyal service to Iranród Éireann. He never went on strike. He was fighting for his rights, his family and his job. Why? Because the Minister has lost control and she must go.</P>

      <P>I agree that the local authorities had made progress on the taxi issue. The publication of the Oscar Faber report went some way towards understanding the difficulties. The taxi forum was also making progress. I spoke to an official today who told me that 3,200 plates were promised by 2002. That would have been much better than what we have now. If that happened the taxi men would not be outside the door, concerned for their livelihoods, and there would not be as many people queuing at taxi ranks at night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem with the Government is it constantly changes tack. With the publication of the joint programme in 1999 we had a new venture. That has caused a problem. We need a far deeper analysis of the problem. We have unlimited hackneys in this city, yet when you try to get one at night you cannot do so. In theory, everyone has a mobile phone so you should be able to telephone for a hackney if you are in a bar or restaurant. As one of the ushers said to me, why during the day do you see long lines of taxis but at night you cannot get one? Is it, as was stated in the Oscar Faber report, that certain taxi people do not like to work at night but prefer working during the day? That analysis must be undertaken. We must look at the reality of deregulation <Col N="921" /> and see where it has worked. We know there are cities where it has been an abject failure.</P>
    <P>There must be greater accountability as regards Dublin Bus. I see the cutbacks in my constituency with the No. 13 bus. I asked simple questions in relation to the DART in Barrow Street but I cannot get answers. We do not have accountability or feedback and that is part of the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is about the abject failure of the Government to tackle the transport crisis. There is gridlock on our road and rail networks. There is gridlock in the capital city and at the Cabinet table. The only actions we see are strikes, go slow and work to rule. The wholescale disruption we have seen over the past three years has led to traffic congestion. I have been travelling to Dublin for the past four years and my journey now takes an hour longer. We have plans for new motorways and additional road infrastructure but these are delayed due to lack of resources to recruit engineers from abroad and fewer planning officials. This is a bottleneck that is clogging up the system and ensuring the Government's proposals do not take effect.</P>
      <P>Three weeks ago the N4, the main artery to the west, was flooded, five years after it was built. What hope is there for our infrastructural development in the future if we could not get it right when we had resources and staff in the past? Rural transport has been blatantly ignored by the Government. Deputy Sargent and I laid before the House cost effective proposals to tackle this issue but they have been ignored. Pensioners cannot get public transport. They cannot use their free travel pass and that is unacceptable. Fine Gael wants to reduce by half rail journey times to Dublin and around the country. We are prepared to make the investment and the radical overhaul of the system that is needed. This Government is failing to tackle those issues and to ensure that the major structural reform required takes place. I condemn the Government on its lack of progress, vision and confidence in delivering the national development plan and its infrastructural elements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. The chaos in the city tonight portrayed by the taxis outside Leinster House and throughout Dublin shows that the situation has come to a head. I do not know where it will lead us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government has lost interest in tackling problems. Whether it is the failure of the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, to take an interest or the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy's, ill conceived action to resolve the taxi problem, it has now come to a head. Take as an example the train service from Galway to Dublin. Last Sunday week a train was due to leave Galway at 4 p.m. for Dublin. Passengers in Ballinasloe were left in the station until 7.10 p.m. without any indication from Iarnród Éireann that the train would not come. When it eventually arrived it was over<Col N="922" /> crowded with people returning to Dublin after the weekend. By the time it reached Athlone, there was no seating and people had to stand. How can that be considered a service? The Minister has failed miserably.</P>
    <P>We can go back further and look at the inadequate bus service. Opposition Members spoke about an hourly bus service from Galway to Dublin by Bus Éireann. The reason it came about was that Bus Éireann realised the private bus companies had cleaned them out. The only way it could fight back and recoup some of the ground lost was by providing an hourly service. The private operators provide an excellent service at a cheaper price and Bus Éireann is still unable to compete with them on price.</P>
    <P>Whatever this Government does, it must realise that it has made a mess of the transport sector whether it be buses, trains, air services or taxis. It is incapable of readjusting to provide a proper service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important issue. The Government has failed dismally in providing public transport services, whether it is on land, sea or air. Deregulation of the taxi industry is a cause of concern to taxi drivers and I can understand that.</P>
      <P>I come from a business background and believe the revocation of restrictions on the number of taxi licences was badly handled. The Government assumes that if a taxi owner made an £80,000 investment five years ago, he or she will be fine. I disagree. Taxi drivers work a 40 hour weekend. It is a high risk industry. The tax write-off being suggested will depend on profits. I am in the retail trade and I am also a funeral director but I am aware that operating a taxi is a high risk enterprise involving high costs. It is not an easy business to run and one must work a 40 hour weekend as opposed to a 40 hour week, which means working early in the morning and late at night.</P>
      <P>The Government has failed. The Minister rejected the option of paying compensation to taxi drivers. There is compensation for farmers and redundancy payments for workers. The Minister must face the fact that people who have made an investment in taxis must be compensated. It is the least to which they are entitled. These people made an investment of £80,000, are probably rearing families, employing somebody to drive and trying to maintain a social life. That is extraordinarily difficult.</P>
      <P>There are also 5,000 hackney drivers. It is a different trade. The new regime will give them an entitlement to get an equivalent plate. Everybody knows how easy it was to get a hackney licence and about the abuse of hackney and taxi licences. The Government has failed and Government backbenchers are playing a double game on this issue. The Government endorsed this policy. Fianna Fáil is in partnership with the Progressive Democrats and is responsible for introducing this deregulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deregulation was necessary but not in this <Col N="923" /> manner. If this Government were in business, it would be bankrupt. That is not the way to treat people who have given a valuable service. This should have been introduced in a planned manner and consultations should have taken place which would have facilitated fairness. We do not need a situation where there are no trains, no buses and strikes. Every man parked outside this House today would prefer to be driving his car and making money while welcoming people into the trade. The Minister, however, made a short announcement, reducing an £80,000 investment to the value of a couple of hundred pounds. That is not fair or just and I cannot understand the Minister's justification.</P>
    <P>The Minister must understand the sheer frustration of the taxi industry. I can empathise with their difficulty. The Minister offered a tax concession in the form of a write-off against profits. That is subject to profits being made. This is not a mega rich business but a difficult business operating during difficult hours.</P>
    <P>There is a huge necessity for additional taxi plates but, like the argument for the retention of grocery orders and other practices, we must ensure the survival of people who have built up this industry to its current level. They will certainly welcome new people to the industry but people who have lost money should be compensated. There are several ways this can be done. People who have made the investment and have families to rear should be given some help in this &ldquo;compo society&rdquo; where there is compensation for everything.</P>

      <P>I support this motion and compliment Deputy Jim Higgins for putting it before the House. This is an historic day. I doubt that any other country in the world has schools closed, trains stopped and airports and roads closed off. It is a national crisis yet the Exchequer is awash with money and the Government is cock-a-hoop about its performance on the economic front.</P>
      <P>Services are a disaster and they will continue to be a disaster for as long as this Government is in power. Problems have not been tackled. One cannot deal with problems by trying to be nice to everybody. That is a childish attitude. Governments are in office to govern, not to travel the length and breadth of the country opening this and that for photo-calls. It was said lately that if a tin of beans were being opened, one could expect a Government Minister to turn up.</P>
      <P>The Government must get down to the basic business of making decisions. That is the purpose of governments. We have seen today the result of the problems that have piled high in recent years. The country has been brought to a standstill. I appeal to the Minister to tackle these problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>The record of the Government on public transport is second to none. We have been more active than any pre<Col N="924" /> vious Government in developing a long-term vision, setting out a comprehensive medium-term investment programme and providing greatly enhanced Exchequer resources for investment. We have done this against a background of unprecedented growth in demand for transport and many decades of sustained under-investment in public transport.</P>
      <P>Let us consider what we are doing. We have taken a number of important initiatives, which provide a long-term vision. The national development plan sets out the basic tenets of our long-term strategy in terms of the revitalisation of railways, a radical transformation of the public transport system in the greater Dublin area and the development of regional public transport, urban and rural. The recently published DTO document, Platform for Change, outlines a long-term transportation strategy for the greater Dublin area and complements the land use strategy in the strategic planning guidelines. Land use and transportation strategies are also being put in place for Cork, Limerick and Galway. We have engaged in a sustained policy development process under the auspices of the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure. We have published far-sighted and challenging proposals on the institutional reform of public transport and the regulation of the bus market in Dublin. The Cabinet committee will consider proposals on the institutional arrangements for transport and land use in the greater Dublin area at its December meeting and a review of bus market regulation outside Dublin will be completed next year.</P>
      <P>We have taken action on investment. We are the first Government in living memory to put substantial Exchequer capital resources into public transport. The national development plan sets out a £2.2 billion public transport investment programme, way ahead of anything provided in previous plans. In 2001, the Exchequer will provide £281 million for investment in public transport, compared with only £409,000 five years ago. We will provide £159 million in Exchequer revenue support payments for public transport in 2001, 50% more than five years ago. A combination of Exchequer and EU support has been provided for the purchase of more than 500 new buses, 375 for Dublin Bus over the past two years and 148 for Bus Éireann this year. A total of 46 DART and diesel railcars have been delivered this year, firm orders have been placed for a further 72 and an option to buy a further 36 DART cars has been negotiated. The revitalised Luas project is under construction, 40 trams have been ordered and the system is on schedule to open in 2003. A competition to appoint a PPP operator will begin before Christmas. We have put in place a five year, £430 million railway safety programme and have provided almost £280 million in Exchequer support in the first three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also taken other initiatives. Last year I published revised guidelines for bus licensing in the Dublin area. Up to then that market was virtually closed to private operators. Since then 17 <Col N="925" /> licences have been awarded. Over the next few days I will urgently consider proposals from my Department for more liberal licensing guidelines. Last night the Minister for Public Enterprise announced a major expansion of the Dublin Bus Nitelink service, with four new routes, extensions to existing routes and a continuous 20 minute service between 12.30 a.m. and 4.30 a.m. The service will have a nightly capacity of up to 10,000 passengers. It will operate throughout the Christmas and new year period, beginning on 30 November. It will then continue on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays throughout the year. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, announced major measures, which will put more taxis on to our city streets. The DTO and the Dublin local authorities have decided to establish a dedicated project team, under the aegis of Dublin Corporation, to plan and implement the quality bus corridors on a seamless basis. The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, has published an important report showing the way forward on integrated ticketing and fares, involving the introduction of state-of-the-art smartcard tickets. Legislation will be introduced in the new year to establish a railway infrastructure procurement agency to procure major rail-based projects, including the metro announced in July on a PPP basis.</P>
    <P>We have made a major start in addressing the neglect of decades. Our record stands up to scrutiny compared with that of previous Governments. We are committed to a long-term programme of reform, investment and service development and we are delivering. I urge the House to support the Government amendment.</P>

      <P>I wish to make one point in support of the motion, one that has not been made by my colleagues, which is of great importance to my constituents and to people living in Munster and the mid-west region. I want to talk briefly about the traffic gridlock in Kildare, which has become intolerable. Neither a Minister nor a statutory agency is willing to work on finding a resolution to what has become a major difficulty. We are told the problem persists only on bank holiday weekends or on Fridays, but the reality is that anybody travelling to or from Dublin through Kildare is seriously adversely affected because of the traffic gridlock there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call on the Garda authorities in conjunction with the National Roads Authority and Kildare County Council to declare Kildare town an emergency traffic blackspot. Hundreds of thousands of pounds per day are being lost directly to the economies of Munster, south Leinster, the mid-west and my constitutency because of the traffic gridlock in Kildare town. Not only are diesel and petrol being burned fruitlessly, as hundreds of thousands of motorists travelling to and from <Col N="926" /> Dublin have to wait for hours on end in Kildare, but potential and actual business is lost to my constituency and further south as investors, those attending meetings and industrial and commercial representatives lose valuable hours every day due to the inability to pass through the town of Kildare. Important meetings throughout my constituency are cancelled or rescheduled on a daily basis because those participating in them are unable to attend on time. The situation over recent months is such that those travelling to Dublin from the south on business or for social reasons are very much burdened and handicapped.</P>
    <P>Kildare County Council washes its hands of this issue, as cars, trucks, and buses park virtually in the middle of the street on the main street in Kildare, thus adding further to the daily problem. I am most critical of the traffic light sequence in Kildare town, which is directly responsible for much of the huge back-up of traffic on a daily basis. I have been in contact with the Garda Síochána in Naas requesting that gardaí take up permanent point duty in Kildare. I suggested that a roster of traffic duty should be undertaken by the gardaí on a daily basis from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. every day. A garda on point duty, equipped with an appropriate two-way radio, would surely do a better job than the current set up.</P>
    <P>As I said here previously, when I was a young fellow I came to Dublin with my parents and the first person we saw on O'Connell Bridge was a big garda on a white bollard wearing white gloves up to his elbows with a baton in his hand. That fellow shifted the traffic. I want him brought out of retirement and placed in Kildare town. The situation there is intolerable.</P>
    <P>During the summer I appealed to the National Roads Authority to help alleviate the problem, but no positive action has been taken to date. Gridlock in Kildare is now a major national issue, costing our economy hundreds of thousands of pounds per day. Meanwhile the National Roads Authority, the Garda Síochána, Kildare County Council or anyone else does not accept responsibility. Surely the Minister for the Environment and Local Government can show a measure of leadership and for a change knock heads together to resolve this critical issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State outlined a number of options and initiatives the Government has taken, but they are not working. I am sure he will agree this city is choked with traffic and the problem is spreading to the rest of the country. The journey from Kerry to Dublin, which at on time took only four hours, now takes five and a half hours and the position is getting worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State talked about a long-term vision. People should have had that vision ten years ago. What we need now is immediate action. We need immediate solutions. Drastic action will have to be taken. As an industrialist said to me last week, we have a first world econ<Col N="927" /> omy with a Third World infrastructure. Traffic gridlock is a major problem when people cannot get from one side of town to the digital park in the west of the city or to work in the morning. While this motion has been rubbished by the Government, it reflects what is happening.</P>
    <P>I received a number of calls from people in Kerry regarding the Tralee-Dublin rail line. A number of people who were due to come to Dublin today for medical treatment could not come, as they were inconvenienced because of the rail strike. The train is their only means of transport from Kerry to Dublin, as they cannot rely on the provision of an ambulance service nor do they have the use of a car. If the industrial relations mechanisms are not working, which is the reason we have so many strikes, we should review the structure of how we resolve disputes. It is time we reviewed what is happening, as there are too many strikes. The Minister cannot keep blaming the existing structures, be they the Labour Court or other mechanisms sheltering behind the PPF. We will have to review the existing structures if they cannot resolve current industrial relations. It is important that the drastic action suggested be taken as soon as possible, otherwise we will have more difficulties.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ellis raised questions earlier tonight. He questioned Fine Gael's motives in raising this issue. I cannot help remembering Deputy Ellis and his colleagues raising the issue of BSE; they demanded a debate on that matter here, no matter how much damage that did to our national image. We may have to debate that issue again soon given the trouble beef farmers are in.</P>
      <P>He also took great pleasure in telling us how much money was available for transport through the BMW scheme and how the Taoiseach had worked for that. He has forgotten very quickly that the Taoiseach worked very hard to include Kerry and Clare to appease an Independent Deputy from Kerry. The Taoiseach did not make that work; it was the European Commission which insisted that only Border, western and midland counties be included.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, introduced the changes in the taxi sector yesterday in an unacceptable way. Before the last election the parties now in Government spoke about how they would consult the people. The Minister for Defence said he would not close any Army barracks without consulting the people. If Deputy Molloy had carried out proper consultations we would not have people outside Leinster House today. That was done because of the pressure exerted by Fine Gael to ensure there was some form of taxi service in Dublin over Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Successive Governments &ndash; I include all parties &ndash; have failed the people of Cavan-Monaghan completely. When the railroads were closed we were promised proper road structures but today there is total gridlock on the M2 from Monaghan <Col N="928" /> to Dublin. Three by-passes were promised years ago but nothing has happened; not a sod has been turned. People trying to reach Dublin Airport cannot get there unless they leave three to four hours in advance, yet under the Government there have been so many strikes there &ndash; including today's taxi strike &ndash; that nobody knows if they will be able to travel. We were lucky to have a major jobs announcement the other day for Cavan but there was none for Monaghan. If we are to retain businesses in outlying areas we must ensure the transport service works properly. School buses are lying idle half the year and this must be looked at. Those buses could be used to transport old age pensioners and others entitled to free travel but who do not have a service.</P>

        <b>:</b> I thank everyone who contributed to this debate. That 27 speakers contributed over three hours shows the depth of political feeling and concern there is in this issue. I thank the Labour Party for supporting the motion. Deputy Stagg's analysis of the social and economic consequences of the current transport paralysis could not be more accurate. People spend a minimum of ten hours every week travelling to and from work or they are late for work or deliveries are late. We need more buses immediately. I visited the Broadstone depot and the new buses are modern and comfortable but the 125 buses boasted about by the Minister for Public Enterprise last night are pitifully inadequate in terms of the demand.</P>
      <P>Last night we had the usual history lesson from the Minister: who did what, when and where. People are not interested in history lessons. They want action and results. The Minister did exactly what I predicted she would do; she produced the chequebook and the cash register, boasting about the mega-millions the Government is spending. As I said last night, the problem with the Government is that it thinks that if it throws money at problems those problems will go away. It thinks money is a cure-all but money is only part of the equation. Proper planning, foresight, vision and management is needed as much as money and we do not have those at present.</P>
      <P>People who sat in traffic jams this evening, inching their way from traffic light to traffic light, are not interested in the mathematics. They want action. They want the gridlock to end so they can get back to their families. As Deputy Yates said last night, however, things are getting worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's rhetoric last night is of little comfort to people who have to cancel hospital appointments and postpone interviews or who missed planes because of today's rail strike or the gridlock at the airport. In the middle of the worst <Col N="929" /> public transport crisis in the history of the State, the best the Minister could offer the country last night was to unveil her new public transport smart card project. If there was ever a poorly timed sick joke, this was it. To talk about smart cards when we have too few buses and no trains while Dublin Airport is wracked by five industrial relations disputes is one joke too many.</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Independent </i>editorial put it well today. Passengers would be more indebted to the Minister and CIE if they &ldquo;would bridge the reality gap between the transport system they would like to have and the shambles we are actually encumbered with at present.&rdquo;  There is something chronically wrong with management-<Col N="930" /> worker relations in CIE that must be sorted out. There seems to be no long-term strategy or industrial relations model in place. Consequently, CIE will continue to stumble from crisis to crisis as is happening at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take notice that commuters are tired of this shambles and will not take much more of it. Forget the smart cards and gimmickry. Give us buses that run on time, give us a reliable air transport system and give us comfortable trains. That is all people are asking for but we have not got that. As has been said repeatedly, it is time for this Minister to go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me this opportunity to raise the important question of the future of the Irish Biscuits plant in Tallaght. More than 600 people are directly employed by this company and probably up to 200 other workers are employed in contract services such as transport, cleaning, catering, security and so on. There is also the knock-on effect on companies such as Cadburys and Greencore which are major suppliers to Irish Biscuits.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, but I regret that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, is not present and has refused to take this item during Question Time or on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>This, after all, is an industrial matter, a matter about jobs and the Tánaiste is the Minister with responsibility for industry and jobs. On top of all that, the matter is in her own constituency. There is widespread concern this evening about what the future holds for the people employed at Jacob's or Irish Biscuits. There is a meeting scheduled for Friday next between management and unions in London. Although it is known there has been contact with the Irish Government, it is not known what is the response of the Irish Government or what information the Ministers have in their possession about the future of the plant at Tallaght. Is there a buyer in prospect? We know the French multinational, the giant food company, has put the company on the market. Danone has pulled out, is disposing of the company but we do not know if there is a buyer in prospect. If there is we do not know what the future holds for the plant at Tallaght being maintained as a going concern.</P>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle knows that Irish Biscuits is an operating subsidiary for Jacob's and has almost half the share of the Irish biscuit market. What disturbs me about the absence of the Tánaiste tonight and the Minister of State for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development being present is that there was a very dispiriting response from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, in this House on 26 October when in an extremely casual, off-hand and misleading statement he told the House:</P>
      <P>I have no reason to believe that rumours that the company in question is to be placed on the market are anything other than speculation. My information is that the company is currently concentrating on the manufacture of its well-known brands and on sustaining its 600 jobs in Ireland. However, it should be noted that as a private company it is entitled to make its own decisions.</P>
      <P>It is clear from that reply that the Minister was wrong and that the Minister took no trouble to establish the true position. At that time the dogs in the street knew that the plant at Tallaght was working well below capacity and that rumours of wind-down, sale or closure were widespread. Now we know that Danone is retrenching to the savoury and snack end of the business but we do not know what is the future of the sweet biscuit part, that is the plant in Tallaght. The Tánaiste refuses to come into the House to make whatever information she has available to the workers at Tallaght. My understanding is that a company called Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst may be interested in acquiring some of the business being disposed of by Danone. I am hopeful but I do not know that the Tallaght plant may be part of that acquisition. I would like the Minister to tell the House what information he has on that.</P>
      <P>Workers who have given many years of loyal service deserve to know what the future holds for them. They deserve the courtesy of a considered and informed reply from the Minister of State tonight. It is critical in an area already badly affected by the closure of the Packard plant &ndash; and this plant is no more than a quarter of a mile from the Packard plant &ndash; that the jobs at Irish Biscuits are secured. Any assistance toward that objective ought to be forthcoming from the Government. I would like to hear from the Minister of State what information he has and what actions have been taken by the Government to protect the jobs at Tallaght. I hope the Minister of State will be able to tell us that there is a buyer in prospect, if not the company I mentioned then other prospective purchasers and that the jobs will be maintained at the modern plant at Tallaght which has a good industrial relations record and good productivity output and that that plant will be maintained and the jobs will be secured into the future. I hope the Minister of State, Mr. Ned O'Keeffe can confirm that.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Rabbitte for raising this important matter which is so relevant in his <Col N="933" /> constituency and to others. Irish Biscuits Limited has been producing biscuits for 150 years. It has a well trained work force of more than 600 people and is regarded as an efficient producer within the biscuit industry. Irish Biscuits Limited has indicated to Enterprise Ireland that there are a number of offers on the table by various parties to acquire Irish Biscuits from its parent company, Groupe Danone of Paris. These offers are being considered by Groupe Danone but a decision has not been made to date.</P>
      <P>I reiterate the point I made in response to a question to this House at the end of last month, that as a private concern Groupe Danone and Irish Biscuits are responsible for deciding their own future. Decisions of this type are normally taken for commercial reasons. However, it is not axiomatic that job losses follow. Should a new owner acquire the company, Irish Biscuits is confident it can continue and thrive as an efficient biscuit manufacturer.</P>
      <P>I share the management optimism about the future of Irish Biscuits. Up to recently, it was purely a production facility and the strategic and marketing decision-making powers rested with the UK facility in Aintree. Now, however, the Belgard Road facility is viewed as a stand alone business unit with the group. It is a profitable company with annual sales of more than £80 million of which a quarter is exported. It has a well-trained work force and unique attributes in that it has the technology to manufacture its speciality mallow products that should serve to ensure its viability and its position on the Irish market. Its market share here is 50 % and growing.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that my Department, in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland, will continue to monitor the situation closely.</P>

      <P>I am opposed to the conclusion of the Condon review on the maternity unit in Monaghan Hospital that it should be closed. The Condon review included Mr. Condon, a former secretary of the Department of Health, a consultant obstetrician from Dublin where there are 6,000 deliveries a year in her hospital, a consultant with a similar number of deliveries in Belfast and a nurse from outside the State. I am very disappointed that the review group did not have a consultant or nurse from a hospital in the area. It did not have a GP, a public health nurse or a <Col N="934" /> mother from the catchment area of Monaghan General Hospital. I know the group met a small number of such people during their deliberations. The report calls for the closure of the maternity unit which will entail women from Monaghan having to travel to Cavan for obstetric care. This is totally unacceptable. Some 96% of deliveries are normal and it shows no regard for the terrain of the Cavan-Monaghan area to propose that women travel 40 or 50 miles on a poor road network with the type of weather conditions experienced in the winter months in the region.</P>
      <P>I travelled yesterday from Carrickmacross to Cavan in frost and fog. Asking women with a normal delivery to travel these distances does not make sense. It will result in babies being born on the roadside, bleeding not being properly attended to because of the distance and women deciding not to go to the hospital and having their babies at home. I request the health board members to reject this plan on Monday. This report should be discussed with the staff of Monaghan General Hospital, with the general practitioners in the region and with the public health nurses who are at the coal face. A decision should be made to provide a new maternity unit as promised by the North Eastern Health Board only two years ago in the five years' plan and to staff the unit with a second obstetrician and paediatrician to ensure a quality service is provided and to build up the catchment area. It has been made clear that money is not the problem. Such a unit will provide an excellent service for the woman and child and eliminate the risks involved in travelling long distance. It would also take account of the human, social and economic factors, for example, the husbands, partners and children who regularly visit a mother. This is so particularly if the mother is detained in hospital for several weeks as can often be the case.</P>
      <P>The obstetrician should be based in Monaghan. Obstetricians more than any other discipline have difficulty in leaving their hospital base to provide outpatient services &ndash; and we are talking about 30 or 40 miles away &ndash; because they have an ongoing commitment to their patients who might come into labour at any time in the hospital where they are located. They would have difficulty getting out to provide the necessary outpatient care in obstetrics and gynaecology. In 1985, a proposal was made by Mr. McGrath to close Monaghan maternity unit. I was then a member of the health board and I opposed the closure of the unit for the same reasons I have outlined this evening.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I requested that the Minister for Health and Children meet the health board members from Monaghan. I wish to record my appreciation that, at very short notice, he met the health board members and Oireachtas Members from the area today and listened carefully to their views.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy O'Hanlon, I wish to share time with Deputy Ó Caoláin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important issue. I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, for being present but I am disappointed a Minister or <Col N="935" /> Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children is not present. However, I thank the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, for meeting us today at short notice.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Condon report states that consultant-led maternity services at Monaghan General Hospital must cease in the immediate future and that a midwifery-led obstetric service will not be allowed has come as a bombshell to the people of Monaghan and I do not believe they will accept it. Promises were made by the health board's executives that Monaghan maternity unit would not only be maintained but that it would be upgraded. In spite of the public furore over a number of years, the number of births at Monaghan General Hospital has remained steady or even increased. With the improved prospects in the Border region and the dividend from the peace process, we should be looking to increase numbers in addition to encouraging constructive co-operation with the new Northern Ireland Assembly.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, must arrange an immediate meeting with his counterpart in Northern Ireland, Bairbre de Brun, because, with Monaghan General Hospital situated only four miles from the Armagh border, there should be an opportunity to serve a much wider region. One need only visit the car park in Monaghan town on any day of the week to see that people from the entire region use the town as a centre for shopping.</P>
    <P>Monaghan General Hospital must be upgraded to level two maternity status and given three consultant obstetricians and the relevant consultancy support services. As Deputy O'Hanlon stated, mothers requiring this service have to travel between 40 and 60 miles on poor quality roads in all kinds of weather to the nearest alternative hospital. Did the Condon review group consider any of these problems or any of the opportunities offered by the new situation along the Border? I believe it did not.</P>
    <P>The maternity unit in Monaghan General Hospital has given a first class service to all those who chose to use it. One mother informed me this evening that she could not favourably compare the care and treatment she received in Monaghan during the births of three of her children to that she received when she gave birth in a large Dublin hospital. A young couple expecting their first child spoke to me in desperation this morning and inquired about what is going to happen.</P>
    <P>The staff of Monaghan General Hospital, who have been given so many promises in the past, cannot understand what is happening. The Minister for Health and Children must ensure that the necessary consultants are provided, even on a temporary basis, until negotiations with Minister de Brun and full consultations take place in respect of this issue. Comhairle na nOspidéal, the Condon review group and Professor John Bonnar, chairman of the obstetricians and gynaecologists association, seem to be running this country's health service at present.</P>
    <P>The care given in Monaghan General Hospital has been first class. As Deputy O'Hanlon stated, <Col N="936" /> money does not seem to be the problem. It would be difficult to explain to expectant mothers why they should be obliged to travel between 40 and 60 miles to the nearest alternative hospital. Why should they be obliged to bear the expense and undergo the stress involved in so doing? Like Deputy O'Hanlon, I believe babies will be born in cars rather than in Monaghan General Hospital.</P>

      <P>I thank my constituency colleagues, Deputies O'Hanlon and Crawford, for sharing time.</P>
      <P>The report of the Condon review group has provoked widespread dismay and anger throughout County Monaghan and beyond. We are faced with proposals for the closure of key services at Monaghan General Hospital, proposals which must be resisted. The people of County Monaghan successfully campaigned against the closure of their hospital and have long been working to ensure that this vital health facility is not only maintained but expanded. Now, however, the members of the North Eastern Health Board are to be asked to discontinue a key element of the health infrastructure of the region, the maternity service on offer at Monaghan General Hospital.</P>
      <P>As a member of the health board, I am strenuously opposing this threatened closure of an essential service for mothers and children. This is an issue not just for the people of County Monaghan but for the citizens and elected representatives of our entire region which comprises counties Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Meath. A reduction of service in any part of the region will reduce health provision for everyone who lives there.</P>
      <P>With other Oireachtas representatives from counties Cavan and Monaghan, I met the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, in Government Buildings earlier today. We expressed our strongest opposition to this proposal and urged his direct intervention. I repeat that call for intervention now. Our subsequent meeting with the North Eastern Health Board executive was very unsatisfactory. Those representatives showed an inflexibility and unwillingness to address the concerns of the community whose service is now threatened. In these circumstances, the Minister's role is now vital.</P>
      <P>I appeal to all members of the North Eastern Health Board to oppose the proposal to close Monaghan General Hospital's maternity department. This is not an issue of hospital against hospital or county against county. As demonstrated in this Chamber this evening, people of diverse political opinions have united in their efforts to save this service.</P>
      <P>Having worked diligently for many years to support and enhance the dedicated service provided by the staff at Monaghan General Hospital to our community, I again pledge my total commitment to this vital health facility. In conjunction with the community and representatives of diverse political opinion, I am determined to save this service.</P>

      <P>I wish to apologise on behalf <Col N="937" /> of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, who cannot be present this evening due to other commitments. I thank the Deputies for affording me the opportunity to address the House this evening and to outline the position in relation to the provision of maternity services at Monaghan hospital on behalf of the Minister.</P>
      <P>In 1998, the North Eastern Health Board unanimously adopted a framework document for the development of acute hospital services. This document provided for a review of maternity services across the region in the context of ensuring best and safest medical and nursing practice, while respecting and responding to the requirement among women for their right to choose the maternity service most appropriate to their individual needs.</P>
      <P>It was, therefore, agreed by the North Eastern Health Board in June 1998 that the chief executive officer would initiate a process to investigate fully all options in the light of current practice, knowledge and developments both in Ireland and internationally. The board agreed to involve obstetricians, anaesthetists, paediatricians, general practitioners, senior nurses and midwives and representatives of user groups in the local communities in this process. The board also agreed to invite expert advice from outside the region.</P>
      <P>The review group was established by the chief executive officer and commenced its work in September 1998. It carried out the review in accordance with the following terms of reference: to investigate fully all the options in relation to maternity services in the area of the North Eastern Health Board in the light of current practice, knowledge and developments, both here and abroad; to involve in this process obstetricians, anaesthetists, paediatricians, senior nurses and midwives and representatives of user groups in the local communities; and to seek appropriate expert advice from outside the region.</P>
      <P>The board has informed the Minister for Health and Children that in conducting the review, the group had regard to the following: review of the literature on best practice and standards; the outcome of a consultative process; results of a research project involving more than 500 women in the north-eastern area who had given birth within the past three years; and submissions made by interested parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review group also took cognisance of the board's acute hospital framework document. It concluded its review and submitted its report to the chief executive officer of the North Eastern Health Board on 14 November 2000. Deputy Martin has been informed that the chief executive officer presented this report to the board, in committee, on 20 November and will present it formally to the board on Monday, 27 November. The Minister has been further informed that the deputy chief executive officer held briefing sessions with staff at both the Monaghan and Dundalk sites on Tuesday, 21 November and that the chief executive officer was meeting Oireachtas Members earlier today. This matter now falls to <Col N="938" /> be dealt with by the health board in the first instance.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter which seeks clarification of the powers of health boards as between the executive and elected members. This matter relates to a church in Castlebar in my constituency. The Minister of State may not be able to answer my questions but I ask him to convey my comments to the Minister for Health and Children so that he can clarify the position.</P>
      <P>This matter deals with the proposed closure of a church on the grounds of the old St. Mary's Hospital, Castlebar. This church was built in 1870 on the grounds of the old sanatorium for the purposes of providing mass for staff and patients. For the past 30 years this church has been used by the Catholic Church where mass has been attended by the general public. The Church does not own the church or the grounds on which it is built. The church is located directly opposite the new entrance to the accident and emergency unit of Mayo General Hospital. Two years ago the people of the parish of Castlebar raised £30,000 for repairs to the roof of the church. I visited it last Sunday and it is a very fine building.</P>
      <P>The Western Health Board has announced that it intends to close the church effective 3 December. The reasons given is that it wants to provide a library in the building for the nurse training school, which will be located in the old psychiatric hospital which also houses the Mayo-Galway Institute. The health board says that this is an executive decision and that it has been taken because of the parking problems outside the main entrance to the hospital, for health and safety reasons and the need for a library.</P>
      <P>I do not know who is responsible for this issue and why this decision has been made. I reject the reasons given by the health board. The director of the GMIT has confirmed to me that he has offered the health board space and facilities in his premises for this library and a medical library. There is no need, therefore, to acquire the church for library facilities. It is clear, even to the untrained eye, that the obstructions outside the main entrance to the hospital's accident and emergency unit can be improved without interfering with the church. I do not accept that the health and safety regulations come into play in this case. This has been presented by the Western Health Board as a <i>fait accompli</i> and it has misrepresented the Archbishop of Tuam, Dr. Michael Neary, and the local parish priest, Canon Curran, by saying agreement was given by the Catholic Church for this closure when it was not. The Archbishop of Tuam and the parish priest have confirmed to me that they want to continue to say mass for the general public in this church.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1970 Act, health boards took the power from county councils to deal with health matters and health services. The functions of the <Col N="939" /> elected members of the boards, through the county councils, are to provide these services. The Minister should clarify this matter. The closure of the church is a matter for the board members as distinct from the executive members. Every Sunday approximately 200 people attend mass in the church. The majority of them live in St. Patrick's Avenue, Westport Road, Aglish estate, Knockaphunta estate, Manor village and surrounding areas.</P>
    <P>The Archbishop of Tuam has been misrepresented and I would like at the meeting on Friday between the chief executive officer of the health board and the members of the health board from County Mayo for the chief executive officer to say that she will arrange a long-term lease for the Catholic Church so that mass can be provided in the church and that the remaining improvements to the accident and emergency unit can be dealt with without any interference to the church. This makes sense and means the Catholic Church will not have to raise funds for a new church, thereby putting a levy on all the new houses in this district over the next five years. Castlebar is a fast growing town and there will be a need for this service in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>On the &ldquo;executive decision&rdquo; by the board, which has been presented as a <i>fait accompli</i> , the Health Act, 1970, clearly states that the Minister is entitled to distinguish between any dispute which arises. I ask him to give a direction to the chief executive of the health board to arrange for a long-term lease so that the Catholic Church can continue to provide mass for the general public in this beautiful church in the coming years.</P>
    <P>It has also been presented that a new ambulance base will be built at the back of the church. However, ambulance drivers have confirmed to me that they have absolutely no objection to the retention of the church and that it does not interfere with access to the hospital in an emergency.

      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin.</P>
      <P>The Health Act, 1970, provides for the establishment of health boards by the Minister for Health and Children, by regulation, for the administration of the health services in the State. It also provides for the specification by the Minister, by regulation, of the membership of each board. It sets out the type and category of person who shall be appointed to such membership of health boards. Section 6 of the Act states that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to section 17, a health board shall perform the functions conferred on it under the Act and any other functions which, immedi<Col N="940" /> ately before its establishment, were performed by a local authority (other than as a sanitary authority) in the functional area of the health board in relation to the operation of services provided under, or in connection with, the administration of the enactments specified in subsection (2).</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) lists the relevant Acts. This is the statutory basis, in conjunction with other sections of the Health Act and other relevant Acts under which health boards are responsible for the provision of primary care, secondary care and other services to the population.</P>
    <P>Section 17 deals with the performance of their duties by the chief executive officers and other officers of a health board. The Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996, <i>inter alia</i>, amended section 17 of the Health Act, 1970, and provided that a reserved function, as defined in that Act, shall be performed directly by a health board and that a function of a health board that is not a reserved function shall be performed by the chief executive officer unless otherwise provided for and such a function shall be an executive function.</P>
    <P>The Health Act, 1970, sets out the functions and responsibilities of the Minister in relation to the performance by health boards of their functions in the delivery of health services in their areas. The Deputy will be aware that the ministerial functions and responsibilities cover the whole range of services provided for in the Act and vary from activity to activity.</P>
    <P>The Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996, also conveyed significant functions and responsibilities on the Minister as regards the interaction between him and the health boards. In particular, it sets out explicitly the responsibilities of the Minister in the determination of net expenditure limits for health boards and the detailed procedure for health boards in the determination, adoption and submission to the Minister of a service plan based on that determination. It also provides for the sanctions that may be applied by the Minister in respect of a health board which is not performing any one or more of its functions in an effective manner or which has failed to comply with any direction given by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The underlying philosophy of the Health Act, 1970, and the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996, together with the other body of enactments, is the vesting of powers within the local statutory administrative structure, whether it be the health boards or their chief executive officers, under the broad direction of the Minister. If the Deputy has a concern in relation to a particular activity of a health board the Minister will, of course, will be happy to examine it further. I will convey the Deputy's comments to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 23 November 2000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78, 111, 132, 156 and 167 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Community employment is an active labour market programme whose primary role is to progress participants to jobs in the open labour market. The programme was restructured during 1999 to take account of the tightening labour market and to refocus the programme on older persons and those most removed from the labour market. The principal feature of the restructuring was the introduction of a phased reduction in the number of participants on CE to 28,000 by 2003, through transferring the resources for 5,000 places to the social economy programme and by reducing the numbers of places otherwise on the CE by 4,500 from the 1999 average provision of 37,500. There are currently 33,412 participants on <Col N="942" /> the programme, which has a target average participation in the region of 33,000 for 2001.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently finalising discussions with the Department of Education and Science aimed at transferring CE funding on schools schemes amounting to £46 million to that Department, based on a FÁS audit of CE essential services in November 1999. This would provide an increase in funding for schools over and above the additional resources already allocated by the Department of Education and Science for these purposes over the past year. The precise nature of the scheme to be implemented is at an advanced stage of consideration by the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <P>Following the proposed mainstreaming of CE schools services and the associated funding, and allowing for an appropriate transition period, CE services to schools will be discontinued. Similar discussions are also under way with the Department of Health and Children on determining the potential to transfer a total of approximately £15 million CE spending on services to persons with disabilities. To ensure that they are not adversely affected by the restructuring of the programme, these services for persons with disabilities are classified as a priority by FÁS. Consequently, they are currently exempt from the phased reductions which have been imposed on other categories of CE projects.</P>
    <P>On completing the discussions with the relevant Government Departments, proposals on the mainstreaming of CE services in schools and for persons with disabilities will be discussed with the social partners within weeks under the framework of the PPF Standing Committee on the Labour Market.</P>
    <P>The social economy programme was formally launched on 18 September 2000. The key aims of the social economy programme are to support the regeneration and quality of life of local disadvantaged areas and to maximise employment opportunities for long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged persons.</P>
    <P>The programme will support the development and operation of social economy enterprises that provide social services and employment opportunities in and for disadvantaged communities. Financial grants and technical supports are provided for the development of social economy businesses for up to three years. This includes grant support for the development of a business plan.</P>
    <P>The national development plan provides for expenditure of £213 million on the social economy programme over the period 2000-06. It is expected that expenditure in 2001 will be £17 million and it is forecast to rise to £41 million per annum as the demand for the programme increases.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80, 99, 105 and 169 together.</P>
      <P>Skills and labour shortages, if left unaddressed, will pose a serious threat to our continued economic success. The Government has, however, a wide range of strategies and polices in place to meet the challenges posed. There are many facets to the policy mix being pursued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reducing the tax burden on labour and improving the reward from work is a major fea<Col N="944" /> ture of the strategy aimed at improving the incentive to seek, take-up and remain in work. Ensuring that a large majority of taxpayers are subject to no more than the standard rate of tax and removing low-paid from the tax net altogether, combined with fundamental reform of the tax system with the implementation of a tax credit system, all act as a substantial encouragement to return to or remain in work for many groups including, new recruits, the unemployed, and persons outside the labour market who would wish to return. This Government has been actively involved in significantly reducing both the standard and marginal tax rates which act to make the country more attractive to highly skilled workers.  </P>
    <P>This strategic approach is being complimented with a wide variety of measures aimed at both increasing the labour supply and upgrading the skills of the workforce as notified in the Employment Action Plan 2000. Key measures include systematic and early intervention with the unemployed with an offer of an employability support; a continuation in the provision of a wide range and scale of labour market programmes to help the long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged groups re-integrate into the open labour market; increases in the supply of education and training places to meet identified and emergent skills shortages; continuing investment in the apprenticeship system to meet the increasing demand for training; and, as part of the comprehensive approach aimed at increasing female labour force participation, funding for child care has been substantially increased as notified in the national development plan.</P>
    <P>As part of the overall strategic goal of enhancing the skills in the economy, a task force on lifelong learning has been established and is considering measures to improve access to learning and upskilling opportunities and aims to bring proposals to Government early next year. In addition, I have recently published the National Training Fund Bill, 2000. This Bill provides for the establishment of the national training fund which will play a key role in helping people acquire skills which will enhance their employability.</P>
    <P>In addition, to augment domestic labour supply, there are a range of policies and programmes in place to attract persons from outside the State into the domestic labour force. Net inward migration into the State has increased significantly in recent years in response to the exceptional growth of the economy. More recently, I have revamped the operation of the work permits scheme. As a result there was 15,391 permits issued as of 21 November 2000 in comparison to 6,258 permits in 1999. This has been supplemented with the implementation this year of the working visa system to facilitate the recruitment of suitably qualified persons for designated sectors where skills shortages are particularly acute.</P>

      <P>The working visa and work authorisation scheme was introduced to facilitate the recruitment of suitably qualified people from non-EEA countries for designated sectors of the employment market where skill shortages are particularly acute. At present, the new arrangements cover the information and computing technologies, construction professionals and nursing sectors. The latest available figures for the new scheme provide details of the number of working visas and work authorisations issued for the first five months of operation of the scheme. A total of 611 working visas and 221 work authorisations issued for this period, up until the end of October 2000.</P>
      <P>I should stress that while FÁS does advertise vacancies in Ireland through its website and jobs fairs abroad, the decision to recruit people is made by private sector employers. The new system facilitates the entry of the prospective employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 129  together.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals at present to amend the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>The Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, is administered by the employment rights division of my Department and is enforced by the labour inspectorate within that division. The inspectorate is comprised of 18 inspectors, two of whom are job-sharing. As well as the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, the labour inspectorate of my Department is responsible for the enforcement of worker rights set down in a variety of labour legislation and of statutory minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment of workers employed in sectors covered by employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements.</P>
      <P>As regards the 1996 Act, inspections of employers' records are carried out based on complaints received about specific breaches of the Act and as a matter of routine. Breaches of the Act can be detected by close examination of these records. The basic hours of work for inspectors are from 9.15 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. Inspections generally take place during normal office hours as the majority of employers carry on business during these hours. However, my inspectors do not restrict their activities to this time-frame and regularly undertake late night inspection work.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the methodology adopted in relation to inspection work in relation to the Act is reasonable and that inspections are organised and targeted in a way that makes most efficient use of the enforcement resources available to me. The latest statistics available to me indicate that a total of 2,342 inspections under the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996 have been undertaken this year. Of these, 627 inspections were undertaken as night-work.</P>
      <P>Enforcement experience has shown that the majority of employers found to be in breach of the Act are willing to adjust their practices to conform with the legal requirements. To ensure that corrective measures are taken by employers in such instances and that further breaches do not occur a follow-up inspection is usually carried out after a suitable lapse of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, there are occasions when pros<Col N="947" /> ecution becomes necessary. During the period 1 October 1999 to 17 November 2000 the number of cases of infringement of the Act involving referral to the Chief State Solicitor's office for legal action against offending employers was 19. Court hearings, during the period in question, of prosecution actions taken by my Department in respect of offences under the Act numbered five, all of which resulted in the conviction of the employers involved.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would point out that while there is a legal obligation on employers to see that the law is upheld in this area, there is also a moral responsibility on parents to ensure that the objectives of the Act &ndash; in regard to both the protection of the education and health of children and young persons &ndash; are not frustrated. As previously stated on a number of occasions, I would urge parents and teachers who are aware of any breaches of the legislation to contact the employment rights section of my Department. Such reported breaches will be dealt with expediently and every effort will be made by the officials of my Department to eradicate non-compliance with the 1996 Act.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84, 103 and 143 together.</P>
      <P>Framework IV of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness identified a problem in the timely provision of training for apprentices, the consequent backlogs which had arisen and undertook that progress which had been made in addressing these problems would be reviewed at end September 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="948" /> In October I responded to a question from Deputy Naughten on this subject and detailed the measures which had been put in place to address the backlogs problem. I also indicated that I would arrange for FÁS to brief the Deputy further on the matter and I understand that such a briefing was provided to the Deputy on 13 November.</P>
    <P>The capacity problems and backlogs which have arisen in apprenticeship are due to the fact that, currently, there are no limits on entry to apprenticeship for suitably qualified people who are taken into employment by qualified employers. This contrasts with the third level education system, for example, where intake is matched to the availability of places. Against this background, the apprentice population has risen from 10,772 in 1995 to 23,023 currently and this has created significant difficulties and costs in ramping up supply of training places to meet demand and has resulted in delays in offering apprentices their off the job training on schedule.</P>
    <P>Concerted efforts have been made to address the problem. The number of training places for phase two has been increased from 3,300 places annually as at September 1996 to a current provision of 7,060 places. Additional resources have been provided in the 2001 Estimates to allow a further ramping up of places to 8,500 by end 2001. FÁS has also introduced administrative changes to working procedures that have significantly improved attendance at training. These changes have resulted in a higher level of throughput due to improved capacity utilisation.</P>
    <P>FÁS has overall responsibility for the administration of the apprenticeship system and is in regular contact with officials of the Department of Education and Science and the institutes of technology in regard to the planning and provision of phase four and six training.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science has increased the number of phase four and six training places from 4,100 places annually as at September 1996 to a current provision of 9,500 places. The institutes of technology also provided an additional 750 phase four and six training places during summer 2000.</P>
    <P>A further increase in phase four and six places is planned, with a target of 11,790 places to be achieved by September 2001. It is also hoped to provide additional places through the mechanism of summer courses in the institutes of technology during 2001.</P>
    <P>On the basis of 8,000 new registrations per annum, these changes will have the effect of further improving levels of provision in response to the very significant increases in demand for apprenticeship training over recent years.</P>
    <P>As regards the special task team referred to in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, my officials will shortly complete a comprehensive review of the apprenticeship system covering capacity, management and governance of the system. In addition, a member of my Department is currently chairing a subgroup of the expert group <Col N="949" /> on future skills needs which is assessing supply and demand for construction skills. The findings of that group, which includes representatives of Government Departments, FÁS, employers and ICTU will provide an important basis for assessing future apprenticeship requirements. The subgroup will report to the expert group early in the new year.</P>
    <P>It is intended to convene the special task team once this work is completed.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on Adult Education Learning for Life published recently by the Minister for Education and Science focused strongly on addressing the problem of low levels of adult literacy. A total of £73.6 million has been earmarked in the national development plan for adult literacy, and the number of clients catered for by the literacy service has increased from 5,000 to 13,000 in the past three years.</P>
      <P>Specific workplace literacy programmes have been organised with the co-operation of unions and employers and the National Adult Literacy Agency has trained tutors to provide specific assistance in the workplace. A programme for workers in the hospitality industry is currently under way and further projects are being developed by NALA for local authority workers in co-operation with the Local Government Services Board.</P>
      <P>The task force on lifelong learning which has been established by my Department in collaboration with the Department of Education and Science is examining the learning needs of low skilled persons in the workplace. My Department will continue to co-operate with the Department of Education and Science and other relevant stakeholders on literacy issues within the framework of the task force's work. I have no plans currently to provide workplace literacy training programmes separate from those being developed by NALA and the social partners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 89 and 162 together.</P>
      <P>The use of advanced information communications technologies has become the most significant driver of world economic growth. ICTs are the catalysts through which enterprise, whether traditional or new and irrespective of location, can create sustained competitive advantage for its products and services on world markets. ICTs are also the catalysts through which enterprise can create quality and sustainable employment. Innovative strategies that capitalise on the power of the Internet are required and new business models that respond to customer demands in the knowledge economy must be developed.</P>
      <P>The challenges posed by the digital economy are not only technological but, to a large extent, strategic in nature. Ireland must ensure in the immediate future, that not only are the basic infrastructural requirements put in place, but also that the full potential of ICTs is realised for the benefit of our enterprise and employment. Government also has a vital role to play in supporting the new digital revolution and is committed to asserting its leadership role through, for example, the information society action plan, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and the eEurope 2002 action plan, and by accelerating the move towards the on-line delivery of public services and the development of Ireland as a knowledge economy.</P>
      <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will promote, in collaboration with other Departments, the State agencies and the private sector, and at international level as members of the European Union, the WTO, the OECD and the UN, an environment which is conducive to building a critical mass of business throughout Ireland that can exploit the new knowledge economy as follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the areas of telecommunications infrastructure, regulation and costs, the Department is inputting into the development of a legislative <Col N="952" /> and regulatory regime to achieve the Government's objective to have vigorous competition by world class telecommunication services providers which will supply low cost broadband &ndash; Internet &ndash; connectivity throughout this country. Last year, our Government committed IR£61 million to the global crossing international connectivity project and a further IR£50 million to 13 regional broadband projects. A further sum of IR£150 million has been set aside under the national development plan for further e-commerce infrastructure projects which will address the telecommunications infrastructure needs in the regions.</P>
    <P>In the area of awareness and access, our development agencies are assisting business to adopt and harness the potential of ICT through acceleration initiatives and by developing business and consumer trust in e-business through awareness campaigns in a public private partnership with the relevant sectoral organisations.</P>
    <P>The Government is encouraging investment in education, skills and training through bodies such as the expert group on future skills needs, the education sector and FÁS to develop the appropriate skills, to promote innovation and to meet the emerging skills gaps, particularly in the ICT industries and e-business areas.</P>
    <P>In the research and development area, initiatives such as the technology foresight fund and the European Union's framework programme of research, Technological Development and Demonstration 1998-2002, are used to establish Ireland as a location for world class research excellence in niche areas within the ICT and e-business areas.</P>
    <P>By working closely with other Departments and international bodies, we are building a balanced e-regulation framework which creates the necessary confidence and trust in e-business by enterprise and consumers alike and which encourages growth in the area.</P>
    <P>Government is maximising the use of ICT in a co-ordinated client centred manner to deliver services to business, consumers and citizens through the Reach, OASIS and BASIS projects.</P>
    <P>These initiatives are being implemented in a co-ordinated manner and aim to ensure that Ireland will be a world leader in the digital economy.</P>

      <Quest>if, further to Parliamentary Question No. 68 of 13 June 2000 on issues associated with the cost of motor insurance for young drivers', he is empowered to put in place certain initiatives to encourage premium discounts; the type of initiatives and other issues that would reduce the frequency of accidents; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Under EU law, neither the Tánaiste nor I, nor <Col N="953" /> our Department or the Government, has any statutory control over the premiums levied by insurance companies, nor do we have the right to influence the criteria used for covering risk.</P>
      <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is in no doubt that the focus of any initiatives aimed at reducing the cost of motor insurance for young drivers must be on reducing the frequency of accidents. The Deloitte &amp; Touche report on insurance costs in Ireland found that motorists in the 17 to 24 year old age group were responsible for over three and a half times the total average claims cost incurred for motorists in the 36 to 40 age group. Furthermore, the report noted that the average cost of an insurance claim for 17 to 24 year old drivers was twice that for the 36 to 40 age group.</P>
      <P>The initiatives are as set out previously. The Irish Insurance Federation, in conjunction with the driving instructors register, has introduced a scheme of insurance premium discounts for the young driver, on completion of a required number of driving lessons. The National Safety Council, in co-operation with the gardaí, continue to promote anti-speeding and anti-drink driving media campaigns.</P>
      <P>My re-establishment of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board is aimed at providing us with information and advice on trends in motor insurance costs and with policy recommendations for addressing these costs.</P>
      <P>Further measures can be expected as a result of the work of the special working group set up to consider the establishment of a personal injuries tribunal. On the basis of that group's second report, it is hoped to bring proposals to Government before Christmas with the objective of putting arrangements in place to reduce the costs of delivering personal injury compensation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>We are satisfied that the necessary information needed by businesses to prepare themselves for the changeover to the euro has been, and continues to be, made available through the extensive work undertaken by the Forfás EMU business awareness campaign. Since it was established in December 1996, at the request of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Forfás campaign has continued with its primary objective, namely the production and dissemination of information to Irish business on issues relating to EMU and the changeover to the euro.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The campaign has produced a comprehensive range of publications that have been widely dis<Col N="954" /> seminated to the business community. To date, over one million Forfás publications, covering a range of changeover issues, have been issued to Irish businesses.</P>
    <P>The campaign has been supported by a full programme of activities each year, designed to bring the issue of the euro to the attention of the business community, including activities such as major press and radio advertising campaigns; special supplements on EMU with national publications and articles supplied on the topic for inclusion in EMU features of other publications; stands at exhibitions and conferences; and direct mail exercises, most notably with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The primary concern for the awareness campaign is to ensure that each business is made sufficiently aware of the need to have made the changeover by 31 December 2001. Each company is encouraged to determine the likely scale of the changeover operation for their particular business and prepare its plan accordingly.</P>
    <P>In relation to the SME sector, the issue of preparedness among small firms has remained a particular focus of attention for the EMU Business Awareness Campaign since its inception. The campaign continues to focus much of its efforts in identifying appropriate mechanisms that will directly target SME companies efficiently and effectively. The small firm organisations themselves, including SFA, ISME and the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, are fully involved in the campaign through representation on our consultative committee as well as through the various working groups established by the campaign.</P>
    <P>There is some evidence from the campaign's latest survey that progress is being made by firms in determining their plans for the changeover and that there is a decreasing tendency to long finger decisions until 2002.</P>
    <P>The campaign will continue on-going monitoring of business preparations until the end of 2001. The campaign has been re-examining the key indicators used to date to benchmark the progress of firms in relation to the changeover and a revised questionnaire is currently being pilot-tested in advance of the main fieldwork for the next dedicated survey, which will take place before the end of this year. This will be followed by a further two dedicated surveys in 2001, most likely in January and June. These main surveys will also be supplemented by shorter questionnaires conducted at bi-monthly intervals throughout 2001, which will allow for a more detailed examination of specific issues raised in the main surveys or provide an indication of progress on a particular indicator. It is also intended that the bi-monthly surveys will serve to monitor, in particular, the progress of retail sector preparations. The findings from all of these research studies will continue to assist in providing direction to the work of the campaign.</P>
    <P>A significant development in the EMU Business Awareness Campaign, and one that is particularly important in connection with SME firms, <Col N="955" /> was the launch of the Loughrea Euro Town Project in March of 1999. The project is intended as a demonstration exercise whereby the business community throughout Ireland will learn from the experiences of businesses in Loughrea as the latter change over to euro-based trading on an accelerated basis. Thirty firms are participating in the project and all are now at various stages in implementing their changeover plans. A number of firms have already switched to euro-based trading. Information on the progress of the project participants, their experiences in drawing up and implementing their changeover plans, and in identifying and dealing with the difficulties that they encountered, is posted on the project web-site, which has recently been re-designed, to take full account of the evolution of this project.</P>
    <P>As the awareness campaign enters its final and most critical phase of operation and the countdown begins to the full changeover with the introduction of euro notes and coins on 1 January 2002, its activities will intensify. In addition, a special emphasis is currently being placed on key business sectors, particularly the retail sector which will be significantly involved in the changeover to euro cash. However, as I have said before, ultimately it is the responsibility of each firm to ensure that they are able to conduct their business in euro from 1 January 2002 and the campaign can only assist in providing the necessary information that will assist them to be ready for the changeover on time.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92, 109 and 117  together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The alleged abuse of the rights of foreign workers reported recently in the media is not as <Col N="956" /> a result of any inherent flaws in the Employment Agency Act, 1971. In this connection, I am satisfied that the current procedures governing the granting of employment agency licences are adequate. I am satisfied that the vetting procedures prior to issue of licences are adequate. The labour inspectorate of my Department also enforces this legislation with its other duties.</P>
    <P>The employment market in Ireland has been transformed in recent years, driven by increased employment opportunities. Employment agencies have responded by developing their services to meet the needs of employers and potential employees. Such services are increasingly provided over the Internet and indeed across borders by the same means. The Employment Agency Act, 1971, is based on the notion of services being provided from an establishment whereas increasingly these services are delivered by means of e-business. It is against these changing circumstances that I have asked my officials to review this legislation. As part of that review the social partners and other interested parties will be consulted over the coming months. Best practice in other EU countries will also be examined with a view to the possibility, where appropriate, of introducing improvements to our current legislation.</P>
    <P>As regards the rights of foreign workers the position is that they enjoy exactly the same rights as Irish workers under this country's employee protection legislation. However, in order to confirm this situation I am arranging for the inclusion of a provision in the draft Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Bill, 2000, whereby for the avoidance of doubt a range of employee protection legislation shall be deemed to apply to all foreign workers posted to this country in the same way as it applies to Irish workers covered by the legislation.</P>
    <P>The labour inspectorate of my Department is responsible for the enforcement of workers' rights set down in a variety of labour legislation and of statutory minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment of workers employed in sectors covered by employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements.</P>
    <P>Generally, enforcement is pursued through the inspections of employers' records. These inspections are carried out based on complaints received about specific breaches of the Acts and also as a matter of routine. Breaches of the Acts can be detected by close examination of the records mentioned above. Inspections take place during normal office hours as the majority of employers carry on business during these hours. However, inspectors also engage in night work in order to enforce certain legislation which gives rise to that requirement.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the methodology adopted in relation to inspection work is reasonable and that inspections are organised and targeted in a way that makes the most efficient use of the enforcement resources available.</P>

      <P>The Office of Director of Consumer Affairs in co-operation with the Consumers Association of Ireland recently carried out the second in a series of four shopping basket price surveys of some 30 of the most popular grocery and related items.</P>
      <P>The survey, which was conducted at supermarkets and large and medium sized retail outlets in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Dundalk, Galway, Athlone, Sligo and Carlow-Kilkenny revealed very little price differential between Tesco, Dunnes Stores and Superquinn countrywide. In the case of the other stores surveyed, the price variation was not significant.</P>
      <P>In light of the general level of price similarity across the range of shopping basket items surveyed and her concern at the apparent lack of competition, I understand the Director of Consumer Affairs has referred the survey results to the Competition Authority. The authority operates independently of me and, therefore, will decide whether any action by the authority is necessary under the Competition Acts.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94 and 144 together.</P>
      <P>Regional development is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>My Department, however, is the designated managing authority for two of the operational programmes under the national development plan. These are the productive sector operational programme and the employment and human resources development operational programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key national objectives in the National <Col N="958" /> Development Plan 2000-2006 are continuing sustainable national economic and employment growth; consolidating and improving Ireland's international competitiveness; fostering balanced regional development; and promoting social inclusion.</P>
    <P>The productive sector operational programme and the employment and human resources development operational programme will contribute to these national objectives.</P>
    <P>The impact of the human resources development operational programme is not expressed in employment terms.</P>
    <P>In the case of the productive sector operational programme, the targets for the indigenous sector include such things as achieving higher sales volume, investment in R&amp;D and productivity improvement so as to create and sustain high quality employment.</P>
    <P>In the case of foreign direct investment, the focus has also shifted away from the simple objective of job creation numbers and now includes job quality, embeddedness in the economy and a more even geographic distribution of projects and jobs created. In the case of the BMW region an ambitious target has been set to deliver 50% of new greenfield jobs to that area over the plan period.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the slower than anticipated spend this year, under the productive sector operational programme, I am satisfied that over the full plan period its aims and objectives will be achieved. The activity and spend under the employment and human resources operational programme are on target.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>In October 2000 I brought a memorandum to Government seeking Government approval for the drafting of a general scheme of a Competition and Mergers Bill. This arose out of the recommendations of the Competition and Mergers Review Group. The Government authorised the drafting of a consolidated Competition and Mergers Bill at its meeting on 24 October 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had asked the Competition and Mergers Review Group to advise me on how best to implement certain recommendations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry. The recommendations referred to the review group's concern, the factors to be considered in regulating changes of ownership of newspapers, an amendment to merger law to enable consideration to be <Col N="959" /> given to the acquisition of control over newspapers by means other than the acquisition of shares, and the consideration of the issue of concentration of ownership on a media-wide as well as on a single media basis.</P>
    <P>I published the report of the Competition and Mergers Review Group on 4 May 2000. The group, which was chaired by Mr. Michael Collins, SC, made some 40 recommendations on a variety of aspects of competition and mergers legislation, the enforcement of competition law and the administration of mergers law.</P>
    <P>Two of the 40 recommendations relate to newspapers and media and arise from the recommendations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry, which reported in June 1996. The review group has recommended legislative changes so as to require the Minister, when considering a merger in the media sector, to consider certain criteria identified by the Commission on the Newspaper Industry.</P>
    <P>The other recommendation relates to the issue of the acquisition of undertakings by means other than the acquisition of shares. The Competition and Mergers Review Group has recommended that the control test in the EU Merger Regulation be incorporated into Irish merger law.</P>
    <P>I have accepted the recommendations of the Competition and Mergers Review Group on the newspaper issue and work on the drafting of a consolidated Competition and Mergers Bill, including these and other legislative changes, has begun in my Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 and 118 together.</P>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy's question relates to encouraging women who are working in the home to take up employment outside the home. In operational terms FÁS recognises, in the light of the current labour market situation, the need to encourage women, who wish to do so, to enter or return to the workforce.</P>
      <P>In 1999 women comprised 47% of all those completing FÁS programmes. Many of these women are women who are planning to return to the workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Specifically, FÁS has been running a pro<Col N="960" /> gramme to encourage and assist women to return to the workforce for many years. More than 1,000 women avail of this programme annually. This programme is provided on a part-time and full-time basis. In addition, many women who wish to return to the workforce go directly into skills training programmes within FÁS and into enterprise training programmes. Many women who wish to move back into work also take up training locally within their own communities. Such training is provided by FÁS on a part time flexible basis.</P>
    <P>FÁS is reviewing its return to work initiative with a view to adapting it to meet the needs of clients from early 2001. Currently FÁS is consulting with representative bodies of women and with locally based womens' groups to ensure that this new programme will best meet the needs of women in the home who wish to return to work.</P>
    <P>This review is in line with the recommendations of the Partnership 2000 Report on Women's Access to the Labour Market Opportunities and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98 and 186 together.</P>
      <P>I have not had any substantive communication with the cement industry in relation to environmental matters. However, the Government's national climate change strategy, which was launched earlier this month, recommends, among other things, that negotiated agreements should be put in place with certain sectors, including the cement industry. My Department will be having detailed discussions with the cement industry on implementation of the climate change strategy.</P>
      <P>It is essential that all sectors, including the cement industry, play their part in ensuring that Ireland reduces its greenhouse gas emissions in line with the strategy. I have been in correspondence with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, to ensure that any legislative changes, which may be required in relation to greenhouse gas emissions, are put in place.</P>
      <P>In relation to the potential environmental impact of cement production in this country, while this is not my direct responsibility, I am satisfied that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is addressing the issue. All cement production activities are licensable under the integrated pollution control licensing regime, which is provided for in Part IV of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 (No. 7 of 1992) and is administered by the Environmental Protection Agency. IPC licensing is a modern and comprehensive system for controlling emissions from certain industrial and intensive agriculture activities, which have the potential to cause significant environmental pollution, and is in line with best international practice for environmental protection.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, has indicated that he will bring forward a Bill to amend the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992. One of the primary purposes of this Bill will be to bring the current integrated pollution control licensing provisions fully into line with EU Directive 96/61/EC on integrated pollution prevention and control. The Bill will also contain appropriate proposals for the Environmental Protection Agency to address greenhouse gas emissions in the course of determining individual licence applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has also provided for improved <Col N="962" /> planning control over the operation of quarries in the Planning and Development Act, 2000. Quarries over five years old will have to register with planning authorities who will be entitled to impose environmental conditions on their operation. Local authorities will also be entitled to require certain quarries, in operation from before the 1963 Planning Act came into force, to get planning permission and submit an environmental impact statement if the authority believes that the operation of the quarry would be likely to have significant effects on the environment. That provision of the Planning Act will be brought into force early in 2001.</P>
    <P>In relation to the activities of the Health and Safety Authority, the position is that from 1 January to 17 November 2000 there have been a total of 295 inspections of mines and quarry locations and five inspections have been carried out at cement producing locations. Six complaints have been received and investigated. There have been three prosecutions of quarrying companies heard at District Court level. These related to falls from height and machine guarding. Sixty improvement notices, 20 prohibition notices and two improvement directions have been issued by inspectors of the authority. These related mainly to the risk of falls from heights, machinery guarding and hazards from mobile site machinery. The authority will continue to accord a high priority to the mines and quarry sector.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101, 127, 130 and 163 together.</P>
      <P>Since 12 October 2000 last I have had an appeal lodged with the Supreme Court in relation to a High Court decision of Mr. Justice Butler on 28 July last concerning my appointment of an authorised officer under section 19 of the 1990 Act to Dunnes Stores Ireland Company and Dunnes Stores (ILAC Centre) Limited. Until the outcome of that appeal is known, it is not possible to estimate when these investigations will be concluded.</P>
      <P>The five examinations of company books and documents under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990, are ongoing. The companies involved are Celtic Helicopters Limited, College Trustees Limited, Guinness &amp; Mahon (Ireland) Limited, Hamilton Ross Company Limited and Kentford Securities Limited. I expect to receive final reports on a number of these companies in the coming months.</P>
      <P>As regards the section 8 High Court inquiry into Ansbacher Cayman Limited, I expect that it will be at least six months before this inquiry can be completed.</P>
      <P>The section 8 inquiry into National Irish Bank Limited and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited is also ongoing and I hope that the inspectors' inquiry can be concluded early in 2001.</P>
      <P>The reports on Bula Resources (Holdings) plc., Garuda Limited and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited are with the Director of Public Prosecutions. I have no information on his intentions with respect to any of these reports. Consultations with my legal advisers are ongoing regarding the initiation of summary prosecutions for breaches of the Companies Acts identified in the Bula report.  </P>

      <P>The report of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry, which was published in June 1996, made a number of recommendations which concerned the functional responsibilities of a number of Government Departments. In November 1996 the then Minister presented an <i>aide memoire</i> to Government on the recommendations contained in the report. The Government decided that each Minister upon whose area of responsibility the recommendations impacted should revert to Government in relation to any necessary action. One of the recommendations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry was that an independent ombudsman to investigate complaints of breaches of press standards be established. The commission was clear that this ombudsman should be appointed and funded by the newspaper industry.</P>
      <P>I support the recommendation regarding the establishment of an ombudsman and I also agree that it is for the newspaper industry to regulate itself in this regard.</P>
      <P>The newspaper industry has always linked its acceptance of the ombudsman proposal to changes in the law on defamation and in that respect I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that proposals for legislation on defamation are being prepared in his Department.</P>

    <P>Last month, October, a total of over 2500 applications were dealt with by my Department; this approximates to over 600 per week. We currently have over 2000 applications on hand. The time taken to deal with applications will always depend on the individual circumstances of the case but, at present, the average time taken is about four weeks.</P>
    <P>Because of the unprecedented increase in the volume of applications, sanction has now been received from the Department of Finance for ten additional staff for the work permit section of my Department in order to eliminate the need for overtime and Saturday working, as at present, and to reduce the waiting period for applicants.</P>

      <P>I published the report of the competition and mergers review group on 4 May 2000. The report dealt with a wide range of competition and mergers issues, including enforcement of competition policy, <Col N="968" /> administration of mergers law and the Restrictive (Practices) Groceries Order, 1987.</P>
      <P>The report was considered by Government on 24 October 2000 and I announced that the existing law in relation to competition and mergers is to be replaced by new consolidated competition and mergers legislation. The new legislation will contain a number of significant reforms to competition and merger law including the law in relation to newspaper-media mergers, competition enforcement and the role of the Competition Authority. I also announced my decision to retain the groceries order which includes the ban on below cost selling.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 and 139 together.</P>
      <P>Given forecast trends in the population with numbers in the older age groups forecast to rise, I believe we have to provide employment opportunities to older persons over 55 who may wish to avail of them.</P>
      <P>Initiatives here embrace both encouraging retired persons who may wish to do so to return to the labour market and removing barriers to women in the home from their participation in the workforce. Measures to assist older unemployed and males outside the labour force in their transition to or return to the labour market are also a feature of the overall strategic approach.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy of reducing the overall tax burden on labour, the reform of the tax system with the implementation of a tax credit system of standard rating the basic single and married persons allowances and the PAYE allowance and the individualisation of the standard rate tax band, all serve to increase the incentive for persons to return to work. This approach is being supplemented with measures to assist older unemployed persons in their transition to the open labour market.</P>
      <P>Other aspects of this area relate to pension and retirement provision, flexibility in employment opportunities and matching skills to the jobs available.</P>
      <P>I am considering these issues at present and I intend to meet with employer representatives to consider the practical steps that can be taken to encourage the return of retired persons or persons over 55 to the workplace.</P>

A total of 611 working visas and 221 work authorisations issued for this period up until the end of October 2000.</P>
      <P>I noted with interest comments made recently by IBEC in relation to the new fast-track scheme. I would like to take this opportunity to point out that the State has been advertising the existence of the scheme through the FÁS jobs fairs and that it was given very considerable publicity at its inception. It is my Department's experience that employment agencies are well aware of the existence of the new arrangements and details are available on my Department's website and the website of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>I trust that, as a representative organisation, IBEC has informed its own members of the details of the scheme.</P>
      <P>IBEC is a member of the immigration policy advisory committee established by the Government to provide an input into evolving immigration policy from a labour market perspective. I am confident that IBEC will use that forum to make a very constructive input in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, signed and ratified the revised European social charter of 1996 and signed without reservation as to ratification, acceptance or approval, the additional protocol providing for a system of collective complaints, 1995, on behalf of Ireland, on Saturday, 4 November 2000 at the Council of Europe's Ministerial Conference held in Rome to mark the 50th anniversary of the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
      <P>Ireland is a party to the European social charter, which was adopted by the Council of Europe in Turin in 1961 and which entered into force in 1965. Ireland was one of the original signatories of the charter, which is the counterpart of the European Convention on Human Rights in the field of social and economic rights. The charter sets out general principles to guide states' policies in the area of social legislation and, more specifically, it guarantees the enjoyment without discrimination of a wide range of fundamental social rights.</P>
      <P>These rights include the right to work in just conditions; the right to fair remuneration; the right to organise; to bargain and strike; the right to equal pay for men and women workers; the right to social security and medical aid; the right to vocational training and the right to the protection of the family. These rights can be accepted selectively by the contracting parties, the member states of the Council of Europe which have signed and ratified the charter, subject to a minimum number of acceptances.</P>
      <P>In order to adapt the charter to developments in the field of social rights since 1961, a revised European social charter was adopted and opened for signature at Strasbourg on 3 May 1996 and came into force on 1 July 1999. The main innovations in the revised charter include: &ndash; strengthening equality between men and women; the right of disabled persons to individual social integration, personal independence and participation in the life of the community; strengthening the right of children and young persons to social, legal and economic protection; the right to protection in cases of dismissal; the right to dignity at work; the right of workers with family responsibilities to equal opportunities and equal treatment; the right to protection against poverty and social exclusion; the right to adequate housing and a widening of the ban on discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have indicated, these rights can be <Col N="971" /> accepted selectively subject to a minimum number of acceptances. While Ireland is in a position to implement almost all of the provisions of the revised social charter, acceptance of the following provisions is deferred until such time as our national legislation is in conformity with these provisions. This will require amending existing legislation in the following areas:&ndash;</P>
    <P>Article 8, paragraph 3 &ndash; regarding certain rights of employed women to protection of maternity &ndash; specifically, where such mothers are nursing their infants;</P>
    <P>Article 21, paragraphs (a) and (b) &ndash; regarding the right of workers to information and consultation;</P>
    <P>Article 27, paragraph 1 (c) &ndash; regarding the right of workers with family responsibilities to equal opportunities and equal treatment &ndash; specifically, in regard to daycare services and other child care arrangements.</P>
    <P>The above provisions will be kept under review.</P>
    <P>In relation to Article 31 &ndash; regarding the right to housing, the position is that Ireland cannot accept the provisions of Article 31 at this time. However, I understand that the Department of the Environment and Local Government intends to follow future interpretations to be given to the provisions of Article 31 by the Council of Europe itself with a view to their possible acceptance by Ireland at a later date. A statement to that effect was made by Ireland to the Council of Europe upon signature and ratification of the revised charter earlier this month.</P>
    <P>The signature of the revised European social charter and of the collective complaints protocol by Ireland is further evidence of this country's on-going commitment to achieving the highest standards in relation to social and economic rights.</P>

      <P>The enterprise development agencies established under the aegis of my Department have a statutory function to assist enterprises in Ireland that are involved in manufacturing and internationally traded services. Consequently, these agencies are precluded from providing direct capital support for joint ventures or other investments outside Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, Enterprise Ireland maintains a net<Col N="972" /> work of overseas offices that help to advise their clients not only on exports but also on investments, joint ventures and other trading relationships and opportunities that might be attractive to Irish business. These offices are located in regions that are strategically important for the long-term development of Irish business and include offices in China and Malaysia.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Tánaiste and I have led a number of trade missions that have helped to cement business relationships between Ireland and important developing markets for Irish entrepreneurs. While recent trade missions to India and China have helped raise the direct profile of Ireland in terms of international trade and investment, the overseas offices of Enterprise Ireland will continue to provide essential market intelligence to Irish firms wishing to trade, invest or provide risk capital for business projects.</P>
    <P>Strengthening trade and business links with key regional economies across the world is vital to the development of Irish business and the Asia-Pacific region has long-term strategic significance for Irish exporters and investors. The Asia strategy group that operates from my Department has set out the future direction of policy to develop earning from Asia, raise awareness of Ireland with key decision makers and to deepen political and business relationships in the region.</P>

      <P>My Department and its agencies are acutely aware that the continued development of the enterprise sector will require adequate provision of appropriate infrastructure. Proper and planned investment can help to minimise regional imbalances and create opportunities for all regions to share in our continuing economic growth.</P>
      <P>The common infrastructure priorities of the regions have been identified by the agencies as roads, air services, telecommunications and the electricity network. Assessments of regional investment needs have been incorporated into the national development plan, and specifically address the access needs of the Border, midlands and west region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to roads, the national development plan includes proposals for major improvements in the north west, including the N2 &ndash; Dublin-Monaghan-Omagh-Derry; the N4 &ndash; Kinnegad-Sligo; N13-N15 &ndash; Sligo-Donegal-Lifford-Letterkenny-Derry; N16 &ndash; Sligo-Blacklion-Enniskillen-Dungannon-Larne, and the N3 &ndash; Dublin-Belturbet-Enniskillen-Derry. The need for other <Col N="973" /> new routes will also be evaluated over the period of the plan and where a need is established funding will be provided for the advance planning and design of the route in the plan period, with a view to bringing the project to construction within an appropriate time frame.</P>
    <P>Regarding regional air services, my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise is currently engaged in renewing the four existing public service obligation air services for a further three-year period. These include air services from Donegal and Sligo to Dublin. Furthermore, I understand that the Minister has secured EU Commission approval to introduce two new PSO routes servicing Derry-Dublin and Knock-Dublin. It is planned to have these new services operational early in 2001 and an EU public tender process is under way to secure carriers for each of these routes. This expansion should boost tourism and business in the north west.</P>
    <P>A world-class electricity network is also critical to facilitate continued inward investment and to underpin delivery of the targets set out in the national development plan. The ESB is upgrading the low voltage network and a series of major additions to the high voltage network are planned. These include a 110 kilometre line from Letterkenny to Binbane which is currently under appeal to An Bord Pleanála, and 63 kilometres of line from Flagford to east Sligo for which a planning application is expected to be lodged shortly.</P>
    <P>The ongoing provision of a state-of-the-art telecommunications network will support Ireland's growth as a knowledge-based economy, and ensure the attraction of high quality jobs. Ireland's connectivity with the US and Europe has been enhanced and our national backbone network is now over 98% optic fibre. Links are increasingly being made to cities and towns throughout the country, the recent completion of the north west digital corridor enabling a Dublin-Sligo fibre network to be built being a case in point. The national plan includes a £150 million provision to support investment in advanced telecommunications in areas around the country.</P>
    <P>I have asked Forfás to develop a database of physical and social infrastructure facilities at regional level for enterprise promotion purposes. This database will assist in determining the investment priorities of the regions and will feed into the national spatial strategy currently being formulated by the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>

      <P>The report of the Donegal employment initiative envisaged that the setting of realistic job creation targets for foreign <Col N="974" /> direct investment and the growth of the indigenous sector would be addressed by the development agencies in the light of the strategies outlined in the report. It also envisaged that the implementation of these strategies would be kept under review by the new Donegal County Development Board.</P>
      <P>The county development board was established in March of this year as a partnership comprising the local authority, State agencies, local development interests and the social partners. It is engaged in drawing up an integrated economic, social and cultural development strategy for the county in line with Government policy. The report of the Donegal employment initiative has already supplied the essential foundations for this new strategy. The county development board has agreed to progress the recommendations of the task force report through the various sectoral working groups it has established on inward investment, indigenous enterprise, infrastructure, lifelong learning and tourism.</P>

      <P>I have, however, been informed by the authority that there have been 22 construction related fatalities up to 17 November. So far this year, 798 accidents resulting in more than three days absence from work have been reported to the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
      <P>The management of health and safety in all sectors of employment is based on the principles of legislation, enforcement and a strong partnership approach. There is a strong legislative base by which safety standards in the construction sector can be managed and this legislation is enforced in a pro-active manner by the Health and Safety Authority. The additional resources, both financial and staffing, which I secured earlier this year for the authority, are being put to good effect in the construction sector through targeted inspection, enforcement and awareness-raising activities.</P>
      <P>However, both I and the authority are of the firm belief that for greater health and safety improvements to be brought about in the construction sector, a strong partnership approach &ndash; by all the parties at all levels in the sector &ndash; to the issue of safety must be adopted. This partnership approach has continued to be developed in 2000 within the context of the construction safety partnership, CSP.</P>
      <P>The report of the CSP, which was launched earlier this year, sets out the conclusions and recommendations of the partnership plan. The partnership plan is a three year plan to improve occupational safety, health and welfare standards in the construction industry and all parties to the plan have made a number of wide-ranging commitments which they have undertaken to implement over that period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recommendations of the partnership plan cover measures to improve safety consultation and safety representation, safety training, introduction of safety management systems and increased inspection activity by the Health and Safety Authority. Work has continued throughout the year on implementing the recommendations of the plan and the parties to the partner<Col N="977" /> ship are meeting again on 4 December to review progress.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 126 and 142 together.</P>
      <P>Statistics are not currently available on the number of people with disabilities in employment. I understand that the 2001 census will attempt to capture this type of information for the first time.</P>
      <P>As regards the integration of people with disabilities into the workforce, the position is as follows. In June 2000, responsibility for the employment and vocational training of people with disabilities transferred from the Department of Health and Children to my Department as part of the Government's policy of mainstreaming services to people with disabilities. In July, I launched a new supported employment programme for people with disabilities, with a budget of £4 million per annum from my Department. Following an assessment of 48 proposals which were received by FÁS, a total of 20 supported employment projects have been approved for funding to the end of 2001. These projects have the potential to place up to 800 people with disabilities in open employment.</P>
      <P>In July, I also announced the introduction of grants to companies for disability awareness training and for the re-training of workers who acquire a disability.</P>
      <P>Disability awareness training will help to integrate people with disabilities into the workplace by providing co-workers with a better understanding of the needs and capabilities of people with disabilities. Employee re-training grants will enable employers to re-train workers who acquire a disability to retain employment in the same company and in the same job, if appropriate. The operational details of these schemes are being finalised by FÁS and will be available shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to these measures, the Government has made a number of further commitments in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness which fall within the ambit of my Department, aimed at the integration of people with disabilities into the labour force. These include: an increased emphasis on progression from vocational training programmes to employment opportunities in the open labour market; increased funding and promotion of the employment support scheme, which provides a wage subsidy to employers who recruit people with disabilities; increased funding <Col N="979" /> for the workplace/equipment adaptation grant scheme which provides grants to employers for adaptations to the workplace to accommodate people with disabilities; strengthening the profile of the positive to disability scheme, which recognises companies which take a positive approach to the employment of people with disabilities; and funding social partners initiatives which promote the employment of people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 128, 160 and 173 together.</P>
      <P>The social economy programme was formally launched on 18 September 2000.</P>
      <P>The key aims of the social economy programme are to support the regeneration and quality of life of local disadvantaged areas and to maximise employment opportunities for long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged persons.</P>
      <P>The programme will support the development and operation of social economy enterprises that provide social services and employment opportunities in and for disadvantaged communities. Financial grants and technical supports are provided for the development of social economy businesses for up to three years. This includes grant support for the development of a business plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local working groups have been established by FÁS in consultation with area partnership companies, in the 38 designated disadvantaged areas to draw up an agreed local strategy for the development of the programme. This includes the identification and prioritisation of new and innovative sectors of work activity where social economy enterprises will support the economic and social regeneration of the locality. The main partners represented on the local working groups include the trade union and employer organisations, area partnership companies, community <Col N="980" /> and voluntary groups, local authorities, health boards, county enterprise boards and farmers' interests.</P>
    <P>A national advertisement campaign in regional and local newspapers has been run to promote the programme to community and voluntary groups. A social economy framework document and brochure has been distributed to local FÁS offices. Applications for social economy programme supports are being encouraged at a local level.</P>
    <P>The national development plan provides for expenditure of £213 million on the social economy programme over the period 2000-06. It is expected that expenditure in 2001 will be £17 million and it is forecast to rise to £41 million per annum as the demand for the programme increases.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 131, 155 and 165 together.</P>
      <P>Drug testing of employees and potential candidates seeking employment is not a feature of the Irish labour market. It is, I understand, a more common practice in the US.</P>
      <P>I am advised that drug screening has no legal basis and cannot be carried out without a person's consent as under the Constitution, it may be an infringement of human rights in relation to privacy and bodily integrity to do so. Even if it were a condition of a contract of employment that employees or potential employees were required to undergo drug screening, the prior consent of the employee would be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, the retention of records by employers or disclosure of information to other potential employers could be in contravention of the Data Protection Act, 1988, which requires that all information held by employers should be <Col N="981" /> relevant to the position held by the employee. In addition, there would also be breaches of the Freedom of Information Act, 1998, in relation to public servants if records relating to them were transferred to another employer.</P>
    <P>Requiring some employees and not others to undergo drug screening would also be discriminatory under the Equality Act, 1998.</P>
    <P>Finally, because of the complexity of the issue, I have no proposals to introduce legislation to regulate drug testing of employees. I should say that any employee, whose employer is attempting to implement drug screening procedures, should refer the matter to the employment rights section of my Department. I would ask Members of this House to provide me with any information they may have of any such cases, so that my labour inspectorate can check out the situation on the ground.</P>

      <P>The Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987, was the subject of one of 40 recommendations contained in the final report of the Competition and Mergers Review Group which I published in May last.</P>
      <P>On the matter of the Groceries Order, the majority of the review group recommended that the Groceries Order be repealed; any legislation or regulation introduced in relation to the grocery trade should not include a ban on below cost selling; and some form of regulation be introduced in relation to the grocery trade which would in particular require suppliers to publish the terms on which they are prepared to trade with retailers, would require retailers to honour the credit terms on which suppliers are prepared to trade with them, would ban &ldquo;hello money&rdquo;, and would require retailers not to discriminate between classes of customers in respect of the products which they sell.</P>
      <P>The recommendation gave rise to a lot of debate and having carefully considered all the arguments and having consulted widely with interested parties on both sides of the debate, I came to the view that it was not in the consumer's interest to remove the ban on below cost selling at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument as to where the consumer's interest lay was finely balanced and there was influential opinion on each side of the debate. I concluded that the evidence did not suggest that any significant benefit, or perhaps any benefit at all, would accrue to consumers if the order were to be repealed now. There was also the argument that below cost selling could be used to eliminate <Col N="982" /> competition and restrict consumer choice in local markets.</P>
    <P>As the grocery sector is changing rapidly, I intend to keep the position under review.</P>

      <P>Long-term unemployed persons have access to the community employment programme which has an average of 35,500 places available in 2000, and to the job initiative programme which has 2,875 places available. The primary purpose of these programmes is to re-integrate long-term unemployed persons into jobs in the open labour market.</P>
      <P>In addition the new social economy programme will provide urgently needed local services, and employment opportunities and experience for people who have been distanced from the labour market. This new programme is aimed at providing up to 2,500 jobs for the long-term unemployed particularly in disadvantaged communities. This programme is being funded through a reallocation of CE funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As identified in the PPF and during the review of the job initiative programme, some people, including those currently on JI, will have difficult<Col N="983" /> ies in getting and keeping a job in the open labour market due to personal barriers such as age, health, literacy and numeracy factors. Additional long-term supports are needed. My Department is currently developing proposals for appropriate supports for such persons taking into consideration discussions already held with the social partners and a number of submissions received from the statutory and voluntary sectors. Final proposals are expected to be ready for further discussions with the social partners in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 and 170 together.</P>
      <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche Report on the Economic Evaluation of Insurance Costs in Ireland, published in 1996, made a number of key recommendations. The report indicated that high insurance costs in Ireland were directly related to high claims costs. In particular, the report found that the average cost of an insurance claim for 17 to 24 year old drivers, was twice that for the 36 to 40 age group. The report also noted that motorists in the 17 to 24 age group were responsible for over three and a half times the total average claims costs incurred for motorists in the 36 to 40 age group.</P>
      <P>The report clearly indicated that the primary focus of initiatives aimed at reducing the cost of motor insurance for young drivers, must be on reducing the frequency of accidents and the associated cost of claims. The key to this is to create appropriate conditions for improving their standards of driving and their appreciation of road safety.</P>
      <P>The Irish Insurance Federation, in conjunction with the Driving Instructors Register, has introduced a scheme of insurance premium discounts for the young driver, on completion of a required number of driving lessons. The National Safety Council, in co-operation with the gardaí, continue to promote anti-speeding and anti-drink driving media campaigns, including road safety educational programmes, for second level school students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="984" /> The report also found that the main contributory factors to rising premium costs, were the high legal costs component of small claim settlements; the faster rate of medical cost inflation, and the high level of general damages awards, relative to special damages in smaller claims. A special working group was established to advise on the establishment of a personal injuries tribunal and to examine issues surrounding alternative systems of personal injury compensation, in operation in other jurisdictions. The group's final report was recently circulated, along with a draft memorandum for Government. It is intended to bring the matter before Government as soon as possible and to publish the group's report at that stage.</P>
    <P>Improved health and safety measures in the workplace, were also identified by the report as a way of reducing insurance costs. As part of the commitment to improving standards of safety on the workplace, the workplace safety group is promoting a workplace safety code on safe working and accident prevention.</P>

      <P>I am happy to have this opportunity to confirm that all ex-offenders are currently eligible for FÁS training and employment programmes. In the case of community employment, jobstart and the workplace programmes, FÁS has waived the normal live register duration requirement regarding eligibility in the interest of assisting ex-offenders to integrate quickly into the labour market. The Deputy may also wish to note that FÁS operates a small number of training workshops in conjunction with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, especially for ex-offenders and people on probation.</P>

      <P>The Office of Director of Consumer Affairs in co-operation with the Consumer's Association of Ireland recently carried out the second in a series of four shopping basket price surveys of some 30 of the most popular grocery and related items.</P>
      <P>The survey, which was conducted at supermarkets and large and medium sized retail outlets in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Dundalk, Galway, Athlone Sligo, and Carlow-Kilkenny, revealed very little price differential between Tesco, Dunnes Stores and Superquinn countrywide. Of the other stores surveyed, the price variation was not significant.</P>
      <P>In light of the general level of price similarity across the shopping basket items surveyed and her concern at the apparent lack of competition, I understand the Director of Consumer Affairs has referred the survey results to the Competition Authority, and that the complaint is now being considered by it. The authority operates independently of me and therefore will itself decide whether any action is necessary under the Competition Acts.</P>

      <P>The National Minimum Wage Act, 2000, came into force from 1 April 2000 and delivered on the Government's commitment in the programme for Government to introduce a national minimum hourly wage. During the passage of the National Minimum Wage Bill 2000, through this House, the Tánaiste gave a commitment to establish a tripartite monitoring group. The group was established in June and comprises representatives of ICTU, IBEC and my Department. The remit of the group is to monitor and assess the implementation of the Act and report its findings and any recommendations to the Tánaiste. The group has met twice since June, 2000.</P>
      <P>The group will be assisted in its work by the results of a follow-up survey, to be undertaken in the coming weeks, of the firm survey carried out by the ESRI in late 1998 and early 1999. The results of the initial firm survey formed part of the ESRI study of the likely impact of the introduction of the national minimum wage.</P>
      <P>The legislation is enforced in the workplace by the labour inspectorate of my Department. There are 17 inspectors in the inspectorate, seven of whom were appointed last April by way of additional resources &ndash; authorised by Government decision of December 1999 &ndash; to assist in national minimum wage enforcement work. All 17 inspectors, as part of their general employment rights legislation enforcement work, check on the compliance of employers with their responsibilities under the National Minimum Wage Act.</P>
      <P>From the commencement date of the Act to 17 November 2000 a total of 3,097 compliance inspections have been carried out by the inspectorate. Any infringements found arising from the inspections have been rectified through the intervention of the visiting inspectors and, to date, the need for legal prosecution has not arisen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 150 and 179 together.</P>
      <P>In general my Department is prepared to issue work permits for the employment of non-European economic area nationals in the State where an employer can demonstrate that, despite prior attempts, they have been unable to recruit a suitable Irish or other EEA national for the jobs concerned. It is also, obviously, necessary that the relevant labour law requirements are met in respect of the job concerned, for example compliance with minimum wage levels, maximum hours of work permitted, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the relevant immigration require<Col N="990" /> ments must be satisfied in relation to the non-national in respect of whom the permit is being sought. Permits cannot, for example, be issued in respect of an individual who is in the State illegally or no longer complies with the conditions under which he-she was admitted; has been asked by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to leave the State or is in the process of being deported or was in the State illegally and has been deported or has left the State having been asked to do so by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform; has entered the State specifically on the basis that he or she will not be taking up employment, for example, visitors, students or tourists; or is seeking employment with a non EEA employer who is operating in the State without business permission from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>I am well aware of the difficulties being experienced by employers in some sectors in filling vacancies and that is why the Government, on my initiative, earlier this year introduced a new simplified work visa-authorisation scheme in respect of information and computing technologies, construction professionals and registered nurses. This new scheme makes it possible for prospective employees with job offers from employers in Ireland to obtain immigration and employment clearance in advance from Irish embassies and consulates abroad and to come here to work for a period of up to two years.</P>
    <P>I have also set up an advisory group, representative of the social partners, Departments and the development agencies, to keep this scheme under review and to advise me in relation to the requirements of the labour market on an ongoing basis. I should add that, in so far as work permits are concerned, my Department has experienced a huge increase in the number of applications received this year. In the first ten months of this year over 15,000 permits have already issued compared with a total of 6,200 for all of last year.</P>
    <P>In order to deal with the increasing volume of applications, sanction has now been obtained from the Department of Finance for an additional ten staff for the work permit section of the Department. In the interim it would be prudent for employers to engage in an appropriate amount of forward planning when proposing to recruit from outside the European economic area.</P>

      <P>The Government, through its enterprise support agencies, is <Col N="991" /> committed to ensuring the most equitable distribution of job opportunities and to address the disparity in jobs between eastern and western regions. The development agencies are now strongly focused on achieving this aim and resources are being deployed to reflect this new focus. The agencies' focus on regionalisation ensures that an attractive financial package will be made available to any appropriate project which may choose to locate or expand in the Objective One &ndash; Border, midlands and the west &ndash; region.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland is working closely with the providers of infrastructure and the educational-training bodies etc., to deliver improved facilities for industry in the regions. The agency is seeking to deliver over 50% of all newly approved greenfield jobs to the Objective One region.</P>
      <P>To ensure that a more equitable distribution of jobs is achieved, IDA Ireland re-organised its internal structures. This restructuring included allocation of additional staff to its regional offices, opening new regional offices in Cavan and Limerick and the allocation of regional responsibilities to key executives in its project divisions. Other initiatives include putting a greater focus on marketing of the regions for specific sectors and improvement of marketing material for the regions.</P>
      <P>The new IDA Ireland strategy is not merely a question of jobs dispersal, it also aims to bring a better mix of industry sectors and higher value industries to locations around the country, in particular, to locations that have not seen the emergence of the more modern industries. The agency's new strategy also addresses the need to increase the value and sustainability of overseas companies already established or about to establish in Ireland. Also, in the Objective One regions, IDA Ireland has acquired additional land and has arranged, in partnership with private developers, to provide advance factories and advance offices in a number of key centres. The approach being pursued by IDA Ireland is having a positive impact on development in the western regions and industries locating in regional towns and cities will benefit the surrounding rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and the county enterprise boards are also committed to developing indigenous industry and to regional dispersal. Enterprise Ireland has deployed over 100 staff in its regional network. The agency works closely with all development organisations in the regions as well as the third level educational institutions, local development bodies and other industry to pro actively facilitate an integrated approach to development in the region. In addition, Údarás na Gaeltachta is actively involved in the development of job creating industries and services in the Gaeltacht regions. The agency operates under the aegis of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in promoting productive schemes of employment through the development of local <Col N="992" /> natural resources, skills and entrepreneurial abilities and the attraction of mobile investment to the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Complementary measures in the national development plan will also help to underpin the regional strategies of the development agencies. Improvement of transport links is essential to facilitate job creation in the regions. The same applies to other key items of physical infrastructure such as telecommunications, energy, water supplies and waste disposal. In this regard, the measures provided for in the plan will provide the infrastructure necessary for the attraction of overseas investment currently lacking outside the major urban areas. The plan envisages spending a higher amount per head of population in the largely rural Border, midland and west regions. The Government is confident that the co-ordinated efforts being made by the development agencies will further advance economic development and employment in western regions.</P>

      <P>The position under EU state aid law of schemes granting remission of rates has changed for the period 2000 to 2006 as compared to the situation which obtained in previous periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 4 and 5 of the Industrial Development Act, 1986 &ndash; and similar provisions in legislation applying to Údarás na Gaeltachta &ndash; contain pro<Col N="993" /> visions in relation to designated areas. The effect of designation on such areas, which were largely in the Border, midland and western regions, was twofold: industry in these areas could be grant aided at higher rates than industry in the rest of the country, and local authorities were allowed, if they thought fit, to remit two thirds of a rate leviable by them in respect of industrial premises in these areas which had been provided by, or by means of a grant made by IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development or Údáras na Gaeltachta. In the period up to the beginning of 2000, such remission of rates in Ireland was approved by the EU Commission as a regional aid.</P>
    <P>A new regional aid map for Ireland was approved by the EU Commission in October 1999 to apply in the period 2000 to 2006. Grant rates payable to industry in respect of the eight regions in Ireland are set out in the map. Higher rates are payable in the Border, midland and western regions, but there is no specific treatment for designated areas as opposed to non-designated areas. Also, remission of rates is no longer approved as one of the ways in which regional aid may be paid.</P>
    <P>The State aid rules now, as in the past, impose an overall limit on the amount of regional aid which may be paid in a particular case, and this amount can be paid in a variety of forms. There are similar limits on other types of aid such as training, R&amp;D or<i> de minimis</i> aid. Accordingly, the fact that rate remission is no longer payable does not in itself lead to a reduction in the amount of regional or other aid that would be payable to an individual enterprise. In the circumstances, the question of extending the rate remission scheme does not arise.</P>

      <P>The social economy programme, which I launched on 18 September, arises out of the report and recommendations of the Partnership 2000 social economy working group established by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="994" /> The report acknowledged the role that the social economy could play in the regeneration of local economies and in improving the quality of life of local communities. The aim under the social economy programme is to build up to an investment of £41 million annually with 2,300 full time equivalent jobs being created in social economy enterprises by 2003.</P>
    <P>The £41 million funding for the new social economy programme consists of the redirection of £38 million from the community employment scheme, £1.9 million from the FÁS community enterprise programme and an additional £1 million from the Exchequer. It was the intention of the working group that a new expanded programme to support the social economy would encompass the activities and objectives of the existing community enterprise programme that was aimed at providing enterprise supports to community and voluntary groups.</P>
    <P>The social economy programme is particularly targeted at supporting enterprise activity within disadvantaged urban and rural communities, which provides employment opportunities for long-term unemployed over 35 years of age and other disadvantaged persons. Maximising employment opportunities and supporting the regeneration of the local community will be important objectives of the programme.</P>
    <P>In relation to the community enterprise programme, all agreed contracts that have been entered into by FÁS are being met in a flexible way. Many business initiatives previously supported under the community enterprise programme in both urban and rural areas, as well as many new local enterprise projects, could be developed by community-voluntary groups as social economy enterprises through funding from the social economy programme. FÁS is actively supporting this process and will monitor its progress. Due to the stated aims and funding to be made available under the social economy programme it is expected that viable social economy enterprises providing sustainable employment opportunities and much needed services in disadvantaged areas will be created. As part of the promotion of the new programme, business plans from community groups, that previously received support under the community enterprise programme, will be encouraged by FÁS. Applications are made through the local FÁS office and are assessed by a local working group comprising the social partners and other local interests.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the investigations which <Col N="995" /> are ongoing at present under section 19 and section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990. There are five examinations of company books and documents currently ongoing under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990. The companies involved are Celtic Helicopters Limited, College Trustees Limited, Guinness &amp; Mahon (Ireland) Limited, Hamilton Ross Company Limited, and Kentford Securities Limited. The work of the authorised officer is substantially complete in a number of these cases and I expect to receive final reports on a number of these companies in the coming months.</P>
      <P>My appointment of an authorised officer to examine the books and documents of Dunnes Stores Ireland Company and Dunnes Stores (ILAC Centre) Ltd., under section 19 of the 1990 Act was the subject of a High Court judgment on 28 July 2000. On 31 October a notice of appeal was lodged with the Supreme Court seeking an order that my appointment of the authorised officer was valid and that his demand for books and documents was also valid.</P>
      <P>Three companies are also being investigated by High Court inspectors under section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990. The companies involved are National Irish Bank Limited, National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited, and Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited. As regards the section 8 High Court inquiry into Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited I expect that it will be at least six months before this inquiry can be completed. The section 8 inquiry into National Irish Bank Ltd., and National Irish Bank Financial Services Ltd., is ongoing and I hope that the inspectors' inquiry can be concluded early in 2001. Section 8 inspectors report directly to the High Court and will report to that court in due course.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that there is already good ongoing liaison between my Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in relation to work permit and immigration procedures. For example, my Department has already agreed with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that a number of categories of non-nationals should no longer require work permits to work in this country. These include persons who are posted on an intra-corporate transfer or secondment for a maximum period of four years to an establishment or undertaking in Ireland which is owned by a company or group which has <Col N="996" /> operations in more than one State and persons coming to Ireland from an overseas company for a maximum period of three years for training, whether or not it entails remunerated work, at an Irish based company.</P>
      <P>It also includes persons who have been granted permission to remain in the State on one of the following grounds: persons with permission to remain as the spouse of an Irish national; persons with permission to remain on the basis of having an Irish born child; and persons who have been given temporary leave to remain on humanitarian grounds, having been in the asylum process. My Department will continue to liaise with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure that procedures and requirements are simplified wherever possible.</P>

      <P>According to FÁS the current accommodation allowance of £27.50 per week can result in many instances of apprentices refusing to take up available places. This is disruptive to the effective planning of courses and to the apprentice concerned. It is also another major factor interfering with the seamless progress of apprentices through the various phases. In reviewing the situation FÁS has made comparisons have with the position in Teagasc, CERT, and private Industry and others. FÁS has made a submission to me on the issue, and I hope to come to a decision in the very near future.</P>

      <P>In respect of those recommendations directed towards my Department and its agencies, the overall position is as follows: In the case of low skilled and labour intensive sectors, my Department is working with FÁS to clarify and develop its role in the area of in company training in the services sector and the EGFSN recommendations in relation to the contract cleaning sector are being pursued in that context. In regard to the retail sector, FÁS has introduced a traineeship for the sector as recommended.

      <P>When considering prospective locations, mobile foreign direct investors seek out a wide range of competitive attributes including a stable political and business environment, available education and skills, market access and competitive infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The Government is keenly aware of the need to ensure that there is adequate infrastructure to support investment in productive capacity, whether foreign or Irish-owned. Accordingly, the national development plan commits £18 billion to investment in economic infrastructure such as roads, transport, communications, environmental services, energy and housing. The plan's provisions are being implemented by way of a number of operational programmes and a Cabinet sub-committee under the chairmanship of the Taoiseach is supervising the financing and timing of these investments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The speed of economic development requires that investment in infrastructure is an ongoing process, involving both the private and public sectors. A proactive approach to the deregulation of the telecommunications sector has been an important feature of the Government's e-business development strategy in recent years. The <Col N="999" /> Government's 1999 agreement with the Global Crossing company links Ireland directly with fibre optic networks in the US and Europe. Our national network is now 98% fibre optic and links are increasingly being made to cities and towns throughout the country. The national plan includes a £150 million provision to support investment in advanced telecommunications in areas around the country.</P>
    <P>Recent decisions by companies such as IBM, Microsoft, Novell, Pepsi, EMC, NETg, GoTo, Breakaway etc., to locate leading edge projects in Ireland is a major vote of confidence in our infrastructure and an endorsement of the ongoing work in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of advanced information communications technologies, ICTs, has become the most significant driver of world economic growth. ICTs are the catalysts through which enterprise, whether traditional or new and irrespective of location, can create sustained competitive advantage for its products and services on world markets. ICTs are also the catalysts through which enterprise can create quality and sustainable employment. Innovative strategies that capitalise on the power of the Internet are required and new business models that respond to customer demands in the knowledge economy must be developed.</P>
      <P>The challenges posed by the digital economy are not only technological but, to a large extent, strategic in nature. Ireland must ensure in the immediate future that not only are the basic infrastructural requirements put in place, but also that the full potential of ICTs is realised for the benefit of our enterprise and employment.</P>
      <P>The Government also has a vital role to play in supporting the new digital revolution and is committed to asserting its leadership role through, for example, the information society action plan, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and the Europe 2002 action plan by accelerating the move towards the on-line delivery of public services and the development of Ireland as a knowledge economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department will promote, in collaboration with other Departments, State agencies and the private sector, and at international level as members of the European Union, the WTO, the OECD and the UN, an environment which is conducive to building a critical mass of business throughout Ireland that can exploit the new knowledge economy as follows: In the areas of <Col N="1001" /> telecommunications infrastructure, regulation and costs my Department is inputting into the development of a legislative and regulatory regime to achieve the Government's objective to have vigorous competition by world class telecommunication services providers which will supply low cost broadband/internet connectivity throughout the country. Last year the Government committed IR£61 million to the global crossing international connectivity project and a further IR£50 million to 13 regional broadband projects.

    <P>In the area of awareness and access our development agencies are assisting business to adopt and harness the potential of ICT through acceleration initiatives and by developing business and consumer trust in e-business through awareness campaigns in a public private partnership with the relevant sectoral organisations. The Government is encouraging investment in education, skills and training through bodies such as the expert group on future skills needs, the education sector and FÁS to develop the appropriate skills, to promote innovation and to meet the emerging skills gaps, particularly in the ICT industries and e-business areas.</P>
    <P>In the research and development area, initiatives such as the technology foresight fund and the European Union's Framework Programme of Research, Technological Development and Demonstration 1998-2002 are used to establish Ireland as a location for world class research excellence in niche areas, within the ICT and e-business areas. By working closely with other Departments and international bodies we are building a balanced e-regulation framework which creates the necessary confidence and trust in ebusiness by enterprise and consumers alike and which encourages growth in the area. The Government is maximising the use of ICT in a co-ordinated client centred manner to deliver services to business, consumers and citizens through the Reach, OASIS and BASIS projects. These initiatives are being implemented in a co-ordinated manner and aim to ensure that Ireland will be a world leader in the digital economy.</P>

      <P>Provisional trade figures for the period from January to September 2000 show that Ireland's exports to Egypt totalled £138 million, an increase of 16% on the same period in 1999. Exports in 1999 totalled £182 million, which in turn was an increase of almost 21% on 1998. While food products, especially meat, are Ireland's principal exports to Egypt, the other major exports include computers parts and recorded media.</P>

      <Col N="1003" /> Enterprise Ireland has already undertaken initial market investigations on behalf of a number of clients and plans to investigate market opportunities on a more in-depth basis have been completed, in those areas highlighted as priority sectors for development in Egypt.</P>
    <P>Two inward missions from the softwareinformation technology sector have visited Ireland during 2000, assisted by Enterprise Ireland. These missions focused on the success factors behind the Irish software industry. Enterprise Ireland has informed me that they plan to undertake an exploratory trade mission to Egypt in February 2001, focusing on the software, information technology and education sectors.

      <P>The primary purpose of the community employment, CE, is to reintegrate long-term unemployed persons into jobs in the open labour market. The review of CE by Deloitte &amp; Touche, consultants, undertaken in 1998, set a framework for a reform of the programme for the years ahead. It recommended that there should be a reduction in participation on the programme over time, as well as a range of other reforms, including an increase in the duration of participant breaks between schemes from <Col N="1004" /> six to 12 months, aimed at securing better targeting and outcomes from the programme.</P>
      <P>This change together with the three year cap on participation in CE were introduced to discourage repeated participation on the programme and to give individuals the opportunity to undertake training programmes where possible, or to utilise the service of FÁS placement officers and-or the local employment service.</P>
      <P>I am particularly sensitive to the needs of older workers in rural areas and their situation is at present being reviewed pending the introduction of suitable projects under the social economy programme. I have received many representations on the restructuring of CE asking for the changes to the eligibility criteria to be reversed, and for participants to be allowed to remain on the programme. Overall, I consider the reduction in absolute numbers participating, together with the changed eligibility criteria, to be appropriate given the present economic climate and buoyancy in employment projections.</P>
      <P>CE is intended to be a progression programme and it would be inappropriate to allow almost permanent presence on such a programme while employees are being recruited from the EU and outside the EU to fill vacancies in both rural and urban areas, in low skilled categories of employment. It is essential, in the interests of the persons concerned, that we should make the most of the present opportunities to reintegrate and offer employment opportunities to the maximum number of those still unemployed.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the fact that a 33% additional loading is imposed on couriers who ride motorcycles by the sole insurance company quoting such a business; and if she has satisfied herself whether there is sufficient competition in this sector of the market to ensure that such loadings are justified by the claims record, in view of the fact that no such loading is imposed in the UK.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of loadings by insurers is extensive throughout the EU and is not subject to State regulation. EU law on insurance explicitly prevents Governments or insurance regulators from specifying policy prices or terms. Accordingly, there is no agreement or guidelines concerning loadings. Furthermore, I would regard any such intervention as anti-competitive and, therefore, not in the interests of consumers affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Underwriting criteria for insuring motorcyclists are normally based on underwriting experience, including trends in the level, frequency and cost of claims for particular risks and classes of risk <Col N="1005" /> and are a matter of judgment by individual private insurance companies.</P>
    <P>Any changes in circumstances affecting the risk insured, would have to be assessed by the insurer, from an underwriting standpoint and the premiums charged would reflect any material increase, in the risk.</P>
    <P>Inquiries made by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in this matter have confirmed the application of an additional loading on motorcyclists employed in the courier business, who by the nature of their work, represent a very high risk category for insurers. The loading is due to the increased level of cover involved. Motorcycle couriers have a &lsquo;hire and reward' dimension to their risk cover, which does not apply in the insurance cover of conventional motorcyclists. Our inquiries also established a practice by UK insurance companies of increasing the premium by far greater than 33% for motorcyclists, employed in the courier business.</P>
    <P>As in any other branch of insurance risk, reductions in premiums can only be achieved by improved safety standards. This includes creating appropriate conditions for improving standards of driving and appreciation of road safety. A number of initiatives are in place and are being taken to improve driving standards and safety awareness among all drivers, including motorcyclists. The National Safety Council, in co-operation with the Garda, continue to promote anti-speeding and anti-drink driving media campaigns.</P>
    <P>The formation of the EU single market for insurance in 1994 granted access to the Irish motor insurance market to all authorised insurance companies within the EU.</P>
    <P>This encourages as many insurers as possible, to compete on the market so that the Irish consumer is getting the most competitive quotes from the insurance companies availing of the opportunity to compete on the Irish market.</P>

In the case of non-unionised employments and where the employer is a member of a body party to the agreement, there is a clear expectation that the terms will be applied. In that regard, the statistical evidence over the years is that the pay terms have been widely applied throughout the labour force.</P>
      <P>Where employees and their employer cannot reach agreement through negotiations concerning the application of the terms of the pay agreement, I would urge the parties to avail of the services of the State's dispute resolution machinery.</P>

      <P>Export figures for the first eight months of 2000 show that the United States has overtaken Great <Col N="1008" /> Britain as our largest single export market. Exports to the United States increased by 55% over the same period in 1999 to a total of £8 billion or 19.5% of Ireland's exports worldwide. There were large increases in exports to the United Kingdom, Netherlands, France, Belgium, Italy, Japan and South Korea.

      <P>Table 1 below contains a detailed breakdown of the number and percentage of vacancies by occupational group (ranked in order of the percentage of vacancies to employment), taken from the ESRI's national survey of private sector vacancies, 1998. It shows that there were 53,000 vacancies, equivalent to 6% of the vacancy-to-employment ratio at the time of the survey in autumn 1998. This table indicates that the greatest proportionate vacancies were among computer engineers and professionals and associate professionals. Another very significant category of vacancy was skilled maintenance and production workers, craftspersons.</P>
      <P>More recently, Forfás and FÁS commissioned the ESRI to conduct a further survey of employers' vacancies in late 1999 and early 2000.

These show that the percentage of firms with vacancies has risen to 31% while the total number of vacancies has risen to 79,600. This represents 6.5% of total employment. Table 2 below presents broad aggregated results from the latest survey. It shows the two areas with the greatest percentage vacancy levels are technicians and skilled craft workers. However, there are also many vacancies at operative level and in services occupations.</P>

      <P>Investment in enterprise has been one of the primary contributors to the development which has seen the Irish economy advance so significantly in recent years.</P>
      <P>The healthy state of our economy is illustrated by a number of economic indicators. Unemployment has now fallen to very low levels and the numbers at work have increased by almost 50%. Output growth is running at around 9% per annum in real terms, which is well in excess of the EU average. The competitiveness of our businesses has significantly improved, and the country's exports and trade surplus have risen very substantially.</P>
      <P>These achievements have been supported by a blend of Government policies, implemented in the context of successive partnership agreements. There has been significant investment in education, training and public infrastructure, as well as private investment in productive capacity which has been supported by grant aid from the industrial development agencies. The personal tax burden has been progressively reduced, and the low corporate tax regime will continue to provide an incentive for investment. All of these factors have contributed to creating the conditions which permit enterprise to flourish.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, we must guard against complacency. Much work is needed to build on these achievements, and to ensure that further progress is not threatened by developments such as infrastructural or skills-related constraints. The national development plan addresses very fully our infrastructure requirements in the coming years. Efforts to ensure the availability of sufficient skilled and unskilled labour are continuing, particularly through the Forfás expert group on future skills needs. A very significant investment in scientific and technological innovation is being made through the technology foresight fund, which will enhance Ireland's position as a centre of high-technology expertise. A range of financial support measures continue to be available as incentives to promote private sector investment in productive capacity and training, as well as in research and development.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the combined effect of these measures will serve to ensure that investment in enterprise will be a key element of our future economic progress.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 197 and 198 together.</P>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to the sectors of the economy most in need of employees and to the degree to which this can be met by overseas labour.</P>
      <P>This was why the Government, on my initiative, earlier this year introduced a new simplified work visa-authorisation scheme to meet the labour needs of certain key sectors such as information and communications technology, construction professionals and nursing.</P>
      <P>This makes it possible for prospective employees with job offers from employers in Ireland to obtain immigration and employment clearance in advance from Irish embassies and consulates and to come to this country to work for a period of up to two years.</P>
      <P>For other sectors, my Department are prepared to consider issuing work permits to Irish employers where they are unable to get Irish or other European economic area nationals to fill specific jobs and where the relevant immigration and labour law requirements are met. To date, this year, my Department has issued more than 15,000 such permits, compared with 6250 for all of last year.</P>
      <P>The areas of highest demand are IT, medicine, catering and agriculture-horticulture.</P>
      <P>While there is strong demand from the industry and services sectors generally, there appears to be very little demand from the construction sector and it may be that this sector is meeting most of its needs from within the European economic area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 200, 201, 202, 203, 209, 210 and 211 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 56, 57, 58, 59 and 60 in this House on 19 October 2000. As I stated on that occasion, the ESB is statutorily responsible for managing, con<Col N="1014" /> ducting and preserving the Shannon fisheries vested in it, subject to my general supervision.</P>
    <P>Corporate governance of the ESB is a matter primarily for the Minister for Public Enterprise. The ownership of the Shannon fisheries is vested in the ESB under statute. Any changes in this regard would be a matter for the Minister for Public Enterprise in the first instance, in consultation inevitably with the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
    <P>Under its governing legislation, the ESB is obliged in each financial year to keep an account of all moneys received and expended by the board in relation to the Shannon fisheries. As soon as may be after each financial year the board is obliged to furnish a copy of the account to the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. My Department has drawn the ESB's attention to its outstanding obligations in relation to accounts, noting however that the ESB furnishes an annual fisheries report to my Department.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Deputy's request for details of court orders and other information relating to the disposal of confiscated materials in the years 1984 and 1985 I refer the Deputy to my reply of 19 October in which I stated that the ESB advise that to assemble the information requested would require a very major investment of resources.</P>
    <P>My Department has begun a thorough review of the corporate relationship with the ESB fisheries division and the past, present and future exercise of roles and responsibilities, in relation to the Shannon fisheries and in that context will be initiating high level discussions with the ESB and the Department of Public Enterprise at an early date.</P>

      <P>Fish quotas for 2001 will be the subject of detailed discussions and negotiations at a meeting of the EU Council of Fisheries Ministers on 14 and 15 December 2000. I am not in a position to pre-empt the outcome to that meeting. The stocks status of many whitefish species, especially cod, hake and monkfish is not satisfactory and there is a growing consensus that decisive action needs to be taken to re-build stocks in order that the fisheries concerned can be developed in a sustainable manner for the ultimate benefit of fishermen. In the context of the upcoming quota discussions, I will approach the issue with the aim of striking the appropriate balance between the respective needs of conservation and the livelihoods of the fishermen concerned.</P>
      <P>In accordance with my general policy of promoting the interest of the Irish fishing fleet generally in a sustainable manner, I am anxious to ensure development of the scallop fishing fleet and I will pursue this with BIM and the Marine Institute. In relation to scallops, these are not subject to the quota regime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have previously indicated to the House, I am keenly aware that Irish fishermen all around the coast are experiencing considerable difficulties as a result of increased fuel costs in particular. The fishing industry is exceptionally exposed to increased fuel prices because of the relatively high proportion of fuel costs to overall costs. The industry, in common with other fishing industries in other member states is rebated excise and VAT on marine diesel. As a result fuel cost increases directly reflect movements in the supply price. Fuel costs to the fishing sector have doubled since January 1999.</P>
      <P>I have a very clear understanding of the scale and severity of the industry's problems. I am continuing discussions with the industry and with my colleagues in Government on ways to tackle the difficulties. Options to alleviate the situation including the fishing industry's proposals are being urgently assessed having regard to overall Government strategies and approaches to the fuel issue.</P>

      <P>The Government currently has no plans to extend favoured nation status to Iraq. Our policy is that any enterprise seeking trade with Iraq must ensure that it is in full compliance with the relevant UN resolutions, including the oil for food programme.</P>
      <P>The basis for the continued imposition of UN sanctions on Iraq remains the Iraqi Government's refusal to co-operate with the UN Commissions appointed to verify the dismantling of Iraq's programme to acquire weapons of mass destruction. The Government regrets that Iraq has not so far fully complied with the resolutions adopted by the Security Council, including those provisions concerning Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.</P>
      <P>We would wish to see the necessary co-operation from Baghdad to allow greater progress to be made on the suspension, and ultimate lifting, of sanctions.

      <P>I have looked into the matter raised by the Deputy. It is my understanding that in the regular mid-term re-election of parliamentary committee chairpersons, Dr. Piskinsut was not nominated by her own party for re-election to the chair of the Human Rights Committee. Instead the chair was taken by another Government Deputy from a different party.</P>
      <P>Dr. Piskinsut's diligence and thoroughness in investigating conditions in Turkish prisons and other places of detention, including claims of torture, is considered admirable. It has been widely recognised that her leadership of the Human Rights Committee and the publication in five volumes of her findings led to a renewed Turkish Government commitment to effectively address any incidents of torture by employees of the State.</P>
      <P>At the Helsinki European Council last December Turkey was accorded candidate status in relation to EU accession. However the strengthening of Turkey's links with the European Union and its eventual accession depend on Turkey's continued pursuit of the political and economic reforms on which it has embarked, including the alignment of human rights standards and practices with those in force in the EU and respect for and protection of minorities. The Government will continue to work actively to encourage Turkey on the path of reform and is ready to provide it with every support and practical assistance towards this end.</P>

      <P>The statute of the International Criminal Court was concluded at Rome on 17 July 1998 and was signed, subject to ratification, by Ireland on 7 October 1998. It will enter into force approximately two months after 60 states have become party to it. My information is that, to date, 115 states have signed the Statute and, of these, 22 have ratified it.</P>
      <P>An amendment to the Constitution is required to permit the State to ratify the statute and, in this regard, I have asked the chairman of the Government legislation committee to arrange for the draft Bill containing a proposal for such an amendment to be given priority in the Government's legislation programme.</P>
      <P>In connection with the actual ratification process itself, apart from the need to amend the Constitution and, therefore, the need for a referendum approving such an amendment, an in-depth analysis of the statute by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform together with my Department, the Office of the Attorney General and other appropriate bodies will also be necessary to determine the exact legislative and administrative measures which may need to be adopted in order for Ireland to be in a position to meet its obligations under the statute.</P>
      <P>The question of whether a declaration under Article 124 should be made would need to be considered before the State ratifies the statute.</P>
      <P>Article 98 does not allow for &ldquo;opt out declarations&rdquo;, rather it calls for a determination to be made on a case by case basis, should the circumstances envisaged in that Article arise. It would be inappropriate at this time to speculate on the outcome of such determinations but they would at all times respect the integrity of the Rome statute.</P>

We have consistently called for the early closure of these reactors which continue to operate well beyond their original design life.</P>
      <P>We have also expressed our concerns to the UK authorities about the announcement made in May this year by British Nuclear Fuels that these reactors will be shut down on a phased basis over the next 20 years. Some of the Magnox reactors will close by 2010 but those at the Oldbury and Wylfa plants may remain open until 2013 and 2021 respectively. The Government wants to see all these reactors closed down now and we will continue to press for this.</P>
      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has been maintaining close contact with the UK Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) about the Wylfa plant. The position taken by the NII is that the plant will remain closed until such time as BNFL satisfies the NII that it is safe to restart operations at the plant.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on 45 animals under the 2000 cattle headage scheme. During an inspection of his herd on 11 September 2000 it was found that one of the animals applied on had been sold on 14 August 2000. My Department's inspectors required proof that this animal, which was listed on the application form as a beef breed cow, conformed to the definition of a cow as set out in clauses 6 and 7 of the terms and conditions governing the scheme. Further inquiries as to the breed of the animal are necessary and, in this regard, another visit has been arranged between the inspectors and the person named. The person <Col N="1022" /> named will be informed of the result of these enquiries as soon as they are completed.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on 25 animals under the 2000 cattle headage scheme, ten of which were dairy cows. One of the animals applied on, a dairy cow with tag number HXA234953, was not in his ownership and possession at the time of application. Consequently, in accordance with clause 13 of the terms and conditions governing this scheme, my Department wrote to the person named on 7 November 2000 advising him that he was ruled out of the cattle headage scheme for the years 2000 and 2001. He was given the opportunity to have this decision reviewed and the person named wrote to my Department on 9 November 2000 stating that the animal was applied on in error because his herd register was not up to date when he completed the application form.</P>
      <P>My Department has accepted this as a genuine error and has now written to the person named advising him to provide the tag number of another dairy cow not applied on at the time of application but which was in his herd at that time since he declared when applying for grants under the 2000 cattle headage scheme that he had 20 dairy cows in his herd.  No grant will be paid on animal tag number HXA234953 and a reduction penalty of 4.16% will apply to the payment on the remaining eligible animals in accordance with clause 30 of the terms and conditions governing the scheme. The person named has been given the opportunity to appeal this decision within 21 days.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the current debate taking place in the United Kingdom on the factors responsible for the increase in bovine tuberculosis. I understand the views of the British Cattle Veterinary Association (BCVA), the National Farmers Union and the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons have been submitted to the TB forum of the UK Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries (MAFF). The BCVA submission includes many of the elements of my Department's current bovine tuberculosis eradication programme, such as herd categorisation, testing strategy, reactor purchase strategy and other biosecurity measures. These measures are being considered along with a strategic wildlife programme in the UK as it is believed the wildlife reservoir of infection remains the major constraint to final eradication of bovine tuberculosis.</P>
      <P>In Ireland a similar type review was and continues to be conducted by the tuberculosis investigation unit of University College Dublin. The specific dynamics of bovine tuberculosis as they exist in this country have been well documented and various recommendations on husbandry and other selected factors have been made and acted upon.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for an allocation of suckler cow quota from the year 2001 national reserve under category C.</P>
      <P>This category was reserved for farmers who were regular applicants under the suckler cow premium scheme and who had at least ten but not more than 30 livestock units. Livestock units are calculated with reference to the number of animals applied on for the year 2000 suckler cow and ewe premium schemes and the 1999 special beef premium scheme. The livestock unit equivalent of any milk quota held is also added. This is calculated by dividing the milk quota by 897 gallons, the national average milk yield per cow.</P>
      <P>The person named had 30.8 livestock units which are calculated as follows: special beef premium scheme 1999 &ndash; 10.8 livestock units; suckler cow premium scheme 2000 &ndash; 11.0 livestock units; milk quota of 8361 gallons at 1 April 2000 (divided by 897)  &ndash;  9.0 livestock units.</P>
      <P>As the livestock units of the person named exceed the upper limit of 30 livestock units, I regret to say that he does not qualify for an allocation of quota from this reserve.</P>
      <P>In any event, because of the large number of applicants and the small amount of quota available for distribution, there was insufficient quota to allow allocations to be made to all eligible applicants under category C. The quota was allocated to eligible applicants in this category with ten livestock units first, then to those with 11 and so on until all the available quota was distributed. This occurred at 20 livestock units &ndash; farmers with livestock units greater than 20 did not receive an allocation of quota.</P>
      <P>There were 815 applicants, seeking 20,101 premium rights, under category C whose livestock units are between 20 and 30 but regrettably there is no quota available to allow allocations to be made to them.</P>

      <Quest>if he is making provision in the forthcoming budget for civil servants who were forced to resign in the early 1960s on getting married; and if these persons will be offered any relief or pension in their own right now that they have matured beyond pension age.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the occupational superannuation arrangements for the Civil Service for which I have direct responsibility, the position is that, prior to 31 July 1973, the law required that female employees in <Col N="1028" /> the Civil Service had to resign on marriage. In such cases, employees under pension age qualified for marriage gratuities of 1/12th of salary per year of service, subject to a maximum of one year's salary.</P>
      <P>I would point out that, where a person who resigns before pension age subsequently becomes a civil servant, the break in service does not debar the reckoning of the prior service for purposes of any pension benefits for which they subsequently become eligible in respect of the later service. In order to aggregate the periods of service, an appropriate refund must be made in respect of any payment made to them on the occasion of the initial resignation. This would be of benefit to any of the employees affected by the marriage bar who re-entered the Civil Service after 1973.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to change the Superannuation Acts to provide pensions for officers who resigned on marriage before 1973. I would point out that any such change would, <i>inter alia,</i> have wide ramifications in relation to employees who left the public service before the introduction of preserved pension entitlements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since April 1995, on foot of a Government decision, all new entrants to the public service are in full PRSI class and are subject to co-ordination.</P>
      <P>Co-ordination applies in both the public service and the private sector, where it is sometimes known as integration. A co-ordinated scheme is one that takes into account the social welfare contributory pension or other similar contributory benefits in designing the overall benefit promise being made by the occupational pension scheme of the member in question. It looks upon the old age contributory pension as part of the total pension package promised to employees on retirement. It acknowledges the substantial PRSI contributions being made by employers and employees which in turn entitle members to substantial social insurance benefits. On the other hand, contributions toward the occupational element of the pension are less than they would be if the pension were not co-ordinated.</P>
      <P>Prior to the change in PRSI status for new entrants to the public service in April 1995, the general position was that co-ordination applied to non-established and industrial civil servants, non-officer grades in the education and local authority sectors, non-officer grades in health boards and voluntary hospitals and all grades in nominated health agencies and certain state sponsored bodies as well as civilian employees of the Permanent Defence Forces. A limited form of co-ordination applied also to enlisted personnel in the Permanent Defence Forces. The remaining public servants had no entitlement to social insurance pensions. As such they were not subject to co-ordination.</P>
      <P>Details in relation to the categories of workers subject to co-ordination in Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta are a matter for those bodies and the responsible Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1032" /> Integration is a central feature of public service pension schemes and of the majority of schemes in the private sector. However, the Deputy may wish to note that the Commission on Public Service Pensions indicated in its interim report that it would examine the issue of co-ordination/integration with particular reference to the occupational pension position of those retiring on relatively low levels of pay and part-time staff. I hope to be in a position to publish the final report shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole structure of stamp duty is based on the &ldquo;slab&rdquo; system rather than a &ldquo;step&rdquo; system; once a threshold is exceeded, the rate applies to the entire consideration. This has always been the case with stamp duty and any change to apply a rate only to an excess over the relevant threshold would require a complete restructuring of the entire system.</P>
      <P>Stamp duty is an important source of funding for the State. The stamp duty yield from residential property in 1999 was £207 million. This is a considerable sum which helps to finance public expenditure in areas such as education, health and the development of infrastructure and also permits the easement of taxation in other areas notably income tax. The introduction of a system as proposed by the Deputy would involve a significant cost to the current yield. Consequently, I have no plans to amend the current stamp duty structure.</P>

      <P>In the absence of specific information about the refusal of tax relief referred to by the Deputy it is not possible to give a definitive reason for that refusal. Generally speaking, a pension payable to the child of a deceased public servant is regarded for income tax purposes as the income of the child. This is as a consequence of the O'Coindealbhain v O'Carroll tax case [4 ITR 221].</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A parent can claim tax relief for health expenses, such as the cost of orthodontic treat<Col N="1034" /> ment, incurred in respect of a dependant child where the child's annual income is £2,100 or less. If a dependant child's income exceeds £2,100, tax relief for health expenses incurred in respect of the child cannot be claimed.</P>
    <P>Medical expenses relief is available to individuals in respect of a dependent child where the dependent &lsquo;is maintained by the individual at the individual's own expense for whole or part of the tax year.' However, if the child has income in its own right then he/she is not wholly dependent on the taxpayer claiming the relief. In this respect relief is not granted to the parent. However, I would note that if a child has his/her own taxable income, he/she may claim tax relief for health expenses incurred, in his or her own right, subject to the normal conditions.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who consulted the Deputy, that the payments referred to by the Deputy in the second half of the question are related to the occupational pension payments received by the individual in question. As the pension referred to is a State pension, I would be happy to make inquiries in the matter if the Deputy furnishes me with the necessary details.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>if he will have arrangements made for a further investigation into the alleged altering of medical records by the Western Health Board, arising from the issues raised in a media report (details supplied).</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

      <P>The background to the case is as follows. The woman concerned tested positive for hepatitis C in October 1997. However, a serious dispute emerged in this case between the woman and the Western Health Board regarding the source of her hepatitis C infection. The woman herself believes that the source was infected anti-D and is of the strong view that anti-D was administered to her following the birth of her child in Castlebar hospital in March 1993. She alleges that a medical record was later altered to denote that anti-D was not administered. The board stated that their medical records show that anti-D was not administered to the woman while she was under their care in March 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tests carried out by the independent laboratory jointly run by the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service and the Department of Medical Microbiology, University of Edinburgh, <Col N="1036" /> indicated that the source of the woman's hepatitis C infection was not the anti-D product manufactured by the Blood Transfusion Service Board. The laboratory's findings are disputed by the woman.</P>
    <P>The board arranged for the woman's solicitors to gain access to all the hospital records relating to the case, including medical, nursing and laboratory records in their original format. I understand that the solicitors also met members of the hospital staff, including medical, nursing, laboratory staff and management, who explained the hospital's practices, procedures and record keeping arrangements in relation to the administration of anti-D. The hospital subsequently forwarded copies of any documentation requested by the solicitors.</P>
    <P>The woman's family requested the Garda to investigate whether anti-D was administered to the woman in Castlebar Hospital, and whether her hospital records had been materially altered. The Garda visited the hospital on 28 October and the 16 November 1998 in relation to this investigation, and, at the request of the hospital, took a number of records away for forensic examination. Neither I nor the Western Health Board have been informed of the results of that examination; in the circumstances, it would not be appropriate to seek such information from the Garda authorities. However, I should say that the Western Health Board accepts that the woman's record was amended but is fully satisfied that the amended record reflects the accurate position, which is that the woman never received anti-D. The board does not accept that the record had been inappropriately changed and the consultant in charge of the woman's care while in Castlebar Hospital is adamant that the woman never received the anti-D product.</P>
    <P>With regard to the woman's desire for a decision on the cause of her hepatitis C infection, my predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, indicated on numerous occasions that he considered that the hepatitis C compensation tribunal was the most appropriate forum in which to have this matter resolved. The tribunal was established by the Oireachtas and has a statutory remit to determine causation on the balance of probabilities. In addition, the tribunal has the confidence of all four of the support groups representing persons infected with hepatitis C through the administration within the State of infected blood and blood products. Indeed, approximately 1,400 individuals have had their claims determined by the tribunal to date. Of the 1,400 claims heard, only 10 &ndash; or less than 1% &ndash; have been rejected by the tribunal. In June 1998, an offer was made to the woman concerned to arrange an early hearing on the causation issue alone, independent of considerations of compensation. In addition, as the woman is now living abroad, my Department offered as an exceptional measure to arrange financial assistance for herself and her family to facilitate their attendance at the compensation tribunal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1037" /> In June 2000 the woman's legal representatives informed my Department that their client would be attending the hepatitis C compensation tribunal, and the necessary arrangements were made by my Department to cover the expenses, totalling £4,000, which she would incur in attending the tribunal. As the hepatitis C compensation tribunal is independent in its operation of both myself and my Department, I am not in a position to confirm the outcome of the hearing. I understand from media reports, however, that the woman's case was withdrawn from the compensation tribunal before a determination had been made and that a case may now be taken by the woman to the High Court. If this is the case, I would urge her to return to the compensation tribunal which provides an effective, informal and non-adversarial route for persons with hepatitis C to obtain redress. A decision to return to the compensation tribunal would in no way debar the woman from proceeding to the High Court at a later stage if she should choose to do so; claimants are only required to discontinue legal proceedings if they accept the compensation tribunal's award. It is entirely a matter for the woman herself and her legal representatives to decide whether they wish to avail of the compensation tribunal but I believe that it is the best option for having the case resolved as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>This is an operational matter for the health boards in the first instance. The issue of young people between 16 and 18 years of age giving consent to immunisation was one of the matters considered by the national steering group established by the health board chief executive officers to oversee the planning of the meningococcal C immunisation programme. I understand legal advice was obtained by the office for health gain, on behalf of the health boards, indicating that the administration of a vaccine to protect against group C meningococcal disease is covered by the provisions of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act, 1997, section 23 of which allows for any person who has attained the age of 16 years to give consent for any surgical, medical or dental treatment as if he or she were of full age. The legal advice obtained further indicates that it is not necessary to obtain the consent of a parent or guardian in respect of a person who has attained the age of 16 years.</P>
      <P>The guidelines for practitioners, including standards of good practice, published by the office for health gain in September 2000 to assist health professionals involved in the meningococcal C immunisation programme recommend that where a young person is consenting to vaccination, they should be advised to inform their parent(s) or guardian(s) accordingly.</P>

The hospital in question is a private psychiatric hospital, registered in accordance with the Mental Treatment Acts.

I understand, however, that there are other facilities on the same campus which are both registered and attract nursing home subvention. If the patient were to transfer to one of those facilities, he may qualify for nursing home subvention.

      <P>Children of drug addicts would generally be regarded as being in a vulnerable position and boards would respond to their needs on the basis of the facts of individual cases. Children of drug users often find it difficult to lead a normal childhood. Their everyday life may lack stability and material and emotional resources. Support systems are necessary for these children and their parents.</P>
      <P>In 1999 the drug misuse research division of the HRB carried out a study on the availability, use and evaluation of the provision of crèche facilities in association with drug treatment in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area. Only a small number of drug treatment clinics provided such facilities. The report made recommendations regarding enhancing the present provision of facilities and also regarding further training of existing crèche staff to deal with specific issues which might arise. Drugs service managers, in conjunction with child care managers in the ERHA, are working to implement these recommendations and to improve crèche facilities for drug misusers.</P>
      <P>Under the Government's initiative on drugs, the Taoiseach allocated £34.8 million in 1999 to the young people's facilities and services fund, to develop youth facilities and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drugs problem exists or has the potential to develop. This funding provides for a wide variety of community based prevention programmes, including early school leaving programmes, after-school activities, sports and recreational activities, family support programmes, art, drama, and music programmes, counselling and transport services.</P>

Prior to the review of the intercountry adoption assessment and the resultant report, Towards a Standardised Framework for Intercountry Adoption Assessment Procedures, published in 1999, statistics in relation to intercountry adoption were published in the Adoption Board's annual reports. Arising from the increased interest in intercountry adoption assessment in recent years more detailed statistics have been collected by the Adoption Board and the Department since 1998.</P>
      <P>The group charged with implementing the recommendations of the above report presented me with a report on progress on implementation in July this year. I am making a copy of this report available to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I draw the Deputy's attention to chapter 6 of the report of the implementation group which includes detailed statistics on the demand for intercountry adoption assessment, waiting lists, waiting times, duration of assessment and staffing levels in intercountry adoption assessment. Statistics have been collected from the health boards at the end of September 2000 and included in this response. I highlight a number of areas where there have been developments in the interim. In particular, the waiting list has been reduced, despite an increase in the number of applications to date this year and the waiting time for assessment in the boards with the longest waiting times, the Mid-Western Health Board and the Eastern Regional Health Authority whose service for the three area boards is provided by the South Western Area Health Board has also been reduced. In addition, the number of social workers has been increased during this period. The Deputy will wish to refer to the statistics contained in the report for comparison purposes.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to introduce legislation to govern the practice of cosmetic surgery but I am continuing to keep the issue under review. The Medical Council is the statutory body established to provide for the registration and control of persons engaged in the practice of medicine under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978. Doctors are required to be registered with the council before they can practise medicine in Ireland. However, practitioners are free to provide services to the public as long as they do not represent themselves as being registered medical practitioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Doctors practising in the public health service are registered with the Medical Council. People who avail of health services outside of the public <Col N="1047" /> health system should endeavour to seek the services of reputable organisations. In cases where people are dissatisfied with the service provided, redress can be sought through civil law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Hospital services for persons with hepatitis C are provided through the following designated units: Beaumont, Mater, St. James's and St. Vincent's Hospitals, Dublin; Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin; St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny; Cork University Hospital and University College Hospital, Galway. Under the health care package made available to persons infected with hepatitis C through the administration within the State of blood or blood products, it is guaranteed that no patient will have to wait more than two weeks for an appointment to a hepatitis C unit. Also, patients referred by a liver consultant to another specialty, for example, gynaecology or rheumatology, are guaranteed their first appointment within two weeks. Subsequent appointments are on the basis of clinical need.</P>
      <P>Concerns about the implementation of the &ldquo;two week rule&rdquo; have been expressed to me earlier this year by the support groups representing persons with hepatitis C. I raised these concerns directly with the chief executive officers of the relevant health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. My Department also followed up the issues raised with the individual hospitals. Hospitals have been reminded of their obligation to provide the levels of service guaranteed to this group of patients and have been asked to review the effective operation of the &ldquo;two week rule&rdquo; on an ongoing basis. As a result, each hospital has been asked to nominate a dedicated liaison officer in their hepatitis C unit, plus a deputy to act in the liaison officer's absence. The liaison officer, or deputy, will be the point of contact for hepatitis C patients attending the hospital and will address the inquiries and concerns of hepatitis C patients regarding hospital services. In addition, hospitals have been asked to establish liaison arrangements with the support groups to discuss service provision, including user satisfaction and future service developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department and I are fully committed to the development of primary care and hospital services for persons with hepatitis C, and the provision of adequate resources for these services. A capital development programme is in place and new facilities have been put in place, or are being planned, for Beaumont Hospital and Mater Hospital, Dublin; St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny; <Col N="1048" /> and Cork University Hospital. I was recently pleased to announce that £600,000 will be made available by my Department over the next two years to provide new facilities for children with hepatitis C at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has been advised by the Health Service Employers Agency that the key point of the European Court of Justice, ECJ, ruling was that if doctors are required to be present at the health centre for on-call purposes, time spent on-call must be regarded in its entirety as working time, and where appropriate, overtime. If they are merely required to be contactable, only the time linked to the actual provision of primary health care must be regarded as working time.</P>
      <P>In Ireland, general practitioners generally do not provide on-call service from health centres, but respond to house calls from their own homes. It is unlikely therefore that the ECJ ruling in respect of the Spanish case will have any significant implications for primary health care doctors in Ireland.</P>

      <P>In the context of planning for the meningococcal C immunisation programme, health boards considered the arrangements in place for the supply of vaccine to general practitioners. In some regions the number of vaccine supply points has been increased, in order to facilitate collection. I also understand that in some health boards arrangements have been made to have vaccine delivered to doctors' practices.</P>
      <P>General practitioners, as private contractors, are responsible in the first instance for ensuring that their practice is appropriately equipped. Where immunisation is concerned, this includes having appropriate refrigeration facilities for vaccine storage.</P>
      <P>The planning process for the meningococcal C immunisation programme also included consideration of the adequacy of vaccine fridge capacity at general practice level.

      <P>Annual immunisation against influenza is recommended for persons over 65 years of age and for other persons with certain conditions, such as chronic respiratory or heart disease. Advice was received this year from the National Immunisation Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, that health care workers who have direct patient contact in health care institutions such as hospitals, nursing homes etc. should also receive the influenza vaccine. In the light of these recommendations my Department asked the health boards to promote the annual immunisation against influenza of health care workers in health board and non-health board settings, that is, hospitals, nursing homes and, where considered appropriate, in the community also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A stock of influenza vaccine is purchased each year by the health boards for use in immunising persons in the designated at-risk groups. This year, in order to ensure vaccine was available to meet anticipated demand, the quantity of influenza vaccine ordered was increased by one third over that purchased in 1999, to some 435,000 doses, when contingency stocks are taken into <Col N="1051" /> account. Delivery of the majority of this stock took place in September 2000 and arrangements were made by health boards to distribute this to doctors.</P>
    <P>There has been a very good response to this year's immunisation campaign. This success has meant that the rate of usage of influenza vaccine has been significantly higher than in previous years. In some areas of the country there was an interval between the initial stock of vaccine being used and delivery of a second batch. This further quantity of vaccine was delivered on 31 October and distributed to health boards for use. In the light of the high level of demand experienced this year, a further 25,000 doses of influenza vaccine have been ordered and are due for delivery shortly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1053" /> Out-patient clinics staffed by consultant-led multi-disciplinary teams are deemed the most appropriate treatment setting for persons suffering from ADD-ADHD. Additional revenue of £3 million has been provided for child and adolescent psychiatry since 1997 primarily for the development of dedicated consultant-led multi-disciplinary teams. Each health board now has a dedicated team in place and services continue to be developed.</P>
    <P>A working group has been established by my Department to review child and adolescent psychiatry and to finalise a plan for the further development of this service. The organisation of services for the treatment of ADD-ADHD will be considered as part of this review.</P>

    <P>All boards, with the exception of the Midland Health Board, have a consultant-led service in place. In the regional orthodontic units dental <Col N="1054" /> teams provide orthodontic services under the overall direction and supervision of the consultant. The Midland Health Board currently provides orthodontic services by arrangements with private orthodontists and hopes to be successful in recruiting a consultant from a recent competition. All health boards may, at their discretion, enter into arrangements with private orthodontists for the provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible patients at approved rates. Conditions of service at a national level are negotiated with the staff associations through the Health Service Employers Agency.</P>
    <P>As part of the Estimates for 2001 the following improvements are planned for the Eastern Regional Health Authority: the employment of a locum consultant orthodontist; the recruitment of two additional orthodontists on a permanent basis; the appointment of six community orthodontists (two in each area health board); contracting of services from private orthodontists at approved rates; recruitment of three clinicians with M. Orth. qualifications to fill the existing vacancies in the regional orthodontic unit at St James's Hospital; recruitment of three additional clinicians with M. Orth. qualification for the unit at St James's; recruitment of 12 nursing and nine administrative support staff for the additional clinicians as outlined above; the commissioning of five additional surgeries at St James's Hospital which will come on stream early in 2001; new regional orthodontic units are also being established at Beaumont and Loughlinstown &ndash; the unit at Loughlinstown is expected to be operational early in January next; existing waiting lists will be validated.</P>
    <P>The authority is also pressing ahead with organisational changes in the orthodontic services. Orthodontics will be managed and operated in the region on the basis of three services, one in each area health board. The combination of these developments should result in significantly reduced waiting times and waiting lists for orthodontic services in the eastern region.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 288 and 291 together.</P>
      <P>The voluntary housing capital assistance and the rental subsidy schemes do not provide for the purchase of houses by the tenants. A tenant purchase scheme for voluntary housing is not desirable at this stage of the development of the voluntary housing sector in this country as the sale of individual housing units would undermine the capacity and resources of voluntary housing bodies to manage and maintain their estates and continue to provide further housing projects to meet pressing needs.</P>
      <P>The rent payable under the rental subsidy scheme, to an approved body, by a tenant of a house qualifying for subsidy, is based on household and subsidiary income in the previous tax year. There is no maximum on the rent payable on the principal household income. However, the contribution to the rent by each subsidiary earner is subject to a maximum of £20 per week.</P>
      <P>Where a tenant of a rental subsidy scheme produces satisfactory evidence of a fall in income to an approved body and of the likelihood of such a fall being sustained for at least four weeks, the weekly rent may be adjusted to the level appropriate to the reduced rate of income for the full duration of the reduction in income.</P>
      <P>In determining rents under the capital assistance scheme, approved bodies are expected to have regard to the tenant's income and the outlay of the body on the accommodation, including ongoing costs of its management and maintenance.</P>
      <P>Residents of rental subsidy houses of more than one year's duration who wish to become owner-occupiers may, on surrendering their house to the approved body, qualify for the following benefits: special mortgage allowance of £9,000 over five years to assist with mortgage repayments; the shared ownership scheme without having to satisfy the income eligibility criteria; improvement works in lieu scheme in respect of the dwelling they are acquiring; low cost housing sites scheme; and exemption from the income limit for local authority housing loans.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 289 and 298 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has received representations from the Dunboyne Combined Residents Associations expressing concern about proposals in the draft Meath County development plan in respect of the development of Dunboyne and Clonee. One of the main criticisms is the fact that, in their opinion, the draft plan, as it relates to Dunboyne and Clonee, would contravene the provisions of the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area. This relates primarily to a proposal in the draft plan to designate unzoned lands east of the old railway line between Dunboyne and Clonee for development and to rezone land in Clonee for both industrial and housing development. The question as to whether these lands comprise a flood plain was not raised in the correspondence which was received in my Department prior to the recent flooding.</P>
      <P>Similar representations were also made directly to me. However, given my statutory role as Minister for the Environment and Local Government it would be inappropriate for me to intervene directly in my capacity as a Deputy for the constituency.</P>
      <P>The adoption of the development plan is a matter for the elected members of Meath County Council. Extensive public consultation is necessary before a plan may be adopted. The draft development plan for County Meath was put on public display from 27 March 2000 to 30 June 2000. I understand that a large number of submissions in relation to the draft plan were received by Meath County Council, including those from the Dunboyne Combined Residents Association and that, following consideration of submissions received, an amended draft plan has now been put on public display from 13 November 2000 to 20 December 2000. Following consideration of any further submissions received in respect of the amended draft plan, it will be a matter for the elected members of Meath County Council to adopt a new plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards compliance with the requirements of the strategic planning guidelines for the greater <Col N="1057" /> Dublin area, it should be noted that the guidelines are monitored and kept under review by the three groups under whose direction they were prepared. These are a steering committee, a technical working group and a local and regional authority members committee. Statutory recognition for the guidelines is provided for in the Planning and Development Act, 2000. The relevant provisions, which will come into force on 1 January 2001, require planning authorities in the area to have regard to the guidelines when making and adopting a development plan.</P>
    <P>Pending the commencement of the statutory provision, I formally requested, in April 1999, that each local authority in the greater Dublin area should ensure that its development plan is in line with the strategy set out in the strategic planning guidelines. A further letter of 14 August 2000 also asked planning authorities to advise the Department as to progress to date in this regard. My Department is awaiting a response from Meath County Council.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is a statutory consultee for all development plans. In accordance with normal practice, the Department, on my behalf, has examined the draft development plan for Meath. In the light of that examination and the papers received, my Department is writing to Meath County Council seeking comments on the compatibility of the proposals for Dunboyne and Clonee with the strategic planning guidelines, reminding the council of my formal request of April 1999 that it should ensure that its draft plan is in line with the strategic planning guidelines and asking for a full report within four weeks. Pending receipt of the report no decision will be taken on the council's application for an extension of time to adopt the new development plan.</P>

      <P>The proposed directive establishing a framework for community action in the field of water policy, 2000/60/EC, has not yet been formally adopted. The proposed directive, generally known as the Water Framework Directive, WFD, was agreed by the European Council and the European Parliament in September 2000 and is now undergoing final legal and linguistic drafting. It is expected that the WFD will be formally adopted in the near future. Following formal adoption, the WFD will come into force on its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities. The directive will be implemented in accordance with its terms. The <Col N="1058" /> directive aims to achieve good water status, as defined, in all inland and coastal waters generally within a 15 year timeframe. It also sets intermediate targets for specific actions such as: three years for necessary laws and administrative provisions to be in place and river basin districts to be identified; four years for completion of an analysis of the characteristics of each river basin district, a review of the impacts of human activities on water status, an economic analysis of water use and a register of protected areas; six years for monitoring programmes to be established and operational; nine years for river basin management plans to be published and for programmes for water management measures to be established; and 12 years for programmes of measures to be fully operational.</P>
      <P>A co-ordinated approach for implementation of the directive will be required between the relevant Departments and other public authorities with relevant water management functions. My Department will take a lead role in promoting and co-ordinating implementation. Proposals are being developed in my Department, in consultation with the authorities involved, as to the appropriate arrangements for implementation, including any necessary legislation. In particular my Department is promoting the establishment by local authorities of river basin management projects which will provide a major input to the development of river basin management plans and the general implementation of the directive. My Department is also involved in discussions with authorities in Northern Ireland regarding the implementation of the directive in relation to cross-Border waters. I envisage that legislation will be required for implementation of the directive and I aim to have appropriate legislative proposals developed and enacted within the three year timeframe provided by the directive.</P>

      <P>Fingal County Council submitted the Howth special amenity area order to me for confirmation on 25 March <Col N="1061" /> 1999. As there were objections to this order, I directed that a public local inquiry be held, as required under section 43 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.</P>
      <P>The inquiry was held over nine days from 1 September to 15 September 1999 and following consideration of the inspector's report on the inquiry, on 16 May 2000, I confirmed, subject to minor modification, as recommended by the inspector, the Howth special amenity area order. In accordance with section 43(4) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, the Fingal County Council (Howth) Special Amenity Area (Confirmation) Order, 2000 was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 18 May 2000. No resolution annulling the confirmation order was passed by either House within 21 sitting days after the order was laid before it, so the order has come into effect. The 21 sitting days requirement expired in Dáil Éireann on 4 October 2000 and in Seanad Éireann on 18 October 2000. My Department has advised Fingal County Council accordingly. All issues relating to the enforcement of the provisions of the special amenity area order are matters for Fingal County Council and I have no responsibilities in that regard.</P>

      <P>Applicants for driving licences who are 70 years of age or more must submit a medical report with an application for a driving licence and are restricted, depending on the certification of the doctor who completes the report, to either a one year or a three year driving licence. This requirement is considered reasonable and necessary in the interests of the individuals concerned, other road users and road safety generally. Formal review mechanisms are not provided for in relation to the above medical certification; it would be open to an applicant, or exceptionally to the licensing authority, to seek a second medical opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the driving licence fee, it is proposed, arising from a review of the overall driving licence fee arrangements by my Department, to introduce more equitable licence fee arrange<Col N="1062" /> ments for persons aged more than 70 years. Amending legislation is required to implement this change. The necessary amendment is being provided for in the Local Government Bill, 2000, which was published last May.</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of bus lanes and quality bus corridors is to facilitate mass transport in urban areas. Accordingly access to bus lanes has been restricted to omnibuses, large public service vehicles and, in relation to with-flow bus lanes only, taxis.</P>
      <P>Pedal cyclists have been afforded access to with-flow bus lanes since the inception of such facilities, <i>inter alia, </i>in view of road safety considerations. A more pro-active promotion of cycling as a transport mode has been advanced through the more recent introduction of quality bus corridors which are commonly provided with associated dedicated cycle tracks for pedal cyclists.</P>
      <P>The view has been taken that access to bus lanes for motorcyclists is not necessitated on road safety grounds and could compromise the safe cycling environment for pedal cyclists which bus lanes and quality bus corridors aim to provide. I understand that the UK authorities have recently conducted several pilot schemes to study the safety benefits to both motor cyclists and cyclists alike of the use of bus lanes by motor cycles. These studies have proven to be inconclusive and the UK authorities are maintaining their policy that motorcycles should not be allowed to use bus lanes.</P>
      <P>While there are no specific proposals to extend the use of bus lanes to motorcycles at this time, I have indicated that consideration might be given by the appropriate authorities to the possibility of practical pilot tests in this country with particular regard to the safety aspects of the proposal.</P>

      <P>The National Development Plan, 2000-2006, together with the community support framework and the economic and social infrastructure operational programme, form the strategic policy context for the improvement of the national road infrastructure over the next seven years. It is a matter for the National Roads Authority within this framework to promote the detailed programming of the work required by the plan and to manage, in co-operation with local authorities and the private sector in the context of public private partnerships, the planning, design and implementation of individual road development projects. With the exception of specified major inter-urban routes to be developed to motorway-high quality dual carriageway standard, the road improvement works, including type of road, to be undertaken under the NDP will be a matter for the NRA and local authorities concerned, having regard to current and projected traffic volumes.</P>
      <P>The NDP provides for major improvements to be made to the N2 between Dublin and Aughnacloy. The need for the development of new routes to augment those mentioned in the plan, including the N2, will be evaluated over the period to 2006. Where the need for a new route is established, funding will be provided for the advance planning and design of the route in the plan period, with a view to bringing the project to construction within an appropriate time frame.</P>

      <Quest>if, having regard to the huge increase in fuel and energy costs particularly for pensioners, he will extend the free schemes and allow 300 units of electricity on a full year basis, as currently many pensioners use more electricity in the summer time due to the cost of heating water with immersion heaters; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The free electricity allowance is available to people, usually aged 66 or over, who are either in receipt of a welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy this condition. It is also available to people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type pensions. In addition, widows/widowers between the ages of 60 and 65, whose late spouses were in receipt of the allowance, retain that entitlement.</P>
      <P>The free electricity allowance is worth 1,500 units of electricity each year, 200 units per billing period in the summer and 300 units per billing period in the winter, in addition to the normal standing charges. The value of the allowance to the individual, if fully taken up, is £154.09 per annum.</P>
      <P>In the review of the free schemes, published last April by the Policy Institute, Trinity College Dublin, the issue of increasing the number of electricity units was examined. The review noted that the objective of the allowance is to provide for a basic standard of usage and considered that the major advantage of the allowance is that it is based on a unit allowance and, therefore, keeps pace with electricity price increases. However, the review noted that this basic standard has increased over the years due to the growth in electrical appliance use. Therefore, despite the inflation-proof nature of the allowance, it is not now as valuable as it was in the past. Accordingly, the review proposes that the allowance be increased to maintain its overall value to the recipient.</P>
      <P>The review examines a large number of issues and the recommendations made will be examined in the context of future budgets and available resources.</P>

      <P>Social insurance contributions are made by employees and the self-employed, subject to social welfare legislation. Widows and widowers make contributions in the same manner as other employees and self-employed persons and there are no provisions within the social insurance system for exemptions, voluntary or otherwise, based on marital or other status.</P>
      <P>The majority of widows and widowers are in receipt of a widow/er's contributory pension based on social insurance contributions paid by either themselves or their late spouses. Continuing entitlement to this pension is not affected by earnings from employment or self-employment. The contributions paid by recipients of a widow/er's contributory pension can be used in due course to build up an individual entitlement to an old age contributory or retirement pension which may be payable at a higher rate than their existing pension. In addition, recipients of widow/er's contributory pension can also qualify for a half rate payment of unemployment and disability benefits if the relevant contingencies arise.</P>
      <P>Other widows and widowers who are not in receipt of a contributory pension and who are working also pay social insurance contributions in the normal way and are covered for all benefits and pensions. The social insurance liabilities of widows and widowers has never been the subject of a legal challenge.</P>
      <P>The payment of social insurance contributions is based on two complementary elements, namely the contributory principle allied with a social solidarity mechanism. The contributory principle means that the contributor will build up individual entitlement over time to various benefits and pensions which will be payable when particular contingencies, such as old age or illness, arise. Payment of social insurance contributions is also the main social solidarity mechanism in place within the social welfare system. This means that the contributions of workers are pooled for the benefit of all contributors if and when various contingencies arise. There is no direct proportional link between the amount of contributions paid by individual insured contributors and the potential vulnerability of contributors to individual risks such as occupational accidents, illness or longevity. Contributors generally, in a practical expression of social solidarity, support those who are more vulnerable or insecure to the advantage of society as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, I do not consider it appropriate to exempt, on a voluntary basis or otherwise, any <Col N="1067" /> group of persons, who are currently covered by the system and who are liable to make social insurance contributions. Such a move would be a retrograde step as it would serve to weaken the social insurance system as a whole.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that widows and widowers who are in receipt of earnings from employment of less than £226 per week are exempt, in the same manner as other workers, from payment of an employee social insurance contribution. They remain covered for social insurance benefits, as appropriate, based on the payment of a contribution by their employer. Self-employed persons, including widows and widowers, who have an income of less than £2,500 per annum from employment and self-employment, are not obliged to make self-employment contributions. Finally, all persons aged 66 and over are not liable to make an employee or self-employed contribution.</P>

      <P>The policy direction followed by successive Governments since 1994 has been to concentrate resources for child income support on child benefit, rather than increasing child dependant allowances, thus ensuring that the supports provided by the State are more neutral <i>vis-a-vis</i> the employment status of the parent(s). A selective approach, whereby the child dependant allowances payable with widow's pensions would be increased while those payable to other recipients remain fixed, would be difficult to sustain on equity grounds.</P>
      <P>The employment disincentive problems associated with child dependant allowances were highlighted particularly in the report of the expert group on the integration of tax and social welfare.</P>
      <P>The expert group found that, unlike child dependant allowances, child benefit does not contribute to poverty traps or work disincentives, as it is a universal payment which is not subject to a means test.</P>
      <P>The options for the development of child income support were evaluated in terms of their effectiveness as a mechanism to address unemployment and poverty traps. The status of the social welfare payment of the recipient was not a factor in this analysis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1068" /> The group consulted with representatives of unemployed people, some employers and members of the national anti-poverty networks, in order to obtain the views of some of the people most directly affected by the poverty traps and disincentives in the tax and social welfare systems.</P>
    <P>Regarding the composition of the group, it had 16 members, of whom nine were men and seven were women.</P>
    <P>Since 1994, the combined child benefit-child dependant allowance payment has increased by more than double the rate of inflation. In terms of tackling work disincentives, the shift towards child benefit has been significant. For instance, in 1994, child benefit represented 29% of the total child benefit-child dependant allowance payment for a four child family, now it represents 47%.</P>
    <P>The value of the child benefit scheme as an effective mechanism for the provision of child income support is reflected in the substantial investment which the Government makes in the scheme.</P>
    <P>The 1999 budget provided for a full-year investment of over £40 million in the scheme, while the 2000 budget provided for a full-year investment of almost £106 million, bringing the total investment in the scheme up to some £575 million.</P>
    <P>The policy of concentrating substantial additional resources on child benefit rather than increasing child dependant allowances is, of course, reflected in the Government's commitment on child benefit under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. This places particular emphasis on making progress towards a rate of £100 per month for the third and subsequent children over the lifetime of the programme. The Government is determined to fulfil this commitment.</P>

      <P>Child benefit is a universal payment which is payable in respect of all children up to the age of 16 years. Child benefit continues to be paid up to age 19 in the case of children who are still in full-time education and children with disabilities. In addition, child dependant allowances are payable to social welfare recipients in respect of each qualified child up to the age of 18 years; however, where a claimant is in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment (such as pensions) child dependant allowances are payable where children are in full-time <Col N="1069" /> education up to the age of 22 years, or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday.</P>
      <P>Since this Government came into office, the child benefit entitlements of parents of multiple births have improved significantly. Prior to the introduction of the Social Welfare Act, 1998, child benefit was payable at double the normal rate for each child where three or more children were born together.</P>
      <P>In the case of twins, child benefit was paid at the normal rate but a grant of £500 was payable at the birth of twins and further grants of £500 were payable when the twins reached the ages of four and 12.</P>
      <P>In the Social Welfare Act, 1998, I introduced two key additional measures designed to improve the overall package of benefits available to parents of multiple births. First, the rate of child benefit payable in respect of twins was increased to 150% of the normal child benefit rate. Secondly, the £500 grants, which previously were confined to families with twins, were extended to include families with multiple births of three or more children. Both these measures took effect in September 1998 at a full year cost of some £4.8 million and fully fulfilled our commitments made on the issue prior to the election.</P>
      <P>Apart from these measures, I have provided for very substantial improvements in the child benefit scheme. The 1999 budget provided for a full-year investment of over £40 million, while the most recent budget provided for a full-year investment of almost £106 million, bringing total investment in the scheme up to some £575 million annually.</P>
      <P>I understand that a group representing the interests of parents with twins in Ireland has been in contact with my Department seeking to have the rate of child benefit payable in respect of twins, that is, 150% of the normal rate, increased to that payable where three or more children are born together, that is, double the normal rate. The cost of providing for the double child benefit payments for twins is estimated at some £6.5 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>The policy direction over the past number of years has been to concentrate resources on improving child benefit for all families. Since I came into office I have increased the lower rate of CB from £30 to £42.50 per month, and the higher rate from £39 to £56 per month.  It is my intention to continue these substantial improvements in child benefit rates, with a priority focus towards £100 per month for third and subsequent children over the period of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, in fulfilment of the Government's commitment.</P>
      <P>These improvements will benefit all families with children, including, of course, families with twins and represent, in my view, the most effective use of the available resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since its inception in 1988, the current national fuel scheme has been a means tested payment for all recipients, including widows. Widows who have a non-contributory pension qualify automatically. Widows who have a contributory pension may have household income of £30 per week or savings or investments of £30,000 in addition to the maximum rate of the widow's contributory pension and still qualify for the fuel allowance.</P>
      <P>A separate fuel scheme, known as the urban fuel scheme, was operated by local authorities up to 1988. Under that scheme, widows with a contributory pension qualified without having to undergo a means test, subject to a &ldquo;one per household&rdquo; rule and provided they resided in the functional area of the local authority or in a house provided by the local authority.</P>
      <P>Persons who had been in receipt of a fuel allowance under the urban fuel scheme prior to 1988 but who failed to meet the qualifying conditions under the national fuel scheme, were allowed to retain their entitlement provided they continued to receive widows pension and satisfied the other conditions for the urban fuel scheme. These were known as &ldquo;saver cases&rdquo;. Details of the number of widows who qualified for the fuel allowance under the saver clause are not available.</P>
      <P>It had been the case that widows with this preserved entitlement had to satisfy the standard means test for fuel allowance if they transferred to old age contributory pension or to retirement pension on reaching pension age. However, with effect from the current 2000-01 fuel season, widows in these circumstances are no longer required to undergo the standard means test in order to retain the fuel allowance.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 50,200 widows and widowers currently in receipt of fuel allowance. The estimated additional cost of paying the fuel allowance to all widows and widowers is £11.27 million per annum. The Deputy will understand that I cannot give specific details of the measures that will be contained in this year's budget but improving the overall position of widows and other social welfare recipients will receive a very high priority in that budget.</P>
      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week, £8 per week in smokeless zones, is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid-October to mid-April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also point out that fuel allowances are <Col N="1071" /> not the sole mechanism through which assistance is provided to people with heating needs. There is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>
    <P>Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment. Exceptional needs payments are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 312 and 313 together.</P>
      <P>The EU Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) requires member states to select SAC sites on the basis of scientific criteria. Article 2 (3) of the directive states that the implementation of the directive shall take account of economic, social and cultural requirements and regional and local characteristics. However, Article 4(1) of the directive requires the member states to propose a list of sites for SAC designation on the basis of the criteria set out in annex III of the directive, that is on a scientific basis.</P>
      <P>The recent European Court of Justice judgment, cm/68/371/98, arising from a UK court case, found that &ldquo;Member States may not take account of economic, social and cultural requirements or regional and local characteristics, as mentioned in Article 2(3) of that directive, when selecting and defining the boundaries of the sites proposed to the Commission as eligible for identification as sites of Community importance&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, my Department could not take account of the possible economic impact of the designation on industry located in Clew Bay when determining if the area would be proposed for designation and, therefore, has not carried out such a study.</P>
      <P>Clew Bay was proposed for SAC designation because it contains eight habitats listed in the Habitats Directive and hosts two listed species, the otter and common seal. In addition, the proposed natural heritage area designation also takes account of fauna and flora not listed in the directive.</P>
      <P>Activities or operations that have no significant adverse impact on the habitats and species listed in the directive will not be affected in any way by SAC designation. Any that are found to cause significant damage to these habitats and species will have to be regulated to ensure the favourable conservation status of the site is maintained.</P>

      <P>A small portion of the townland in question is included in a special protection area, SPA, designated under the EU Birds Directive, and in a proposed natural heritage area. The need for the designation of the area as an SPA arises because it hosts an internationally important flock of Greenland white-fronted geese which winter at the site, together with populations of other important bird species. Past management or disturbance does not necessarily diminish the importance of particular lands for birds.</P>
      <P>All landowners and land users may object to these designations. Initially the objections should be made, including a map of the relevant land, at 6&rdquo; scale if possible, in writing, to Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, at 7 Ely Place, Dublin 2. If Dúchas is unable to accede to the appeal, the appellant may refer the matter to the SAC appeals advisory board. This board consists of equal representation from the non-governmental conservation organisations and representative groups of the landowners and land users. It is chaired by the former Ombudsman, Mr. Michael Mills. The designations are made on a scientific basis and consequently appeals must be made on a similar basis. To be successful an appeal would need to show that the lands are not significant for the population of geese or other important bird species.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, Carrigafoyle Castle has been included in the list of works to be undertaken as part of my Department's programme under the national development plan. The proposed works to the castle involve safety works, re-flooring of the small chambers and external re-pointing.</P>
      <P>Given the existing commitments of the direct labour force in Dúchas, the heritage service, the major part of this project is likely to be put to tender. Depending on the level of response to tenders, it is expected that works will commence in 2001.</P>

      <P>I can inform the Deputy that there is no designated division in my Department that deals exclusively with public private partnership projects.</P>
      <P>However, the Deputy may be interested to know that the Midlands Prison at Portlaoise, which was completed and inaugurated on 9 November, was developed on a public private partnership basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prisons planning section and the Office of Public Works were primarily responsible for developing the overall concept and outline <Col N="1076" /> designs for the project, and liaised with specialist co-ordinators within the Prisons Service.</P>
    <P>In relation to possible further such projects, I can inform the Deputy that my Department has received expressions of interest from private investors which could in certain circumstances fall within the remit of the public private partnerships.</P>
    <P>I can also inform the Deputy that a Government decision on 28 March 2000 provides that the provision of accommodation for asylum seekers on a permanent basis should be on the basis of a public private partnership. Discussions are ongoing between officials of my Department and the Office of Public Works in relation to finalising the arrangement for this.</P>

I might also add that the Garda Commissioner is not generally in favour, for operational reasons, of releasing details of individual Garda station strengths in Garda districts throughout the country and I also share that concern.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy in his question is referring to medico-legal work conducted by GPs on behalf of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>Negotiations between the Irish Medical Organisation and officials of my Department in relation to claims for increases in all fees relating to medico-legal work conducted by GPs on behalf of the Garda Síochána and restructuring of the relevant fee schedules were concluded in December 1999.</P>
      <P>With effect from 1 December 1999, the basic fee for doctor attendance at a Garda station is £50 between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. and £80 between 5 p.m. and 9 a.m. Previously, the fees ranged between £25.09 and £63.33 depending on the time of call-out. The higher rate of £80 is paid for duty on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays. Additional fees are payable where the doctor is required to examine more than one patient &ndash; £30 and £55 for office and out-of-office hours, respectively. The higher rate of £55 is paid for examinations on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays.    </P>
      <P>The revised fees for court attendance by GPs on behalf of the gardaí, also effective from 1 December 1999, are £200 for half-day attendance and £400 for full day attendance. Previously, the fees ranged between £55.89 and £123.64 depending on the number of hours absence from home. In addition, where a doctor is required to employ a locum while in court he is entitled to claim vouched expenses up to a limit of £75 for a half-day or £150 for a full day.</P>
      <P>Court attendance by consultants generally, arises in relation to civil cases and the fixing of fees for such attendance is a matter for the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and Incorporated Law Society. I have no role in the matter.  </P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>At my instigation, the department of community health and general practice, Trinity College, Dublin, has conducted two major health risk surveys on prisoner in custody.</P>
      <P>They reported that approximately one in five prisoners who injected heroin claimed that they first started injecting while in prison. Prison management is, however, generally sceptical of this particular figure. It must be remembered that the declared personal drug histories by participants in surveys of this kind cannot be totally relied upon as accurate in all instances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that I am fully committed to tackling the drug problem in the prison system. The action plan on drug misuse and drug treatment in the prison system, which I approved last year, provides a detailed strategy to raise the level of treatment for drug addicted offenders <Col N="1080" /> and reduce the supply of drugs in the prison system. This includes the expansion of detoxification facilities, more drug free areas and the provision of methadone maintenance. The provision of addiction counselling support services is central to the plan. The plan builds on a medical policy which has been agreed between my Department and the Eastern Health Board in that it seeks to provide the same access to treatment for prisoners as patients have within the community.</P>
    <P>At my request the director general of the Prisons Service established a national steering group for prison based drug treatment services with a view to implementing the action plan. The steering group comprises representatives from this Department, the Eastern Health Board, senior Prisons Service management, probation and welfare service, prisons psychology service and the prison education service. The group submitted their first report to me in July of this year and the report was circulated to various organisations for views and feedback. The implementation of the recommendations contained in the report were approved, in principle, by the Government on 18 October 2000, on the basis that the precise staffing and other expenditure related proposals would be the subject of direct negotiations between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Finance as well as the Prisons Service and health boards. These are due to commence immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been acutely aware of the problem of hepatitis infection and the associated drug problem in our prisons for some time. At my request, independent research has been conducted by Trinity College Dublin on the prevalence and risk of hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV in Irish prisoners. The latest report from the research team, based on a very large sample of committal prisoners in 1999, found that infection with hepatitis C among the prisoners who took part in the survey was 22%. However, the prevalence of hepatitis C among declared drug users was found to be 72%. These figures are similar to the prevalence of infection among drug users in the community. Almost one in four of all the 607 prisoners tested had evidence of either hepatitis B or C or HIV infection.</P>
      <P>Information on HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C is routinely available to all prisoners through prison medical and other staff. Prisoners diagnosed with any of these conditions are automatically referred to specialist clinics in external hospitals for assessment and advice in relation to current or envisaged treatment needs. Any recommended treatment is provided to prisoners while in prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A steering committee on communicable dis<Col N="1081" /> eases has been at work in my Department for some time dealing specifically with this important issue. In addition, the director of the Prison Medical Service, in his annual report for 1998, recommended an independent review of the structure and organisation of prison health care services. I had no hesitation in accepting his recommendation and a multi-disciplinary group has been established to conduct this review. This group is expected to report in the first half of 2001.</P>
    <P>The action plan on drug misuse and drug treatment in the prison system, which I approved last year, provides a detailed strategy to raise the level of treatment for drug addicted offenders and reduce the supply of drugs in the prison system. At my request the director general of the Prisons Service established a national steering group for prison based drug treatment services with a view to implementing the action plan. The steering group comprises representatives from my Department, the Eastern Health Board, senior Prisons Service management and the probation and welfare service.

The group submitted their first report to myself in July of this year and the report was circulated to various organisations for views and feedback. The implementation of the recommendations contained in the report were approved, in principle, by the Government on 18 October 2000, on the basis that the precise staffing and other expenditure related proposals would be the subject of direct negotiations between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Finance as well as the Prisons Service and health boards.

      <P>I have discussed this issue on a number of occasions with the director general of the Irish Prisons Service and with senior policy advisors in my own Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I became Minister in June 1997, every research project and study directly carried out by my Department and the Prisons Service in this policy area has involved a consultation element which included community and voluntary organisations as well as the general public. Usually, views have been invited by my staff via public advertisements and direct requests to relevant organisations. Over the past three years, I have also commissioned and facilitated publication of independent research on prisoner related issues on an unprecedented scale. The research teams <Col N="1082" /> involved in these projects have included some of the sternest critics of current prisons policy. My policy development approach and that of my officials has been inclusive and neither narrow nor conservative.</P>
    <P>In the case of recent specific studies into prisoner healthcare and drug treatment the level of consultation with interested groups has been very extensive indeed. Additionally, the director general of the Irish Prisons Service and his steering group on prison based drug treatment services have recommended the establishment of local liaison systems at individual prison level as well as full discussions, at reasonable intervals, between the steering group and representative groups from the community and voluntary sector. The governors of Mountjoy Prison, Cloverhill Prison, St. Patrick's Institution and the training unit have agreed to establish local liaison groups with relevant community interests to facilitate dialogue and throughcare for persons treated in prison for drug dependency and with a view to enhancing the partnership approach to this issue.</P>
    <P>A partnership approach to policy formation is being taken generally by prisons management. It has to be accepted, however, that there are real and practical impediments to conceding all demands by interest groups, however worthy, for a direct management role in this area.</P>

      <P>There is no public private partnership unit in my Department. However, I established an interdepartmental working group in August 1999, to develop guidelines and advise on the other key issues for the operation of a public private partnership &ndash; PPP &ndash; approach in relation to swimming pools. The group is chaired by my Department and comprises of members from the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Office of Public Works, and representatives from three local authorities. The group was asked to examine the following issues: appropriate procurement procedures for PPPs; standard format for invitation to tender for a PPP; criteria and procedures for use by local authorities in selecting PPP partners; key issues for a model PPP contract for local authority swimming pools and how these might be best dealt with; review of the Department procedures for the planning, approval and financing of swimming pools; technical guidelines to take account <Col N="1085" /> of the PPP process; and any related matters. I expect to receive their report shortly.</P>

      <P>At primary level, my Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. Under this scheme St. Fergal's junior and senior schools have the services of a full-time caretaker shared between the two schools. Each school also has the services of a full-time secretary. Under the terms of the scheme there is no compulsion on the caretaker to retire when he reaches the age of 65 <Col N="1086" /> years but, should he do so, both schools will qualify for funding under the PESP scheme which has replaced the 1978-79 scheme outlined above.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional per-capita grants for primary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. Under this scheme qualifying schools receive grants of £40 per pupil per annum &ndash; £20 per pupil in respect of each service &ndash; subject to a maximum of £20,000 &ndash; maximum of £10,000 in respect of each service. In the event that the caretaker retires, St. Fergal's junior and senior schools would receive a grant of £7,540 and £7,480 respectively based on the school's enrolment in September 1999.</P>

My objective is to introduce a range of significant and specifically targeted interventions, which will ensure that disadvantaged children receive the support they require to enable them to succeed in school. The interventions in question will take the form of extra teacher support or extra funding, or both, depending on the nature and level of need identified. As a first step in the new programme, I will be allocating 200 new teaching posts and additional funding to primary schools with significant concentrations of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. I expect to be in a position to make a further announcement in relation to this matter shortly.</P>

      <Quest>the plans he has to recruit a suitably qualified teacher to provide home tuition for a person (details supplied) in County Carlow who is suffering from ADHD and Hydrocephalus; the reason the correspondence from his Department suggests that the family should recruit and maintain records, which is an unacceptable burden that they should not be asked to carry; the reason it has taken so long for his Department to deal with this issue; whether the child is being deprived a proper education due to the inaction of his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that my Department has identified a qualified teacher who is immediately available to provide a home tuition service to the child in question. I have asked my Department's inspectorate to contact the child's parents to arrange for the putting in place of this service as speedily as possible.</P>
      <P>The practice of requiring parents to identify a suitable teacher to deliver home tuition services and to maintain certain records in relation to the service delivered, reflects the traditional basis for the service which was focused on addressing the needs of children who were unable to attend school due to serious illness. In such situations, it was felt that the parents should have a central involvement in the arrangements so that the service would be designed around the needs and circumstances of the child and family involved.</P>
      <P>However, my Department has always been willing to assist in the identification of suitable teachers to deliver the service, as indicated in the case in question. The requirement that parents keep a record of the tuition actually delivered was necessary in view of the reality that many of the children involved would not always be well enough or available to receive the full level of service approved by the Department.</P>
      <P>Given the significant growth in the scope of the home tuition service which has taken place over recent years, my Department is currently reviewing its procedures in this area. This review will include the areas of concern which have been raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I am most anxious that a suitable school placement be arranged for the child in question as quickly as possible. With regard to the delay in dealing with this issue, I understand that the matter was not brought to the attention of my Department's special education section until October of this year. I also understand that a home tuition service was approved for the child in question within days of the special education section becoming aware of the case. I can also assure the Deputy that my Department's inspectorate has been actively engaged in seeking to arrange a suitable school placement for the child and is continuing its efforts in this regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 341 and 346 together.</P>
      <P>The possibility of introducing a preliminary third level course in life sciences as a prerequisite for entry into healthcare courses was considered in the final report of the Commission on the Points System. The report recommends that the key bodies and institutions involved in policy-making on healthcare training, for example, the Medical Council, the universities, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Health and Children, should set up a committee to explore the matter further. In response to a request from my Department, the Higher Education Authority has sought a meeting with the major providers of healthcare courses through the conference of heads of Irish universities and the Royal College of Surgeons to explore how best to progress the consideration of the many complex issues involved.</P>
      <P>The current intake to undergraduate medical courses is the subject of a quota, which was introduced in 1980-81 following a report of the Higher Education Authority. The final report of the Points Commission considers that there should be a regular review of places on courses with capped numbers. My Department, in consultation with the Department of Health and Children is considering the question of reviewing the current quota arrangements.</P>

      <P>There are two third level institutions, five secondary schools and two further education colleges located in the Dublin 8 area. Vocational training activities are funded by my Department through the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee which provides a wide range of full-time PLC courses in Inchicore vocational school and the Liberties College of Further Education, and in other locations throughout the city. Participants on PLC programmes receive free tuition and are eligible to apply for maintenance grants on the same basis as third-level students.

Such programmes combine an integrated work experience element with literacy, numeracy, IT communications skills and a range of vocational options.</P>

In this context it is planed to expand the range of vocational training courses over the coming years as part-time options come on stream under the back to education initiative.</P>

      <P>On 14 September 2000, I announced the creation of an action group on access to third level education to advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote access <Col N="1091" /> by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities to third level education.</P>
      <P>The creation of this group is in line with a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>The Government is providing for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period 2000 to 2006, aimed at tackling under-representation by the three target groups.</P>
      <P>As an indication of the Government's support in promoting equity in access and as an initial step, pending the findings of the action group, I announced the introduction of a special maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders, targeted at those most in need. The full rates of the special maintenance grant entail increases over the standard rates as follows: from £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college; and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college.</P>
      <P>The first instalment will be made to eligible students early in 2001.</P>
      <P>I have indicated that I would expect that up to 10,000 students will benefit from this measure. This is, of course, a tentative estimate and the actual number of students to benefit will depend on the outcome to the action group's work.

The NDA involves a network of sixteen schools situated within the vicinity of the following areas: Coolock-Darndale, Finglas-Cabra and Ballymun. The primary objective is to increase the third level participation rate of those leaving participating schools.</P>
    <P>As regards the details of the NDA and the criteria, my Department has been advised that DCU are targeting all schools which satisfy the following criteria: be a designated school within the Department of Education and Science scheme for disadvantaged schools; be within the designated areas of the following area partnerships: Finglas-Cabra, Ballymun and Northside; not have selective entry for students; have little or no tradition of progression to higher education; are not a participant in an access programme of another university or third-level college; and, preferably, have data available for the last few years on both attrition rates and the first destination of leaving certificate students.</P>
    <P>An integral part of the NDA programme is the direct entry scheme for school leavers. The scheme targets those who have the ability to benefit from higher education but who, for reasons of disadvantage, did not achieve their educational potential at second level and, accordingly, were unable to compete on an equal footing with other candidates for admission to higher education.</P>
    <P>Students wishing to apply to the university through the direct entry scheme are asked to attend an interview, participate in the DCU summer school, complete a financial statement and produce academic records and references. Students are selected on the basis of their academic performance, level of motivation and degree of disadvantage. Every year up to 5% of first year places are made available to students from disadvantaged areas under the direct entry scheme who satisfy the following criteria: successful completion of the NDA summer school; a high level of motivation; socio-economically disadvantaged; minimum entry requirements of the university and any specific programme requirements; at least four Cs in higher level subjects in the leaving certificate examination.</P>
    <P>Since 1996, my Department has provided funding through the Higher Education Authority to the universities, including DCU, for the targeted initiative aimed at disadvantaged school leavers. The total amount of funding for this initiative was £260,000 in 1996, increasing to £785,000 last year.</P>
    <P>The targeted initiative involves links with second-level schools designated as disadvantaged, involving liaison and outreach work. There are two aspects to the programmes.</P>
    <P>One involves assistance to students to meet the points requirement for courses, enabling them to obtain a college place through the standard CAO <Col N="1093" /> entry procedure. There are, for example, mentoring programmes and summer schools for potential students.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of the programmes is the special entry arrangements through which more flexible entry criteria are applied and various supports put in place for students entering by this method.</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority recently published a report, Evaluation of the Targeted Initiative on Widening Access for Young People from Socio-Economically Disadvantaged Backgrounds, by Professor Robert Osborne and Ms Helen Leith, which examined the efforts made by the universities to promote the participation of school leavers from less well off backgrounds in higher education under the initiative.</P>
    <P>The goal of achieving equity in higher education is a central pillar of our educational policy. The Government is providing for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period 2000 to 2006, aimed at tackling under-representation by three target groups students with disabilities, students from disadvantaged backgrounds and mature students.</P>
    <P>The completion of the Osborne report is timely as it is feeding into the ongoing work of the action group on access to third level education, which I established last September, to advise on measures which would tackle under-representation by disadvantaged students. This action group will advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote participation at third level by such students. I have asked the group to provide a report to me within three months.</P>

      <P>My Department provides a range of special support services for pupils with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. In some cases, where the condition is not of a serious nature, the students in question are capable of being successfully taught within the mainstream first and second level systems, with the support where necessary of resource teachers and-or special needs assistants.</P>
      <P>Where more pronounced forms of the condition in question arise, students have access to a range of special schools and special classes attached to ordinary schools. These special facilities can cater for children up to the age of 18 years. All such facilities operate at reduced pupil teacher ratios and attract special increased rates of capitation funding.</P>
      <P>The national educational psychological service, which is available to every second level school in the country, is also playing an increasing role with regard to assessment and educational provision for pupils exhibiting persistent and maladaptive levels of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. My Department also works in close co-operation with the health authorities to ensure that any necessary therapeutic services are made available to such students.</P>
      <P>I would be very concerned if any student should be expelled from school as a result of suffering from the condition in question. If the Deputy is aware of any such case, he may wish to provide details to my Department so that the matter can be addressed.</P>
      <P>I should also mention that a high level planning group has been working in my Department on the arrangements which should be put in place to ensure the most effective provision of a high quality co-ordinated service at all stages of the education system for students with disabilities, including the condition to which the Deputy refers. The objective is to develop a service which delivers the necessary response when and where required and which operates in a user friendly manner which has full regard to the rights and needs of parents of children with disabilities. I expect to receive the report of the planning group in the near future and I can assure the Deputy that I will be supportive of any measures which enhance the quality of our special education services.</P>
